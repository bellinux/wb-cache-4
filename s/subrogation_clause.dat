5000|$|Justice Iacobucci, {{writing for}} a {{unanimous}} court, held {{in favour of}} Can-Dive {{on the basis that}} they were able to rely on the <b>subrogation</b> <b>clause.</b> The case turned on the existence of any exceptions to privity. Iacobucci first affirmed the existence of an agency exception to privity, and then expanded on the [...] "principled exception to the privity of contract doctrine" [...] established in London Drugs v.

5000|$|Fraser River Pile & Dredge Ltd. owned a derrick barge [...] "Sceptre Squamish", that it {{chartered}} to Can-Dive Services Ltd. Can-Dive accidentally sank {{the barge}} {{while it was}} chartered. Fraser River collected on a $1.1 million insurance policy for the barge. The original policy between Fraser River and their insurer contained a <b>subrogation</b> <b>clause</b> which waived the insurer's right of subrogation against any third parties. Fraser River and their insurer entered an agreement which waived the original subrogation waiver, intending to allow the insurance company and Fraser River to sue Can-Dive.|$|E
40|$|Subrogation {{means that}} a person who indemnifies another is {{entitled}} to step into the shoes of the person and take over whatever right he may have against third parties. But, it is found that the insurers are not always successful in their subrogation claims against the wrongdoer in the construction industry. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} insurers? right of subrogation claim in construction contract, this master project has been carried out with the intention to identify circumstances that do not allow insurers to exercise their rights of subrogation. This project has been carried out mainly through documentary analysis of the relevant cases repeated in law journals, such as Malayan Law Journal, Singapore Law Report, Building Law Report, etc. Eighteen cases has been chosen to be analysed in accordance with the feature of right of subrogation against co-insured and the waiver of <b>subrogation</b> <b>clauses</b> in the standard forms of contract. The result showed that, in conjunction with insurance clauses, construction contracts do include provisions that require the insurance policies to be in the form of joint names of the employer, contractor, subcontractor and all related third parties. This would lead to the insurers not being able to exercise the usual rights of subrogation against any of the joint insured. Besides that, the construction contracts also require the insurance policies to contain cross liability or waiver of <b>subrogation</b> <b>clauses.</b> The clauses provide that the insurances carrier, after settling and paying a claim, cannot pursue the damage paid for by the insured parties? insurance carrier. These effectively prevent an insurer from seeking recovery from the party at fault. So, where a loss has been caused by a subcontractor and the principal contractor seeked recovery, the insurer cannot pursue the claim from the subcontractor...|$|R
40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) {{was enacted}} in 1974 {{to protect the}} pension rights of {{employees}} nationwide. However, due to its broad preemptive powers, ERISA has since developed into a tool used by health insurers to recover {{millions of dollars in}} tort damages meant to benefit employees with ERISA health plans. This practice, known as subrogation, has been met with legislative backlash in the form of state antisubrogation statutes, which attempt to limit the enforceability of <b>subrogation</b> <b>clauses</b> found in almost all ERISA health plans. However, many courts have held that ERISA preempts these antisubrogation statutes, thereby affirming insurers’ ability to recover funds intended to compensate injured victims. These decisions often have disastrous and life changing consequences for injured employees. After examining ERISA’s preemptive clauses and the Supreme Court cases delineating their limits, this Note argues that state antisubrogation statutes should be upheld against preemption challenges. This result is necessary to preserve ERISA’s original purpose: protection of employees nationwide...|$|R
