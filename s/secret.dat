5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully <b>secret</b> trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of <b>secret</b> trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully <b>secret</b> trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully <b>secret</b> or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully <b>secret</b> trusts are.|$|E

40|$|The law discriminates among a corporation’s <b>secrets.</b> In {{the eyes}} of the law, {{commercial}} <b>secrets</b> of corporations are legitimate <b>secrets</b> that deserve legal protection and nondisclosure, but personal <b>secrets</b> of executives are not as deserving of legal protection and nondisclosure. This divergent treatment of <b>secrets</b> has resulted in a legal landscape of perplexing, paradoxical paths for corporations and executives concerning executive disclosures — a precarious landscape that has left corporations and investors dangerously susceptible to revelations of private facts that shock market valuation and institutional stability. This Article explores this divergent treatment of <b>secrets</b> in the context of public corporations and the private individuals who manage them, and offers a new way of thinking about corporate and personal <b>secrets.</b> This Article conceives the concept of Executive Trade <b>Secrets</b> as a pragmatic theoretical framework for unlocking this paradox of <b>secrets</b> and addressing the challenges surrounding executive disclosures. This Article is the first to use trade <b>secrets</b> law to address the interdisciplinary legal issues surrounding executive disclosures. It re-conceptualizes private matters of executives as legally protectable trade <b>secrets</b> by unfolding the hidden symmetry between commercial <b>secrets</b> and personal <b>secrets.</b> It reveals Executive Trade <b>Secrets</b> as faithful to the first principles of the laws of trade <b>secrets,</b> privacy, securities, and corporations, and explains how such fidelity protects the privacy interests of executives and the corporate interests of shareholders. This Article, ultimately, constructs a way to think anew about executive disclosures and the larger issues at the modern nexus of secrecy, privacy, and commerce...|$|R
