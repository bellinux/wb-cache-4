25|$|In 211, Cao Cao {{embarked}} on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and the subsequent battles. Cao Cao's wife Lady Bian followed her husband and stayed at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan), while Cao Pi remained in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Lady Bian fell ill during that time. Lady Zhen became worried when she heard about it and <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> day and night. She constantly sent messengers to inquire her mother-in-law's condition, but refused to believe them when they reported that Lady Bian was getting better, and she became filled with greater anxiety. Lady Bian later {{wrote a letter to}} her, telling her that she had fully recovered, and only then did Lady Zhen's worries disappear. About a year later, when Lady Bian returned to Ye, Lady Zhen rushed to see her mother-in-law and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy. Those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them. Lady Bian assured Lady Zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety.|$|E

The TSA security official applied an invasive [...] "hand-sliding inspection" [...] during which she [...] "ran her hands around her breasts, over her stomach, buttocks and her inner thighs, and even touched her most private areas." [...] Fitzpatrick said that <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> during the experience. [...] "I felt helpless, I felt violated, and I felt humiliated." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit {{relatives}} in Chicago. She departed on January 17, 1926. When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she {{was so impressed with}} the skyline of Manhattan that <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> what she later called [...] "tears of splendor". Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then left for Hollywood, California.|$|E

Krasinski said that Creed Bratton's line, [...] "Which one is Pam?" [...] was his favorite moment [...] "in the entire show, ever". Fischer, in turn, said that her favorite moment was when Jim confesses {{that he does not}} have a crush on her, due to the emotion involved. Fischer later admitted that, after the shot was filmed, <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> because it [...] "broke [...] heart".|$|E
500|$|Joseph and Prince Kaunitz {{arranged}} the First Partition of Poland despite Maria Theresa's protestations. Her {{sense of justice}} pushed her to reject the idea of partition, which would hurt the Polish people. The duo {{argued that it was}} too late to abort now. Besides, Maria Theresa herself agreed with the partition when she realised that Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia would do it with or without Austrian participation. Maria Theresa claimed and eventually took Galicia and Lodomeria, a province claimed by Hungarian monarchs since the 13thcentury; in the words of Frederick, [...] "the more <b>she</b> <b>cried,</b> the more she took".|$|E
500|$|In late 1964, O'Hara went to Italy {{to shoot}} The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965) with Rossano Brazzi. O'Hara played a British woman who leaves her diplomat husband in England for an Italian pianist (Brazzi). She had high {{expectations}} for the film but soon realized that Brazzi was miscast. During the production O'Hara witnessed a robbery taking place nearby at jewellery store nearby in Milan. She was so frustrated with the finished film, which was a box office flop, that <b>she</b> <b>cried.</b> O'Hara made her last picture with James Stewart the following year in the comedic western, The Rare Breed. Malone thought that she modeled her performance on Julie Andrews, [...] "adopting a schoolmarmish voice and demeanor that ill befit her", and coming out with pious statements like [...] "cleanliness is next to godliness".|$|E

500|$|After Nancy Reagan {{accepted}} the flag, {{she approached the}} casket and spent several minutes patting and stroking it. She laid her {{head down on the}} casket, before breaking down and crying; The Washington Post described Nancy as having been [...] "stoic through nearly a week of somber rituals" [...] but she [...] "surrendered to her grief after being handed the flag that had covered her husband's coffin." [...] While <b>she</b> <b>cried,</b> she kissed the casket and said [...] "I love you". Her children surrounded her, and attempted to console her. Nancy then walked away with her military escort, clutching the folded flag. The military band began to play the Victorian hymn [...] "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" [...] as the Reagan children said their goodbyes. Funeral attendees had an opportunity to file past the coffin.|$|E
500|$|Gertie the Dinosaur {{debuted in}} February 1914 {{as part of}} McCay's {{vaudeville}} act. [...] McCay introduced Gertie as [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity", and commanded the animated beast with a whip. [...] Gertie seemed to obey McCay, bowing to the audience, and eating a tree and a boulder, though she had a will of her own and sometimes rebelled. [...] When McCay admonished her, <b>she</b> <b>cried.</b> [...] McCay consoled her by throwing her an apple—in reality pocketing the cardboard prop apple as a cartoon one simultaneously appeared on screen. [...] In the finale, McCay walked offstage, reappeared in animated form in the film, and had Gertie carry him away. [...] Producer William Fox's Box Office Attractions obtained distribution rights to {{a modified version of}} Gertie that could be played in regular movie theaters. [...] This version was prefaced with a live-action sequence and replaced the interactive portions with intertitles.|$|E
500|$|Henry hired Swiss {{troops to}} help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up {{barricades}} {{in the streets and}} refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise. When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L'Estoile reported that <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Bellièvre, [...] "Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape." [...] As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everything}} she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels {{free to make}} judgments of the scenes around her; Shelley writes that Claire [...] "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, <b>she</b> <b>cried,</b> 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed. As scholar Angela Jones contends, [...] "Shelley {{may be said to}} figure herself as a more knowledgeable, disinterested English outsider capable of rendering impartial judgment"—an Enlightenment value.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kier McFarlane, and its plot was inspired by 1968 film Barbarella. According to Minogue, {{she had been a}} [...] "massive" [...] fan of the film, and wanted to pay tribute to the film's lead actress Jane Fonda, who played the titular character. The video was shot in two days, where Minogue had been strapped with harnesses and wires; the majority of the shooting included wires pulling off her clothes during those particular sequences. The singer commented in her 2002 book [...] {{that it was one of}} her [...] "most painful shoots", and complained that she felt [...] "rigged" [...] into all sorts of [...] "contraptions". Minogue further complained about the 19 hours spent on both filming days, and revealed <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> during some of the shooting; she jokingly concluded in the book that she would never do another visual that required harnesses and water. Minogue's characteristics in the video were loosely inspired by the titular character of Barbarella, for which a large staff that helped with styling, hair styling and make-up was required.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E

500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, <b>she</b> <b>cried,</b> and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who {{want to get out of}} prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E
