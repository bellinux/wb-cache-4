Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol.

Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American macaws.|$|E

Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E

5|$|Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully {{believe that}} by {{combining}} the surviving aircraft and pilots from Shōkaku and Zuikaku, {{it is likely that}} Zuikaku could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They also note that doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, American air squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get Zuikaku ready for the forthcoming battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{the second}} edition of the tournament, Blackpool and Bologna were the two nations' best-ranked teams and contested the final at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara on 12 June 1971.

But he <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> even if the lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E
