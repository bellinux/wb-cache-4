40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} aspects of redshift surveys is that there are huge regions of space totally devoid of galaxies. These are the cosmic voids, which grew hierarchically from the initial density troughs in the primordial fluctuation field. In a hierarchical structure formation scenario <b>smaller</b> <b>voids</b> build up larger ones; the void hierarchy. In this paper we study the void evolution and merging history of large voids and void ensembles. We do this by means of constrained realizations of Gaussian fields, which are our initial fields for N-body simulations. Our direct goal was to test the theoretical model of Sheth & van de Weygaert (2004). In this model they proposed that <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> can either merge into larger ones or collapse into larger overdense regions. Preliminary analysis confirms this model, where <b>smaller</b> <b>voids</b> either merge away in large voids, analogue to build up of large haloes or <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> can collapse away. The model assumes that <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> collapse, if they are embedded in larger spherical overdensities. Our results, however, indicate that this condition might be even too stringent and that void-collapse also occurs when the local deformation, caused by the tidal field, is strong enough that it can shear and tear away voids into filaments or walls. In order to track this Lagrangian evolution of <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> and its surrounding in an objective manner we propose the usage of the Watershed transformation. This tool combines the capability of detecting filaments and voids simultaneous in a parameter free way. In combination with the DTFE interpolation method we regard it as an excellent tool to extract and visualize the cosmic foam. Here we present the 2 dimensional version with applications to slices out of a large simulation. In upcoming work it will be extended to three dimensions and we expect it to use as a foam extractor. ...|$|R

In this thesis, using first-principles method, I examined the microscopic mechanism of He trapping in vacancies and voids in structural materials (vanadium solid and 6 H–SiC composites). In vanadium, a single He atom located in the tetrahedral interstitial site (TIS) {{turned out to be}} more stable than that in the octahedral interstitial site (OIS). Helium atoms were placed one by one into the vacancy defects (monovacancy and void) from the remote TISs, and we calculated the trapping energies as a function of the number of He atoms inside the vacancy defects. We found that, the monovacancy and void (about 0. 6 mn in diameter) can host up 18 and 66 He atoms, respectively, in vanadium solid. The induced internal pressure by He bubbles in monovacancy and <b>small</b> <b>void</b> increased up to 7. 5 GPa and 19. 3 GPa, respectively. In vacancy defect, the He–He equilibrium distances decreased with the amount of He atoms incorporated in monovacancy and <b>small</b> <b>void,</b> and the host lattice expanded dramatically. The atomic structures of selected He clusters trapped in vacancies were compared with the gas-phase clusters. In complex 6 H–SiC, there are ten kinds of interstitial sites for a single He atom. According to the calculated formation energy, the most stable site is the. R site. [1], where R site alternates with hexagonal interstitial sites. We explored the interactions between an interstital He atom and HenVam (Va stands for vacancy) clusters (n, m = 1 – 4). We found that the binding energy between He and the HenVam clusters increases with the number of vacancies (e. g., the binding energy is 1. 3 eV for He 2 Va 3, and 1. 7 eV for He 2 Va 4, respectively). The <b>small</b> <b>void</b> (about 0. 55 nm in diameter) in 6 H–SiC can accommodate up to 14 He atoms and the corresponding internal pressure is estimated to be 2. 5 GPa. The maximum density of He atoms in a small He bubble is about 50 atoms/nm 3, which is of the same magnitude as the experimental value 10 atoms/nm 3. Compared to vanadium, a small nanosized void in the 6 H–SiC host lattice has a weak tendency for trapping He. When trapped seventy He atoms in <b>small</b> <b>void</b> in vanadium, the nearest vanadium bond expands 22 – 28 %, and the volume of the void expands by 80 %. At the same time, with fourteen atoms encapsulated in a <b>small</b> <b>void</b> in 6 H–SiC, the local Si–C bonds explans 1 – 5 %, and the volume of the <b>small</b> <b>void</b> expands about 7 %.

40|$|AIM: To compare void {{detection}} in root fillings {{using different}} radiographic imaging techniques: intraoral analogue, intraoral digital and cone beam CT (CBCT) images {{and to assess}} factors influencing <b>small</b> <b>void</b> detection. METHODOLOGY: Two straight root canals in canine teeth were prepared. Calibrated steel wires of five different diameters (200, 300, 350, 500, 800 microm) were inserted respectively in the canal after the injection of a sealer. To simulate filling voids of known dimensions, the wires were removed after the sealer had set. Each sample was imaged, using a Minray X-ray tube (Soredex, Helsinki, Finland) at optimal clinical settings combined with Vistascan PSP (Dürr Dental, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany), Digora Optime PSP (Soredex), Sigma CCD (Instrumentarium, Tuusula, Finland) and E-speed films (Agfa-Gevaert, Mortsel, Belgium). The teeth were also imaged using CBCT (3 D Accuitomo, Morita, Japan). A generalized mixed model and ANOVA analysis were used on the acquired data (Tukey-Kramer correction). RESULTS: There {{was no evidence that}} the factor 'root level' affected void detection in root fillings. 'Void size' was a main determining factor as all voids larger than 300 microm were determined with all techniques. For the smaller voids, there were significant differences between the 5 imaging techniques at different void sizes and different root levels. CONCLUSIONS: Void size and imaging technique were main determining factors. Voids larger than 300 mum were determined with all imaging techniques.

The time de-lay of partial discharge (PD) inception after voltage application in such <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> depends on various parameters including the gaseous volume, and it is subjected to considerable scatter. Average values for this time delay are reported in literature. How-ever, the strong scatter implies a certain probability for the first PD, {{which has not been}} explicitly cal-culated so far. Therefore the probability of the in-ception of the first PD is calculated in this paper as a function of time and of AC (50 Hz) and DC field strength with the geometry as parameter. At first only one single cylindrical void is considered. Fur-ther the calculation is extended to a large number of statistically distributed voids. It is shown that for sufficiently high field values the kind of voltage and the considered pressure range have a minor influence on the PD inception compared to its scatter whereas the geometry of the voids is more important. The calculation allows a better estimation of the delay of PD inception in <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> when performing mea-surements for material investigations and other test routines...|$|R

The first removes an ambiguity about how the void-in-cloud process, which erases <b>small</b> <b>voids,</b> should be incorporated into the excursion set approach. The main technical change here is to think of voids within a fully Eulerian, rather than purely Lagrangian, framework. The second accounts for correlations between different spatial scales in the initial conditions.

In particular, we show that the predicted importance of the void-in-cloud process depends strongly on whether or not one accounts for correlations between scales.

40|$|We derive a {{microscopic}} theory of glassy dynamics {{based on the}} transport of voids by micro-string motions, each of which involves particles arranged in a line hopping simultaneously displacing one another. Disorder is modeled by a random energy landscape quenched in the configuration space of distinguishable particles. We study the evolution of local regions with m coupled voids. At low temperature, energetically accessible local particle configurations can be organized into a random tree with nodes and edges denoting configurations and micro-string propagations respectively. A micro-string propagation initiated by a void can facilitate similar motions by other voids via perturbing the random energy landscape.

This idea can be tested using voids {{in the distribution of}} galaxies: at some level <b>small</b> <b>voids</b> should not contain any (even dwarf) galaxies. We use observational samples complete to MB = − 12 with distances less than 8 Mpc to construct the void function (VF) : the distribution of sizes of voids empty of any galaxies. There are ∼ 30 voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 Mpc. We then study the distribution of dark matter halos in very high resolution simulations of the LCDM model. The theoretical VF matches the observations remarkably well only if we use halos with circular velocities larger than 45 ± 10 km/s. This agrees with the Local Group predictions.
