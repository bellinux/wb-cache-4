40|$|Hand eczema is common, and is {{the most}} {{frequent}} occupational skin disease. Exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> contributes to hand eczema. Common <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> are water, detergents, chemicals and foodstuffs. The aim of this thesis was to study exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> {{in the general population}} in relation to gender, age and occupation, and in individuals with and without hand eczema. A further aim was to validate questions regarding occupational exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants.</b> In the first study, 182 individuals with hand eczema and 182 without hand eczema, matched for age and sex, participated in telephone interviews regarding exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> at work and during leisure time (Study I). In the second study a validation was performed of self-reported occupational exposure to water, chemicals, foodstuffs, gloves and hand washing, in five different occupations (Study II). Forty participants completed a questionnaire before the start of a working day and observers subsequently registered the exposure during the working day. In another study, a validation was performed as above, in 40 nurses/assistant nurses working in six different geriatric wards (Study III). The participants answered questions regarding exposure to water (frequency and total time of exposure), gloves, hand disinfection and moisturizers. Finally, in an epidemiological study, as part of a public health survey 18, 267 gainfully employed individuals aged 18 64 years answered questions regarding occupational water exposure (Study IV). About 20 % of individuals in the general population reported occupational skin exposure to water (Study IV). Furthermore, 7 % reported exposure of more than 2 hours and 6 % of more than 20 times a day. Women reported more water exposure at work compared with men. The youngest group, aged 18 29 years, reported more water exposure than did the older groups. Eighty per cent of the population reported wet exposure during leisure time, for half an hour or more a day, and women were more exposed than men (Study I). Individuals who reported wet exposure at work also reported more wet exposure in their leisure time. No statistically significant differences were seen regarding exposure to water, hand washing or chemicals in individuals with and without hand eczema. The correlation between self-reports and observations regarding water, gloves and foodstuffs were strong, while they were moderate regarding hand washing. There was a tendency to overestimate all exposures (Study II). In nursing the correlations between self-reports and observations were strong for hand disinfection and moisturizers. They were moderate for frequency of water exposure and weak for total time of exposure to water (Study III). The nurses/nurse assistant nurses overestimated their exposures, to water in particular. In conclusion, one-fifth of the general population are occupationally exposed to water and half of the them are highly exposed. Wet exposure during leisure time is common and individuals with high water exposure at work also tend to have high wet exposure in their leisure time. Women have more wet exposure than men both at work and at leisure. Individuals with and without hand eczema seem to have similar exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants.</b> Despite some tendency to overestimate the exposure in the validation studies, the questions are considered useful for surveying exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants...</b>|$|R
2500|$|An itch, {{also known}} as pruritus, is {{classified}} as a sensory stimulation to scratch a certain area of the skin.

40|$|Irritant contact {{dermatitis}} (ICD) is often chronic; its aetiology frequently being related to occupational exposure. Management of ICD involves persistent reduction in exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> such as water, detergents and prolonged occlusion by gloves. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the severity of hand dermatitis 5 years after initial diagnosis and to find out what factors were related to this outcome. A questionnaire survey was carried out on severity of hand dermatitis, exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> and preventive measures, 5 years after initial ICD diagnosis. Of a cohort of 201 patients with ICD, 172 received the questionnaire and 124 (72 %) responded. 5 years after initial diagnosis, 50 % still had medium and 32 % severe hand dermatitis. Patients with severe ICD and high exposure showed low levels of prevention and difficulty in changing their occupational exposure. Use of emollients was predominantly therapeutic rather than preventive. Occupation was changed in 57 % of cases, of which 46 % was permanent. In this population, ICD is a chronic disease; implementation of secondary preventive measures appears to fail. In occupations with high exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants,</b> implementation of permanent exposure reduction is more difficult, compared to occupations with a medium level of exposure. High exposures might have led to change of occupation; medium exposures could have been reduced to low levels. In occupations with high exposure, women were overrepresented...|$|R
40|$|Keratinocytes play an {{important}} role in skin irritation. In an attempt to investigate mechanistic bases of human skin irritation response, we recently identified the upregulation by <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> of adipose differentiation related protein (ADRP) in reconstituted human epidermis. ADRP is a lipid-storage-droplet-associated protein, governing deposition and release of lipids from droplets. The purpose of this study was to characterize, in a human keratinocyte cell line (NCTC 2544), sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-induced ADRP expression, to identify the biochemical events that lead to ADRP expression, and to understand its function in sodium dodecyl sulfate cytotoxicity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate induced a concentration- and time-related production of ADRP that was associated with lipid droplet accumulation. Lipid accumulation following sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment was due to intracellular redistribution rather than lipid neosynthesis, as indicated by equivalent (14) C-oleate and (14) C-acetate incorporations. Other <b>skin</b> <b>irritants,</b> namely benzalkonium chloride, tributyltin, and 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate, also induce lipid droplet accumulation. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-induced ADRP expression and lipid droplet accumulation were modulated by the calcium chelator BAPTA, indicating a role of calcium in ADRP induction. Decrease of sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-induced ADRP expression by specific ADRP antisense oligonucleotide resulted in increased cytotoxicity, indicating a protective role of ADRP and lipid accumulation in the process of cell damage induced by <b>skin</b> <b>irritants.</b> ADRP expression was also induced in vivo following treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate in an experimental model of skin irritation, indicating that the in vitro model represents irritation...|$|R

40|$|Nursing {{has been}} {{identified}} as a wet work occupation, with a high prevalence of occupational irritant contact dermatitis. Reduction of exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> contributes to the prevention of occupational skin disease in nurses. The role of the use of water & soap, handalcohol and gloves in prevention programs is discussed. Two additional measures for reducing exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> are postulated: 1 Use a handalcohol in stead of water and soap in disinfection procedures, when the hands are not visibly dirty: 2 Use of gloves in wet activities such as patient washing, to prevent hands to become wet and visibly dirty. We investigated the effectiveness of these recommendations in a model. Mean daily wet work exposure during nursing work was modelled: regular model. We also modelled exposure to <b>skin</b> <b>irritants</b> in combination with the imple-mentation of these recommendations: prevention model. The hands of healthy volunteers were exposed to the regular or the prevention model during 3 weeks 5 days a week. Change in TEWL {{of the back of the}} hands was measured after 3 weeks exposure to these wet work simulations. An increase in TEWL with the regular model, while mean TEWL decreased in the prevention model. Skin irritation from occlusion by gloves appears to be more pronounced in the regular model compared to the prevention model. The results of this study justify the conclusion that in nursing-work hand-alcohol is the preferred disinfectant. Although the prevention model implies increased occlusive exposure this has no additional irritating effect, probably because of the absence of soap exposure...|$|R
