5000|$|Prior to El Nino, {{the warm}} pool stores heat and is {{confined}} to the far western Pacific. During the El Nino, the warm pool migrates eastward along with the concomitant precipitation and current anomalies. The fetch of the westerlies is increased during this time, reinforcing the event. Using data from <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> and Tropical Atmosphere - Ocean (TAO) moorings in the western Pacific, {{the east and west}} migration of the warm pool was tracked over 1992-2000 using sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), currents, and subsurface data on conductivity as a function of temperature and depth taken on various research cruises. [...] This work showed that during westward flow, the BLT in the western Pacific along the equator (138oE-145oE, 2oN-2oS) was between 18 m - 35 m corresponding with warm SST and serving as an efficient storage mechanism for heat. BLT formation is driven by westward (i.e. converging and subducting) currents along the equator near {{the eastern edge of the}} salinity front that defines the warm pool. These westward currents are driven by downwelling Rossby waves and represent either a westward advection of BLT or a preferential deepening of the deeper thermocline versus the shallower halocline due to Rossby wave dynamics (i.e. these waves favor vertical stretching of the upper water column). During El Nino, westerly winds drive the warm pool eastward allowing fresh water to ride on top of the local colder/saltier/denser water to the east. [...] Using coupled, atmospheric/ocean models and tuning the mixing to eliminate BLT for one year prior to El Nino, it was shown that the heat buildup associated with BLT is a requirement for big El Nino. [...] It has been shown that there is a tight relationship between SSS and SST in the western Pacific and the barrier layer is instrumental in maintaining heat and momentum in the warm pool within the salinity stratified layer. Later work, including Argo drifters, confirm the relationship between eastward migration of the warm pool during El Nino and BLT heat storage in the western Pacific. [...] The main impact of BLT is to maintain a shallow mixed layer allowing an enhanced air-sea coupled response. In addition, the BLT is the key factor in establishing the mean state that is perturbed during El Nino/La Nina ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in providing sea-truth data for various ocean color sensors is climatology. This is particularly true in the Gulf of Maine since it is cloudy and foggy more than it is clear; the climatology shows on average, about one in four to five days has clear skies with clear days slightly more frequent in the late summer and early fall. Our strategy has been to use a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> where one has choice of the sampling days. This provides much better flexibility to sample during clear periods with good satellite coverage. Our Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) contract has been to use the M/S Scotia Prince ferry as a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> running between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth, NS. Measurements include continuous, surface, along-track fluorescence, two independent measures of backscattering, total light scattering, absorption, beam attenuation, above-water remote sensing reflectance, calcite-dependent light scattering, temperature, and salinity. Expendable bathythermography (XBT) drops allow acquisition of vertical temperature information, useful for defining isopycnal slope, which affects primary production. These data are comparable to a previous program from early 1982, where a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> program (SOOP) was run on the truck ferry, M/V Marine Evangeline, which ran along the same transect. These surface data were combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperature fields to examine the Maine coastal current. Unfortunately, this program stopped in 1982.

40|$|An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for geoacoustic {{inversion}} using scalar and vector sound fields {{created by}} a passing ship is discussed in this paper. The continuous sound field emitted by a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> is processed by the sequential filtering technique to estimate slowly changing environmental properties along the source range. The inversion problem is solved by the UKF with a random-walk parameter model, {{which is expected to}} perform well when dealing with highly nonlinear problems. Synthetic geoacoustic inversions are performed using multi-frequency pressure, vertical particle velocity and waveguide impedance (a ratio between pressure and vertical particle velocity) data for the geoacoustic model of a mud environment offshore {{at the mouth of the}} Amazon River in Brazil (CANOGA 12). For the preliminary tests, the sound source is composed of a flat spectrum. Numerical results demonstrate that the sequential filtering technique is capable of estimating the evolution of environmental properties along the source range. In practice, ship data have complex time-varying spectral characteristics that can greatly limit the accuracy of broadband or multi-frequency passive applications. Since the vertical waveguide impedance is independent of the source spectral level, it is preferred for environmental characterization by the sound field generated from a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Because of this independence property, the vertical waveguide impedance is expected to yield a more reliable inversion than that of pressure or vertical particle velocity field. © 2013 CUST.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that striations in different frequency bands have different sensitivities to the three critical parameters. The sensitivity differences are used here to progressively estimate the C-bot, H and C-sed. We first use low-frequency striation structure to estimate the C-bot, then obtain a preliminary estimation of the H and C-sed {{with a set of}} low-frequency striations, and finally find the best-fit solutions from previous estimates using high frequency striation structure.

These regions of high density of fronts do not systematically match regions of high eddy kinetic energy, but the occurrence of increased horizontal gradients is usually associated with confluence. We were able to reproduce reasonably well the spatial variability of fronts, by a simple model that passively advects the large scale salinity climatology with the altimetry-derived surface velocities. We find that stirring induced by meso scale turbulence as well as displacements of water masses are important contributors to the genesis of fronts.

These included data from samples collected for microscopic phytoplankton identification, information from satellite maps to follow geographical bloom development and in situ data to identify hydrographic factors related to bloom initiation.

False front error rates were lower for the histogram methods (27 %– 28 %) than for the gradient method (45 %). Considering only AVHRR fronts for which the SST gradient along the ship track was greater than 0. 18 C km 21, error rates drop to 14 % for the histogram methods and 29 % for the gradient method. Missed front error rates were lower using the gradient method (16 %) than the histogram methods (30 %). This error rate drops significantly for the histogram methods (5 %– 10 %) if fronts associated with small-scale SST features (, 10 km) are omitted from the comparison. These results suggest that frontal climatologies developed from the application of automated edge-detection methods to long time series of AVHRR images provide acceptably accurate statistics on front occurrence. 1...|$|E
40|$|Effective control {{methods are}} of high {{importance}} {{to establish and}} maintain certain water qual-ity standards. Eutrophication and annual phytoplankton blooms {{play an important role in}} the Baltic Sea. The cyanobacteria dominated summer bloom causes special problems in that eco-system, not only because of the ability to fixate atmospheric nitrogen, but also for the capabil-ity of producing cyanotoxins, harming other life forms. An impact on human life is given di-rectly by blooms being washed ashore, as well as indirectly through the food chain. In Situ measurements in wide aquatic areas are time-consuming and expensive, yet only give spatial-ly and temporally limited information. A special algorithm addressing the specific optical properties of cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea is developed at the Marine Remote Sensing group of the German Aerospace Centre. Based on inherent optical properties of cyanobacteri-al pigments and other water constituents, a four component model with parameters for Chlo-rophyll-a, Phycocyanin, Suspended matter and CDOM was developed for the optically com-plex Baltic Sea. Using the simulated dataset, a neural network was trained for the task of in-verting atmospherically corrected MERIS reflectances. This algorithm extends the set of standard water quality products (C,S,Y) by a qualitative new parameter for the pigment Phy-cocyanin and accounts for the specific optical properties of the Baltic Sea.

The satellite algorithm is based on remote sensing reflectance of the water in the red band, a measure of turbidity. Validation of the satellite algorithm using horizontal transects from a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> showed the strongest relationship with phycocyanin fluorescence (an indicator of cyanobacteria), followed by turbidity and then by chlorophyll a fluorescence. The areal fraction with cyanobacteria accumulations (FCA) and the total accumulated area affected (TA) were used to characterize the intensity and extent of the accumulations.

For some inlets, the longitudinal buoyancy gradient dominates the exchange flow, for some others wind straining is more important.

Non-SDC changes in alkalinity in ocean margins and inland seas were examined by comparing the salinity-normalized alkalinity {{with that of the}} open ocean end-member. Non-SDC alkalinity additions to the western North Atlantic margin, eastern North Pacific margin, and Mediterranean Sea were identified, which mainly resulted from river inputs and shelf currents. In contrast, removal of TA through formation and sedimentation of calcium carbonate was observed to be an important control in the Red Sea. The concentration of the river end-member can only be reliably derived from the y intercept of TA-S regression (TAS 0) in river-dominated systems such as estuaries and river plumes. In coastal regions where other processes (evaporation, shelf currents, upwelling, calcification, etc.) are more influential, TAS 0 can significantly deviate from the river water concentration and hence be an unreliable indicator of it. Negative values of TAS 0 can result from non-SDC TA removal at the low salinity end (relative to the salinity of the oceanic end-member) and/or non-SDC TA addition at high salinities (as occurs in the Mediterranean Sea) ...|$|E

A predominately diatom bloom was observed in the Bay of Biscay in April, with a mixed population of diatoms, dinoflagellates and coccolithophores throughout the spring and summer, and a very distinctive bloom, which contained {{a large proportion of the}} dinoflagellate Karenia Mikimotoi, to the stratified side of the Ushant Front in mid-July...|$|R

S. service Argos {{software}} onboards <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> the following operations are implemented : i) a combination of a nonlinear median filter in order to despike the eXpandable BathyThermogramme profile prior to onboard quality control, ii) plus a linear Hanning filter, to filter out the small scale features before using the Broken stick data reduction method (that gives directly the required number of significant data point without iteration), iii) and a final regression fit. Only bathy-messages are computed only to the deph of the deepest "good" data point. So very few bathymessages are rejected later on, during the successive quality controls. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
