5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> the portal.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs {{a hole in the}} ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the {{entrance}} to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach {{is the fact that}} humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E

25|$|November {{began with}} a talk at the Arché club, with another in a couple weeks. Her book series Message of the Mystics was noted for sale in Kansas City. A series of {{conferences}} on social development were announced by the Forward Movement and Ford was among the speakers. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> out November with a talk for the Arché club.|$|E
25|$|In this ending, {{available}} as alternate ending {{on the home}} releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. The screen then fades to black.|$|E
25|$|After an {{argument}} between Mercy and Fatboy, she pushes {{him and he}} falls onto a tree planted in memory of Trina Johnson (Sharon Duncan Brewster), breaking it. Worried that Trina's ex-husband Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) will be angry with them, they enlist Leon and Zsa Zsa's help to replace the tree. However, as they dig up the tree, they discover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy when she says it is all she can see when <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> her eyes. She attends Lucas's Bible class and questions him about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to make an excuse to leave because he cannot answer her. Grace asks Mercy {{to write a letter}} of apology to Lucas, but Mercy throws it away. Mercy and Fatboy play rounders but smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window, which Fatboy repairs. Mercy asks Dot if she can attend her church. When Zsa Zsa is left homeless, she asks to move in with Mercy and her grandmother.|$|E

500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes hold {{of his hand and}} presses the coin into it. As <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> his palm she stops abruptly; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E
2500|$|In February a poem of {{hers was}} {{published}} in the New York Times echoed from the Chicago Post - [...] "The song unsung". A week later she gives a talk on William Dean Howells for the Arché club. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> out February with a talk on Whistler. Nearly two weeks later she was in Fort Wayne, before heading back to New York. There was a district club meeting she spoke at on color, and a few days later she was in Dixon, Illinois for a talk each offered on color, and French artists. By the end of April she was back in Chicago giving a talk on [...] "American Poets".|$|E
2500|$|When Dorothy leaves Oz {{after having}} several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert {{by means of}} the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her {{unexpected}} arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> her eyes and says: [...] "Theres no place like home". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.|$|E

2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
2500|$|Gail Bederman takes a {{different}} view in her Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880–1917. There she describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that [...] "civilization" [...] is predicated on white masculinity. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> with a chapter on 1912's Tarzan of the Apes because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male {{by the standards of}} 1912 white America. Bederman does note that Tarzan, [...] "an instinctivily chivalrous Anglo-Saxon", does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his [...] "masculine impulse to rape." [...] However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand-in for his biological white mother) by hanging him, [...] "lyncher Tarzan" [...] actually enjoys killing black people, the cannibalistic Mbongans, for example. Bederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane, he does so as [...] "Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men." [...] The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane—who in the original novel is not British, but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland—from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees [...] "civilized" [...] Africans farming, his first instinct is to kill them just for being black. [...] "Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims—cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood—lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove him the superior man." ...|$|E
