Conventional <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> materials converts <b>sound</b> energy into thermal energy {{due to the}} porosity and tortuosity. New <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> model has helical-like shape in layered format with composite materials, and it can change the flow resistance itself through the change of the air cavity between layers. Acoustic impedance and sound absorption coefficient using impedance tube are measured for comparing to conventional <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> materials. According to the result of sound absorption coefficient, helical-like shaped structure&# 39;s absorption coefficient exhibited better <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> properties. A simple method of improving the sound absorption and transmission especially at low frequencies after incorporating periodic formation is proposed and verified through experimentation. And with cantilever beam, dynamic stiffness and loss factor of layered absorber is measured and compared with other conventional sound absorber&# 39;s properties...|$|R

The proposed <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> structure has helical-like shapes in layered format with cyclic winding of the mulberry papers and coconut fibers. The acoustic properties changes depending on {{the thickness of the}} air cavity between the thin layers and porosity of the layers themselves. Sound absorption coefficients were measured using two-microphone impedance tube in order to investigate the acoustic property variations with porosity. The measured results were compared to predictions utilizing wave propagations through a slit for verification of the <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> mechanism. A simple method for improving the sound absorption with less material by composite structure is proposed and verified through the experiment. Dynamic stiffness and loss factor of the helical-shaped sound absorbers were measured and compared by analyzing supporting properties to the vibrating beam. Depending on the construction method, the frame dynamic properties showed variation even when the sound absorption was identical.

The muffler geometry can be optimized consequently, to attenuate or remark certain spectral components of the engine noise, according to the result expected. Evidently the design of complex silencing systems is a time-consuming operation, which must be carried out by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. In particular, 1 D and multiD linear/non-linear simulation codes can be applied to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domain.

The 1 D-multiD integrated approach is exploited to validate the transmission loss prediction of reverse chamber configurations with inlet and outlet extensions.

40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing(MB) is {{a process}} for {{producing}} fibrous webs or articles directly from polymers or resins using high-velocity air or another appropriate force to attenuate the filaments. This process is one of the newer and least developed nonwoven processes. This process is unique because it is used almost exclusively to produce microfibers rather than fibers the size of normal textile fibers. MB microfibers generally have diameters in the range of 2 to 4 ㎛, although they may be as small as 0. 1 ㎛ and as large as 10 to 15 ㎛. The material acoustic property for noise absorption is principally based on the efficiency of material structures for damping sound wave reflections.
