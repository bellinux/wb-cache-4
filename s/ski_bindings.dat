5|$|After {{finishing}} their active careers, some of Ull's members {{entered the}} ranks of sports officials and administrators. Most notable was Karl Roll, who became the first chairman of the Norwegian Ski Federation in 1908. Several members had already held positions in the older organization Association for the Promotion of Skiing, founded three weeks before Ull, in 1883. Johan Bechholm was its first secretary, from 1883 to 1886, and many others followed. Johan Sverre (member since 1896) was a notable Olympic administrator after the Norwegian independence in 1905, and Hjalmar Krag (member since 1887) became chairman in the Confederation of Sports. Fritz R. Huitfeldt also became a known figure in his field; for his <b>ski</b> <b>bindings,</b> and for pioneering Telemark skiing. Huitfeldt's ski factory, which he started together with Richard Blichfeldt, was named Ull.|$|E
25|$|During wet or snowy weather, snow {{boots are}} worn {{to keep the}} foot warm and dry. They are {{typically}} made of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and {{designed to provide a}} way to attach the skier to his/her skis using <b>ski</b> <b>bindings.</b> The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relation between position of <b>ski</b> <b>binding</b> 	and turning. The <b>ski</b> <b>binding</b> was fixed on five conditions as follows : 	 1) the center， 2) the front and 3) the back parts of both skis， 4) the front part of 	left ski and the back part of right ski and 5) the front part of right ski and the back part 	of left ski. Then a skier performed snow plow and parallel turn. The results of this study 	were summarized as follows : 1. It seems that skiing movements were very similar one 	another regardless of the five conditions of <b>ski</b> <b>binding</b> from a view point of photograph. 	 2. The skier had feelings that he put on like a short ski in case that the <b>ski</b> <b>binding</b> was 	fixed on the front part of ski and the skier put on like a long ski ip case that the <b>ski</b> 	<b>binding</b> was fixed on the back part of ski...|$|R

2500|$|Snowboard bindings, unlike <b>ski</b> <b>bindings,</b> do not {{automatically}} release upon impact or after falling over. With skis, this mechanism {{is designed to}} protect from injuries (particularly to the knee) caused by skis torn in different directions. Automatic release is not required in snowboarding, as the rider's legs are fixed in a static position and twisting of the knee joint cannot occur to the same extent. Furthermore, it reduces the dangerous prospect of a board hurtling downhill riderless, and the rider slipping downhill on his back with no means to maintain grip on a steep slope. Nevertheless, some ski areas {{require the use of}} a [...] "leash" [...] that connects the snowboard to the rider's leg or boot, in case the snowboard manages to get away from its rider. This is most likely to happen when the rider removes the board at the top or the bottom of a run (or while on a chairlift, which could be dangerous).|$|E
