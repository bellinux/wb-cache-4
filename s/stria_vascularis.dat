5000|$|Hearing loss, as {{caused by}} the 3243 {{mitochondrial}} DNA mutation, {{is seen in the}} form of progressive cochlear dysfunction. Although the mechanism by which the mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) causes this dysfunction of the cochlea is still under investivation, it has been hypothesized that it involves the ion pumps required for sound transduction. As the mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) leads to unbalanced amounts or unstable respiratory chain enzymes, respiration and oxidative phosphorylation are reduced, leading to lower levels of ATP. [...] Naturally, the most metabolically active organs in the patient will be affected by this ATP deficiency. Included in these metabolically active organs is the cochlear <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis.</b> The <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and the hair cells, both essential to sound transduction, make use of ion pumps to regulate the concentration of ions including K+, Na+, and Ca2+ using ATP.

50|$|As the basilar {{membrane}} vibrates, the hair cells {{attached to this}} membrane are rhythmically pushed up against the tectorial membrane, bending the hair cell stereocilia. This opens mechanically gated ion channels on the hair cell, allowing influx of potassium (K+) and calcium(Ca2+) ions. The flow of ions generates an AC current through the hair cell surface, at the same frequency as the acoustic stimulus. This measurable AC voltage is called the cochlear microphonic (CM), which mimics the stimulus.

5000|$|The {{connection}} between albinism and deafness is well known, though poorly understood. In his 1859 treatise On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin observed that [...] "cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf".

The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. It {{is interesting to note}} that similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin per se does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function. Instead the absence of melanocytes in the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> of the inner ear results in cochlear impairment, though why this is, is not fully understood.|$|E
50|$|When {{a person}} {{shows signs of}} sensorineural {{deafness}} there is usually muffling of speech, difficulty understanding words, especially against background noise or in a crowd of people. A person might also frequently ask others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly. They might also withdraw from conversations or avoid some social settings because everything sounds muffled, even when there are loud noises. Sensorineural Deafness indicates that the patient has difficulty hearing not due to environmental factors, but through genetic mutation in the KCNJ10 gene. This gene affects the potassium channel count and their productivity in several parts of the body.Since the main mutation for EAST syndrome is in the KCNJ10 gene, it affects the potassium channels found in the inner ear cells. This includes the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> region of the inner ear, which is the upper portion of the fluid filled spiral ligament of the cochlea. The cochlea is the main region that translates sound waves into neurological signals to be interpreted by the brain. Without properly functioning potassium channel, the potassium conductance is reduced, which is critical for maintaining the endocochlear functioning properly. This implies that more potassium ions leave rather than going into the cell. This causes a lack of sound wave translation into neurological signals, which the brain is unable to understand or interpret. Potassium is also necessary on hair cells, which are mainly under concentration in the endolymph, which is an inner ear fluid membrane. Without the use of potassium channels or entry of potassium in appropriate regions, {{there is a lack}} of signal transduction that help with processing sounds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pendred syndrome, an autosomal-recessive {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} deafness and goiter, {{is caused by}} a mutation of SLC 26 A 4, which codes for the anion exchanger pendrin. We investigated the relationship between pendrin expression and deafness using mice that have (Slc 26 a 4 +/+ or Slc 26 a 4 +/-) or lack (Slc 26 a 4 -/-) a complete Slc 26 a 4 gene. Previously, we reported that <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> of adult Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice is hyperpigmented and that marginal cells appear disorganized. Here we determine the time course of hyperpigmentation and marginal cell disorganization, and test the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to this tissue degeneration. Methods Slc 26 a 4 -/- and age-matched control (Slc 26 a 4 +/+ or Slc 26 a 4 +/-) mice were studied at four postnatal (P) developmental stages: before and after the age that marks the onset of hearing (P 10 and P 15, respectively), after weaning (P 28 - 41) and adult (P 74 - 170). Degeneration and hyperpigmentation <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Gene expression in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> was analyzed by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, the expression of a select group of genes was quantified in spiral ligament, spleen and liver to evaluate whether expression changes seen in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> are specific for <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> or systemic in nature. Results Degeneration of <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> defined as hyperpigmentation and marginal cells disorganization was not seen at P 10 or P 15, but occurred after weaning and was associated with staining for CD 68, a marker for macrophages. Marginal cells in Slc 26 a 4 -/-, however, had a larger apical surface area at P 10 and P 15. No difference in the expression of Lyzs, C 3 and Cd 45 was found in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> of P 15 Slc 26 a 4 +/- and Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice. However, differences in expression were found after weaning and in adult mice. No difference in the expression of markers for acute inflammation, including Il 1 a, Il 6, Il 12 a, Nos 2 and Nos 3 were found at P 15, after weaning or in adults. The expression of macrophage markers including Ptprc (= Cd 45), Cd 68, Cd 83, Lyzs, Lgals 3 (= Mac 2 antigen), Msr 2, Cathepsins B, S, and K (Ctsb, Ctss, Ctsk) and complement components C 1 r, C 3 and C 4 was significantly increased in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> of adult Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice compared to Slc 26 a 4 +/+ mice. Expression of macrophage markers Cd 45 and Cd 84 and complement components C 1 r and C 3 was increased in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> but not in spiral ligament, liver or spleen of Slc 26 a 4 -/- compared to Slc 26 a 4 +/- mice. The expression of Lyzs was increased in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and spiral ligament but not in liver or spleen. Conclusion The data demonstrate that hyperpigmentation of <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and marginal cell reorganization in Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice occur after weaning, coinciding with an invasion of macrophages. The data suggest that macrophage invasion contributes to tissue degeneration in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> and that macrophage invasion is restricted to <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and is not systemic in nature. The delayed onset of degeneration of <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> suggests that a window of opportunity exists to restore/preserve hearing in mice and therefore possibly in humans suffering from Pendred syndrome. </p...|$|E

Pericyte foot processes were tightly positioned adjacent to endothelial cells. Exposure to wide-band noise at a level of 120 dB for 3 hours per day for 2 consecutive days produced a significant hearing threshold shift and structurally damaged blood vessels in the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis.</b> Additionally, the serum protein, IgG, was observed to leak from capillaries of the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> and pericytes lost their tight association with endothelial cells. Levels of the pericyte structural protein, desmin, substantially increased after noise exposure in both guinea pigs and mice with a corresponding increase in pericyte coverage of vessels. Increased expression levels of desmin were associated with the induction of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α and the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Anatomy and PhysiologyA. Philine WangemannPendred {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} sensorineural deafness and post-pubertal goiter. It is caused by mutations in the anion exchanger, pendrin (SLC 26 A 4). The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand the etiology of Pendred syndrome using a mouse model. Different methods of amplification from nanogram amounts of starting RNA were evaluated for gene array application. Gene arrays were performed and free radical stress markers were compared between the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and the thyroid of the Slc 26 a 4 +/- and Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice. Hearing loss in Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice is linked to the loss of Kcnj 10 protein expression and consequently the loss of endocochlear potential. To understand the mechanism of hearing loss in Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice, progressive loss of Kcnj 10 protein expression in <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> of Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice was assessed, the modulation of Kcnj 10 protein expression by free radical stress in cultured <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and in an heterologous expression system was evaluated. To characterize the thyroid pathology, pendrin expression in the thyroid of Slc 26 a 4 +/- mice was measured in a developmental study and correlated with serum thyroxine (T 4) levels of Slc 26 a 4 +/- and Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice over a developmental time course. All tested methods of RNA amplification were suitable for gene array application and demonstrated high internal consistency. Intermethod comparisons revealed variations in data, suggesting that a single amplification method ought to be used within a given experiment. Markers of free radical stress were increased in the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> of Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice before the onset of hearing. Progressive loss of Kcnj 10 expression was seen in Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice at the onset of hearing. Furthermore, free radical stress modulated the expression of Kcnj 10 in cultured <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> and in a heterologous expression system. The pendrin mRNA expression was marginal in the thyroid and did not correlate with serum T 4 levels. Further, absence of pendrin did not affect free radical stress markers in the thyroid.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that ethacrynic acid (EA) can potentiate the ototoxicity of {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics (AmAn) such as kanamycin (KM), if they were applied at the same time. Currently, to create the model of EA-KM-induced cochlear lesion in rats, adult rats received a single injection of EA (75 mg/kg, intravenous injection), or followed immediately by KM (500 mg/kg, intramuscular injection). The hearing function was assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement in response to click and/or tone bursts at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 kHz. The static microcirculation status in the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> after a single EA injection was evaluated with eosin staining. The pathological changes in cochlear and vestibular hair cells were also quantified after co-administration of EA and KM. After a single EA injection, blood flow in vessels supplying the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> rapidly diminished. However, the blood supply to the cochlear lateral wall partially recovered 5 h after EA treatment.

Importantly, disposable co-administration of EA and KM resulted in a permanent hearing loss and severe damage to the cochlear hair cells, but spared the vestibular hair cells. Since the cochlear lateral wall is the important part of the blood-cochlea barrier, EA-induced anoxic damage to the epithelium of <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> may enhance the entry of KM to the cochlea.

A current density analysis revealed standing current density profiles that were qualitatively similar between animals {{and between the}} second and third cochlear turns. Radial standing current densities were greatest at or near the spiral ligament. All the scala vestibuli current density profiles were scaled versions of one another while the scala tympani current density profiles showed more variability. Acoustic stimuli modulated the standing current and there was a cochlear microphonic current density peak in scala tympani near the organ of Corti. The results are summarized with a current-density field line model, the key element of which is a constant current pumped into scale media by the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis.</b> The standing potential gradients drive current from each perilymphatic chamber into the spiral ligament en route to the lateral surface of the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis.</b> The strial current is divided between the receptor cell pathway and leakage pathways. The standing current through the leakage pathways is indirectly modulated by acoustic stimulation through the modulation of the endocochlear potential.

Here we show that LIMP 2 -deficient mice display a progressive high-frequency hearing loss and decreased otoacoustic emissions as early as 4 weeks of age. In temporal overlap to hearing impairment, fluorescence immunohistochemical studies revealed that the potassium channel KCNQ 1 and its β-subunit KCNE 1 were almost completely lost in the luminal part of marginal cells in the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> affecting first higher and later also lower frequency processing cochlear turns. Concomitant with this, the expression of megalin, a multiligand endocytic receptor, was reduced in luminal surfaces of marginal cells within the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis.</b> KCNQ 1 /KCNE 1 and megalin were also lost in the dark cells of the vestibular system. Although LIMP 2 is normally expressed in all cells of the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> in the organ of Corti and cochlear neurons, the lack of LIMP 2 preferentially caused a loss of KCNQ 1 /KCNE 1 and megalin, and structural changes were only seen months later, indicating that these proteins are highly sensitive to disturbances in the lysosomal pathway.

In the cochlea, the sensitivity and efficiency of sensory apparatus to convert mechanical energy into neural activity, largely depends on the fluidic and ionic environment. In the lateral wall of cochlea, the secretory epithelium <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> {{plays an important role in}} the maintenance of fluidic and ionic homeostasis. A variety of gene mutations disturbs the cochlear homeostasis and subsequently leads to hearing impairment. The review covers several aspects of cochlear homeostasis, from cochlear fluid and the functional role of <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> cochlear K+recycling and its molecular substrates to genetic deafness with abnormal cochlear homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChromogranin A (CGA), {{which is}} {{supposed}} to be responsible for the calcium storage of secretory vesicles and is also considered to be a marker protein of neurons and endocrine cells, has been found in a variety of organs and tissues. In the present study, soluble proteins from the organ of Corti, saccule, crista, utricle, tectorial membrane, <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> and the spiral ligament from the inner ear of guinea pig were extracted, and probed with both polyclonal and monoclonal CGA antibodies to determine the presence of CGA. A 75 kDa protein reactve to both antibodies was found in the organ of Corti, saccule, crista, utricle, <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> and the spiral ligament, suggesting the widespread presence of CGA in the inner ear...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (this volume) we described {{a method for}} evaluating the cochlear microvasculature. This method {{was applied to the}} analysis of lateral wall tissue from chinchillas sacrificed 1 h, 24 h, l week and 3 weeks after surgical rupture of Reissner's membrane. The degree, direction, and time course of pathological changes seen in the microvessels were different for the system of <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> vessels, the system of spiral ligament vessels, and the system of spiral prominence vessels. These results indicate {{that it is important to}} evaluate all of the lateral wall vessels rather than just the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis,</b> and emphasize the importance of dividing the microvasculature into three independent systems, in order to obtain a clearer perspective on microvascular changes which occur following cochlear trauma...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} {{and maintenance of}} the endocochlear potential (EP) by the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> is essential for proper function of the cochlea. We present a mathematical model that captures the critical biophysical interactions between the distinct cellular layers that generate the EP. By describing {{the relationship between the}} K+ concentration in the intrastrial space and the intermediate cell transmembrane potential, we rationalize the presence of a large intermediate cell K+ conductance and predict that the intrastrial [K+] is ∼ 4 mM at steady state. The model also predicts that the <b>stria</b> <b>vascularis</b> is capable of buffering the EP against external perturbations in a manner modulated by changes in intrastrial [K+], thus facilitating hearing sensitivity across the broad dynamic range of the auditory system...|$|E
