METHOD: We performed multiple Cox regression analyses to predict the long-term outcome of a 3 -condition, randomized, controlled benzodiazepine discontinuation trial in general practice. RESULTS: Of 180 patients, we completed follow-up for 170 (94 %). Of these, 50 (29 %) achieved long-term success, defined as no use of benzodiazepines during follow-up. Independent predictors of success were as follows: offering a taper-off program with group therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 5 to 3. 9) or without group therapy (HR 2. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 8 to 4. 8); a lower daily benzodiazepine dosage at the <b>start</b> of <b>tapering</b> off (HR 1. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 1. 9); a substantial dosage reduction by patients themselves just before the <b>start</b> of <b>tapering</b> off (HR 2. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 4 to 3. 3); less severe benzodiazepine dependence, {{as measured by the}} Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire Lack of Compliance subscale (HR 2. 4; 95 %CI, 1. 1 to 5. 2); and no use of alcohol (HR 1. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 2. 5).

40|$|Class of 2009 AbstractOBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize the Hyaluronidase (HYA) gene family throughout gestational development of murine hearts to provide greater insight regarding its role in cardiac morphogenesis. METHODS: Microdissection of murine embryos was accomplished to extract embryonic heart tissue. RNA was extracted using the standard Trizol protocol. cDNA templates were created using a standard protocol. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to verify presence of HYA, isolate a sample for insertion into a cloning plasmid to make a recombinant clone. A TOPO cloning reaction followed by a double DNA digest was accomplished to verify gene sequencing and orientation in the clone. SYBR Green real time RT- PCR was used to quantify gene expression relative to 18 S RNA. RESULTS: RT-PCR provided qualitative data indicating HYA 1, HYA 2, and HYA 3 are present at all observed time points (E 8. 5, E 9. 5, E 10. 5, E 11. 5, E 12. 5, E 13. 5, E 14. 5, E 15. 5, and E 16. 5).

Two groups of RA patients on TNFi with DAS 28 < 3. 2 were compared: the tapering group (TG: 67 pts from Spain) and the control group with standard therapy regimen (CG: 77 pts from the Netherlands). DAS 28 was measured at different time points: visit 0 (prior starting TNFi), visit 1 (prior to <b>start</b> <b>tapering</b> in TG and with DAS 28 < 3. 2 in TG and CG), visit 2 (6 months after visit 1), visit 3 (1 year after visit 1), visit 4 (the last visit available after visit 1) and visit-flare (visit with the worst flare between visit 1 and visit 4). Despite the reduction of administered drug at visit 4 in the TG (interval elongation of 32. 8 % in infliximab, 52. 9 % in adalimumab and 52. 6 % in etanercept), the DAS 28 remained similar between groups at the end of the study (DAS 28 : 2. 7 ± 0. 9 in TG vs. 2. 5 ± 1 in CG, p= 0. 1). No differences were seen in the number of patients with flares [26 / 67 (38. 9 %) in the TG vs. 30 / 77 (39 %) in the CG, p= 0. 324] and only nineteen out of 136 patients (14 %) had anti-drug antibodies at the end of the study.

One hundred consecutive patients from participating centers were analyzed, and based on clinical status and response to JAK 1 / 2 inhibitors {{at the time of}} HCT, patients were stratified into 5 groups: (1) clinical improvement (n = 23), (2) stable disease (n = 31), (3) new cytopenia/increasing blasts/intolerance (n = 15), (4) progressive disease: splenomegaly (n = 18), and (5) progressive disease: leukemic transformation (LT) (n = 13). Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 61 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 49 % to 71 %). OS was 91 % (95 % CI, 69 % to 98 %) for those who experienced clinical improvement and 32 % (95 % CI, 8 % to 59 %) for those who developed LT on JAK 1 / 2 inhibitors. In multivariable analysis, response to JAK 1 / 2 inhibitors (P =. 03), dynamic international prognostic scoring system score (P =. 003), and donor type (P =. 006) were independent predictors of survival. Among the 66 patients who remained on JAK 1 / 2 inhibitors until stopped for HCT, 2 patients developed serious adverse events necessitating delay of HCT and another 8 patients had symptoms with lesser severity.

But I am very much among those few".|$|R
