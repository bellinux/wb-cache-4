40|$|Bibliography: leaves 181 - 206. This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{empirical}} analysis of the fuzzy feature of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Overall Index using fuzzy logic techniques. The data for the periods 1985 - 2001 {{is used in the}} analysis. Description of the fuzzy feature is crucial to the proper understanding of the movement of the JSE Overall Index and the South African economy. The fuzzy feature of the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index if understood would impact on the ﬁnancial and economical decisions. A preliminary Fractal analysis is carried out before the fuzzy analysis to investigate the nature of the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index. The Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index experiences the Hurst phenomena of long memory for periods of 100 days (approximately three months). Outside the long memory periods, the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index is found to exhibit antipersistent or short-range dependency characteristics. The fuzzy feature of the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index is described by many aspects of fuzzy logic. The analysis of the fuzzy feature is carried out according to time periods of approximately 4 years each of the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index. The index in each time period is partitioned in three fuzzy states: "low", "middle" and "high". The fuzzy states are important in assessing the fuzzy nature of the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index. The partitioning reveals that the fuzzy states of the Johannesburg <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Overall Index do not possess sharp boundaries. The sizes of the fuzzy states are found to change with time. This reﬂects changes in the forces behind the dynamics of the index...|$|R

40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Theory {{is a novel}} {{approach}} to alliance behaviors in which a great power gives scarce security goods to a small state. This behavior is a puzzle for two reasons. First, {{it seems unlikely that}} a rational state would give away valuable resources without getting something in return, yet small states seem to have nothing to offer. Second, small states sometimes refuse great power offers, which would seem to indicate that "free" security goods impose some sort of cost. This theory addresses both of these puzzles. First, it argues that great powers evaluate small states on their ability to contribute to the great power's security agenda. The extent to which a small state can do so is its Perceived Strategic Value (PSV) {{in the eyes of the}} great power. Ceteris paribus, small states with higher PSV receive larger <b>security</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Second, it argues that small states face a wider array of threats than do great powers and array their forces to meet the greatest threat facing the regime. To the extent that the small state's security perspective mirrors the great power's, the level of <b>security</b> <b>exchanges</b> will be higher. However, because <b>security</b> <b>exchanges</b> impose costs on both parties, there are many cases in which either low PSV or an incompatible small state strategic agenda makes a <b>security</b> <b>exchange</b> unlikely. I test the theory using great power - small state interactions in the Middle East between 1952 and 1961 using qualitative methods and from 1952 to 1979 using statistical analysis. I find <b>Security</b> <b>Exchange</b> Theory is a powerful and parsimonious solution to the puzzle of great power - small state exchange behavior...|$|R
