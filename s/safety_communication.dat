[...] Patient advocates noted that a randomized clinical trial would be unethical, that the mechanism of injury is well-established in animals, and that studies had shown exposure to multiple uses of anesthetic significantly increased the risk of developing learning disabilities in young children, with a hazard ratio of 2.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.26–3.54).|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} an understudied area of telecommunication policy, namely {{the regulation of}} public <b>safety</b> radio <b>communication</b> to bring about communication interoperability. Commonality and funding are the two intertwined policy challenges need to be overcome to achieve this interoperability. Addressing these challenges separately, US federal policy has struggled to establish communication interoperability. By contrast, the integrated approach of the Europeans {{has resulted in a}} relatively successful outcome. It is argued that this integrated approach may even permit the transplantation of a more general telecommunication policy thread [...] competition [...] to the public <b>safety</b> radio <b>communication</b> field. However, whether interoperability is established may also be linked to intra-agency fears of a potential re-direction of hierarchical communication flows brought about by new (and configurable) communication infrastructure. If this is the case, policy-makers regulating for interoperability will need to take into account inter- and intra-agency organizational dynamics as well.

40|$|Introduction: Patient {{safety is}} a problem in {{radiology}} departments. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review was to investigate how patient safety in radiology departments was affected by stress, radiation <b>safety</b> and <b>communication.</b> These three areas were chosen to be studied further because the authors considered these as the three biggest and most common problem areas in the radiology department. Method: The study was written as a literature overview in which both quantitative and qualitative peer reviewed articles were included. Results: The results showed that stress, radiation <b>safety</b> and <b>communication</b> can lower patient safety if handled improperly. Conclusion: Patient safety in the radiology department is one area in healthcare that needs more study. Through this literature review, we concluded that factors such as stress, radiation <b>safety</b> and <b>communication</b> could {{have a negative impact on}} the patient safety. However, patient safety would be increased if the factors were rectified by increasing staffing, improving education in radiation protection and having a better dialogue between the radiographer and other healthcare professionals and between radiographer and patient.

40|$|Vehicular {{traffic density}} {{is a key}} factor in {{determining}} the behaviour of radio overlapping and thus impacts performance of data and <b>safety</b> message <b>communication</b> in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). In this paper, we propose a novel density model for urban traffic systems and employ this model for the purpose of spatial-temporal analysis of radio overlapping. To model traffic density, we consider a signalized junction and road segments linked to that junction as basic building blocks of urban traffic systems. The density model enables us to derive a framework to explain trends and critical regions of radio overlapping corresponding to VANET scenarios targeted for urban transportation systems, which cannot be derived from uniform density models widely used in existing literature. We apply the derived radio overlapping model to study channel load associated with periodic beaconing, a fundamental mechanism for <b>safety</b> message <b>communication</b> in VANETs. This study also provides a generic analytical framework to investigate other performance aspects of data and <b>safety</b> message <b>communication</b> in VANETs. Our experimental results using the proposed realistic density model demonstrate the need for an adaptive mechanism to adjust transmission power and data rate to reduce channel loads associated with dense traffic conditions...|$|R
