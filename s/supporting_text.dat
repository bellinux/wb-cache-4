Arcas received notice for adding texture and depth to Lark's art and using pallette changes to help tell the story.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church {{has been}} opposed to {{contraception}} {{since at least}} the second century. Many early Church Fathers made statements condemning the use of contraception including John Chrysostom, Jerome, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus of Rome, Augustine of Hippo and various others. Among the condemnations is one by Jerome which refers to an apparent oral form of contraception: [...] "Some {{go so far as to}} take potions, that they may insure barrenness, and thus murder human beings almost before their conception." [...] Augustine, in On Marriage and Concupiscence, states that whoever merely involving lust in intercourse without intending procreation, [...] "although they be called husband and wife, are not; nor do they retain any reality of marriage, but use the respectable name [...] to cover a shame. ... Sometimes this lustful cruelty, or cruel lust, comes to this, that they even use sterilizing drugs." [...] The phrase [...] "sterilizing drugs" [...] (sterilitatis venena) was widely used in theological and ecclesiastical literatures to condemn any contraceptive acts and birth control. Augustine utilized the biblical story of Onan as a <b>supporting</b> <b>text</b> to denounce contraception.|$|E

50|$|Error {{bars are}} {{graphical}} {{representations of the}} variability of data and used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement. They give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be. Error bars often represent one standard deviation of uncertainty, one standard error, or a particular confidence interval (e.g., a 95% interval). These quantities {{are not the same}} and so the measure selected should be stated explicitly in the graph or <b>supporting</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
