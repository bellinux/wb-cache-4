40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, failure modes and fatigue {{behavior}} of laser welds in lap-shear specimens of HSLA <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> are investigated based on experimental observations and finite element analyses. The optical micrographs of failed specimens show that laser welds failed in the base metal due to the necking/shear of the load carrying sheets towards weld face under quasi-static loading conditions and in the HAZ due to the kinked fatigue crack propagating through the load carrying sheets towards the weld root under cyclic loading conditions. Elastic-plastic finite element analyses are conducted to explain the ductile failure and effects of the sheet thickness on the failure modes under quasi-static loading conditions. A kinked fatigue crack growth model based on the computational global and local stress intensity factor solutions for finite kinked cracks and a structural stress model based on the closed-form structural stress solutions of the beam bending theory are adopted to estimate the fatigue lives of the laser welds. Approximate stress intensity factor solutions as functions of the normalized weld width are 2 proposed for the right pre-existing crack tip of the load carrying thinner sheet. The effect of weld gap is also investigated based on the computational stress intensity factor solutions and an analytical structural stress model. In the second part of the thesis, Niobium-clad and polymer-graphite coated <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were examined for their ductility and formability. The effects of annealing temperature and time on the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of Nb-clad 304 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were investigated under uniaxial tensile, bending and flattening tests. Nano-indentation tests indicated that the intermetallic layer formed due to the annealing process exhibits much higher values of hardness and elastic modulus as compared to those of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and Nb <b>sheets.</b> Uniaxial tensile, bend and flattening tests and ball punch deformation tests were carried out to determine the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of EB- 815 coated 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> under different straining conditions.

40|$|Stainless steels {{are well}} known {{to be prone to}} cold welding and {{material}} transfer in sliding contacts and therefore difficult to cold form unless certain precautions as discussed in this paper are taken.

The effect of type of lubricant was found to be more complex. For example, the chlorinated lubricants failed to prevent metal-to-metal contact on a brushed sheet surface but succeeded on a blasted sheet surface of the same stainless steel material.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{miniaturization}} {{of components}} {{plays an important}} role for manufacturing in electrical and electronic industries. Therefore, the joining technology of thin metal sheets has been strongly required. Laser welding with micro-beam and high-speed scanning is a promising solution in micro-welding, because it has high-potential advantages in welding heat sensitive components with precise control of heat input and minimal thermal distortion. Approach: In this study, the characteristics of laser micro-welding of thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> by using a single-mode CW fiber laser with high-speed scanning system were experimentally investigated. Results: It was clarified that the welding bead width and depth increased with increasing the scanning velocity under a constant energy density condition and high efficient welding was expected by using high-speed laser scanning with Galvano scanner. The utilization of shielding gas is very effective to obtain smooth fusion bead and the combination of micro beam spot and high-speed laser scanning made it possible to obtain good overlap welding of ultra-thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Conclusion: A faster and high quality welding could be achieved by using a single-mode fiber laser with micro-beam and high-speed scanning...|$|R
40|$|Beside its {{conventional}} {{applications such}} as improving the wear resistance of machine parts and tools, plasma thermochemical treatment (PTT) can be successfully used as a method for surface modification to achieve specific surface properties. Surface electrical conductivity of austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> for example, can be significantly enhanced by means of plasma nitriding. Such materials are of interest for the use as bipolar plates of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).

40|$|AbstractIntroduction:Intravascular {{coronary}} stenting {{has been}} used in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), with a major limitation of in-stent restenosis (ISR). The 316 <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> has been widely used for coronary stents. In this study, we developed a novel coating method to reduce ISR by simultaneously coating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-CD 34 antibody on 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> Methods:Round 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in the D-H group were polymerized with compounds generated from condensation reaction of dopamine and heparin using N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Sixteen sheets from the D-H group were further immersed into 1 ug/ml VEGF 165 and 3 mg/ml heparin sodium one after another for 10 times, and named as the D-(H-V) 10 group. Eight sheets from the D-(H-V) 10 group were coated with anti-CD 34 antibody and termed as the D-(H-V) 10 -A group. Immunofluorescence assay and ELISA were used to evaluate whether the 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> disks were successfully coated with VEGF and anti-CD 34 antibody. Results:The results of immunofluorescence assay and ELISA showed that VEGF could be detected in the D-(H-V) 10 and D-(H-V) 10 -A group, suggesting the <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were successfully covered with VEGF. Anti-CD 34 antibody could only be observed in the D-(H-V) 10 -A group, which was the only group coated with CD 34 antibody. Both results suggested that the 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were successfully coated with VEGF and anti-CD 34 antibody. Conclusion:Our study developed a method to simultaneously coat VEGF and anti-CD 34 antibody to <b>stainless</b> metal <b>steel.</b> This research serves as a fundamental role for a novel coating strategy...|$|R

As {{a result}} of the trend of {{consumer}} demand for many stamped sheet metal products, the study of flexible and incremental sheet metal forming and the small-scale production of stamped goods has received considerable attention.
