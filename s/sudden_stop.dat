5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a <b>sudden</b> <b>stop.</b> This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E

In this model, capital inflows are largely exogenous to the recipient economies, they are very large when scaled {{to the size of}} the domestic financial sectors of recipients, and have large real effects. They also sow the seeds for the ensuing <b>sudden</b> <b>stops,</b> or capital flow reversals, observed in recent financial crises in emerging markets. <b>Sudden</b> <b>stops</b> can have devastating effects on output, growth, and employment. The paper goes on to test the main hypothesis derived from the model with an econometric analysis of capital surges and <b>sudden</b> <b>stops</b> using a panel-probit framework with heterogeneous unobserved country effects. While capital surges can be triggered by a number of domestic or foreign signals, the main variables that account for <b>sudden</b> <b>stops</b> are preceding capital surges, the size of the current account deficit, and contagion from <b>sudden</b> <b>stops</b> in other emerging markets. The main policy conclusion is that emerging economies need specific policies to deal with capital surges, which are largely exogenous to them.
