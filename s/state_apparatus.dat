5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent <b>state</b> <b>apparatus</b> of the Orange Free State. He {{designed}} the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the <b>state</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

Measuring rod used is community report related to maladministration of regional <b>states</b> <b>apparatus</b> to the national Ombudsman Commission. Additionally, interviews with community members which have made an application for identity card, birth certificate, marriage certificate, and the like, have done as supporting information. The finding shows that so far, community members state that services provide by <b>states</b> <b>apparatus</b> is sufficient...|$|R

5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other <b>state</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the <b>state</b> <b>apparatus,</b> by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with the government should be in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|The power {{struggle}} in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central <b>state</b> <b>apparatus,</b> which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power {{at the expense of}} the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as Prime Minister, and later President, Nasser {{continued}} the efforts to limit {{the power of the}} ulema of al-Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage. In 1952, the waqfs were nationalized and placed under the authority of the newly created Ministry of Religious Endowments, cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs. He abolished the sharia courts, merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955, severely limiting the independence of the ulema. The 1961 reform law, which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al-Azhar, gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the sheikh al-Azhar, a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ulema since its inception. Al-Azhar, which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state, continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state. Al-Azhar became increasingly co-opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution—independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased. The authority of the ulema were further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws. While these reforms dramatically curtailed the independence of the ulema, they also had the effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into the <b>state</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The 1961 reform law also provided the ulema with the resources of the state, though the purse strings were outside of their control. While Nasser sought to subjugate the ulema beneath the state, he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit the influence of al-Azhar. One such proposal was made by Taha Hussein in 1955. Hussein sought to dismantle the Azharite primary and secondary educational system and transform the university into a faculty of theology which would be included within the modern, secular, collegiate educational system. The ulema opposed this plan, though Nasser's choice of maintaining al-Azhar's status was due more to personal political considerations, {{such as the use of}} al-Azhar to grant legitimacy to the regime, than on the opposition of the ulema.|$|E

5000|$|Interpellation is {{associated}} {{in particular with}} the work of French philosopher Louis Althusser. In Marxist theory, interpellation is an important concept regarding the notion of ideology. According to Althusser, every society is made up of Ideological <b>State</b> <b>Apparatuses</b> (ISAs) and Repressive <b>State</b> <b>Apparatuses</b> (RSAs) which are instrumental to constant reproduction of the dominant ideology of that given society. While ISAs belong to the private domain and refer to private institutions (family, church but also the media and politics), the RSA is one public institution (police/military) controlled by the government. Consequently, 'interpellation' describes the process by which ideology, embodied in major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes the very nature of individual subjects' identities through the process of [...] "hailing" [...] them in social interactions.|$|R

V práci se snažím o poskytnutí interpretace toho, jak státní aparáty (re) produkují svoji legitimitu tím, že utvářejí svůj obraz jako ochránců bezpečnosti a garantů nomického řádu. Práce je složena ze tří dílčích částí - teoretické, metodologické a analytické. ObhájenoThis {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} called "The Issues of Legitimacy in Society after the Neoliberal Revolution". The main {{theme of this}} paper is analysis of interaction between the institution of punishment, society and legitimacy of <b>state</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> This thesis tries to explain how <b>state</b> <b>apparatuses</b> create their own legitimacy through creating the perception of self as a protectors of society members security and as a protectors of the so called "nomical order". I suppose that this perception of state authorities may result in reinforcement of theirs legitimacy. My dissertation consists of three main parts. The first part of this work stands as a theoretical framework and thus is focused on characteristics and operationalization of key theoretical concepts. More specifically, in this part of thesis, I characterize the terms neoliberalism (as a political ideology and as a political praxis), neoliberal revolution. From the theoretical operationalization of the term "neoliberalism" concepts of "centaur state" and "penal pornography" are derived. For theoretical framework of my study are also important the concepts of institution of punishment, legitimacy and <b>state</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> Theoretical part of my thesis is concluded by conceptual-analytical model called "The dispositive of penal legitimacy". In second part I am concerned with characteristics of data-creating and data-interpreting processes. In this methodological part, I try to present methodology (critical discourse analysis and dramaturgical analysis), that is used in last part of my dissertation. Last chapter deals with analysis of data. In this part I try to provide interpretation of data in accordance to the dispositive of penal legitimacy. As a main methodological tools I use critical discourse analysis and dramaturgical analysis. In accordance to critical discourse analysis, I divide analysed discourse to three main parts. On the level of discourse production, I am concerned with analysis of how is created the discourse of penality in relation on <b>state</b> <b>apparatuses,</b> political actors and social exclusion. On the level of discourse praxis, I am concerned with interpretation of behaviour of <b>state</b> <b>apparatuses</b> on public occasions (via dramaturgical analysis) and with interpretation of their relations to the issues of social exclusion and security. The last level of analysed discourse sociocultural praxis is focused on analysis of intertextuality in medial representations of categories related to dispositive of penal legitimacy...|$|R
