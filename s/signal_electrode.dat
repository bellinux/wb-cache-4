40|$|Stub {{and ring}} {{resonators}} with resonance frequency micromechanical tuning are presented. Benefits and main differences of micromechanical resonance frequency tuning method from other methods are shown. Normalized dependences of effective permittivity on normalized air gap values for various microstrip line electrode width to substrate height ratios are obtained. Effective permittivity analytical formulas {{for the case}} of infinitely wide electrodes are derived. Calculated and experimental dependences of resonance frequency on air gap value and stub experimental unloaded quality factor dependences are given. Air gap influence on resonance frequency value depending on substrate permittivity is shown {{in terms of the}} resonance frequency sensitivity. Error estimation for measured experimental data is presented. Adding tunable heterogeneity between the microstrip resonator <b>signal</b> <b>electrode</b> and the substrate provides not only the resonance frequency tuning but preserves unloaded quality factor. The preservation of the unloaded quality factor during the resonance frequency tuning achieved due to the metal and dielectric loss reduction. Air gap doesn?t have dissipative losses and has permittivity of one, which makes it the best solution for unloaded quality factor preservation. Another important conclusion is that insertion of the air heterogeneity reduces values of dielectric and metal losses arising when substrates with high permittivity are used. For dielectric loss reduction, it is important to maintain low ratio of microstrip line width to substrate height. In contrast to dielectric losses for metal loss reduction the ratio of microstrip line width to substrate height should be high. However, that ratio is limited by impedance permissible range. ???????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????. ???????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ???????, ? ??? ?? ?? ?????????? ? ????????????. ????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ? ?????????, ? ????? ????????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ????????????? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????. ???????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ??? ??????????? ????????????????? ??????...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} {{development}} of economy and technology, there is a boom in wearable devices, such as smart watches, smart wristbands, sports bracelets, somatic game devices, and multimedia devices. Generally, these wearable devices were connected through Bluetooth or ZigBee. To increase the integration and communication security, body area network (BAN) was proposed as a new generation of wireless sensor networks which works in the vivo and vitro of the human body. It could be applied in many domains, including health care, medical, military, and consumer electronics [1]. Honeine, P. et al. [2] indicated using BAN in health care and medical domains to monitor the vital physiological signals. They analyzed the long-term information of physiological sensors which were worn or implanted in the body to provide a health care for some common diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart attack. In a health care BAN, transmission method should be low power consumption, low radiation, and high transmission efficiency and security. However, with high power consumption and network insecurity, traditional communication technologies (Bluetooth or ZigBee) were not suitable for the BAN. In this regard, intra-body communication (IBC) was identified by IEEE Standards Organization as a physical layer standard for BAN [3]. In intra-body communication (IBC), human body was selected as transmission medium for electrical signal propagation [4]. There are two signal coupling types in IBC, which are capacitive coupling and galvanic coupling, respectively [4 – 8]. In capacitive coupling IBC, the signal channel is mainly composed of four parts—human body, <b>signal</b> <b>electrode,</b> ground electrode, and the external ground. The ground electrode couples the signal towards the external ground via the electrostatic field. Meanwhile, the surrounding environment has a great influence on the quality of communication, whereas galvanic coupling injects the electric current signal into the body through a pair of electrodes attached to the skin, and another pair of electrodes is used to differentially detect the coupling potential on the skin. The transmission path of galvanic coupling IBC is completely dependent on the human body. Therefore, it does not interact with the external environment which contributes to higher security.|$|E

After more than two years, an unusual degradation in third-electrode signals was observed, providing the first indication of battery degradation.

The parameters were statistically analyzed and according to the results, an artificial neuronal network was designed to use the P vectors as inputs to classify the electrical signals related to the contraction conditions. A first approach classification was performed with and without contraction classes (CR and NCR), then the same database were subdivided in four classes: with induced contraction (ICR), spontaneous contraction (SCR), without contraction due a post mortem condition (PMR) or under physiological conditions (PNCR).
