40|$|This paper {{examines}} the spatial dynamics of urbanism in Rio de Janeiro {{during the early}} nineteenth century. Conventional narratives of modernisation fail to capture the complexities of this moment, between 1808 and 1821, when the city replaced Lisbon as {{the capital of the}} Portuguese empire. The position of colony and metropolis were inverted, Portuguese absolutism was bolstered by British liberalism, and a market-economy arose alongside the expansion of slavery. As the newly-created imperial capital, Rio felt the effects of these various transformations: the physical boundaries of the city rapidly expanded, its economy diversified and the cultural life of the city was re-shaped. Our aim in this paper is to understand this particular moment of urban transformation as a product of the intersection of global networks of trade, slavery and industrial capitalism. Rather than depicting the historical geography of the city as a passive <b>space</b> for European <b>conquest</b> and expansion, we consider the extent to which its urban dynamics were shaped by a distinct local geography of globalisation. In particular, we examine the interrelated spatialities that are {{part and parcel of the}} modernising process...|$|R

He identifies this source with radio and its yet unknown characteristics. In his article, Costanzi describes what would be the dangers and sensations experienced by an astronaut, such as suffering extreme heat, poisonous radiations, G-acceleration and weightlessness, the latter resulting in a feeling of falling.

40|$|Introduction At the {{beginning}} of the <b>space</b> <b>conquest</b> the space-systems were composed of unique satellite. With the growth of the needs and the explosion of the technologies, the space-systems became more and more complex. Now they are composed of many satellites working together : we talk about constellation. The aim of the constellation design, is to optimize the satellite positions in order to obtain the best performances at the lowest cost. In fact, launching a satellite is expensive and the reduction of the constellation size is necessary. The field of satellite constellation optimization is complex because {{of the size of the}} exploration space, the presence of local optimum, and the time consuming criterion. For this reason, applying any optimization algorithm over the whole constellation using a black-box criterion leads to an impossible resolution. In order to bypass these obstacles and to simplify the search we decide to split the constellation and the exploration space. We al...|$|E
40|$|Optimization {{has been}} playing a very {{important}} role in the orbit and attitude control, and structural design of spacecraft since the advent of the space era. It is well known that weight, space, energy, and time are among the most important constraints that guide the space missions planning. the optimization has a wide field of applications even if only the space area is considered. In this work {{the focus is on the}} structural and control optimization of Large Space Structures (LSS). the structural and the control optimization are separete disciplines that have had application in space missions since the early days of the space era. However the integrated problem is recent. The terminology "Integrated" here stands for an optimization process that takes into account simultaneously aspects of both areas: Structures and Control. The main goal of this new field in space sciences is to obtain an optimal integrated system under the point of view of the Structure and Control disciplines. In this sense this approach creates a necessary bridge between structural and control groups for they have been working separately and facing integration problems during the whole history of the <b>space</b> <b>conquest</b> mainly when the spacecraft is large and has a complex structural configuration. In the case treated here the optimization aims to obtain the minimum weight of a structure while satisfying constraints involving frequencies, control damping and weight of structural appendages. The control is designed together with the structure to damp the structural vibration and pitch motion (attitude control). the gravity-gradient is considered as a source of external torque, characterizing the space environment. One of the strongest challenges to solve the integrated structural/control optimization problem is that of software integration. If computer codes are to be developed they must have structural and control optimization capabilities and which may be by itself a separate problem. The idea that has guided this work is the use of existing software. In this way no computational packages have to be built. However the difficulty of integrating existing software must be considered before embarking in such a comprehensive task. In this research the ORACLS (Optimal Regulator Algorithms for the Control of Linear Systems) software was chosen from the control side. From the structural area the NEWSUMT-A (New Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique) and OPT (OPTmization) computer programs were chosen. MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) software has also been used for the control of the transient phase. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) technique was used to solve the vibration and control problem while the sequential unconstrained minimization techniques (SUMT) were used to attack the structural part of the problem. This means that the SUMT and the LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) were used simultaneously through two integrated computer programs to solve the structural and control problem. The Generalized Reduced Gradient method (GRG) has also been used in conjunction with the LQR to solve a more simplified version of the Large Space Structure treated here. In this research the integrated structural/control method is used to optimally design a Large Space Structural system with and without articulation subject to the gravity-gradient. The result demonstrates that it is possible that the control area consideration may impose some restrictions on the structural design if integrated software can work to solve the problem. The improvements in the weight an control efforts are significant as compared with the original (non-optimal) design. However, the computer cost to solve problems with large numbers of design variables and constraints must be balanced; otherwise the problem solution may become prohibitive under cost aspects. That is, an optimal integrated system under the structural and control consideration may have a solution cost which is not et all optimal...|$|E

Tomando a cidade como lugar, procuramos analisar o trânsito dos estudantes pelos diversos espaços, na conquista de territórios de expressão sociopolítica, na constituição de formas de organização, mobilização, lutas, debates e no enfrentamento das questões educacionais e cotidianas que afligiam os jovens naquele momento. Elegemos os universitários como nossos sujeitos de pesquisa, problematizando suas trajetórias que reportam as movimentações nos grupos de jovens da Igreja, no movimento secundarista, nos partidos, associações de bairro, dentre outros espaços. Como a trajetória dos estudantes pela cidade acabou por vir a ser um objetivo do trabalho em virtude de que muitos militantes do movimento universitário transitaram no movimento secundarista, em vários momentos referenciamos as ações dos partícipes desses dois lugares a fim de problematizar esses percursos como momentos representativos da militância estudantil e da constituição desses sujeitos.

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{vertical}} {{perspectives and}} the satellite technologies that produce them are situated in Ursula Biemann’s Remote Sensing (2001). In this 53 -minute long video essay, {{a range of}} satellite images, animations of satellites, and other found footage that relates to satellite operativity can be found. These images are juxtaposed with up to four other frames in split-screen presentations, and sometimes have script layered on top. In between, on top of, and next to these images, we see Biemann’s own footage from interviews she conducted and locations to which she travelled. Via all these images – some moving and some still – the video essay investigates the multiple trajectories and motivations of women who migrate to work in sex industries globally. The {{way in which the}} video essay utilises found satellite imagery and highlights important aspects about satellite operativity sits very timely within the increasing visibility of vertical perspectives in the form of drone and satellite imagery and virtual visualisations of the earth (Google Earth). The ubiquity of machines that offer perspectives from above calls for critical terms which can effectively address such visions of the world, {{the way in which they}} are produced, and the ends they serve. These terms, I argue, differ greatly from those found in the earlier perspectival paradigms in art history – in which linear perspective has occupied a dominant role – as elaborated by Erwin Panofksy, Hubert Damisch, and others. Following Donna Haraway’s notion of “situated knowledges” both as a method and theoretical framework, this thesis argues that Biemann’s Remote Sensing situates vertical perspectives and the technologies that produce them in a technological framework as well as within the specific cultural and political context: notably that of women in parts of Southeast Asia, South Korea, and Eastern and Central Europe, who migrate to work in the sex industry. In this way the specific forms of satellite vision presented by Biemann’s video essay are made pertinent in relation to a feminist analysis of migrant women’s labour. This a result of negotiating and reimagining the possible conceptualisations of satellite vision between border restriction, global mobility, and the visibility of these women. Instead of perpetuating a rhetoric that situates satellite vision as a penetrating gaze which offers infinitely mobile and all-powerful surveillance, the video essay offers technical details which instead present satellite vision as embodied, vulnerable, and partial. From this position, the situated knowledge of the satellite – in all its partiality – can be stitched together with the interviews with current and former sex workers, women’s rights and anti-trafficking activists, as well as live camera action scenes from the daily activities of these women into a counter-geography. This counter-geography gives visibility to aspects of globalisation which often go under the radar: clandestine networks, illicit border-crossing circuits, as well as some of the multiple grey areas between being forced into sex work and choosing sex work. This counter-geography operates in highly experimental ways which embrace the overall difficulty of representing clandestinity, grey areas, and migrant subjects. As such, I argue that Biemann exploits and reimagines the limits and possibilities of the video essay by a range of postproduction effects that destabilise the types of objective truth claims often associated with traditional documentaries, as well as by multiplying, fracturing and experimenting with the screen space. Concerning the latter, I argue that her use of vertical perspectives along with split-screens and composite images disrupts the rationalising of <b>space</b> associated with <b>conquest</b> and colonization...|$|R
