50|$|The first {{mention of}} Svijany dates from 1345, when {{the village was}} owned by a Cistercian monastery located in Mnichovo Hradiste. In 1565 the village became the {{property}} of Jaroslav of Vartemberk, who built a fortress there, but the brewery was already operating by 1564, and it continued to operate {{to the benefit of}} Jaroslav's estate. Upon Jaroslav's death in 1602, the village, fortress, and brewery all passed to Jachym Ondrej Slik. As a rebel against Habsburg rule of Bohemia, he was executed in 1621, and Svijany came under control of the Wallenstein family through 1814. In 1820, Svijany (together with the village and castle of Sychrov) passed to control of the Rohan family. They sold the brewery to their tenant, Antonin Kratochvile, whose family continued to operate it until 1939, at which point they were compelled to sell it back to the Rohan family. In 1945 the brewery was confiscated and nationalized as part of the state-owned North Bohemian Breweries, which was dissolved in 1990, at which point Svijany became part of the state-owned Breweries of Vratislavice nad Nisou. Later threatened with closure due to a <b>sales</b> <b>crisis,</b> Svijany was sold to the newly established Pivovar Svijany (Svijany Brewery Ltd.) in 1998. This was converted to a joint-stock company in 1992 and incorporated into Pražské Pivovary (Prague Breweries) in 1997. At that time Pražské Pivovary had come under control of the English brewer Bass company. In 2002, Pražské Pivovary became part of the Belgium-based Interbrew group, changing their name in 2003 from Pražské Pivovary to Pivovary Staropramen. In 2004, Interbrew merged with AmBev to form Inbev. In 2009, the private equity fund CVC Capital Partners bought all of Anheuser-Busch InBev's holdings in Central Europe, renaming the operation StarBev. In 2010, Svijany came under ownership of the Liberec Investment Fund.|$|E

50|$|In serious {{economic}} crises, Marx suggests, {{the structure}} of market prices {{is more or less}} suddenly readjusted to the evolving underlying structure of production values. The economic crisis means that price and value relationships have gotten badly out of kilter, causing a breakdown of the normal trading process. According to Marx, the basic meaning of crises for capitalists was, that they could not longer invest their capital at an adequate profit income, which usually meant also that their capital lost part of its value. For workers, crises meant an increase in unemployment, and wage-cuts. Some output and assets might also be destroyed, because they could not be sold, or because they did not make money. Solving the crisis meant reorganizing production and trade, to meet the new requirements for profitable <b>sales.</b> Usually, <b>crises</b> were happening all the time somewhere in the capitalist economy, but those crises were limited to specific industries going bust - such crises normally did not spread to the whole economy. However, at some point, the crisis of particular branches of activity could set off a chain-reaction which would spread to the whole economy.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} stylized monopolistic {{competition}} model {{of international trade}} where firms differ {{with respect to the}} expected economic lifetime of their innovations. Upon entry, they receive a commonly observed signal which is updated over time. Jointly with partial irreversibility of investment, this generates heterogeneity in effective discount rates and, thus, in the cost of finance. In line with evidence, the model predicts a negative correlation between firms' financing costs and their age. Over a firm's life-cycle, per period net profits and the export participation probability grow. Exporters are less likely to exit than purely domestic firms. Belief updating entails excessive financing of incumbents relative to entrants and too much exporting. Asymptotically, trade liberalization reduces overall general equilibrium exit rates, but it does not necessarily increase welfare.

The Pastoral Risk Management (PARIMA) project is a multi-disciplinary, effort funded by USAID from 1997 to 2006. The two main components of the project include research arid outreach. The study area extends from Hagremariam in southern Ethiopia to Isiolo and Baringb Districts' in north-central Kenya. The study area represents an intact eco-marketing region, hosts 10 major ethnic groups, and is beset by pervasive poverty, violence, food insecurity, poor infrastructure, and inadequate public services: Research has focused on risk mapping, household survey, and community-level case studies to identify prominent risks for pastoralists, clarify pastoral coping strategies, and reveal possible Development interventions. Outreach disseminates research information among researchers, Development agents; policy makers, and communities. Outreach has also engaged in efforts to build awareness and capacity of pastoral communities and Development agents to implement risk-management interventions using pilot projects. Degree training has focused on master's and doctoral students, both in East Africa and the United States. Non-degree training includes workshops and interactive field tours for communities, Development facilitators, and policy makers. One Development vision of the PARIMA project is based on how to promote household wealth accumulation and conservation via asset and income diversification. The process could involve encouraging households {{to become involved in}} more timely livestock <b>sales</b> before <b>crises</b> occur, putting some revenue in draught-proof alternative investments, and then focusing on how to achieve a degree of sustainable livelihood diversification.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of the credit crunch in the severe {{contraction}} of trade and economic activity {{at the height of the}} 2008 - 09 global financial crisis, using firm-level data from six emerging market economies in Asia. We construct firm-specific measures of global demand, which allow us to disentangle the effect of falling demand from that of financial constraints on sales. The results indicate that: (1) Although the fall in demand adversely affected the sales of all firms during the <b>crisis,</b> <b>sales</b> declined by less for firms with better pre-crisis financial conditions. (2) In the face of the decline in external financing opportunities, some firms relied more on trade credit from suppliers to supplement operating capital during the crisis, which allowed them to post relatively better sales. (3) Export-intensive firms with comparable financial vulnerability resorted less to trade credit as an alternative source of finance, and hence experienced sharper declines in sales than the domestically-oriented firms. These findings point to the presence of credit frictions among the factors that contributed to the disproportionately large decline in international trade during the crisis.

Using manorial court rolls and ministers' account rolls, as well as the I 283 lay subsidy assessment, annual fluctuations in the transfer of land are compared with local, regional, and national grain price movements. The working assumption that land transfers increased as grain prices rose and that this reflected a rush to the market by sellers, desperate to exchange land for cash and goods, has been tested by searching the court rolls for possible 'motive'. As a result, the <b>crisis</b> <b>sales</b> have been set {{within the context of the}} withdrawal of credit in years of bad harvest; in particular, the possibility that excessive taxation in the I 29 OS caused creditors to withdraw their loans and invest in land is mooted. Withdrawal of credit from poorer villagers, especially in the last decade of the thirteenth century, meant that an added effect of taxation was to remove the support of credit at a time when it may have been most needed.

The basic directions of development of land relations and the threat of sale of agricultural land bypass the moratorium by perpetual lease transaction are considered. Because of the difficult economic conditions in Ukraine, devaluation of the national currency and decreasing of real rent, increasing poverty among the rural population perpetual lease agreements will gain more and more popularity. This creates dangerous tendencies for legal land quasi market organization in terms of the moratorium and in modern realities it is gaining popularity among large agricultural holdings. The increasing popularity of perpetual lease promotes the factor that land owners are able to obtain a large sum of money immediately after contract conclusion, but not in parts during the lease term.

We {{have seen some}} remarkable developments {{as part of the}} digital age revolution {{in the last quarter of}} a century. These have taken place concurrently with a motor age that is possibly past its prime. A number of major motor manufacturers have faced disappointing <b>sales</b> or financial <b>crisis</b> alongside several countries seeing a halt to the historic trend of growing car use. The co-existence of the motor age and the digital age prompts this paper to consider the hypothesis that society is undergoing a fundamental transition from a regime of automobility to something significantly different. The paper considers what has characterized the motor age and proceeds to examine the digital revolution and how this is changing people’s means to access people, goods, services and opportunities. The range of interactions between the motor age and the digital age are addressed, underlining the difficulty in establishing the net consequence of one for the other. The new debates concerning ‘peak car’ are considered in which the digital age is identified as potentially one key factor responsible for observed changes in car use. The paper then focuses upon a sociotechnical conceptualization of society known as the Multilayer Perspective to examine its hypothesis. Support or not for the hypothesis is not, as yet, established. Transport’s future in the digital age is uncertain and the paper sets out some views on resulting policy considerations and research needs...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues raised during the recent crisis has been the potentially exacerbating role played by mark-to-market accounting. Many have proposed the use of historical cost accounting, promoting its ability to avoid the amplification of systemic risk. We caution against focusing on the accounting rule in isolation, and instead emphasize the interaction between accounting and the regulatory framework. First, historical cost accounting, through incentives that arise via interactions with complex capital adequacy regulation, does generate market distortions of its own. Second, while mark-to-market accounting may indeed generate fire <b>sales</b> during a <b>crisis,</b> forward-looking institutions that rationally internalize the probability of fire sales are incentivized to adopt a more prudent investment strategy during normal times {{which leads to a}} safer portfolio entering the crisis. Using detailed, position- and transaction-level data from the U. S. insurance industry, we show that (a) market prices do serve as ‘early warning signals’, (b) insurers that employed historical cost accounting engaged in greater degrees of regulatory arbitrage before the crisis and limited loss recognition during the crisis, and (c) insurers facing mark-to-market accounting tend to be more prudent in their portfolio allocations. Our identification relies on the sharp difference in statutory accounting rules between life and P&C companies as well as the heterogeneity in implementation of these rules within each insurance type across U. S. states. Rather than promoting a shift away from market-based information, our results indicate that regulatory simplicity may be preferred to the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios that gives rise, through interactions with accounting rules, to distorted risk-taking incentives and potential build-up of systemic risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of {{financial}} crises on foreign direct investment (FDI) activity. The paper will examine whether or not there is fire sale FDI in host countries during a financial crisis. Also, it explores the extent to which FDI inflows is affected by the occurrence of a financial crisis. The paper adds a detail about the types of financial crises. It is expected that different types of financial crises have varying effects on FDI inflows. Hence, financial crises are categorized into banking crisis, inflation crisis, and currency crisis. It is also expected that differing types of FDI have different reaction to financial crises, hence FDI inflows are distinguished between two groups including cross-border merger and acquisitions (M&A) and greenfield investment. The sample used in this paper is based on 23 developed countries across four economic regions for the period 1990 - 2010. The paper uses a panel data analysis to check the appropriateness and effectiveness of financial crises in the FDI regression model. The empirical results indicate that financial crises have strong negative effects on FDI activity in my sample. In particular, banking crisis and currency crisis are shown to reduce the value of FDI inflows, FDI stocks and greenfield FDI activities significantly, while inflation crisis has little impact FDI activity. I do not find evidence in supporting the fire sale FDI hypothesis in my sample. On the other hand, financial crises lead to large decline in the value of cross-border M&A.

40|$|First version March 29, 2015; This version March 15, 2016 During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis (GFC), Japan and the U. S. differed {{in at least two}} important ways: (1) while markets were stable in Japan then, the bubbles in the U. S. housing and financial markets burst and (2) while Japanese banks suffered few losses, huge losses badly weakened U. S. banks. In addition, and unlike the U. S., Japan requires firms' balance sheets to show, not only their total debt, but also the components of their debt: bonds, loans, and other debt. We used data for listed, non-financial, Japanese firms' bonds, bank loans, and other debt to investigate whether the 2008 "Lehman shock" in the U. S. disrupted Japanese bond markets. The Japanese data al-lowed us to estimate how much the Lehman shock affected Japanese firms' bonds outstanding and issued and to estimate how much, in turn, the Lehman shock resulted in firms' getting more loans from Japanese banks. The estimates revealed important cross-currents during the crisis. Our estimates implied that, while the crisis reduced bond issuance, it was accompanied by enough more bank loans to raise total debt. During the crisis, both bonds outstanding and bond issuance responded less to prior bond shortfalls and responded less to their maturing bonds. Second, while it greatly reduced bonds issued and outstanding at smaller, listed firms, the crisis boosted them at the very largest firms. In contrast, bank loans then rose more at smaller firms. Third, bank loans rose more, and bonds outstanding fell more, at firms with greater exposure to foreign <b>sales.</b> Fourth, the <b>crisis</b> led firms, and especially larger firms, to hold more cash and fewer securities and to reduce costs.
