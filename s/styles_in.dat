5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, {{began to take}} their places as the dominant <b>styles</b> <b>in</b> the mainstream, which resulted in heavy metal music losing popularity and going underground for a decade.

5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and focused more on absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan <b>styles</b> <b>in</b> an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} were themselves an influence on composers well into the Soviet era.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the same}} time the Empire <b>style</b> <b>in</b> France was a more grandiose wave of neoclassicism in {{architecture}} and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman <b>styles,</b> it originated <b>in,</b> and took its name from, the rule of Napoleon I in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier <b>style</b> <b>in</b> the German-speaking lands, Federal <b>style</b> <b>in</b> the United States, the Regency <b>style</b> <b>in</b> Britain, and the Napoleonstil in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour [...] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".|$|R
