6000|$|The next thing, therefore, was a {{cylinder}} of brass, broadly open above, {{saying to the}} world, as it were, [...] "Look! I contain coal." [...] And there were brass tongs like <b>sugar</b> <b>tongs</b> wherewith Euphemia would regale the fire and brighten it up, handing it a lump {{at a time in}} the prettiest way. But brass dints. The brazen thing was quiet and respectable enough upstairs, but ever and again it went away to be filled. What happened on these holiday jaunts Euphemia has never ascertained. But a chance blow or worse cause ran a crease athwart the forehead of the thing, and below an almost imperceptible bulging hinted at a future corpulency. And there was complaint of the quantity of polishing it needed, and an increasing difficulty in keeping it bright. And except when it was full to the brim, the lining was unsightly; and this became more so. One day Ithuriel must have visited Euphemia's apartment, and the tarnished brilliancy of the thing stood confessed. For some days there was an interregnum, and a coal-scuttle from downstairs--a black unstable thing on flat foot and with a vast foolish nether lip--did its duty with inelegant faithfulness.|$|E

He was then approached by a reporter named Norman Grindstone, who was investigating the disappearance of detective Harry Christmas. Harry was [...] "on to something big", as Norman put it, involving the Pentagon, a rash of 32 mysterious disappearances since 1949, silver <b>sugar</b> <b>tongs,</b> and an Ant Farm. Norman found Harry's conclusion about what was going on, and showed it to Flex. Both were horrified by Harry's discoveries. Soon after, Norman Grindstone was seemingly erased from existence. For two months Flex flexed about every muscle in his body to try and turn the Pentagon into a circle. Dolores left him in this time because he wouldn't stop flexing. He failed, and investigated the Pentagon up close. He was captured, however, by the (real) Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and placed inside the Tearoom of Despair. Once there, he lost his powers and his memory, and was left to wander, homeless and crazy, until he found Danny the Street.|$|E

Gill at a dinner held in is honour at the Castle Mona, Douglas, Isle of Man on Wednesday June 16, 1852.In addition Capt. Gill also received a purse of 100 sovereigns. On {{the top of the}} coffee and tea pots were two emblems, one representing that for the sailing vessels, being formed of a rudder, sail, and block grouped together, the other consisting of a large paddle wheel, funnel and steering-wheel.On the coffee pot was inscribed, under the figure of a yacht, the names of the sailing vessels commanded by Captain Gill, and under a steam vessel the names of the Mona's Isle, Queen of the Isle, King Orry, Ben-my-Chree and Tynwald, the steamers which had been under his charge. In addition to the silver articles there were three handsome papier mache waiters and a complete service of china in white and rich gold. The silver article, had the initials W. G. upon them, with the principal inscription [...] "To Captain William Gill, the discoverer of the Victoria Channel into Liverpool."In this manner, therefore, did Liverpool express gratitude for the new Channel.|$|E
40|$|Sucrose-phosphatase (SPP) catalyzes {{the final}} step in the pathway of sucrose {{biosynthesis}} in both plants and cyanobacteria, and the SPPs from these two groups of organisms are closely related. We have crystallized the enzyme from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 and determined its crystal structure alone and in complex with various ligands. The protein consists of a core domain containing the catalytic site and a smaller cap domain that contains a glucose binding site. Two flexible hinge loops link the two domains, forming a structure that resembles a pair of <b>sugar</b> <b>tongs.</b> The glucose binding site {{plays a major role}} in determining the enzymeâ€™s remarkable substrate specificity and is also important for its inhibition by sucrose and glucose. It is proposed that the catalytic reaction is initiated by nucleophilic attack on the substrate by Asp 9 and involves formation of a covalent phospho-Asp 9 -enzyme intermediate. From modeling based on the SPP structure, we predict that the noncatalytic SPP-like domain of the Synechocystis sucrose-phosphate synthase could bind sucrose- 6 F-phosphate and propose that this domain might be involved in metabolite channeling between the last two enzymes in the pathway of sucrose synthesis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnzymatic subsite mapping earlier {{predicted}} 10 binding subsites in {{the active}} site substrate binding cleft of barley alpha-amylase isozymes. The three-dimensional structures of the oligosaccharide complexes with barley alpha-amylase isozyme 1 (AMY 1) described here give {{for the first time}} a thorough insight into the substrate binding by describing residues defining 9 subsites, namely - 7 through + 2. These structures support that the pseudotetrasaccharide inhibitor acarbose is hydrolyzed by the active enzymes. Moreover, sugar binding was observed to the starch granule-binding site previously determined in barley alpha-amylase isozyme 2 (AMY 2), and the sugar binding modes are compared between the two isozymes. The "sugar tongs" surface binding site discovered in the AMY 1 -thio-DP 4 complex is confirmed in the present work. A site that putatively serves as an entrance for the substrate to the active site was proposed at the glycone part of the binding cleft, and the crystal structures of the catalytic nucleophile mutant (AMY 1 D 180 A) complexed with acarbose and maltoheptaose, respectively, suggest an additional role for the nucleophile in the stabilization of the Michaelis complex. Furthermore, probable roles are outlined for the surface binding sites. Our data support a model in which the two surface sites in AMY 1 can interact with amylose chains in their naturally folded form. Because of the specificities of these two sites, they may locate/orient the enzyme in order to facilitate access to the active site for polysaccharide chains. Moreover, the <b>sugar</b> <b>tongs</b> surface site could also perform the unraveling of amylose chains, with the aid of Tyr- 380 acting as "molecular tweezers.

40|$|The {{phosphatase}} AtPTPKISI {{is involved}} in the control of starch metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves at night. The SEX 4 (Starch Excess 4) mutants, lacking this predicted phosphatase, have strongly reduced rates of starch metabolism. It is shown that this chloroplastic protein can bind to glucans through a carbohydrate binding domain (CBM) located within its previously predicted kinase interaction sequence (KIS), while another novel KIS containing protein (AKINÎ²y) shows no such interaction. Further analysis of the CBM identifies conserved residues vital for carbohydrate binding and common to CBMs, as well as <b>sugar</b> <b>tongs,</b> not present in similar CBMs or the GBD/KIS domain of the previously studies AMPKÎ², but found within the binding domain of the PTPKIS family proteins. While PTPKIS 1 shows activity to generic phosphatase substrates, it is unable to dephosphorylate either phosphotyrosine or phosphothreonine containing peptides. It does however show phosphatase activity towards phosphorylated starch and amylopectin, comparable to that of the mammalian protein laforin. Remarkably, the most closely related protein to PTPKIS 1 outside the plant kingdom is laforin, required for the metabolism of the mammalian storage carbohydrate glycogen and implicated in a severe form of epilepsy (Lafora disease) in humans, through the formation of insoluble starch like polyglucans (lafora bodies). In addition to PTPKIS 1, PTPKIS 2 (At 3 g 015180) is identified, a predicted phosphatase, with a domain structure homologous to that of PTPKIS 1, termed. The PTPKIS 2 -SALK (PTPKIS 2 knockout) mutant, lacking this predicted phosphatase, has a reduced rate of starch metabolism. It is shown that this mutant causes a phenotype similar to SEX 4, but less extreme. It is further shown that this protein can bind to glucans through a carbohydrate binding domain (CBM), but unlike PTPKIS 1 shows no activity towards any phosphate substrates. PTPKIS 2 does however modulate the activity of PTPKIS 1, causing a 4 -fold increase in the activity of PTPKIS 1 against phosphorylated starch, when both enzymes are present in equimolar concentrations. Finally, a hypothesis is proposed as to the roles of PTPKIS 1 and PTPKIS 2 in starch metabolism, and the similarity of function seen in the mammalian protein Laforin.
