5|$|Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha, former {{dependencies}} of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> {{and current}} {{parts of the}} British Overseas Territory of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena,</b> Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, have never formed their own teams independent from the <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> team.|$|E
5|$|Two extinct flightless {{species of}} rail were {{at one time}} placed in the genus Atlantisia with the Inaccessible Island rail. The Ascension crake (Mundia elpenor) and the <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> {{swamphen}} (Aphanocrex podarces) were once considered congeners of A. rogersi. The Ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> swamphen disappeared before 1600 {{and has never been}} encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and the <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Both the Ascension crake and the <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.|$|E

50|$|Sadly, most of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> endemic birds became extinct since human {{habitation}} began. Still, Wirebird breeding {{programs are}} on-going, although numbers are still falling. The Millennium Forest Project has been highly successful and has boosted {{the chances of}} <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> treasured flora and fauna, {{and this is the}} main concentration of conservation on the island.|$|R
25|$|Napoleon praised <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> coffee {{during his}} exile on the island, {{and the product}} enjoyed a brief {{popularity}} in Paris {{in the years after}} his death.|$|R
5|$|Jamestown is {{the capital}} of the British Overseas Territory of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena,</b> Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the {{historic}} main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from the English East India Company settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 1700s survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.|$|E
5|$|Bulteel's convoy {{continued}} on, pausing at Rio de Janeiro on 12 August to resupply. The East Indiamen {{then went}} on to <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> on their way to Asia. The two Botany Bay ships sailed on to Australia and the whaler Seringapatam sailed for the South Seas.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{original}} death mask {{was created}} around 6 May, {{although it is}} not clear which doctor created it. In his will, he had asked to be buried {{on the banks of the}} Seine, but the British governor said he should be buried on <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena,</b> in the Valley of the Willows.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} built in 1862 and is similar in design to <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> <b>Saint</b> Paul's Cathedral, which {{was built in}} the 1850s. It is {{designated}} as a Grade I listed building, and is one of many listed buildings (a designation for buildings of historic or architectural merit) in Jamestown.|$|R
50|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) for the 2014/15 financial year was £33.5 million and gross national product (GNP) was £32.3 million, GNP per Capita was £7,392 and GNP per Capita, was £7,133.|$|R
50|$|The Trust was {{established}} by Ordinance. It unites in one organization <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> Art and Craft Association, Heritage Society, Nature Conservation Group, Dive Club, Farmer's Association, Fisherman's Association, Tourism Association and the Domaines Français.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} (2,932 inhabitants in 2012) primarily {{consists of}} native-born Falkland Islanders, {{the majority of}} British descent. Other ethnicities include French, Gibraltarian and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena,</b> and Chile has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, Falkland Islanders are British citizens.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1815, {{four days}} after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette {{arranged}} for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days {{on the island of}} <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena.</b> The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was ignored by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{announced}} his second abdication on 24 June 1815. In the final skirmish of the Napoleonic Wars, Marshal Davout, Napoleon's minister of war, {{was defeated by}} Blücher at Issy on 3 July 1815. Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the Royal Navy was blockading French ports to forestall such a move. He finally surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of HMS Bellerophon on 15 July. There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; Longwy capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so. Louis XVIII was restored to the throne of France and Napoleon was exiled to <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena,</b> where he died in 1821. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815.|$|E
25|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> biodiversity, however, also {{includes}} marine vertebrates, invertebrates (freshwater, terrestrial and marine), fungi (including lichen-forming species), non-vascular plants, seaweeds and other biological groups. To date, {{very little is}} known about these, although more than 200 lichen-forming fungi have been recorded, including nine endemics, suggesting that many significant discoveries remain to be made.|$|R
5000|$|Englishman Sir Francis Drake {{probably}} {{located the}} island {{on the final}} leg of his circumnavigation of the world (1577-1580). Further visits by other English explorers followed and, once <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena’s</b> location was more widely known, English ships of war began to lie in wait {{in the area to}} attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home.|$|R
50|$|The year 1759 saw the {{destruction}} of central Skövde in a large fire. A block of old wooden houses are preserved, and together with a botanical garden, form the cultural reserve Helénsparken. The oldest house in the park, Helénsstugan ('Heléns cottage') is from the early 18th century. Next to Hertig Johan's Torg ('Duke Johan's Square') is <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> Church and church park.|$|R
5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril of Alexandria, captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography of the portrait clearly identify it as an image of Cyril of Alexandria, the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images painted in the church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above the entrance), the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of the entrance), Saint Constantine and <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> (right of the entrance).|$|E
5|$|The Eocene frigatebird genus Limnofregata {{comprises}} birds whose fossil {{remains were}} recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments, unlike the marine preferences of their modern-day relatives. They had shorter less-hooked bills and longer legs, and longer slit-like nasal openings. Three {{species have been}} described from fossil deposits in the western United States, two—L. azygosternon and L. hasegawai—from the Green River Formation (48–52 million years old) and one—L. hutchisoni—from the Wasatch Formation (between 53 and 55 million years of age). Fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the Pleistocene and Holocene has been recovered from Ascension Island (for F. aquila), <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> Island, both in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and also from various islands in the Pacific Ocean (for F. minor and F. ariel).|$|E
5|$|The Galapagos shark {{is found}} mainly off {{tropical}} oceanic islands. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs around Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde, Ascension Island, <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> and São Tomé Island. In the Indian Ocean, {{it is known}} from Walter's Shoal off southern Madagascar. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs around Lord Howe Island, the Marianas Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Kermadec Islands, Tupai, the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Hawaiian Islands, the Galapagos Islands, Cocos Island, the Revillagigedo Islands, Clipperton Island, and Malpelo. There are a few reports of this species in continental waters off the Iberian Peninsula, Baja California, Guatemala, Colombia, and eastern Australia.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment {{levels are}} low (31 {{individuals}} in 2013, compared to 50 in 2004 and 342 in 1998). Employment {{is dominated by}} the public sector, however the number of government positions has fallen from 1,142 in 2006 to just over 800 in 2013. <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena’s</b> private sector employs approximately 45% of the employed labour force and is largely dominated by small and micro businesses with 218 private businesses employing 886 in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Barren Ground {{lies at the}} top of Swanley Valley and Old Woman's Valley, about 700 m {{above sea}} level. The scenery is {{dominated}} by High Hill to the west and The Saddle to the north. Despite the name, the area is fertile, but due to the steepness of the terrain is largely woodland. In <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> 2008 Land Development Plan, Barren Ground is marked as an area for additional housing development.|$|R

5|$|Admiral Strachan's {{squadron}} {{was ordered}} to prepare for sea during December at Plymouth, but like Warren's force, Strachan was trapped by strong winds in Cawsand Bay and could not sail until mid-January. Strachan's orders were to sail for <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> and search for signs of the French squadrons. If their whereabouts could not be discovered, Strachan was to join the squadron under Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham detailed to invade the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. During February and March Strachan searched in vain, eventually receiving the news that Willaumez had anchored in neutral Salvador in Brazil during April. Steering northwest {{in the hope of}} intercepting the French squadron, Strachan was hampered by the presence of HMS St George, which proved too slow for a flying squadron. Returning to Plymouth, Strachan detached St George and Centaur, which had been made the flagship of the Rochefort blockade squadron and was given HMS Belleisle, HMS Audacious and HMS Montagu as replacements, as well as two frigates.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} in 1803–15 known as the Napoleonic Wars, various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire. Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution (1789), these further revolutionized the formation, organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to mass conscription. Under the leadership of Napoleon, French power rose quickly as the Grande Armée conquered most of Europe, and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–14 campaigns, resulting in {{the restoration of the}} Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication and banishment to the Island of <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> concluded the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Phipps pursued his life-long {{interest}} in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1885, he edited a revised edition of {{what was then the}} standard authority on Napoleon, Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne's Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte. He also wrote the revision's chapters XXIV and XXVI. Subsequently, he edited a new edition of the surgeon Barry Edward O'Meara's Napoleon at <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena,</b> another Napoleonic Wars classic, to which he wrote a new introduction: O'Meara had been Napoleon's doctor on Helena. Historians praised Phipps' introduction as a convincing exposition against the treatment of Napoleon on Helena. In 1889, he edited a revised edition of Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan's The private life of Marie Antoinette, queen of France and Navarre; with sketches and anecdotes of the courts of Louis XVI, which was also well received.|$|E

25|$|The island had a monocrop economy until 1966, {{based on}} the {{cultivation}} and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string. <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena's</b> economy is now weak, and is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government. The public sector dominates the economy, accounting for about 50% of gross domestic product. Inflation was running at 4% in 2005. There have been increases {{in the cost of}} fuel, power and all imported goods.|$|R
50|$|Alternative: Helena {{felt bad}} for her sister and traded places with her. So Sibylla became a <b>saint</b> and <b>Helena</b> a witch.|$|R
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird has the {{smallest}} {{range of the}} three tropicbird species, yet it still ranges across the neotropics, {{as well as the}} tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian oceans. The nominate subspecies Phaethon aethereus aethereus breeds on islands in the Atlantic south of the equator, including Ascension, and <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and Fernando de Noronha and Abrolhos Archipelago in Brazilian waters. It is a vagrant to the coastline of Namibia and South Africa. The subspecies P. a. mesonauta is found in the east Atlantic, the east Pacific, and in the Caribbean. The Indian Ocean subspecies, P. a. indicus is found in waters off Pakistan, western India, southwestern Sri Lanka, the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula. The subspecies is also a rare but regular vagrant to the Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is built}} on igneous rock in the James Valley, {{sandwiched}} between steep cliffs. It is therefore rather long and thin. The walls of the valley are rough and steep, and rockfalls have been a problem, although now minimised by netting. A small stream, the Run, runs through the valley. The town is commonly divided into lower and upper parts, depending on the distance up James Valley. Being the island's main port (and with the <b>Saint</b> <b>Helena</b> Airport only receiving its first scheduled flight in October 2017) the town is still currently the main entrance to the island to visitors. Despite not being connected to Jamestown proper by road, Rupert's Valley, the next valley north, {{is also part of}} the town. It houses much of the island's infrastructure, such as its power station and associated fuel storage, and a one-ship wharf was completed in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|There are 31 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories.

Starting with the bottom medallion {{on the right}} wing, Helena questions Jewish leaders (wearing Jewish hats) about the location of the Cross. In the middle medallion, Helena watches as servants dig up the Cross on Mount Calvary, below a pointing Hand of God; the two thieves crosses have already been excavated. In the upper medallion, Helena is testing the three crosses on a sick man to find the one True Cross that has the healing powers.|$|R
