5000|$|In metaphysics, the {{multiple}} occupancy view (m.o.) {{is a particular}} analysis of fission cases, which claims {{to be at least}} a priori possible, if not actually true of real cases of fission. Imagine an amoeba which undergoes <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fission</b> into two sister amoebae (call them B and C). We tend to think that before fission there was one amoeba (call it A), but what has happened to it? It has not died, for death is a biological state, and there are no dead amoebae lying around after the fission! In fact, there is more life after the fission than there was before, i.e. two live amoebae instead of just one. Has A somehow ceased to exist without dying? Is A still around, and identical with either B or C? It cannot be identified with both B and C, for identity is a transitive relation, and B is certainly not the same amoeba as C. Yet, the fission was symmetrical, so neither B nor C has any more or less claim to be A than the other. This is the problem. We seem to be forced to say that A has ceased to exist, but the m.o. view provides us with another option, consistent with all of the above considerations. The m.o. view is that there were two distinct but coincident amoebae before fission, occupying the same body of matter, but which diverge upon fission into the same two distinct, but no longer coincident, amoebae. The number of amoebae hasn't increased, i.e. there were two before fission, and there are the same two after fission. The amoeba has [...] "divided without multiplying"! The m.o. view has also been applied to hypothetical cases of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fission</b> involving persons. On the face of it, the m.o. view contravenes the principle of identity of indiscernibles. However, one and the same physical object can be a proper part of two or more distinct objects (e.g., a road intersection is part of two distinct roads), which leads to four-dimensionalism, whereby, for example, an amoeba at a time (amoeba stage) is a temporal part of an amoeba extended in time, i.e., objects have temporal parts.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{photofission}} on 181 Ta nucleus induced by bremsstrahlung photons with endpoint energies of 50 and 3500 MeV has been performed. The fission yields have been measured {{by using the}} induced-activity method in an off-line analysis. The absolute photofission cross sections for the tantalum target at 50 and 3500 MeV {{are found to be}} 5. 4 ± 1. 1 microb and 0. 77 ± 0. 11 mb, respectively, and the corresponding deduced fissilities are (0. 23 ± 0. 05) x 10 ^- 3 and (2. 9 ± 0. 9) x 10 ^- 3. Mass- and charge-yield distributions were derived from the data. The results were compared with the simulated results from CRISP code for multi-modal fission by assuming <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fission</b> mode. Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures, 3 tabl...|$|E

In 2010, the many units act to increase the density of Jupiter until stellar ignition is carried out, converting the planet into a miniature star. In 3001, millions of copies of TMA-2 assemble themselves into two megastructure disks that attempt to block the Sun from the Earth and from its colonies in the Jovian system.|$|R
50|$|Organisms which {{replicate}} via symmetric division, such as E. coli, {{are thought}} to be immortal. However, by tracking the inheritance of both the new and old cell pole, evidence of aging was found in E. coli. A cell which has consecutively inherited the old cell pole has been shown to exhibit a significantly decreased growth rate. The decline in growth rate in Stewart et al. appears to be at least partially attributed to the preferential localization of inclusion bodies near the old cell wall. This localization is thought to be the passive result of the slow diffusion of the large aggregate, and the exclusion of the aggregate by the nucleoid. A similar mechanism of aging has been found to occur in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe, which divides via <b>symmetrical</b> binary <b>fission.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{clustering}} {{structure and the}} internal or sub-structure of clusters in $^{ 112 - 122 }$Ba nuclei {{within the framework of}} relativistic mean field theory in an axially deformed cylindrical co-ordinate. We calculate the total density distribution, and the individual neutrons and protons density distributions. From the analysis of the clustering confugurations of the density distributions of various shapes, we find different sub-structures inside the Ba nuclei considered here. The important step, carried out for the first time, is the counting of number of protons and neutrons present in the clustering region(s). $^{ 12 }$C is shown to consitute the cluster configuration of Ba nuclei in most cases, with $^{ 2, 3 }$H and $^ 4 $He constituting the neck between two <b>fissioning</b> <b>symmetrical</b> fragments.

40|$|Abstract. The brick crusher hammers {{were used}} in factory, which wear-resisting was poorer. According this phenomenon, the single {{structure}} was designed in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fission</b> structure. Firstly, high chromium cast and low alloy steel were casted into half of the bimetal hammer head, then two new type bimetal hammer head were connected into a whole body by the welding technology. The high abrasion resistance and impact toughness of bimetal composite material {{played an important role}} in process of use and the service life was improved effectively, which provided a new way of thinking for complex compound casting. The results showed that the new type of bimetal composite casting and welding connection hammer production’s cost was 1. 5 times of high manganese steel hammer, but the service life was improved 3 ~ 5 times. Low alloy steel and high chromium cast iron composite layer was a metallurgical combination, and the whole strength was good and no fault phenomenon in the using process after welding...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} crypt {{formation}} and {{the roles of}} Wnt and cell-cell adhesion signaling in cryptogenesis are not well described; but {{are important to the}} understanding of both normal and cancer colon crypt biology. A quantitative 3 D-microscopy and image analysis technique is used to study the frequency, morphology and molecular topography associated with crypt formation. Measurements along the colon reveal the details of crypt formation and some key underlying biochemical signals regulating normal colon biology. Our measurements revealed an asymmetrical crypt budding process, contrary to the previously reported <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fission</b> of crypts. 3 D immunofluorescence analyses reveals heterogeneity in the subcellular distribution of E-cadherin and β-catenin in distinct crypt populations. This heterogeneity was also found in asymmetrical budding crypts. Singular crypt formation (i. e. no multiple new crypts forming from one parent crypt) were observed in crypts isolated from the normal colon mucosa, suggestive of a singular constraint mechanism to prevent aberrant crypt production. The technique presented improves our understanding of cryptogenesis and suggests that excess colon crypt formation occurs when Wnt signaling is perturbed (e. g. by truncation of adenomatous polyposis coli, APC protein) in most colon cancers...|$|E
40|$|Several evidences of {{anomalous}} nuclear reactions {{occurring in}} condensed matter {{have been observed}} in the phenomenon of electrolysis. Despite the great amount of experimental results coming from the so-called Cold Nuclear Fusion research activities, the comprehension of these phenomena still remains unsatisfactory. On the other hand, as reported {{by most of the}} articles devoted to Cold Nuclear Fusion, one of the principal features is the appearance of microcracks on the electrode surfaces after the experiments. In the present paper, a mechanical explanation is proposed considering a new kind of nuclear reactions, the piezonuclear fissions, which are a consequence of hydrogen embrittlement of the electrodes during electrolysis. The experimental activity was conducted using a Ni-Fe anode and a Co-Cr cathode immersed in a potassium carbonate solution. Emissions of neutrons and alpha particles were measured during the experiments and the electrode compositions were analyzed {{both before and after the}} electrolysis, revealing the effects of piezonuclear fissions occurring in the host lattices. The <b>symmetrical</b> <b>fission</b> of Ni appears to be the most evident observation. Such reaction would produce two Si atoms or two Mg atoms with alpha particles and neutrons as additional fragments...|$|E
