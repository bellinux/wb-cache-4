Diversity in 2 G devices can be present both {{in form of}} multiple receive branches and blind repetitions. In presence of diversity, intersymbol interference (ISI) equalization and co-channel interference (CCI) suppression are usually very complex. In this paper, we consider the improvements for 2 G devices with receive diversity. We derive a low-complexity receiver based on a channel <b>shortening</b> <b>filter,</b> which allows to sum up all diversity branches to a single stream after filtering while keeping the full diversity gain. The summed up stream is subsequently processed by a single stream Max-log-MAP (MLM) equalizer. The channel <b>shortening</b> <b>filter</b> is designed to maximize the mutual information lower bound (MILB) with the Ungerboeck detection model. Its filter coefficients can be obtained mainly by means of discrete-Fourier transforms (DFTs). Compared with the state-of-art homomorphic (HOM) filtering based channel shortener which cooperates with a delayed-decision feedback MLM (DDF-MLM) equalizer, the proposed MILB channel shortener has superior performance. Moreover, the equalization complexity, in terms of real-valued multiplications, is decreased by a factor that equals the number of diversity branches...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, single–carrier {{transmission}} impaired by cochannel interference is considered, {{which generally}} arises in a GSM / EDGE mobile radio network. Here, cochannel interference is created {{due to the}} reuse of the frequencies in nearby cells. In the case, that only a single antenna {{is available at the}} mobile receiver, the (multiple–input single–output) system is overloaded and equalization with low complexity is difficult. The optimum joint maximum–likelihood sequence estimation (JMLSE) algorithm would require a huge number of channel states to be considered in a corresponding Viterbi algorithm. The usage of a channel <b>shortening</b> <b>filter</b> in combination with a joint M–algorithm for detection was proposed in [1] in order to obtain good performance results at low complexity for single– antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) in the low–to–moderate carrier–to–interference power ratio (CIR) range, but unfortunately the M–algorithm has shown worse performance than joint delayed–decision feedback sequence estimation (JDDFSE) or joint reduced–state sequence estimation (JRSSE) for high CIRs. To solve this problem, we consider a combined scheme of JRSSE and the M–algorithm for joint detection of the desired user signal and one or more interferers, which corresponds to a special application of breadth–first sequence detection [2]. For the considered algorithm, each trellis state ν is equipped with a list of M (best) paths to be stored and processed forward. I...|$|E

Channel shortening equalizers can be employed to shorten the effective impulse response of a long intersymbol interference (ISI) channel in order, for example, to decrease the computational complexity of a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) or to increase the throughput efficiency of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme. In this paper, the issue of joint transmitter–receiver filter design is addressed for shortening multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISI channels. A frequency-domain approach is adopted for the transceiver design which is effectively equivalent to an infinite-length time-domain design. A practical space–frequency waterfilling algorithm is also provided. It is demonstrated that the channel shortening equalizer designed according to the time-domain approach suffers from an error-floor effect. However, the proposed techniques are shown to overcome this problem and outperform the time-domain channel <b>shortening</b> <b>filter</b> design. We also demonstrate that the proposed transceiver design can be considered as a MIMO broadband beamformer with constraints on the time-domain multipath length.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{discrete}} multitone receiver, a time-domain equalizer (TEQ) reduces intersymbol interference (ISI) by shortening the effective {{duration of the}} channel impulse response. Current TEQ design methods such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE), maximum shortening SNR (MSSNR), and maximum geometric SNR (MGSNR) do not directly maximize bit rate. In this paper, we develop two TEQ design methods to maximize bit rate. First, we partition an equalized multicarrier channel into its equivalent signal, noise, and ISI paths {{to develop a new}} subchannel SNR definition. Then, we derive a nonlinear function of TEQ taps that measures bit rate, which the proposed maximum bit rate (MBR) method optimizes. We also propose a minimum-ISI method that generalizes the MSSNR method by weighting the ISI in the frequency domain to obtain higher performance. The minimum-ISI method is amenable to real-time implementation on a fixed-point digital signal processor. Based on simulations using eight different carrier-serving-area loop channels, 1) the proposed methods yield higher bit rates than MMSE, MGSNR, and MSSNR methods; 2) the proposed methods give three-tap TEQs with higher bit rates than 17 -tap MMSE, MGSNR, and MSSNR TEQs; 3) the proposed MBR method achieves the channel capacity (as computed by the matched filter bound using the proposed subchannel SNR model) with a five-tap TEQ; and 4) the proposed minimum-ISI method achieves the bit rate of the optimal MBR method.

Conventional implementations of echo cancellers are often the adaptive transversal filter architectures due to the simplicity and robustness of stability and convergence. However, the conventional echo cancellers suffer from high cost problem especially when the response time of the echo is long.

40|$|The {{front-end}} electronics for the ALICE TPC to {{read out}} the charge detected by 570132 pads {{located on the}} readout chamber end-caps is here presented. The read-out chambers are multiwire proportional chambers with cathode pad read-out. The pads receive as the image charge of the signal on the anode amplification wires a signal with a fast rise time (less than 1 ns), and a long tail due to {{the motion of the}} positive ions. The signal is delivered on the detector impedance which varies between 3 pF to 12 pF. Therefore the front-end electronics must cope with different pad capacities. The electronics will be located in an area with limited access. High reliability is thus a concern. The circuit was developed in 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. The front-end electronics consist of a charge sensitive preamplifier/shaper, a 10 -bit 10 MHz low-power ADC and an ASIC which contains a <b>shortening</b> digital <b>filter</b> for the tail cancellation, the baseline subtraction and zero-suppression circuits, and a multiple-event buffer [3]. The image charge induced on the TPC pads is amplified and integrated by a low input-impedance amplifier. It is based on a continously sensitive charge sensitive amplifier followed by a semi-gaussian pulse shaper of second order. The amplitude, which is different for the 3 different pad sizes, has a typical value of 7 µA. The Preamplifier/shaper for the ALICE TPC (Fig. 1) is based on the design of the preamplifier/shaper for the NA 45 /CERES TPC. The main modifications concern: • migration from the technology AMS CMOS 0. 8 µm to the AMS CMOS 0. 35 µm; • optimization of the design to better fulfil the ALICE requirements; • removal of the tail cancellation circuit that, in the ALICE design, is implemented in the digital ASIC. This continuously sensitive design is particularly suitable for a detector with high occupancy. A peaking time of τs = 120 ns and noise consideration ( 10 MΩ. The feedback resistance RF is realized by using a MOS transistor biased in subthreshold region. The MOS transistor MF establishes the DC path and continuously discharges CF with a decay time Tdecay =CF × Rds (MF) ...|$|R
