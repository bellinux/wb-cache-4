40|$|To address banks’ {{risk taking}} {{during the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, we develop a model of credit-portfolio optimization and study the impact of risk-based capital regulation (Basel Accords) on banks’ asset allocations. The model shows that, when a bank’s capital is constrained by regulation, regulatory cost (risk weightings in the Basel Accords) alters the risk and value calculations for the bank’s assets. The model predicts {{that the effect of}} a tightening of the capital requirements – for banks for which these requirements are (will become) binding – will be to skew the risky portfolio towards high-risk, high-earning assets (low-risk, low-earning assets), provided that the asset valuation – i. e., reward-to-regulatory-cost ratio – of the high-risk asset is higher than that of the low-risk asset. Empirical examination of U. S. banks supports the predictions applicable to the dataset. In addition, our tests show the characteristics of banks with different levels of risk taking.

This crisis has highlighted two more basic questions about Basel II: One, is the method of capital regulation incorporated in the revised framework fundamentally misguided? Two, even if the basic Basel II approach has promise as a paradigm for domestic regulation, is the effort at extensive international harmonization of capital rules and supervisory practice useful and appropriate? This book provides the answers. It evaluates Basel II as a bank regulatory paradigm and as an international arrangement, considers some possible alternatives, and recommends significant changes in the arrangement. ...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of two data sets {{containing}} Loss Given Default (LGD) observations of home equity and corporate loans, we consider non-linear and non-parametric techniques to model and forecast LGD. These techniques include non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR), a regression tree, a transformed linear model and a two-stage model combining a linear regression with SVR. We compare these models with an ordinary least squares linear regression. In addition, we incorporate several variants of 11 macroeconomic indicators to estimate {{the influence of the}} economic state on loan losses. The out-of-time set-up is complemented with an out-of-sample set-up to mitigate the limited number of credit crisis observations available in credit risk data sets. The two-stage/transformed model outperforms the other techniques when forecasting out-of-time for the home equity/corporate data set, while the non-parametric regression tree is the best performer when forecasting out-of-sample. The incorporation of macroeconomic variables significantly improves the prediction performance. The downturn impact ranges up to 5 % depending on the data set and the macroeconomic conditions defining the downturn. These conclusions can help financial institutions when estimating LGD under the internal <b>ratings-based</b> <b>approach</b> of the Basel Accords in order to estimate the downturn LGD needed to calculate the capital requirements.

40|$|Basel II rules {{put forward}} by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{introduced}} a more risk-sensitive approach to banks to calculate regulatory capital requirements. This more risk-sensitive framework includes an option for banks to apply for permission to use Internal-ratings based approach in which the bank can estimate some parameters by itself without resulting to supervisory estimates. The framework for calculating the capital requirement for exposures in corporate portfolio includes a correlation function in which the bank's own estimate of probability of default {{would be the only}} variable.

The resulting asset value correlations calculated from the empirical dataset in this paper are close to what previous studies on default data have found to be the empirical level. The dataset is based on the ratio of gross impairment to loans and guarantees. Furthermore the feasibility of the results is assessed through three hypotheses which all assist in showing the feasibility of the chosen approach.

40|$|The capital {{adequacy}} requirement of banks shifted in March, 2007 from Basel I to Basel II. In Basel II, exact measurement of credit risk is adopted, and banks choose between a standardized approach (SA) and an internal <b>ratings-based</b> <b>approach</b> (IRBA). In general, the IRBA {{is a more}} risk-sensitive capital requirement measurement than the SA and Basel I. Theoretical modeling in related literatures implies that since the IRBA depends on the probability of default, a downturn implies a higher capital requirement, meaning that the IRBA is pro-cyclical to the business cycle. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to verify the effects of the IRBA on bank lending through empirical analysis. Although the empirical analysis here cannot confirm the pro-cyclicality of the IRBA, it does allow the proposal of a benchmark for the effects of this approach. The effect we estimate is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), and the estimation method adopted is difference-in-difference propensity score matching (DID-PSM). Using this method, we can confirm the real effects of the IRBA. The results are that in 2006 - 2007 when bank balance-sheets were favorable, the ATT are negative, but all these are insignificant, on the other hand, in 2006 - 2008 when the balance-sheets were infuluenced by the subprime-loan crisis, the ATT are negative and significant, and smaller than it in 2006 - 2008.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two aspects}} of credit risk {{measurement}} {{in the context of}} Basel 11 : The International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards. The first is the problem arising when two credit rating agencies disagree over the rating assigned to an issuer and a split rating arises. The second area is the determination of internal credit rating models for use under the Internal <b>ratings-based</b> <b>approach.</b> This thesis presents a variety of bank rating modes for individual and long term ratings across different agencies and regions. Using an extensive database of credit rating agencies with a sample of over 52, 000 split ratings covering a four year period from 1999 - 2004 the first study shows that there is a ranking of agencies from the most to least generous that is stable over time. In most cases, the differences between the mean ratings of the agencies are significantly different from each other at the 1 % level. The greatest differences arise between the US and Japanese agencies. When the split ratings are compared in terms of Basel II risk weights the differences between the US and Japanese agencies are still highly significant and the conclusion is that supervisors should alter the mapping of the Japanese agencies to the risk assessments under the provisions of Annex 2 to Basel II. Contrary to earlier research this study does not find that the highest level of split ratings arise for banks. The level of consensus between agencies appears to correspond to the average credit quality of the industry in question. Bank credit ratings are modelled from financial ratios and variables using ordinal logistic regression. Sample sizes exceeded 1, 100 banks for the largest agencies.

40|$|Under the {{framework}} of Basel II, banks which adopt the internal <b>ratings-based</b> <b>approach</b> {{will be required to}} compare their actual provisions with expected losses. Any shortfall (i. e., the expected loss exceeds the provision) should be deducted from capital of the bank. It is therefore important to ensure banks make adequate provisions against expected losses. In addition, both sound policy and the Banking Ordinance require banks to take a forward-looking view of provisions. These requirements raise the issue of how to determine an adequate level of provisions in response to changing market conditions, in particular requiring adequate provisions from an expected-loss perspective. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to employ a simple model for measuring provisions for collateralised loans. The collateral value and the probabilities of default (PD) of borrowers are the two correlated input variables in the model. The model incorporates forward-looking elements including volatility of the collateral value and correlation between the collateral value and the PD into the measured provisions. The model can be readily extended to measuring provisions for loans without collateral provided that the expected values and volatility of the loans' recovery rates can be estimated. Some calculations of provisions with different loan-to-value ratios and one-year PD are presented for illustrative purposes. For example, using the classified-loan ratio of 1. 49 % as at September 2005 as a proxy of the PD and the loan-to-value ratio of 180 % (which corresponds to the loss-given-default of about 45 %), the provision for loans is about 0. 66 % of the outstanding loan value. Promotion of forward-looking provisions in assessments of risk can obviate the need for large increases in provisions when the economy is in recession. This means that procyclicality of lending would be reduced to some extent. ...|$|R

Purpose: Our essay seeks to explore what influence pillar 1 and the new updated management of credit risks in the new capital accord Basel II have on small Swedish banks and what influence pillar 2 have. We also want to explain if Basel II has influences on small Swedish banks credit analysis and possible effects in their risk management and pricing. Methodology: In our essay we use an inductive approach and our chosen research method is the qualitative one. We have chosen to look into four small Swedish banks, and the empirical data is obtained from telephone interviews with selected respondents from Länsförsäkringar Bank, SkandiaBanken, GE Money Bank and ICA Banken. Conclusions: • The work with credit scoring does not get influenced by Basel II if the Standardised Approach is chosen. • Banks that’ve early implemented high technological systems in the organization, that small banks normally do, have gotten an easier transition to Basel II. • Basel II {{will result in a}} risk adjusted pricing and a more fair credit market. • Internal <b>Ratings-based</b> <b>Approaches</b> is very demanding to develop, {{but at the same time}} it’s a more risk sensitive approach. • Pillar 2 results in a more sophisticated work for the small banks. • Basel II results in a further price press on residential loans in Sweden...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between banks’ approval for the internal <b>ratings-based</b> (IRB) <b>approaches</b> of Basel II and the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets. Analysing a panel of 115 banks from 21 OECD countries that were eventually approved for applying the IRB to their credit portfolio, we find that risk-weight density becomes lower once regulatory approval is granted. The effect persists when we control for asset structure, and we provide evidence showing that this phenomenon cannot be explained by modelling choices, or improved risk-measurement alone. Consistent with theories of risk-weight manipulation, we find the decline in risk-weights to be particularly pronounced among weakly capitalised banks, where the legal framework for supervision is weak, and in countries where supervisors are overseeing many IRB banks. We conclude that part of the decline in reported riskiness under the IRB results from banks’ strategic risk-modelling. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|With the {{financial}} crisis spreading to the real economy, the discussion about potential procyclical implications of Basel II received a surge of attention. While existing research approaches the topic either from a theoretical perspective or from an empirical perspective that draws on simulated data, we are first in studying the cyclicality of risk weights {{on the basis of}} realized data. Furthermore, we are able to differentiate not only between Basel I and Basel II, but also between the Standardized Approach (StA) and the internal <b>ratings-based</b> (IRB) <b>approach.</b> We argue that without knowledge of these approaches’ presumably distinct cyclicality of risk weights, any measure to dampen procyclicality is premature. For this purpose, we first study which banks opt for implementation of the IRB approach and then set up a panel model to quantify the cyclicality of capital requirements. While we find no evidence of cyclicality in portfolios subject to the Basel II StA, we find economically substantial and statistically significant effects in IRB portfolios. ...|$|R
