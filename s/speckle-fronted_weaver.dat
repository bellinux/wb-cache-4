Aquatic environments are generally inhabited, and when found in dryer climates such as forests or the savanah, {{they are generally}} near streams or in well watered areas. Roosting sites are often important in the ecology of bats, as the bats {{are subject to the}} conditions of their roosting sites. The nests constructed by birds, such as <b>speckle-fronted</b> <b>weaver,</b> provide protection from predators and the elements. likely {{as a result of the}} benefits gained from roosting in these nests, the lesser woolly bats have been known to roost in abandoned nests previously inhabited by speckled weavers, scarlet-chested sunbirds, and several others.
