2500|$|On October 31, 1983, about 2:00p.m., {{five members}} of a {{construction}} crew saw a 100-foot-long sea serpent off Stinson Beach, which is just north of San Francisco, California. A flagman named Gary saw it first swimming towards the cliffside road which the work crew was repairing. He radioed {{another member of the}} work crew, Matt Ratto, and told him to grab the binoculars. Ratto began looking at the sea serpent when it was 100 yards offshore and {{less than a quarter of}} a mile away. Ratto said, [...] "The body came out of the water first." [...] He added, [...] "It was black with three humps." [...] He continued, [...] "There were three bends. like humps and they rose straight up." [...] He further described it as a [...] "humpy, flat-backed thing". He also made a sketch of the animal which appeared to be a round headed, blunt nosed, snake-like creature followed by 3 vertical arches or coils sticking out of the water. Another eyewitness, Steve Bjora, said [...] "The sucker was going 45 to 50 miles an hour." [...] He also described the animal saying, [...] "It was clipping. It was boogying. It looked like a long eel." [...] Marlene Martin, the Caltran <b>safety</b> <b>engineer</b> who was over seeing the work crew also saw the animal. She said, [...] "It shocked the hell out of me" [...] adding, [...] "That thing's so big he deserves front page coverage." [...] She went on to say, [...] "It was hard to describe how big it was. I have no creative imagination. It was a snake-like thing that arched itself up and was so long it made humps above the water." [...] Martin first saw it near Bolinas and saw it swim the whole way to Stinson beach then watched it turn around and head towards the Farallon Islands. Martin said, [...] "It had a wake as big as a power boat's and it was going about 65 miles an hour. It looked like a great big rubber hose as it moved. If someone had gotten in its way it would have plowed right though them." [...] Before it went underwater Martin saw it lift its head and a portion of its body directly behind its head out of the water then open its mouth. Martin said, [...] "It was like it was playing." [...] She described the animal as a [...] "giant snake or a dragon, with a mouth like an alligator's." [...] She continued, [...] "It was at least 15 or 20 feet in circumference, but it was hard to tell how long it was. I mean, how long is a snake? Marlin Martin concluded by saying, [...] "He should have the whole damn ocean. It's his territory. He's the King of the Sea!" ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{critical}} {{systems are}} becoming more complex, both {{in the type of}} functionality they provide and in the way they are demanded to interact with their environment. Such growing complexity requires an adequate increase in the capability of <b>safety</b> <b>engineers</b> to assess system safety, including analyzing the bahaviour of a system in degraded situations. Formal verification techniques, like symbolic model checking, have the potential of dealing with such a complexity and are more often being used during system design. In this paper we present the FSAP/NuSMV-SA platform, based on the NuSMV 2 model checker, that implements known and novel techniques to help <b>safety</b> <b>engineers</b> perform <b>safety</b> analysis. The main functionalities of FSAP/NuSMV-SA include: failure mode definition based on a library of failure modes, fault injection, automatic fault tree construction for monotonic and non-monotonic systems, failure ordering analysis. The goal is to provide an environment that can be used both by design engineers to formally verify a system and by <b>safety</b> <b>engineers</b> to automate certain phases of safety assessment. The platform is being developed within the ESACS project (Enhanced Safety Analysis for Complex Systems), an European-Union-sponsored project in the avionics sector, whose goal is to define a methodology to improve the safety analysis practice for complex systems development. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{software}} development process, formal verification and functional testing are complementary approaches {{which are used}} to verify the functional correctness of software; however, even perfectly reliable software could lead to an accident. The correctness of software cannot ensure the safe operation of safety-critical software systems. Therefore, developing safety-critical software requires a more systematic software and safety engineering process that enables {{the software}} and <b>safety</b> <b>engineers</b> to recognize the potential software risks. For this purpose, this dissertation introduces a comprehensive safety engineering approach based on STPA for Software-Intensive Systems, called STPA SwISs, which provides seamless STPA safety analysis and software safety verification activities to allow the software and <b>safety</b> <b>engineers</b> to work together during the software development for safety-critical systems and help them to recognize the associated software risks at the system level...|$|R
