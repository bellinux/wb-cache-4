40|$|Particleboard often {{represents}} the lowest cost option amongst {{a range of}} suitable wood panel products. Particleboard consumption {{in the world is}} approximately 57 % of total wood panel consumption and the demand is growing at 2 &ndash; 3 % per year. This demand required more and more wood chipping to supply the raw materials as particleboards are traditionally made using custom flaked softwood particles. Hardwood <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> have traditionally not been favoured by the particleboard industry (or indeed other forest product industries) owing to their high density and high extractive content. Throughout Australia considerable quantities of hardwood saw mill residues are produced as solid waste. In Victoria alone, over a million cubic metres of saw logs are converted annually into sawn timber, producing in excess of 200, 000 tonnes of hardwood sawdust. In recent years, the re-growth and plantation timber industry in Australia has been producing hardwood <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> with lower extractive contents and lower densities. The work presented here is aimed at developing an economical methodology for making particleboard using 100 % hardwood sawmills waste. A comprehensive literature review indicated that a similar attempt has not been conducted to date. Through the literature review, major parameters which would influence particleboard made of sawmill waste were established. Subsequently, in consultation with the softwood particleboard industry, a preliminary process of making particleboards in the laboratory was developed. This method was trialled and modified until an acceptable particleboard could be produced. A systematic experimental investigation was then performed incorporating a design of experiments method (DOE) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate the behaviour of single-layer and three-layer particleboard properties separately with processing parameters. Seven processing parameters were studied for three-layer boards while six parameters were studied for single-layer boards. The particleboard testing was performed according to the Australian and New Zealand standards for reconstituted wood-based panels. It was found that three-layer particleboards can be produced using 100 % hardwood <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> as the major raw material to meet the standards for general purpose particleboard. This hardwood particleboard uses a slightly higher amount of resin and moisture for its surface layer than conventional softwood particleboards. To understand the effect of processing parameters on the particleboard properties, further analysis was conducted. Based on this analysis, process models were developed to predict the most critical particleboard properties (modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture and the vertical density profile) with respect to processing parameters. These models can be used to optimise properties of hardwood particleboard with regard to processing parameters. Also, these models can be used to produce particleboards in the laboratory with required design properties...|$|E

After six weeks, maize plants in soils with eucalyptus and particularly filtercake biochar had higher biomass compared to those in soils with cotton and swine manure biochars. The latter’s low biomass was likely related to excessive salinity. In general, our biochars showed potential for increasing θ in sandy soils compared to the soil alone.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges of the forestry sector and the global wood industries is the need to address and overcome declining raw material supplies, to fully utilize available resources, and to take advantage of innovations in wood processing. A growing number of timber producers are facing raw material shortages and some wood processors are now operating below 50 percent of capacity. This problem is expected to worsen in the next several years. A method to produce particleboard from hardwood <b>sawmill</b> <b>residue</b> has been investigated at RMIT University, Australia. This work has proven that a particleboard made in laboratory has acceptable mechanical properties and density profiles in accordance to the Australian Standard. However, this board product required a high resin consumption, and a higher board density, inhibiting ready acceptance by the industry. The Ph. D research project presented here addressed this gap in knowledge and examined ways of optimising the new particleboard product. A feasibility and a cost benefit analysis was done to examine the elements of improvement needed. The research then focussed on examining the potential of optimising the board process parameters by using mixes of softwood and hardwood residue. Four series of experiments were carried out for this investigation. During the first and second series, it was revealed that mixes of hardwood and softwood would not improve board properties as expected. Analysis of the underlying reasons revealed that the observed reduction in strength is a result of over curing of hardwood particles when used in the surface layers. It was found that the acidic property of hardwood accelerates the UF resin curing which lead to uneven degree of curing throughout the board. The best configuration of hardwood and softwood throughout the board was found to be with softwood in the surface and hardwood in the core. After obtaining adequate hardwood/softwood configuration throughout the board, using the theory of experimental design, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effect of other processing parameters on the board properties. A process model was developed to predict board properties as a function of processing variables. A final optimised board which complies with the required properties of the AS/NZS standards and utilising up to 45 % hardwood residue was developed through the research program. Outcomes would lead to a reduction of the demand for custom flaked hardwood used in particleboard by replacing them up to 45 % by saw mill waste...|$|R

In Brazil, initiatives are being created to combine the use of <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> to pulp production. With this in mind, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of amedium-sized sawmill {{in the city of}} Rio Grande, in Rio Grande do Sul state, and to promote physical and chemical analysis of waste wood generated in the sawing process. It was used 20 logs of Pinus elliottii, divided into two diameter classes. The residues, except the sawdust, collected for analysis were disposed in the courtyard of the company in the form of chips. The following physical and chemical properties of the chips were examined: density, extractives content soluble in acetone, acetyl groups, soluble and insoluble lignin on acid (Klason lignin), uronic groups and carbohydrates. Comparing the results of the wood properties to the ones found in literature, it was evaluated {{the quantity and quality of}} waste that can be used as feedstock for the production of kraft pulp. As the main results there was a slight increase of sawing yields in the larger diameters logs compared to the smaller diameters. From the physical and chemical analyses, it was obtained the following results: density of 0. 402 g / cm ³, cellulose content of 43. 67 % and 24. 37 % for hemicellulose, klason lignin of 26. 75 % and 3, 80 % for extractives content.

In comparison, emissions of PM, carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from advanced wood combustion (AWC) systems, such as gasification, are considered to be an order of magnitude lower than conventional combustion systems. • The quantity and chemical composition of airborne pollutants emitted from biomass burning depends on combustion characteristics and operating conditions, such as complete combustion, more likely with AWC systems, which leads to lower levels of pollutants and likely lower toxicity.

40|$|This study {{consisted}} of in-depth techno-economic analyses of biofuel upgrading processes and of whole biotrade chains. The chains encompassed the production of pyrolysis oil or pellets from biomass residues in the source regions, the transportation of the upgraded fuels internationally over long distances and the final utilisation of the fuels. The techno-economic analysis of the biofuel upgrading processes was undertaken primarily to generate techno-economic data that were needed as input data {{for the assessment of}} the biotrade chains. The evaluation of pyrolysis-oil production was deemed {{to be one of the}} most reliable assessments made to date. The estimated pyrolysis-oil production costs, e. g. below 25 EUR/MWh for stand-alone production from forestry residues, compare favourably with the current consumer-prices of heavy fuel oil in many European countries. Integration of the pyrolysis process with an industrial combined heat and power (CHP) plant would lower the production costs by more than 20 %. The production of pellets was assessed to be somewhat more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient than the production of pyrolysis oil. However, the higher production costs of pyrolysis oil would be counteracted by lower costs in connection with product handling and utilisation. Four international biotrade chains were analysed in detail. The chains cover two source regions, North-Western Russia and Eastern Canada, and two traded commodities, pyrolysis oil and pellets. The chains terminate in the Netherlands where the imported biofuels are co-fired with coal in condensing power stations. The costs of the delivered biofuels were estimated to be in the range 18 - 30 EUR/MWh, with the costs of pellets about 25 % lower than those of pyrolysis oil. The estimated electricity-generation costs displayed little dependence on the type of biofuel - pyrolysis oil or pellets - because the costs associated with the utilisation of the biofuels for co-firing are higher for the pellets. For the Canada-Netherlands chains based on zero-cost <b>sawmilling</b> <b>residues,</b> the costs of the delivered biofuels were estimated to be about 20 % lower, and the electricity-generation costs about 10 % lower, than those of the Russia-Netherlands chains. With the electricity consumption calculated as the equivalent amount of fuel that would be needed for its generation, the energy consumptions of the biotrade chains, prior to the end-use of the bioftiels, were estimated to be in the range 13 - 23 % of the energy content of the original biomass residues. Local-utilisation alternatives were also evaluated. It was concluded that, particularly when the local reference energy system is carbon intensive, local utilisation can be a more cost-efficient and a more resource-efficient option than international trade and use of biomass resources elsewhere. This type of comparison is, however, very dependent on both the greenhouse-gas emission intensities and the costs of the reference energy systems in the exporting and importing regions. In practice, there are many factors which may limit local utilisation or make utilisation of biomass resources elsewhere more attractive. Obviously, when increased local utilisation is not feasible, exporting surplus biofuel is a highly beneficial and fully justified option. Other drivers for international bio-energy trade, such as improving access to markets, developing biomass production potentials over time and securing stable supply and demand, fuel supply security and other issues were not part of the present work programme.

Thus, it is necessary to examine which framework should be used to conduct an evaluation. Post-harvesting reforestation is essential to achieve net carbon emission reduction effects by substituting the concrete check dam with the timber check dam.

Case studies {{were conducted in}} Kenya to identify these opportunities by (i) defining the energy demand and supply structure to identify markets; (ii) evaluating the biomass resources available; and (iii) identifying the availability of other facilities required for such a system. At the same time, the yield potential of 12 SRF species, planted in Palmerston North, New Zealand in small plots at 3470 stems/ha and harvested after 2, 3, 4 and 5 years was evaluated. Samples were collected from each species to determine their energy properties. Data on tree growth, yield, and biomass properties were used to develop two multi-objective indices - the relative yield index (RYI) and the fuelwood value index (FVI) for evaluating SRF species. Biomass from the 4 year rotation harvest was used as feedstock to fuel a downdraft air gasifier rated 35 kW (electric). Feedstock gasification processes, gas quantity and quality were correlated with the biomass properties to define {{the characteristics of a}} good fuelwood species for gasification purposes. The Kenyan studies highlighted constraints in the energy sector and identified opportunities for new bioenergy technologies. Small scale biomass gasification systems showed potential but suitable sites were restricted to <b>sawmills</b> where processing <b>residues</b> could be used as gasifier feedstock. Field trials of SRF systems were recommended to evaluate tree species over different silvicultural treatments, and to intensify biomass production. A demonstration plant at one of the bigger sawmills was recommended to stimulate interest among investors. Species yields of the trial plantings in New Zealand in the 12 species assessed ranged from 6 ODt/ha/y for Alnus glutinosa to 73 ODt/ha/y for Eucalyptus globulus at 5 year rotations. A stocking density trial of E. saligna showed that 3, 500 stems/ha managed on 4 - 5 year rotations provided the highest yields. Though these yields may not be achieved in field plantings or in Kenya, the study demonstrated the feasibility and methodology that could be applied. Like yield, the bioenergy properties varied between species. Higher heating values ranged from 19. 6 - 20. 5 MJ/kg for wood, 17. 8 - 20. 6 MJ/kg for bark, and 19. 5 - 24. 1 MJ/kg for leaves. Gas yields varied between 1. 88 - 2. 89 g/g dry wood due mainly to moisture content variations which also affected the composition of the gas. Gas heating values varied from 4. 602 to 6. 112 MJ/Nm 3, and were considered to be of sufficient quality to fuel internal combustion engines. Both RYI and FVI showed that yield factors outweighed bioenergy properties when identifying a good fuelwood species. The large differences in yields indicated the benefits that could be achieved by selecting appropriate species for a specific region.

The Japanese government hopes to be able to address this concern by generating jobs through the establishment of “Biomass Town Project” under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF). The planned project targets the reutilization of more than 90 % of wastes and the effective utilization of more than 40 % of biomass from lumber and forest residues. To support this target, the government had already mobilized more than 300 municipalities all over Japan. However, speciﬁc properties of biomass such as bulkiness and low energy per unit density cause some difﬁculties in their collection and handling. These entail high costs in transporting biomass to other places from generation areas. Utilization of biomass in areas where it was produced will develop and activate the locality through employment generation. It will also relieve other areas from receiving wastes generated elsewhere under the precept, “local production for local consumption. ” This is a good reason to get some public support to construct sustainable society. 　Located northwest of Mie Prefecture, Iga City’s major industry is agriculture, such as, stockbreeding and forestry. Under the “Biomass Town Projects”, Iga City in 2008 proposed to undertake “Rape-seed oil project” (Iga Nanohana project) to the National government in order to attract young people to repopulate the area and reinvigorate the aging population. 　One of essential features of this project is the creation of renewable energy from used vegetable oil and the rape-seed oil as biodiesel fuel (BDF) for agricultural machineries. And unlike the biodisel fuel (BDF) from EU which was synthesized from vegetable oils (sun ﬂower, rape seed), the BDF in Japan is synthesized from kitchen waste oils. This explains the high production of BDF (several thousands liters per cycle) in EU compared to very low production in Japan (average of 100 liters per cycle). The exception is Kyoto City-Hall, a model on the use of BDF from recycled vegetable oils, which produces from 50 ～ 200 L/cycle. 　The BDF processors in Japan are called as “Community scaled BDF-Processor” which are usually enterprising cities, towns and villages or a small business without know-how and technical skills in BDF production. To help Iga City hall make BDF effectively, Mie University and Mie Prefectural Environmental Institute participated in this project starting from the planning stage. This report outlined the Iga-nanohana project and current status of BDF production from the BDF-Processor in local area. 　Currently, we are investigating BDF production from used oil but our future plans include exploration of other BDF sources such as phytoplankton, Jathropa and other potential materials for biofuel production. Taking care of the terrestrial environment through zero emission programs is a step that can be taken to control or even prevent the {{negative impact}} of land-based activities to the coastal environment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> {{produced}} in wood processing of Pilon (Hyeronimaalchorneoides) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp) species, {{were used to}} fabricate pellets with experimental design equipment. Different manufacturing conditions as the diameter (8 mm − 10 mm), compression force (300 kgf − 500 kgf) and temperature applied during densification (90 °C − 105 °C), were employed in order to evaluate its effect on unit density, bulk density and durability of pellets produced. Values between 0. 856 kg/dm 3 and 1. 093 kg/dm 3 for unit density, 480. 0 kg/m 3 and 603. 0 kg/m 3 for bulk density were determined. For durability, values between 96. 1 % and 97. 5 % were determined. Significant increase in values determined for unit and bulk density were founded, with diameter reduction and compressive force increasing. Durability was the least sensitive property {{to the effect of}} studied densification conditions, whose variation was not significant between similar densification treatments. The effect of temperature generally had less impact on physical properties evaluated. The comparison of results against European standards for wood pellet quality, showed that fabricated pellets fulfills values defined for physical properties in different categories.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} and fossil fuel reserves exhaustion are increasing {{the importance of}} the biomass-derived products, in particular wood, as source of clean and renewable energy for the production of electricity or steam. In order to improve the global efficiency and the entire production chain, we have to evaluate the energetic aspects linked to the process of transformation, handling and transport of these materials. This paper reports results on a comparison between two chippers of similar size using different cutting technology: disc and drum tool respectively. During trials, fuel consumption, PTO torque and speed, processing time and weight of processed material were recorded. Power demand, fuel consumption, specific energy and productivity were computed. The machine was fed with four different feedstock types (chestnut logs, poplar logs, poplar branches, poplar <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues).</b> 15 repetitions for each combination of feedstock-tool were carried out. The results of this study show that the disc tool requires, depending on the processed material, from 12 to 18 % less fuel per unit of material processed than the drum tool, and consequently, from 12 to 16 % less specific energy. In particular, the highest difference between tools was found in branches processing whereas the smallest was in poplar logs. Furthermore the results of the investigation indicate, that, in testing conditions, the productivity of drum tool is higher (8 %) than disc tool...|$|E
40|$|Thermochemical biomass {{conversion}} systems {{have the potential}} to produce heat, power, fuels and other products from forest biomass at distributed scales that meet the needs of some forest industry facilities. However, many of these systems have not been deployed in this sector and the products they produce from forest biomass have not been adequately described or characterized with regards to chemical properties, possible uses, and markets. This paper characterizes the producer gas, biochar, and activated carbon of a 700 kg h&# 8722; 1 prototype gasification system and a 225 kg h&# 8722; 1 pyrolysis system used to process coniferous sawmill and forest residues. Producer gas from <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> processed with the gasifier had higher energy content than gas from forest residues, with averages of 12. 4 MJ m&# 8722; 3 and 9. 8 MJ m&# 8722; 3, respectively. Gases from the pyrolysis system averaged 1. 3 MJ m&# 8722; 3 for mill residues and 2. 5 MJ m&# 8722; 3 for forest residues. Biochars produced have similar particle size distributions and bulk density, but vary in pH and carbon content. Biochars from both systems were successfully activated using steam activation, with resulting BET surface area in the range of commercial activated carbon. Results are discussed in the context of co-locating these systems with forest industry operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of wood to yield such varied products as paper, paperboard, lumber, plywood, and reconstituted building board {{ranks among the}} ten largest industrial activi-ties in the United States. To produce paper or paperboard, the wood is first pulped. Pulps are made from wood chips, whole tree chips, <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues,</b> or logs. Pulps can be produced through chemical or mechanical means or {{by a combination of}} both. The pulp may then be bleached to various degrees of brightness. Finally, bleached or un-bleached pulp is processed into thick sheets of paperboard or paper. The manufacture of building boards, with a few exceptions, involves processing the wood itself into sheets or boards, with the aid of adhesives. The following material is intended to provide a broad overview of selected segments of the wood processing in-dustry. The production process, atmospheric emissions, and emission control technologies employed are described for (l), several chemical wood pulping processes, (2) mechani-cal wood pulping processes, and (3) paper and paperboard manufacture. It should be recognized that this manual only provides information on the most common manufacturing processes and control technologies. There are a large num-ber of variations of the basic processes and control systems; thus the descriptions here are necessarily generic in nature.

40|$|Australia {{is heavily}} reliant on fossil fuels, {{particularly}} coal, for electricity production, {{but is now}} encouraging expansion of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Plantation forests are a potential source of biomass for renewable bioenergy. This study examines the potential GHG emission reduction from bioenergy utilising thinning, harvest and <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> from plantation forests in northern NSW. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, two alternative energy conversion options were compared: co-firing in black coal power plants located distant from the plantation region, or in stand-alone wood-fired plants located within the plantation region. Emission reduction per ha, and per unit electricity produced were calculated for two levels of plantation productivity. The potential emission reduction from forestry in Northern NSW was estimated using published predictions of future expansion of plantations in this region. Co-firing gave higher emissions reduction per ha, and per unit of biomass, due to the greater efficiency of energy conversion by co-firing. However, co-firing gave lower emissions reduction per MWh, compared with the wood-fired option, due to the greater fossil fuel input required for transport. The emission reduction benefits of the wood-fired plants would increase, and possibly surpass the co-fired option, if high efficiency IGCC technology was employed. The potential biomass production from 180 000 ha plantations in northern NSW {{was estimated to be}} 2. 03 Mt dry matter per annum. The potential power output was estimated at 3090 GWhe per annum from co-firing, or 2120 GWhe pa for the wood-fired option, giving net GHG emission reduction of 2. 63 Mt CO 2 e and 1. 93 Mt CO 2 e per annum for the co-fired and wood-fired alternatives, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Biomass energy can be {{important}} in meeting the heating needs of facilities that currently depend on fossil fuels. The Kenai Peninsula region of Alaska has abundant forest resources, which include {{a substantial amount of}} spruce (Picea spp.) wood killed by bark beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby)). This region of Alaska holds promise for the development of biomass energy projects not only because of its timber resources but also the presence of an existing timber industry (both processing and logging infrastructure). Salvaged material could be used to produce energy to heat buildings, although its longterm supply might be questionable. Many sawmill facilities in the region would be well positioned to supply wood wastes for fuel if the availability of beetle-killed wood declines. This paper evaluates the economic feasibility of using local forest and <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues</b> to supply a wood-fired hot water system that would provide space heating or process heat at a centrally located site within the Kenai Peninsula. In the Kenai Peninsula, there are about 10 to 15 sawmill facilities currently producing an estimated 4. 5 million board feet (MMBF) of lumber per year, primarily spruce (Kilborn 2000, Parrent 2000 b). During the past several decades, improved technologies in Pacific Northwest sawmills [...] -including thinner sawkerfs, smaller green lumber target sizes, and more accurate log positioning systems [...] -have resulted in higher lumber recovery along with corresponding reductions in residue production (Keegan et al., n. d.). Although mill technologies and lumber recovery rates in Alaska are likely not at the same level as mills in the Pacific Northwest, recent work has assessed the lumber recovery of sawmills in most regions of Alaska (Kilborn, in press). Based on the sawing effi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Finland {{considers}} {{energy production}} from woody biomass as an efficient energy planning strategy {{to increase the}} domestic renewable energy production in order to substitute fossil fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, a number of developmental activities are implemented in the country, {{and one of them}} is the installation of second generation liquid biofuel demonstration plants. In this study, two gasification-based biomass conversion technologies, methanol and combined heat and power (CHP) production, are assessed for commercialization. Spatial information on forest resources, <b>sawmill</b> <b>residues,</b> existing biomass-based industries, energy demand regions, possible plant locations, and a transport network of Eastern Finland is fed into a geographically explicit Mixed Integer programming model to minimize the costs of the entire supply chain which includes the biomas supply, biomass and biofuel transportation, biomass conversion, energy distribution, and emissions. The model generates a solution by determining the optimal number, locations, and technology mix of bioenergy production plants. Scenarios were created with a focus on biomass and energy demand, plant characteristics, and cost variations. The model results state that the biomass supply and high energy demand are found to have a profound influence on the potential bioenergy production plant locations. The results show that methanol can be produced in Eastern Finland under current market conditions at an average cost of 0. 22 Euro/l with heat sales (0. 34 Euro/l without heat sales). The introduction of energy policy tools, like cost for carbon, showed a significant influence on the choice of technology and CO 2 emission reductions. The results revealed that the methanol technology was preferred over the CHP technology at higher carbon dioxide cost (> 145 Euro/tCO 2). The results indicate that two methanol plants (360 MW biomass) are needed to be built to meet the transport fuel demand of Eastern Finland...|$|E
