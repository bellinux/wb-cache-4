50|$|The journal was {{originally}} simply typed and printed by Sciences Nat {{on a small}} <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicating</b> <b>machine</b> which was rotated by hand with a crank. From 1974, it was produced by photocopying on a Rank Xerox machine. In 1977, a small Gestetner duplicator was obtained. During this time, pages were simply stapled together. From 1978 the typing was done on a Varityper which made it necessary to type the whole text twice. In 1979 a more advanced offset printer allowed colours printing for the first time. In 1980, 8 colour plates were produced which placed it {{at the head of}} entomological journals worldwide judged by quality of the illustrations. From 1984, the Bulletin was printed by a professional company. Each issue had from 8 (first issue) to 60 pages (double issue 75-76). Some errors also occurred: all pages of issue 80 are marked 79. Nearly all the articles were written in French, nearly all with figures, and (after 1980) most of them with colour photos.|$|R

Zuccato’s system involved writing {{on a sheet of}} varnished paper with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been. This sheet - which had now become a stencil - was placed on a blank sheet of paper, and ink rolled over it so that the ink oozed through the holes, creating a duplicate on the second sheet.|$|R
