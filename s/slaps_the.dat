500|$|Freelance writer Dan Vebber, who {{is known}} for his work on the {{animated}} series Futurama, wrote [...] "The Book Job" [...] with contributions from the staff writers on The Simpsons. Matt Selman, an executive producer and writer on The Simpsons, was the one who conceived of the idea behind the episode. He was inspired by an article in The New Yorker about the book packaging company Alloy Entertainment—the publisher of series such as Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries—and the company's use of ghostwriters. According to Selman, the article [...] "was all about how these executives take market research and come up with the ideas for these books and farms them out and <b>slaps</b> <b>the</b> name of fake writers on them and fabricates backgrounds for these authors who don’t exist. We took that trend and kind of blew it up and shoved it in the face of Lisa".|$|E
500|$|When Charlie Evans {{is brought}} {{on board the}} Enterprise in the episode [...] "Charlie X", he falls for Rand. She is older than the {{adolescent}} boy and attempts to dissuade his affections by introducing him to Yeoman Tina Lawton. But he declares his feelings for Rand. Concerned, Rand seeks {{the advice of the}} Captain who intervenes and involves Evans in some sparring practice. After he falls over, he reveals his powers to make people disappear when one of the other sparring partners laughs at him. Charlie takes control of the ship, and goes to Rand's quarters with a rose. She refuses his approach; Spock and Kirk arrive but Charlie attacks them, and Rand <b>slaps</b> <b>the</b> boy. In response, he makes her vanish. It is only after a Thasian vessel appears that the Enterprise and Rand are returned to normal, as Charlie is taken away by the aliens.|$|E
5000|$|The slapper is on offense, and {{attempts}} to bring his hands over to <b>slap</b> <b>the</b> backsides of his opponent's hands. This must be done with sufficient speed, because the slappee's goal is to pull their hands away, {{and out of the}} area where the hands overlap, to avoid <b>the</b> <b>slap.</b> If <b>the</b> slapper misses the hands of the slappee during <b>the</b> <b>slap,</b> then <b>the</b> roles switch.|$|R

2500|$|Wolverine {{appears in}} Deadpool, again voiced by Steve Blum.

He appears unaware that he is in a game, given his response to Deadpool stating that he was setting up a surprise for the player. Deadpool apparently calls constantly to ask if he can take the Blackbird out for a joyride.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson and Young {{went to the}} {{shooting}} location–a park–to do a test film, which essentially involved them [...] "mucking about, 'Tangoing' each other;" [...] as they [...] "messed around" [...] they decided the [...] "little slap" [...] just wasn't powerful enough, so they exaggerated it; Robinson recalled that [...] "if you watch the ad, the Orange Man's arms go way back before he <b>slaps</b> <b>the</b> person in the face." [...] Seminal American jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of [...] "his deep, charismatic voice;" [...] Scott-Heron {{was the first person}} to see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, he loved it.|$|E

6000|$|The {{passion for}} playing chess {{is one of}} the most unaccountable in the world. It <b>slaps</b> <b>the</b> theory of natural {{selection}} in the face. It is the most absorbing of occupations, the least satisfying of desires, an aimless excrescence upon life. It annihilates a man. You have, let us say, a promising politician, a rising artist, that you wish to destroy. Dagger or bomb are archaic, clumsy, and unreliable--but teach him, inoculate him with chess! It is well, perhaps, that the right way of teaching chess is so little known, that consequently in most cases the plot fails in the performance, the dagger turns aside. Else we should all be chess-players--there would be none left to do the business of the world. Our statesmen would sit with pocket boards while the country went to the devil, our army would bury itself in chequered contemplation, our bread-winners would forget their wives in seeking after impossible mates. The whole world would be disorganised. I can fancy this abominable hypnotism so wrought into the constitution of men that the cabmen would go trying to drive their horses in Knights' moves up and down Charing Cross Road. And now and again a suicide would come to hand with the pathetic inscription pinned to his chest: [...] "I checked with my Queen too soon. I cannot bear the thought of it." [...] There is no remorse like the remorse of chess.|$|E
