The W–F bond distances are 183.2 pm. Between 2.3 and 17°C, tungsten hexafluoride condenses into a pale yellow liquid having {{the density of}} 3.44 g/cm3 at 15°C. At 2.3°C it freezes into a white solid having a cubic crystalline structure, the lattice constant of 628 pm and calculated density 3.99 g/cm3. At −9°C this structure transforms into an orthorhombic solid with the lattice constants of a= 960.3 pm, b= 871.3 pm, and c= 504.4 pm, and the density of 4.56 g/cm3. In this phase, the W–F distance is 181 pm, and the mean closest intermolecular contacts are 312 pm. Whereas WF6 gas {{is one of the}} heaviest gases, with the density exceeding that of the heaviest elemental gas radon (9.73 g/L), the density of WF6 in the liquid and solid state is rather moderate.|$|E

Global inconsistency condition is recently proposed as a milder condition but {{is expected to}} play an almost same role by comparing high <b>symmetry</b> <b>points</b> in the theory space. In order to clarify the consequence coming from this new condition, we discuss several quantum mechanical models with topological angles and explicitly compute their energy spectra.

40|$|Two phonon {{selection}} {{rules for}} Raman and infrared processes are given for crystals having the caesium chloride structure. The selection rules are {{quite similar to}} that of the rocksalt structure, favourable for second order Raman scattering processes and quite severe for the second order infrared processes. With the help of the theoretical dispersion curves it is shown that the second order Raman spectra of CsBr and CsI can be accounted for in terms of phonon pairs at <b>symmetry</b> <b>points</b> in the s. c. Brillouin zone. Each of the observed peaks is found to arise from several phonon pairs at the different <b>symmetry</b> <b>points.</b> The many contributions to the observed peaks together with the high polarizability of the caesium and halogen ions account for the relatively high intensity of the spectrum.

40|$|We {{compute the}} moments of the {{characteristic}} polynomials of random orthogonal and symplectic matrices, defined by averages with respect to Haar mea-sure on SO(2 N) and U Sp(2 N), to leading order as N → ∞, on the unit circle as functions of the angle θ measured {{from one of the}} two <b>symmetry</b> <b>points</b> in the eigen-value spectrum {exp(±iθn) } 1 ≤n≤N. Our results extend previous formulae that relate just to the <b>symmetry</b> <b>points,</b> i. e. to θ = 0. Local spectral statistics are expected to converge to those of random unitary matrices in the limit as N → ∞ when θ is fixed, and to show a transition from the orthogonal or symplectic to the unitary forms on the scale of the mean eigenvalue spacing: if θ = πy/N they become functions of y in the limit when N → ∞. We verify that this is true for the spectral two-point correlation function, but show that it is not true for {{the moments of}} the characteristic polynomials, for which the leading order asymptotic approximation is a function of θ rather than y. <b>Symmetry</b> <b>points</b> therefore influence the moments asymptotically far away on the scale of the mean eigenvalue spacing.
