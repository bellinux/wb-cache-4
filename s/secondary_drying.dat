50|$|Freeze-drying - This process {{involves}} dehydration {{of materials}} that are heat-sensitive. Unlike spray drying, water is removed through the sublimation process without changing the structure or shape of the nanoparticles.

50|$|Manifold freeze-dryers {{are usually}} {{used in a}} {{laboratory}} setting when drying liquid substances in small containers and when the product {{will be used in}} a short period of time.

50|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>drying</b> phase aims {{to remove}} unfrozen water molecules, since the ice was removed {{in the primary}} drying phase.

Usually the pressure is also lowered in this stage to encourage desorption (typically in the range of microbars, or fractions of a pascal). However, there are products that benefit from increased pressure as well.|$|E

So as to track the evolution of residual moisture during <b>secondary</b> <b>drying,</b> vials were regularly collected through a vacuum-tight sampling device; the residual moisture and the morphology of the porous cake was then determined by Karl Fischer titration and Scanning Electron Microscopy, respectively. The control of freezing promotes the formation of larger ice crystals and, as a result, accelerates the sublimation of ice and slows down the desorption process. Overall, we found that it reduces the total (primary and <b>secondary)</b> <b>drying</b> time and produces much more uniform batches than those obtained by the conventional freezing, and this positive effect was observed since the end of primary drying.

This study describes for the first time the application of Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy, a spectroscopic and noninvasive sensor for monitoring <b>secondary</b> <b>drying</b> in laboratory-scale freeze drying with the overall purpose of targeting intermediate moisture contents in the product. Bovine serum albumin/sucrose mixtures were used as a model system to imitate high concentrated antibody formulations. First, the rate of water desorption during <b>secondary</b> <b>drying</b> at constant product temperatures (− 22 °C, − 10 °C, and 0 °C) was investigated for three different shelf temperatures. Residual moisture contents of sampled vials were determined by Karl Fischer titration. An equilibration step was implemented to ensure homogeneous distribution of moisture (within 1 %) in all vials. The residual moisture revealed a linear relationship to the water desorption rate for different temperatures, allowing the evaluation of an anchor point from noninvasive flow rate measurements without removal of samples from the freeze dryer. The accuracy of mass flow integration from this anchor point was found to be about 0. 5 %. In a second step, the concept was successfully tested in a confirmation experiment. Here, good agreement was found for the initial moisture content (anchor point) and the subsequent monitoring and targeting of intermediate moisture contents.

40|$|Abstract: When {{agricultural}} {{lands in}} formerly dry forest are abandoned, chronic disturbance by livestock grazing and wood extraction may set back successional processes precluding older dry forest structure from be reached. We compare cacti density, richness, diversity and evenness in twelve 50 × 50 m plots: six plots in <b>secondary</b> <b>dry</b> forest and six plots in older conserved dry forest at Sierra de Huautla, Central Mexico. Cacti were identifi ed, the life-form of each species was recorded and size was measured to assign individuals into four life-stage classes. Nine cacti species were registered across both forest types. In this dry forest, richness, diversity and evenness of cacti community increased in sites under chronic disturbance, whereas density was not signi-fi cantly affected. Size structure at community {{level in the}} conserved forest showed an increase of individuals with size, whereas in the secondary forest, size structure showed an uneven distribution of individuals, as in populations that regenerate by pulses. In the secondary forest, there was a lower proportion of adults {{and they were in}} average, smaller than those in the conserved forest. Chronic disturbance may eventually change cacti community structure, affecting animals that depend on large arboreal cacti for food, perches and/or refuge; therefore, maintenance of biodiversity will be at stake.

40|$|In recent years, special {{attention}} has been given to freezing and its control. As a matter of fact, freezing suffers from the same challenges as primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>drying,</b> from performance in specific formulations to reproducibility and batch uniformity. These challenges are made further critical if we account for the fact that potential problems in freezing impact on the product behavior during both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>drying,</b> on product morphology, as well as on intra-vial and vial-to-vial heterogeneity. Recent literature showed that the control of temperature at which nucleation occurs is beneficial to primary drying time, but also to batch uniformity [1]. In this study, we investigate how the control of nucleation temperature, and particularly the use of Vacuum Induced Surface Freezing (VISF), can effectively reduce the total cycle time, minimize batch heterogeneity, and improve intra-vial uniformity [3]. This last aspect is not secondary to the previous advantages as uncontrolled freezing can promote a non-uniform distribution of the active ingredient within the lyophilized product and potentially their aggregation/denaturation [4].

In addition, a laboratory experiment was done in order to assess millipede feeding preferences regarding the chemical characteristics of leaves from various species. Millipede abundance and species richness were significantly higher under P. subcordata than under B. simaruba, probably due to the higher N content of P. subcordata leaves. Moreover, millipedes fed preferentially on N-rich leaves.

Tropical forests {{are important in}} the global carbon cycle but questions remain about the distribution of carbon stocks and the controls over carbon cycle processes in these forests. This is especially true with tropical dry forests which comprise as much as 43 % of global tropical forests, but have been studied less and impacted more by human activities. In many areas, tropical dry forests are recovering from clearing and few studies have investigated the carbon cycle implications of this increasing area of <b>secondary</b> tropical <b>dry</b> forests. This dissertation describes three projects that examined the global, regional, and stand-scale patterns of carbon uptake and storage in <b>secondary</b> tropical <b>dry</b> forests. In Chapter 2, I reviewed literature on carbon stocks in mature and <b>secondary</b> tropical <b>dry</b> forests {{around the world and}} analyzed the global contribution of these forests. I found that carbon stocks in mature tropical dry forests increased linearly with mean annual precipitation and I conclude that restoring tropical dry forest could make a significant global contribution to climate change mitigation. In Chapter 3, I studied landscape level controls of aboveground biomass and plant functional trait distributions in <b>secondary</b> tropical <b>dry</b> forests of northwestern Costa Rica. I found that edaphic factors, and plant functional traits explain little additional variation in biomass after accounting for stand age but that the dominant plant traits in a community are well correlated with succession and soil properties. I conclude that plant trait distributions indicate soil and succession driven changes in stand level function, but that these changes are not reflected in the landscape scale distribution of biomass. In Chapter 4, I measured aboveground net primary productivity in 18 secondary forest plots in northwestern Costa Rica over three years. I found that large inter-annual differences in precipitation do not significantly affect ANPP and that variation in litterfall and biomass among our plots is explained by different factors.

This study investigates the relationship between herbivory and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in Poincianella pyramidalis in two contrasting habitat types in the Brazilian caatinga (shrublands). We tested the following hypotheses: that FA occurs in P. pyramidalis; that FA of P. pyramidalis leaves is greater in individuals located in pasture than in those located in <b>secondary</b> tropical <b>dry</b> forest; that herbivory by insects (leaf chewers and leaf miners) increases in parallel with increases in the level of FA; and that herbivory is more common in pasture than in <b>secondary</b> tropical <b>dry</b> forest.

From a management standpoint, when new trails are clearing into intact, native-dominated forest, they should be carefully monitored for the spread of invasive species, and controlling their seed sources may be helpful in minimizing invasion.
