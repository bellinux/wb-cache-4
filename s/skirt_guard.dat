25|$|The ladies' {{version of}} the roadster's design {{was very much in}} place by the 1890s. It had a step-through frame rather than the diamond frame of the gentlemen's model so that ladies, with their dresses and skirts, could easily mount and ride their bicycles, and {{commonly}} came with a <b>skirt</b> <b>guard</b> to prevent skirts and dresses becoming entangled in the rear wheel and spokes. As with the gents' roadster, the frame was of steel construction and the positioning of the frame and handlebars gave the rider a very upright riding position. Though they originally came with front spoon-brakes, technological advancements meant that later models were equipped with the much-improved coaster brakes or rod-actuated rim or drum-brakes.|$|E

50|$|The shell {{jacket was}} first {{introduced}} to European armies {{toward the end of}} the 18th Century. Up to then, soldiers, infantry, cavalry and artillery had worn open dress uniform coats with turn-back lapels over either coloured or white sleeved-waistcoats and breeches. The advent of closed uniform coatees, i.e. waist- length jackets with standing collars and tails, buttoned from throat to waist, meant that sleeved waistcoats could not be worn underneath and therefore fell redundant. However, in order to save damage or staining to dress coatees while on fatigue duties, etc., a new, relatively plain coloured waist-length jacket was introduced. The term “shell” jacket is of British origin, appearing during the 1790s, when Light Dragoons adopted a dark blue short jacket with a decorative sleeveless over- jacket, or “shell” on top. Though short-lived, the name stuck and was later to be applied to short, sleeved fatigue jackets from about 1800. Through the British Army adopted coloured shell jackets (red for infantry and heavy cavalry, dark blue for artillery and light cavalry), Foot-Guards and Highland regiments adopted a white shell-jacket, referred to as a sleeved-waistcoat. During the first half of the 19th Century, the British Army wore dress coatees in battle against European or American enemies, but tended to wear shell jackets on colonial campaigns. However, the shell jacket was discontinued by the British in the 1870s (other than by certain cavalry regiments) in favour of a second, plainer <b>skirted</b> tunic. <b>Guards</b> and Highland regiments continued to wear white shell jackets for “walking out” until 1914.|$|R

50|$|A skirtguard {{prevents}} winter or flowing spring clothing {{from getting}} {{caught in the}} area where many features converge: the back brake, O-lock, and spokes. The skirtguard and O-lock form an integrated system. The O-lock catches clothing, so the skirtguard is needed to compensate. The O-lock passes {{through a hole in the}} <b>skirt</b> <b>guard.</b> The traditional, old-fashioned city bike has a solid (opaque) fabric <b>skirt</b> <b>guard,</b> while the contemporary European city bike has a clear plastic guard.|$|E
50|$|A <b>skirt</b> <b>guard</b> (or coatguard) allows {{using the}} bike with normal clothes, {{for both the}} main rider and a {{passenger}} riding on the back rack. The <b>skirt</b> <b>guard</b> helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, cloak, dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and chaincase. It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>skirt</b> <b>guard,</b> dress guard or coat {{guard is}} a device fitted over {{the rear wheel}} of a bicycle to prevent a long skirt, coat or other {{trailing}} clothes or luggage catching in the wheel, or in {{the gap between the}} rim and the brakes.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary city {{bikes are}} {{increasingly}} {{found in many}} European cities, including Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear <b>skirt</b> <b>guard,</b> colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front suspension fork, suspension seatpost, Hub dynamo, dynamo lighting with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable kickstand, child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork. Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a less is more philosophy.|$|E
50|$|Utility {{bicycles}} often {{feature a}} step-through frame {{so they can}} be easily mounted, single speed, or with internal hub gearing, and drum brakes to reduce the need for maintenance, mudguards to keep the rider's clothing clean, a chain guard to prevent skirts or loose trousers from being caught in the chain, a <b>skirt</b> <b>guard</b> to prevent a long coat or skirt catching in the rear wheel or brakes, a center stand kickstand so it can be parked easily, and a basket or pannier rack to carry personal possessions or shopping bags.|$|E

Since by then it was the British who had the strongest and best-developed market in bike design, Dutch framemakers either copied them or imported them from England. In 1895, 85 per cent of all bikes bought in the Netherlands were from Britain; the vestiges of that influence can still be seen in the solid, gentlemanly shape of a traditional Dutch bike even now.|$|E
5000|$|Though the ladies' {{version of}} the {{roadster}} largely fell out of fashion in England and many other Western nations as the 20th century progressed, it remains popular in the Netherlands; this is why some people refer to bicycles of this design as Dutch bikes. In Dutch the name of these bicycles is Omafiets ("grandma's bike") though in Frisia they often call them Widdofyts (Frisian for [...] "widow's bike"). The classic Omafiets is still in production in the Netherlands and has changed little since 1911: {{it comes with a}} single-speed gear, 28 x 1½ (ISO 635) wheels, black painted frame and mudguards (with white-blazoning {{at the back of the}} rear one), and a rear <b>skirt</b> <b>guard.</b> Modern variants, be they painted in other colours, with aluminium frames, drum-brakes or multiple gear ratios in a hub gearing system, will all conform to the same basic look and dimensions as the classic Omafiets. (The Dutch gentlemen's equivalent is called the Opafiets (Dutch for [...] "grandpa's bike") or Stadsfiets ("city bike") and generally has the same characteristics but with a [...] "diamond" [...] or [...] "gents'" [...] frame, thereby much the same as the gentleman's English roadster.) ...|$|E
