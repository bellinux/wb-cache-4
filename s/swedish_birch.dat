40|$|Birch pollen grains {{are known}} to be ice {{nucleating}} active biological particles. The ice nucleating activity has previously been tracked down to biological macromolecules that can be easily extracted from the pollen grains in water. In the present study, we investigated the immersion freezing behavior of these ice nucleating active (INA) macromolecules. Therefore we measured the frozen fractions of particles generated from birch pollen washing water as a function of temperature at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS). Two different birch pollen samples were considered, with one originating from Sweden and one from the Czech Republic. For the Czech and <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> pollen samples, freezing was observed to start at − 19 and − 17 °C, respectively. The fraction of frozen droplets increased for both samples down to − 24 °C. Further cooling did not increase the frozen fractions any more. Instead, a plateau formed at frozen fractions below 1. This fact could be used to determine the amount of INA macromolecules in the droplets examined here, which in turn allowed for the determination of nucleation rates for single INA macromolecules. The main differences between the <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> pollen and the Czech birch pollen were obvious in the temperature range between − 17 and − 24 °C. In this range, a second plateau region could be seen for <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> pollen. As we assume INA macromolecules to be the reason for the ice nucleation, we concluded that birch pollen is able to produce at least two different types of INA macromolecules. We were able to derive parameterizations for the heterogeneous nucleation rates for both INA macromolecule types, using two different methods: a simple exponential fit and the Soccer ball model. With these parameterization methods we were able to describe the ice nucleation behavior of single INA macromolecules from both the Czech and the <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> pollen...|$|E

40|$|Current {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} proxy for Earth’s surface ultraviolet-B (UV-B) flux focus on the organic chemistry of pollen and spores because their constituent biopolymer, sporopollenin, contains UV-B absorbing pigments whose relative abundance may respond to the ambient UV-B flux. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy provides {{a useful tool for}} rapidly determining the pigment content of spores. In this paper, we use FTIR to detect a chemical response of spore wall UV-B absorbing pigments that correspond with levels of shade beneath the canopy of a high-latitude <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> forest. A 27 % reduction in UV-B flux beneath the canopy leads to a significant (p < 0. 05) 7. 3 % reduction in concentration of UV-B absorbing compounds in sporopollenin. The field data from this natural flux gradient in UV-B further support our earlier work on sporopollenin-based proxies derived from sedimentary records and herbaria collections...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the impact of {{changing}} temperature regimes on composition and diversity of cryptogam communities in the Arctic and Subarctic, despite the well-known importance of lichens and bryophytes to the functioning and climate feedbacks of northern ecosystems. We investigated changes in diversity and abundance of lichens and bryophytes within long-term (9 – 16 years) warming experiments and along natural climatic gradients, ranging from <b>Swedish</b> subarctic <b>birch</b> forest and subarctic/subalpine tundra to Alaskan arctic tussock tundra. In both Sweden and Alaska, lichen diversity responded negatively to experimental warming (with the exception of a birch forest) and to higher temperatures along climatic gradients. Bryophytes were less sensitive to experimental warming than lichens, but depending on the length of the gradient, bryophyte diversity decreased both with increasing temperatures and at extremely low temperatures. Among bryophytes, Sphagnum mosses were particularly resistant to experimental warming in terms of both abundance and diversity. Temperature, on both continents, was the main driver of species composition within experiments and along gradients, {{with the exception of the}} <b>Swedish</b> subarctic <b>birch</b> forest where amount of litter constituted the best explanatory variable. In a warming experiment in moist acidic tussock tundra in Alaska, temperature together with soil ammonium availability were the most important factors influencing species composition. Overall, dwarf shrub abundance (deciduous and evergreen) was positively related to warming but so were the bryophytes Sphagnum girgensohnii, Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi; the majority of other cryptogams showed a negative relationship to warming. This unique combination of intercontinental comparison, natural gradient studies and experimental studies shows that cryptogam diversity and abundance, especially within lichens, is likely to decrease under arctic climate warming. Given the many ecosystem processes affected by cryptogams in high latitudes (e. g. carbon sequestration, N 2 -fixation, trophic interactions), these changes will have important feedback consequences for ecosystem functions and climat...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAirway {{challenge}} with dsRNA {{is of interest}} since this agent acts on TLR 3 and mimics rhinoviral (RV) infection-induced interferons/cytokines. Contrasting frequent employment of dsRNA in epithelial cell cultures there is no information on effects of dsRNA administered to human airways in vivo. Here we explore effects of nasal dsRNA challenges in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis inside and outside <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> pollen season. MethodsWe examined effects of dsRNA in seven patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. By being studied {{both inside and outside}} of an active pollen season they served as their own controls. Based on pilot experiments a repeat dose regimen of dsRNA, 4  ×  100  μg, was given daily into the right nostril on two consecutive days; left nostril received corresponding saline challenges. Airway cells for gene analyses were obtained by nasal brushing shortly before the first challenge and 48  h after challenges. ResultsPollen counts and nasal symptoms indicated a significant season of allergic rhinitis. At the height of the pollen season, dsRNA challenges increased three antiviral proteins, interferons β and λ 1 and IL- 32, compared to saline challenges. By contrast, outside the pollen season dsRNA did not increase the expression of these antiviral proteins. dsRNA did not cause any symptoms outside the season nor did it increase the allergic symptoms evoked by natural pollen exposure. ConclusionThese findings suggest the possibility that active mucosal inflammation, induced by natural allergen exposure in human airways, transiently increases in vivo antiviral responsiveness of airway surface cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> pollen (BP) -allergic patients report hypersensitivity to some fruits, nuts and vegetables. Some BP-allergic patients complain ‘I can’t tolerate any fruit’. The main {{aim of the}} present study was to answer the question, ‘can BP-allergic patients tolerate some of the exotic fruit, not at present common in Sweden?’ Methods: Consecutive patients (n = 397) visiting the participating Allergy Clinics, who had a BP allergy and reported a food hypersensitivity, were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding 66 different fruits and vegetables. Subjects had three alternatives as an answer to each of the food questions: (i) ‘I tolerate it’; (ii) ‘I get symptoms from it’; or (iii) ‘I have not tried this food’. Skin prick tests were performed with pollen allergens. Results: Most patients had experienced reactions to several foods; only 31 patients (8 %) reported hypersensitivity to one food only. Some of the fruit had been tried by only a few patients. In addition to earlier well- known BP-related foods, more than 40 % of patients who had knowingly eaten Japanese pear and pomegranate said that they had experienced symptoms after eating the fruit. Most patients tolerated pineapple, melon, grapes and citrus fruits, as well as zucchini, lychee, rambutan, mangosteen, ugli, melon pear and cherimoya. Conclusions: Although an allergy to fruit is common among BP-allergic patients, there are several widely available fruits that most patients tolerate; for instance, pineapple, melon, grapes and citrus fruit.

40|$|Birch {{regarded}} as Sweden’s third largest tree species. The two birch species, Silver- and Downy birch represents about 12 % of total Swedish timber volume. For forestry, birch an important tree species which today mainly {{used for the}} manufacture of pulp and paper. The aim of this project was to describe mechanical and physical properties of birch. The properties that have been studied are stiffness, bending strength, shrinkage, spiral gran angle, density and microfibril angle in the cell wall and vessel cells, {{from different parts of}} the birch stems grown at different rates. The mapped properties have been compared also with those of other tree species, mainly spruce. The long term aim is to increase the knowledge of the birch wood properties to provide better predict their impact on products as well as provide a basis for better utilization of <b>Swedish</b> <b>birch</b> raw material and hopefully using birch as future structural timber. Three birch stands with different growth was chosen: Two stands where the birch growth has been different in a mixed forests stand of spruce and pine, and a fast growing stand with improved birch seedlings. Samples were taken from four different heights in the trees. The main thing that has been analyzed is the bending strength, modulus of elasticity, shrinkage coefficients in different directions and spiral grain. The mechanical tests are carried out on tines that are 20 x 20 x 300 mm and the fiber angle measurements were carried out on discs. These results have supplemented by the results of analyzes conducted with lnnventias SilviScan instruments that are able to recognize variations of year ring wood properties. Some of these are density, and microfibril angle, which is also included in this report. The results show that the wood from normal growth and fast growth improved birch receive equivalent wood properties. The results also show that birch wood properties are slightly better than that in Norway spruce. The material in this project was limited to only three stands and 11 sampled trees and therefore it can´t provide complete answers to the birch trees different wood properties. Limitations include genetic origin, growth rate, earlier silvicultural treatment and number of sample trees...|$|E
