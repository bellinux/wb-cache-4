40|$|Background: Recently, {{the use of}} T 7 RNA {{polymerase}} {{instead of}} other viral and cellular promoters is increasing due to high efficacy of transcription in the cell cytoplasm by this polymerase. In order to translate the transcripts produced by T 7 RNA polymerase in mammalian cell lines, {{it is necessary to}} include Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) sequences. In addition, if <b>sequence</b> of <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> signal would be included after interested gene, the rate of expression could be increased in the cells. Methods: For expression of eGFP in HEK- 293 and T 7 -BHK cells by T 7 RNA polymerase, the sequence of eGFP as well as IRES sequences upstream of eGFP gene and <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> signal were inserted into a pUC 57 plasmid. On the other hand, gene of T 7 RNA polymerase was cloned into modified pIRES 2 -EGFP plasmid. Then, the constructed plasmids were transfected into HEK- 293 cells. T 7 -BHK cell was used for control of T 7 RNA polymerase activity. Results: Our results showed that using T 7 RNA polymerase for expression of foreign genes in mammalian cell lines is highly efficient. Conclusion: Highly efficient eGFP expression in HEK- 293 cells showed that T 7 RNA polymerase could be used for cytoplasmic RNA transcription such as production of anti-cancer proteins and oncolytic viral genomic RNA by reverse genetics...|$|R

The nucleotide sequence was 3953 bp in length and included a 300 bp 5 untranslated region (UTR), 536 bp 3 UTR with an AATAA canonical polyadenylation signal <b>sequence</b> and <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> tail, and a 3117 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 1038 amino acid protein. The calculated molecular weight of the protein was 115. 4 kDa with an estimated pI of 5. 29. This sequence was submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank under accession number KF 765670. A phenetic analysis showed that the Na,K-ATPase -subunit of P. vannamei shared {{a high degree of}} identity with other species. The relevant mRNA was detected in all of the tissues examined by fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

40|$|Abstract. Bioinformatics {{tools are}} {{required}} to produce reliable, high quality data devoid of unwanted sequences in the preprocessing stage of current sequencing and EST projects. In this paper we describe SeqTrim, an algorithm designed to extract the insert sequence from any sequence read devoid of any foreign, contaminant or unwanted sequence, whatever the experimental process was. SeqTrim is easy to install and {{able to identify the}} sequence insert by removing low quality <b>sequences,</b> cloning vector, <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> or T tails, adaptors, and sequences that can be considered contaminants.

The default parameters of the algorithm are best suited for most cases but a configuration file can be provided along with input sequences. SeqTrim admits several input and output formats (with and without quality values), which enables its inclusion in already or newly defined sequence processing workflows. SeqTrim is under continuous refinement due to collaboration between biologists and computer scientists which has succeed in correct dealing with most sequence cases and opens the possibility to include new capabilities to manage new kinds of bad sequences...|$|R

Rabbitfish GH was extracted from pituitary glands under alkaline conditions, fractionated by {{gel filtration chromatography}} on Sephadex G- 100, and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The fractions containing GH were identified by immunoblotting with bonito GH antiserum. Under nonreducing conditions, the molecular weight of rabbitfish GH is about 19 kDa as estimated by SDSâ€“PAGE. The purified hormone was potent in promoting growth in rabbitfish fry. Weekly intraperitoneal injections of the hormone significantly accelerated growth. This was evident 3 weeks {{after the start of}} the treatment, and its effect was still significant 2 weeks after the treatment was terminated. Rabbitfish GH cDNA was cloned to determine its nucleotide <b>sequence.</b> Excluding the <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> tail, rabbitfish GH cDNA is 860 base pairs (bp) long.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} and purification of the RNA-directed DNA polymerase of RNA tumor viruses has been developed. This nucleic acid affinity chromatography system utilizes an immobilized oligo (dT) moiety annealed with <b>poly</b> (<b>A).</b> The alpha and alphabeta DNA polymerases of avain myeloblastosis virus bound effectively to <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> oligo (dT) -cellulose. Alpha DNA polymerase did not bind effectively to <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> oligo (dT) -cellulose, <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> -cellulose, or to cellulose. Alphabeta bound to oligo (dT) -cellulose and cellulose at the same extent (approximately 30 %), indicating that this enzyme did not bind specifically to the oligo (DT) moiety only. However, alphabeta bound to <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> -cellulose {{two to three times}} better than to cellulose itself, showing that alphabeta could bind to <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> without a primer. Alphabeta DNA polymerase also bound to poly (C) -cellulose, whereas alpha did not.

In addition, alphabeta DNA polymerase is able to reversibly transcribe avian myeloblastosis virus 70 S RNA approximately fivefold faster than alpha DNA polymerase in the presence of Mg 2 + and equally efficient in the presence of Mn 2 +. alpha DNA polymerase transcribed 9 S globin m RNA slightly better than alphabeta with either metal ion...|$|R

Studies varying bilayer width revealed that the polyLeu core peptides predominately formed a TM state when the bilayer width exceeded hydrophobic sequence length by (i. e. when negative mismatch was) up to ∼ 11 – 12 Å (e. g. the case of a 11 – 12 residue hydrophobic sequence in bilayers with a biologically relevant width, i. e. dioleoylphosphatidylcholine [DOPC] bilayers), while polyLeuAla core peptides formed predominantly TM state with negative mismatch of up to 9 Å (a 13 residue hydrophobic sequence in DOPC bilayers). This indicates that minimum length necessary {{to form a}} predominating amount of a TM state (minimum TM length) is only modestly hydrophobicity-dependent for the sequences studied here, and a formula that defines the minimum TM length as a function of hydrophobicity for moderately-to-highly hydrophobic sequences was derived.
