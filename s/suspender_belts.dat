50|$|From the 1940s to '60s, {{suspenders}} {{became a}} common, popular {{alternative to the}} girdle, especially among teens and young women. Amid concerns girdles might cause abdominal flabbiness, <b>suspender</b> <b>belts</b> offered a simpler, more practical, and more comfortable choice when used simply to hold up their stockings.|$|E
50|$|Other common {{signifying}} footwear of the dominatrix are thigh-high boots, {{in leather}} or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status, {{along with the}} very high stiletto heel. Fishnet stockings, seamed hosiery, <b>suspender</b> <b>belts</b> and garter stockings are also popular accents in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of their legs, with erotic connotation.|$|E
50|$|Stocking fetishism {{may include}} other {{feminine}} clothing which contributes {{to enhance the}} fantasy. Some men find it arousing to collect and wear stockings, panties and <b>suspender</b> <b>belts.</b> In some cases, this is done {{for the purpose of}} momentary sexual stimulation. Others wear such a complete combination under a pair of trousers or beneath a business suit on a regular daily basis.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was during}} this early period that Silhouette brought into {{existence}} the world's first (and perhaps only) radioactive corset. In 1937, the ‘Silhouette Radiante’ was successfully marketed to a British public eager to try for themselves the [...] "...stimulating, even rejuvenating influence” of radiation (certified by the Marie Curie Institute). The company also helped the Second World War effort, by making bras and <b>suspender</b> <b>belts</b> for the W.A.A.F., A.T.S. and W.R.N.S.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959 {{the company}} {{introduced}} the first non-run seam-free stockings. To update the company's image in 1962, the parrot {{was replaced with}} two letter Ps and the phrase Pretty Polly for Pretty Legs forming a new what? [...] In March 1967, hold-ups were introduced, which avoided the need for <b>suspender</b> <b>belts,</b> and were even featured on Tomorrow's World. It depended on the invention in 1899 of silicone by Professor Frederick Kipping at University College Nottingham. In the late 1960s, Pretty Polly was the best-selling range of hosiery in the UK, with a market share of 20%. In 1982, lycra (invented in 1959) was introduced.|$|E

50|$|In modern usage, {{stocking}} specifically {{refers to}} the form of hosiery configured as two pieces, one for each leg (except for American and Australian English, where the term {{can also be a}} synonym pantyhose). The terms hold-ups and thigh highs refer to stockings that stay up through the use of built-in elastic, while the word stockings is the general term or {{refers to the}} kind of stockings that need a <b>suspender</b> <b>belt</b> (garter belt, in American English), and are quite distinct from tights or pantyhose (American English).|$|R

50|$|<b>Suspender</b> <b>belts</b> {{continue}} to be worn for their original purpose of holding up stockings. Suspenders today are available {{in a variety of}} styles, most commonly in white, 'fleshtone' beige-pink, or black with a satin finish. These are often now made from a mixture of nylon and spandex / lycra, being more readily available in retail stores. Variations of the suspender or garter belt include knickers with suspender attachments reminiscent of images of the 1960s, and corsets or girdles with small loops inside the bottom edge for attaching suspenders. Knickers are normally worn on top of the suspender belt as this makes it easier to remove them to use the lavatory / bathroom. If worn underneath the belt, undressing may be rather complicated if using a public facility.|$|E

50|$|Suspenders (American English, Canadian English) or braces (British English) are fabric or leather straps worn {{over the}} {{shoulders}} {{to hold up}} trousers. The straps may be elasticated, either entirely or only at attachment ends, and most straps are of woven cloth forming an X or Y shape at the back. Suspenders are typically attached to trousers with clips or buttons using leather tabs at the ends. Outside the United States the term <b>suspenders,</b> or <b>suspender</b> <b>belt,</b> refers to a garment used to hold up stockings. This is called a garter belt in American English.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1965 and {{his suicide}} in 1976, he chronicled his {{exploration}} of his subconscious transsexual desires in [...] "Cent Photographies Erotiques": graphically detailed images {{of pain and}} pleasure now on show in London. It was also in this year that Molinier, {{with the aid of}} a remote control switch, began to create photographs in which he assumed the roles of dominatrix and succuba previously taken by the women of his paintings. In these beautifully-made, intimate black and white photographs, Molinier, either alone with doll-like mannequins or with female models, appears as a transvestite, transformed by his 'fetish' wardrobe of fishnet stockings, <b>suspender</b> <b>belt,</b> stilettos, mask and corset. In montages, an unlikely number of stockinged limbs intertwine to create the women of Molinier's paintings.|$|R

The back adjusting strap has an inverted V of which each end has a side-retaining snaphook. Each of the adjusting straps has a loop around it made of 1 in elastic material. In 1991, the individual equipment <b>belt</b> <b>suspenders</b> are redesignated LC-2 with no apparent modifications.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1920s, {{what had been}} a wartime {{expedient}} – the need to economise on material – had become a statement of freedom by young women, manifested by shorter hemlines (just above the knee by 1925–6) and boyish hairstyles, accompanied by what Robert Graves and Alan Hodge described as [...] "the new fantastic development of Jazz music". At the Antwerp Olympic Games in 1920 the French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen attracted attention with a knee length skirt that revealed her <b>suspender</b> <b>belt</b> whenever she leapt to smash a ball. From then on, sportwear for women, as with day-to-day clothes, became freer, although, after the Second World War, when the American player Gussie Moran appeared at the Wimbledon championships of 1949 in a short skirt that revealed lace-trimmed panties, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club accused her of bringing [...] "vulgarity and sin into tennis" [...] and shunned the outfit's designer Teddy Tinling for many years.|$|R

50|$|<b>Suspender</b> (garter) <b>belts</b> {{are usually}} worn {{at the waist}} or just {{slightly}} below. If worn too low on the hips, {{there is a chance}} of the belt sliding down, as it is pulled downward by the stockings. The garment should fit closely on the waist, but not too tight. Some underwear, such as corselettes or girdles, referred to as shapewear, may come with suspender slings attached.|$|R

Early production individual equipment <b>belt</b> <b>suspenders</b> attach to the individual equipment belt by means of open bent-wire hooks which {{are attached to the}} individual equipment belt's upper set of eyelets.

2500|$|Following {{his close}} friend Milton Caniff's lead (with Steve Canyon), Capp had {{recently}} fought a successful {{battle with the}} syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a Time cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, The Life and Times of the Shmoo, became a bestseller for Simon & Schuster. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, <b>suspenders,</b> <b>belts,</b> curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including [...] "Shmooveralls." [...] The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, The Return of the Shmoo, have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures.

50|$|In the 21st century, pantyhose or tights {{are more}} widely worn than stockings. Hold-ups are an {{alternative}} way for keeping stockings up, {{with a band}} of latex rubber molded to the stocking top. Nevertheless, suspenders continue {{to be used by}} women who prefer not to wear tights for health reasons. Women who suffer from thrush or cystitis may be advised not to wear tights as nylon worn close to the genital area can exacerbate any infection present. Similarly latex rubber in hold-ups may irritate some people's skin. A <b>suspender</b> (garter) <b>belt</b> is the only option in these cases.|$|R
