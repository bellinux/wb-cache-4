2500|$|The {{film was}} previewed to French film {{distributors}} at the Palais Rochechouarton on 25 April 1934. The screening was disastrous and Gaumont {{took control of}} the film. Jean Pascal called the original cut [...] "a confused, incoherent, willfully absurd, long, dull, commercially worthless film." [...] However, Élie Faure said that he was reminded of the painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and praised [...] "these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line. And perhaps it was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration — classical, in a word — that made me appreciate all the more pleasure of <b>savoring</b> <b>the</b> very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism." ...|$|E
