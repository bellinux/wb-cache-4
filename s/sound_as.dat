5|$|Through Swayamvaram, Gopalakrishnan {{became the}} first Indian {{director}} to use <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> a leitmotif (a recurring musical theme). The film provided a new experience to Indian cinema-goers, as it used ample amounts of natural sounds with a minimalistic background score.|$|E

5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, {{but it can be}} a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Computer Gamer {{gave the}} Amstrad version 85%, praising the {{gameplay}} and graphics. They {{noted that it}} was an approachable flight simulator that can be played without reading the manual. Amstrad Action rated this version at 54% calling it challenging, but lacking in action. They described environmental detail and fighting as the high points, but criticized <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> poor and graphics as slow.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{terrestrial}} television brought {{a number of}} enhancements over the previous analog television, primarily higher-quality picture and <b>sound,</b> <b>as</b> well as datacasting and multi-view services such as video program guides, high definition, and now-and-next program information. There {{are a number of}} additional channels, datacasting, as well as high definition services, available to digital {{terrestrial television}} viewers in Australia. Digital-only content is subject to availability and differs greatly in various television markets.|$|E

5000|$|Some elided syllables in English are {{pronounced}} in SLE. For example, [...] "different" [...] would be pronounced [...] "diff-er-ent" [...] (/ˈɖifərənʈ/ [...] ). Also, some syllables normally unstressed and <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> /ə/ may be <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> /a(ː)/ (or, /o/, /u/, /e/ or /i/). For example, the word [...] "camera" [...] (/ˈkæmərə/) may become [...] "/ˈkæməra(ː)/".|$|R

5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> that of a drum machine.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A (each element {{pronounced}} separately, {{without the}} stroke) {{is a small}} studio monitor loudspeaker originated by the BBC for use by outside broadcast vans to ensure quality of their broadcasts. The speaker concept set out transparent and natural <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> the goal, and {{the achievement of the}} end result is widely acknowledged.|$|E
5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify <b>sound.</b> <b>As</b> the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E

50|$|When Cosby went on tour, Wright was put {{in charge}} with {{creating}} a Watts 103rd touring band which included both the musicians he had just recorded Hot Heat with but also added in the Wright <b>Sounds</b> <b>as</b> well.

5|$|The {{album was}} well-received critically, with critics noting the band's growth; praising the band's {{electronic}} and pop <b>sound,</b> <b>as</b> well as Ichiro Yamaguchi's songwriting and vocals. The album led Sakanaction {{to be chosen}} one of the ten iTunes Japan Sound of 2009 artists, as well as nominated at the Life Music Award 2009.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. It {{pioneered the}} new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema {{and became one of}} the first Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and outdoor locales. The film also became the first Indian film to use <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> a leitmotif. It was shown at various film festivals around the world, and won four National Film Awards at the 20th National Film Awards in 1973, including Best Feature Film, Best Director for Gopalakrishnan, and Best Actress for Sharada.|$|E
5|$|A book of piano {{sheet music}} {{arrangements}} {{from the original}} soundtrack has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> much like the originals as possible. The actual piano sheet music from the Final Fantasy XIII Piano Collection album has been published as a corresponding music book by Yamaha Music Media. Yamaha has additionally published its own sheet music book for piano arrangements from the original soundtrack, {{as well as a}} book of piano and vocal sheet music for the vocal tracks on the original soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Zetsubō, Studio Mebius (a brand under VisualArt's) started production on Snow. The artists for the visual novel were Asuka Pyon, who also drew the character designs, and Kobuichi. The scenario was written by three members of staff: Mochizuki Jet, Klein, and Jinno Masaki. I've <b>Sound,</b> <b>as</b> well as T Music Factory, Famishin, and Fam contributed to the music composition. According to the liner notes on the original soundtrack of Snow, the producers acknowledged that the game's structure resembled Key's visual novels Kanon and Air. Yūichi Suzumoto, {{who is known for}} his work on Air, Clannad, and , provided scenario assistance for Snow.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, {{but the other}} two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom <b>Sound.</b> <b>As</b> the floatplanes were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō {{and told him that}} no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's floatplanes overhead while unloading along the north shore of Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> a modern crocodilian.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Townshend and {{longtime}} Who engineer Bob Pridden remixed the album, {{resulting in a}} deluxe 5-disc box set. Unlike earlier reissues, this set contains two discs of demos, including some songs that were dropped from the final running order of the album, and a selection of songs in 5.1 surround sound. The box set came with a 100-page book including an essay by Townshend about the album sessions, with photos. In 2014, the album was released on Blu-ray Audio featuring a brand-new remix of the entire album by Townshend and Pridden in 5.1 surround <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> well the 2011 Deluxe Edition stereo remix and the original 1973 stereo LP mix.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the albums produced, music from the original soundtracks of the SaGa games has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Books are available for Romancing SaGa 3, Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, SaGa Frontier, SaGa Frontier II, and Unlimited SaGa. The compositions from Unlimited SaGa were rewritten by Tadaomi Idogawa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> much like the originals as possible. The music for the other books was written by Asako Niwa for piano solos of similar difficulty.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Nasution {{siblings}} {{formed a}} band; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by Uriah Heep and Blood, Sweat & Tears. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia (UKI) {{to fulfill his}} father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, {{as a replacement for}} their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member. The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers, he attempted to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> much like the original artist as he could.|$|E
