40|$|We have {{developed}} a highly efficient MPEG- 2 video coding method in order to deliver high-quality HDTV service at lower bit rates.

The picture <b>structure,</b> <b>frame</b> or field, is selected based on the vertical frequency energy of the picture and restricts macroblock based adaptation. The macroblock coding modes including motion vector and prediction type are determined so as to maximize the ratio of assignable bits for the DCT coefficients and motion compensated prediction errors.

40|$|Abstract: Wheel loaders {{are prone}} to lateral tilting {{accidents}} due to their complex working environment, variable <b>structure</b> <b>frame</b> and the large offset of the centroid position. The accidents may seriously threaten the driver’s safety. This paper proposes a steady-state margin (SSM) angle as a new instability threat indicator to analyse lateral stability of wheel loaders. Firstly, the structural characteristics and the rollover process of a wheel loader are presented, and the SSM angle is defined. Secondly, {{on the assumption that}} the tyres are rigid, the calculation process of the SSM angle is described in detail, then the SSM angle of the XG 953 wheel loader is computed. A virtual prototyping simulation was performed under the environment of ADAMS. The maximum relative error between the theoretical calculation and simulated result was 4. 55 %, within the permissible speed range. When changing the tyre parameters to normal tyre parameters, the relative error became larger. Finally, an indirect method is proposed to deal wit...|$|E
