The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> were repaired, are {{situated}} a bit further. The old tower of St. Luke's protects the harbour in the east, and the harbour entrance is encircled and guarded by the Revelin Fortress.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in <b>small</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the {{hurricane}} began affecting land, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The agency also advised <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> {{in the region}} to remain at port during the storm. Evacuations were ordered for a few islands in the Outer Banks, and several thousand tourists voluntarily left the coastline for safer areas. Overall, about 50,000people evacuated due to {{the hurricane}}. Further north, the Coast Guard advised people to avoid swimming along the coast of Long Island.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} days of November, the Yugoslav Navy stopped the Libertas convoy twice for {{inspection}} between the islands of Brač and Korčula as it enforced the blockade. The convoy of 40 <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> led by the ferry Slavija {{was on its way to}} resupply Dubrovnik and retrieve refugees from the besieged city. On 11 November, the Maltese-flagged coaster Euroriver, manned by a Croatian crew, was sunk by gunfire off Šolta Island.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians {{would have no}} {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety of}} the water. They were saved by remaining aboard <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> and a schooner captained by William G. Marshall, which was at anchor in the bay. While safe in the water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, unable to do a thing except curse them.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. <b>Small</b> <b>boats</b> can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} known to have been used for {{shipping}} in Roman times, when it was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream. There are records of <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods. Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the fourteenth century, and iron was shipped from Newenden or Udiam in the sixteenth century. A century later, an iron store was erected at Udiam. Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden, while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe.|$|E

5|$|The three destroyers and 16 <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They {{formed into}} {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the {{portside}} MLs were {{to head for the}} Old Mole to disembark their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire unaided, the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by Campbeltown and Atherstone.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} western Gulf of Mexico on September14 and moved eastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two <b>small</b> <b>boats.</b> After turning to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of , followed by executing a clockwise loop from September16 through September18. After maintaining peak winds for about five days, the storm weakened, by which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state. The storm dissipated on September21 just off the Georgia coast.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} <b>small</b> <b>boats,</b> towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size of}} the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Due to Lane's {{projected}} path {{near the}} western coast of Mexico, authorities closed ports to <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> {{in the cities}} of Acapulco. Just weeks after Hurricane John took a similar path through the area, several tourists voluntarily left their vacations to fly home. Many residents boarded up buildings and bought hurricane supplies {{in preparation for the}} storm. Officials also closed schools across the state of Guerrero. In all, 40,400tourists were evacuated from the Mexican coastline. According to the Secretaría de Gobernación, under which the Mexican Civil Protection Service operates, there were 5.5million homes and 21million people in 21states threatened by the system in all of Mexico. As a result, authorities evacuated about 2,000people to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{from the}} storm {{affected}} the Philippines, causing flooding that forced 3,500people to evacuate their houses. This occurred after a month of heavy rainfall from several tropical cyclones in July. Officials closed schools and advised <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> to remain at port. A vessel capsized offshore Antique Province, and its crew of 15 was rescued. At least six people died due to electrocution, after downed power lines touched floodwaters. The storm spawned a tornado and caused landslides in Negros Oriental. The storm killed 35people {{in the country and}} injured 22others. Damage was estimated at $3.3million (₱172million 2002PHP). Milenyo was the final storm to be named by PAGASA during 2002.|$|E

5|$|In 1960 {{there were}} only three primary schools in Bintulu. These schools {{provided}} classes until Primary3 level. There were no secondary schools. Villagers could pursue their secondary school studies at either Miri or Kuching by using <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> as there were no roads connecting Bintulu to either Miri or Kuching. Bintulu Government Secondary School was opened in 1964. In 1967 Bintulu celebrated the first 100 years of the Council Negri meeting (Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). A stone monument was built in front of a government rice storeroom to commemorate the event. Bintulu was a sub-district of Miri Division in the 1970s. The sub-district was upgraded into a district in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In all, {{the storm}} {{directly}} affected 3,027,601people, or 318,968families. Nationwide, 146people were injured. Infrastructure damage totaled $106.2million (1988 USD), while damage to agriculture accumulated to $16.5million and damage totaled $8.9million in private properties. Overall, Skip {{was responsible for}} $131.8million in damage. Additionally, 144,136people or 28,824families were evacuated to shelters {{as a result of}} the flooding. In all, 237people were killed due to Typhoon Skip. Since many roads in the devastated area were impassable, officials were forced to ferry relief goods to stranded residents by <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> and military helicopters. The Canadian Red Cross donated CD$5,000, while the city of Ottawa donated CD$150,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, ports were closed in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, while residents and tourists were encouraged to take precautions in coastal areas. Also, ports were closed on the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and in Chetumal. <b>Small</b> <b>boats</b> were restricted from leaving some ports, but evacuations were deemed unnecessary. Tropical storm warnings were issued {{as soon as the}} storm was first classified for the coast of Belize and the coast of Mexico south of Cabo Catoche, and remained in effect until Arthur weakened to a tropical depression.|$|E
