40|$|There is {{interest}} in pre-farm gate fortification {{of the diet}} with highly bioavailable selenium (Se) to improve public health, so {{the aim of the}} present study was to determine the bioavailabilities of Se from Se-enriched whole milk and milk replacers supplemented with exogenous Se in neonatal pigs. Milk enriched with Se (1070 &# 0956;g Se/kg dry matter (DM); HSeM) was obtained from cows supplemented with <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast</b> while the control milk diet (135 &# 0956;g Se/kg DM; LSeM) was made using milk powder from non-supplemented cows. Additional diets were formulated by adding <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast</b> (HSP) or selenate (HSN) to the LSeM diet to give final Se concentrations of 1070 &# 0956;g Se/kg DM. Neonatal pigs were trained to drink milk and then randomly allocated to their four respective diets and slaughter times (0, 7, 14, 28 and 42 days of feeding). Plasma Se increased over the first 21 days in pigs consuming HSeM, reaching a value over three times higher than the LSeM pigs. Plasma Se concentrations plateaued at 45, 125, 122 and 170 &# 0956;g/mL for LSeM, HSN, HSP and HSeM pigs, respectively (P < 0. 001). After 28 days, muscle Se plateaued at 47, 106, 237 and 486 &# 0956;g/kg for LSeM, HSN, HSP and HSeM pigs, respectively (P < 0. 001). Colonic selenoprotein P gene expression was greater (P = 0. 024) in pigs fed HSeM compared with LSeM while the HSP and HSN were intermediate. These data suggest that Se in milk from cows fed <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast</b> is highly bioavailable and may offer a means of delivering supplemental Se to humans...|$|R

Sixty spring-calving cows grazing perennial pasture at a herbage allowance of 40 kg DM/cow/day were supplemented with crushed barley grain and a formulated concentrate containing <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast.</b> The effects of the selenium supplement (25 mg Se/day) on milk production, selenium concentration in milk and somatic cell counts were determined by comparison with 60 cows consuming a similar diet without the <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast.</b> There were no effects of short-term selenium supplementation on milk production, the concentrations of protein, fat or lactose in milk or on somatic cell counts. The selenium concentration in bulk milk samples increased from 10. 3 to 128. 3 µg/L from day 0 to day 9 of the treatment period.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{analytical}} {{strategy was}} {{proposed for the}} identification of selenium species in <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast.</b> It was based on on-line nanoHPLC electrospray hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS analysis following a one-step fractionation of an aqueous extract by size-exclusion chromatography. The enhanced purity of the species arriving at a given moment at the detector allowed the detection {{of a series of}} compounds with the characteristic selenium isotopic pattern during a single chromatographic run. The high resolution and mass accuracy provided by the TOF analyser allowed, in combination with the double bond equivalent information and in-source fragmentation data, the determination of the empirical formulae of the detected selenium species. The identification was completed by targeted on-line fragmentation of pseudomolecular ions corresponding to the most abundant Se isotopes. Besides the identification of previously reported compounds (m/z 433, m/z 431) the data obtained confirmed the presence and allowed the structural characterization of 5 new adenine-containing selenium species (m/z 661, 613, 475, 406 and 403) along with some of their sulfur analogues.

40|$|Interactions between grape tannins/red wine {{polyphenols}} and yeast cells/cell walls {{was previously}} studied {{within the framework}} of red wine aging and the use of yeast-derived products as an alternative to aging on lees. Results evidenced a quite different behavior between whole cells (biomass grown to elaborate yeast-derived products, <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast,</b> and <b>yeast</b> <b>inactivated</b> after autolysis) and yeast cell walls (obtained from mechanical disruption of the biomass). Briefly, whole cells exhibited a high capacity to irreversibly adsorb grape and wine tannins, whereas only weak interactions were observed for cell walls. This last point was quite unexpected considering the literature and called into question the real role of cell walls in yeasts' ability to fix tannins. In the present work, tannin location after interactions between grape and wine tannins and yeast cells and cell walls was studied by means of transmission electron microscopy, light epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy. Microscopy observations evidenced that if tannins interact with cell walls, and especially cell wall mannoproteins, they also diffuse freely through the walls of dead cells to interact with their plasma membrane and cytoplasmic components...|$|R
40|$|Yeast is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} probiotic in aquaculture {{with the potential to}} substitute for antibiotics. In this study, the involvement and extent to which the viability of yeast cells and thus the secretory metabolites released from the yeast contribute to effects of baker's yeast was investigated in Nile tilapia. No yeast, live yeast or heat-inactivated baker's yeast were added to basal diets high in fishmeal and low in soybean (diet A) or low in fishmeal and high in soybean (diet B), which were fed to fish for 8 weeks. Growth, feed utilization, gut microvilli morphology, and expressions of hsp 70 and inflammation-related cytokines in the intestine and head kidney were assessed. Intestinal microbiota was investigated using 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Gut alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity was measured after challenging the fish with Aeromonas hydrophila. Results showed that live yeast significantly improved FBW and WG (P < 0. 05), and tended to improve FCR (P = 0. 06) of fish compared to the control (no yeast). No significant differences were observed between <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast</b> and control. Live yeast improved gut microvilli length (P < 0. 001) and density (P < 0. 05) while <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast</b> did not. The hsp 70 expression level in both the intestine and head kidney of fish was significantly reduced by live yeast (P < 0. 05) but not <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast.</b> Live <b>yeast</b> but not <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast</b> reduced intestinal expression of tnfα (P < 0. 05), tgfβ (P < 0. 05 under diet A) and il 1 β (P = 0. 08). Intestinal Lactococcus spp. numbers were enriched by both live and <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast.</b> Lastly, both live and <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast</b> reduced the gut AKP activity compared to the control (P < 0. 001), indicating protection of the host against infection by A. hydrophila.

40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in chickens and turkeys for fattening and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the maximum authorised total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from <b>selenised</b> <b>yeast.</b> To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the FEEDAP Panel concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in chickens for fattening and pigs for fattening, the FEEDAP Panel considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories. HMSeBA does not modify the quality of meat as measured by physico-chemical properties...|$|R

One-day-old female chickens of the laying strain Isa Brown were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments consisting of basal diet (BD) containing only background Se (0. 12 mg/kg dry matter (DM)) and two treatments based on identical BD supplemented with 0. 2 mg Se/kg DM either from SS or from Se-yeast. The fourth group of layers fed BD enriched with 0. 7 mg Se/kg DM from Se-yeast. After 4 weeks of experiment, no differences in blood Se levels were observed between chickens fed diets supplemented with equivalent doses of SS or Se-yeast, while the 8 -week intake of Se-yeast resulted in significantly higher blood Se levels of layers than from SS (0. 17 vs. 0. 21 mg/L, P˂ 0. 01). The layers given BD showed significantly the lowest Se level. The daily Se balance was positive in all birds with the highest values in chickens fed larger amount of Se-yeast. The balance measurements carried out in week 4 and 8 showed no differences between groups supplemented with equivalent Se amounts in the selenium balance and Se retention (% of Se ingested), both differing from the control group in week 8 only. The 8 -week intake of Se-yeast resulted in significantly higher Se deposition in muscles, heart, gizzard, pancreas, lungs, kidney, Bursa Fabricii and feathers of chickens than that from SS. The highest tissue Se concentrations in all layers were found in the kidney. The layers given diet with larger amount of Se-yeast showed the highest values in the majority tissues. The results demonstrate the better bioavailability of Se-yeast in young layers due to the greater body retention of this essential microelement than from sodium selenite, however the higher Se absorption from digestive tract of birds was as effective as inorganic Se source...|$|R
40|$|Incubation of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (GAPD) with {{sodium nitroprusside}} (SNP) decreased its activity in concentration- and time-dependent fashion {{in the presence}} of a thiol compounds, with DTT being more effective than GSH. Both forward and backward reactions were effected. Coinciding with this, HgCl 2 -sensitive labelling of the protein by [32 P]NAD+ also increased, indicating the stimulation of ADP-ribosylation. Treatment with SNP of GAPD samples from rabbit muscle, sheep brain and <b>yeast</b> <b>inactivated</b> the dehydrogenase activity of the three, but only the mammalian proteins showed ADP-ribosylation activity. The SNP-modified protein of rabbit muscle GAPD, freed from the reagent by Sephadex filtration showed a concentration-dependent restoration of the dehydrogenase activity on preincubation with DTT and GSH. Such thiol-treated preparations also gave increased ADP-ribosylation activity with DTT, and to a lesser extent with GSH. The SNP-modified protein was unable to catalyze this activity with the native yeast enzyme and native and heat-inactivated muscle enzyme. It was possible to generate the ADP-ribosylation activity in muscle GAPD, by an NO-independent mechanism, on dialysis in Tris buffer under aerobic conditions, and on incubating with NADPH, but not NADH, in muscle and brain, but not yeast, enzymes. The results suggest that the inverse relationship of the dehydrogenase and ADP-ribosylation activities is coincidental but not correlate...|$|R

Cows received ad libitum a total mixed ration (TMR) with a 1 : 1 forage: concentrate ratio on a dry matter (DM) basis. There were four diets (T- 1 to T- 4), which differed only in either source or dose of Se additive. Estimated total dietary Se for T, (no supplement), T- 2 (SS), T- 3 (SY) and T- 4 (SY) was 0. 16, 0. 30, 0. 30 and 0. 45 mg/kg DM, respectively. Blood and milk samples were taken at 28 -day intervals and at each time point there were positive linear effects of Se in the form of SY on the Se concentration in blood and milk.

In whole blood, selenocysteine (SeCys) was the main selenised amino acid and the concentration of selenomethionine (SeMet) increased with the increasing inclusion rate of SY In milk, there were no marked treatment effects on the SeCys content, but Se source had a marked effect on the concentration of SeMet. At day 112 replacing SS (T- 2) with SY (T- 3) increased the SeMet concentration of milk from 36 to 111 ng Se/g and its concentration increased further to 157 ng Se/g dried sample as the inclusion rate of SY increased further (T- 4) to provide 0. 45 mg Se/kg TMR. Neither Se source nor inclusion rate affected the keeping quality of milk. At day 112 milk from T- 1, T- 2 and T- 3 was made into a hard cheese and Se source had a marked effect on total Se and the concentration of total Se comprised as either SeMet or SeCys.

Inactivation of either the spindle or tension checkpoint enables premature anaphase entry in cells with dysfunctional Cik 1 /Kar 3, resulting in co-segregation of sister chromatids. Moreover, the abolished Kar 3 -kinetochore interaction in cik 1 mutants suggests that the Cik 1 /Kar 3 complex mediates chromosome movement along microtubules, which could facilitate bipolar attachment. Therefore, we can induce syntelic attachments in budding <b>yeast</b> by <b>inactivating</b> the Cik 1 /Kar 3 complex, and this approach will be very useful to study the checkpoin...|$|R
40|$|Glycogen synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was {{purified}} to homogeneity. The enzyme {{showed a}} subunit molecular mass of 80 kDa. The holoenzyme {{appears to be}} a tetramer. Antibodies developed against purified <b>yeast</b> glycogen synthase <b>inactivated</b> the enzyme in yeast extracts and allowed the detection of the protein in Western blots. Amino acid analysis showed that the enzyme is very rich in glutamate and/or glutamine residues. The N-terminal sequence (11 amino acid residues) was determined. In addition, selected tryptic-digest peptides were purified by reverse-phase h. p. l. c. and submitted to gas-phase sequencing. Up to eight sequences (79 amino acid residues) could be aligned with the human muscle enzyme sequence. Levels of identity range between 37 and 100 %, indicating that, although human and yeast glycogen synthases probably share some conserved regions, significant differences in their primary structure should be expected...|$|R
40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are {{expressed}} by haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and {{may play a}} role in haematopoiesis in response to pathogens during infection. We have previously demonstrated that (i) <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeasts</b> of Candida albicans induce in vitro differentiation of HSPCs towards the myeloid lineage, and (ii) soluble TLR agonists induce in vivo their differentiation towards macrophages. In this work, using an in vivo model of HSPCs transplantation, we report for the first time that HSPCs sense C. [*]albicans in vivo and subsequently are directed to produce macrophages by a TLR 2 -dependent signalling. Purified lineage-negative cells (Lin−) from bone marrow of C 57 BL/ 6 mice (CD 45. 2 alloantigen) were transplanted into B 6 Ly 5. 1 mice (CD 45. 1 alloantigen), which were then injected with viable or <b>inactivated</b> C. [*]albicans <b>yeasts.</b> Transplanted cells were detected in the spleen and in the bone marrow of recipient mice, and they differentiate preferentially to macrophages, both in response to infection or in response to <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeasts.</b> The generation of macrophages was dependent on TLR 2 but independent of TLR 4, as transplanted Lin− cells from TLR 2 −/− mice did not give rise to macrophages, whereas Lin− cells from TLR 4 −/− mice generated macrophages similarly to control cells. Interestingly, the absence of TLR 2, or in a minor extent TLR 4, gives Lin− cells an advantage in transplantation assays, as increases the percentage of transplanted recovered cells. Our results indicatethat TLR-mediated recognition of C. [*]albicans by HSPCs may help replace and/or increase cells that constitute the first line of defence against the fungus, and suggest that TLR-mediated signalling may lead to reprogramming early progenitors to rapidly replenishing the innate immune system and generate the most necessary mature cells to deal with the pathogen.

40|$|Although {{cellular}} immunity involving activated macrophage {{is important in}} resistance to Brucella infections, serum factors and polymorphonuclears (PMNs) play some role in the initial responses to Brucella infections. In this research, we studied respiratory burst of PMNs against opsonized <b>yeast</b> and opsonized <b>inactivated</b> Brucella melitensis in chronic Brucellosis patients and controls with no previous history of Brucellosis. A group of 41 patients and another group of 20 blood donors as control, were included. The other 2 groups included 10 cases and 6 controls. Mean responses of PMNs of patients and controls to opsonized yeast were 110. 3 and 129. 3 milivolt respectively and {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. No statistically significant difference was observed between respiratory burst of PMNs exposed to inactivated Brucella in 10 patients with chronic Brucellosis (Mean 67. 2) and 6 control blood donors (Mean 112. 5), so we concluded that inactivated Brucella melitensis can't inhibit activity of myeloproxidase enzyme. &nbsp...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factors Aft 1 and Aft 2 from Saccharomyces cer-evisiae {{regulate the}} expression of genes involved in iron homeosta-sis. These factors induce {{the expression of}} iron regulon genes in iron-deficient <b>yeast</b> but are <b>inactivated</b> in iron-replete cells. Iron inhibition of Aft 1 /Aft 2 was previously shown {{to be dependent on}} mitochondrial components required for cytosolic iron sulfur pro-tein biogenesis. We presently show that the nuclear monothiol glu-taredoxins Grx 3 and Grx 4 are critical for iron inhibition of Aft 1 in yeast cells. Cells lacking both glutaredoxins show constitutive expression of iron regulon genes. Overexpression of Grx 4 attenu-ates wild type Aft 1 activity. The thioredoxin-like domain in Grx 3 andGrx 4 is dispensable inmediating iron inhibitionofAft 1 activity, whereas the conserved cysteine {{that is part of the}} conserved CGFS motif inmonothiol glutaredoxins is essential for this function. Grx 3 and Grx 4 interact with Aft 1 as shown by two-hybrid interaction...|$|R

Treatments comprised control (basal diet composed of 16 % Mombasa grass silage, 66 % ground corn, 3 % vitamin nuclear mineral and 15 % cottonseed meal), amylase treatment (control diet {{with the addition of}} 48. 7 saccharifying units kg- 1 diet) and compound treatment (control diet with the addition of enzymatic complex composed of 83. 2 saccharifying units, 8. 8 fibrolytic units, 0. 05 g of mannan oligosaccharides and 0. 2 g of <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast</b> Kg- 1 of the dry matter diet). The addition of products did not significantly increase daily weight gain, intake, feed conversion and carcass yield of cattle. There was no difference between in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) in the diets. The percentage of residual fecal starch was not influenced by exogenous amylolytic enzymes of amylase and compound treatments. The tested products were not able to improve animal performance. ...|$|R
40|$|The alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (ADH) inactivator from aerobically grown rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles {{was shown to}} be associated with membranes which were recovered in sucrose gradients at peak density 1. 13 grams per cubic centimeter. When Mg 2 + was included in the gradient, the inactivator was recovered at peak density 1. 16 grams per cubic centimeter coinciding with the marker enzyme for endoplasmic reticulum, antimycin A-insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase. ADH was recovered exclusively in cytosol fractions. The inactivator attacks ADH from several plant sources and from yeast. There was no evidence for proteolysis when pure <b>yeast</b> ADH was <b>inactivated</b> by the inactivator, but there was a loss of SH groups from ADH during inactivation which was restored after incubation with dithiothreitol under denaturing conditions. The inactivator did not attack other SH enzymes tested but did result in loss of SH groups from glutathione and dithiothreitol which prevent ADH inactivation. When O 2 was removed from the inactivator assay medium, the inactivation as well as the loss of SH groups from yeast ADH was significantly depressed...|$|R

Thyoglycolate induced, allogenic, peritoneal macrophages were incubated with or without stimulated cell supernatants. Then, the phagocytic activity against <b>inactivated</b> <b>yeast</b> and peroxidase production were measured. Stimulated cell supernatants increased the phagocytic activity and the peroxidase production of allogenic peritoneal macrophages. The activities of these stimulated cell supernatants were lost completely when they were heated at 56 ℃ for 30 min or dialyzed against a pH 2 buffer for 24 h-similar to IFN-γ. Stimulated cell supernatants did not increase phagocytic activity and peroxidase production of heterogenic mouse peritoneal macrophages. These {{findings suggest that the}} spleen lymphocytes of Japanese parrotfish can produce a macrophage activating factor in vitro with Concanavalin A bound to Sepharose 4 B beads, and that this factor may be IFN-γ. イシダイの脾臓細胞中のリンパ球をコンカナバリンA（Con A）セファロース 4 B とともに 48 時間培養し，その上清によるマクロファージ活性化を検討し，以下の結果を得た。Con A 培養上清で培養したイシダイ腹腔マクロファージの貪食能と細胞内のペルオキシダーゼ活性の両機能は共に亢進していた。イシダイCon A 培養上清をホ乳類でINF-γ 失活処理とされている熱（ 56 ℃）あるいは酸（pH 2 ）処理を行ったところ，マクロファージの活性化が消失した。イシダイCon A 培養上清の腹腔マクロファージ活性化の種特異性について，マウス腹腔マクロファージを用いて検討したところ，後者は活性化能を持たず，イシダイCon A培養上清の種特異性が存在した。 以上のことより，養殖イシダイ脾臓細胞中のリンパ球は，Con A で培養するとINF-γ を産生すると推察され，イシダイの魚体内でINF-γ，マクロファージの免疫防御機構の存在が示唆された...|$|R
40|$|Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the {{accelerated}} turnover of mRNAs transcribed from genes containing early nonsense mutations, {{is dependent on}} the product of the UPF 1 gene in <b>yeast.</b> Mutations that <b>inactivate</b> UPF 1 lead to the selective stabilization of mRNAs containing early nonsense mutations but have no effect on the half-lives of almost all other mRNAs. Since the transcripts of nonsense alleles are not typical cellular constituents, we sought to identify those RNAs that comprise normal substrates of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Many yeast pre-mRNAs contain early in-frame nonsense codons and we consider it possible that a role of this pathway is to accelerate the degradation of pre-mRNAs present in the cytoplasm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, in a strain lacking UPF 1 function, the CYH 2, RP 51 B, and MER 2 pre-mRNAs are stabilized 2 - to 5 -fold and are associated with ribosomes. We conclude that a major source of early nonsense codon-containing cytoplasmic transcripts in yeast is pre-mRNAs and that the UPF 1 protein may be part of a cellular system that ensures that potentially deleterious nonsense fragments of polypeptides do not accumulate...|$|R
40|$|Inactivation of Hsp 104 by {{guanidine}} is contended to be {{the mechanism}} by which guanidine cures yeast prions. We now find an Hsp 104 mutation (D 184 N) that confers resistance to guanidine-curing of the yeast [PSI+] prion. In an independent screen we isolated an HSP 104 allele altered in the same residue (D 184 Y) that dramatically impairs [PSI+] propagation in a temperature-dependent manner. Directed mutagenesis of HSP 104 produced additional alleles that conferred varying degrees of resistance to guanidine-curing or impaired [PSI+] propagation. The mutations similarly affected propagation of the [URE 3] prion. Basal and induced abundance of all mutant proteins was normal. Thermotolerance of cells expressing mutant proteins was variably resistant to guanidine, {{and the degree of}} thermotolerance did not correlate with [PSI+] stability. We thus show that guanidine cures <b>yeast</b> prions by <b>inactivating</b> Hsp 104 and identify a highly conserved Hsp 104 residue that is critical for yeast prion propagation. Our data suggest that Hsp 104 activity can be reduced substantially without affecting [PSI+] stability, and that Hsp 104 interacts differently with prion aggregates than with aggregates of thermally denatured protein...|$|R
