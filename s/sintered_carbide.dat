Experiments were carried out on hardened steel X 155 CrVMo 12 - 1 plate during milling process with a constant surface inclination angle (α) and variable cutting speeds (vc) and feeds (fz). Cutting forces (Fi) were measured and presented in function of tool wear (VBB). Specific cutting pressures were also estimated in function of tool wear (VBB). Their values are applied to cutting force model formulation, which includes tool wear. The research revealed that in certain range of cutting speed tool life acquired for <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> can be higher than that obtained for cubic boron nitride tool. It was observed, that for cubic boron nitride cutter abrasive wear was dominant independently of cutting speed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was analysis of the wear of milling cutters made of <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> and of boron nitride. The article presents the life period of the cutting edges and describes industrial conditions of the applicability of tools made of the materials under investigation.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this work was {{to work out the}} {{technology}} of manufacturing carbon and titanium based layers on the surfaces of sintered carbides machining edges used in furniture industry. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid deposition system employing DC magnetron sputtering and radio frequency plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (RF PACVD) in one reaction chamber was used to manufacture Ti:C gradient layers. For the laboratory investigation layers were deposited on <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> samples. Friction coefficient and SEM EDS analysis were made. For the exploitation tests layers were deposited on the commercial <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> tools widely used in furniture industry. Findings: As the result of investigation it was noticed that Ti and C based gradient layers deposited on sintered carbides surfaces seems to be a very interesting alternative for standard non modified machining tools because of they noticeably decreased friction coefficient and improved durability.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} mechanical properties both of <b>sintered</b> <b>carbides</b> WC-Co type and sialon tool ceramics with wear resistance ternary coatings Ti(B,N) type deposited by the cathodic arc evaporation process (CAE-PVD). Design/methodology/approach: The microhardness tests of coatings were made using the ultra microhardness tester. The grain size of investigated coatings was determined by the Scherrer method. Tests of the coatings adhesion to a substrate material were made using the scratch test. There was investigated the roughness of both uncoated and coated surface multi-point inserts. Wear mechanism observations, after the scratch test, were carried out by the scanning electron microscope with EDS attachment. Findings: This paper presents that studied PVD coatings deposited on <b>sintered</b> <b>carbides</b> and sialon tool ceramics have an effect on increasing hardness surface of tools. Moreover, the results achieved after the investigation shown that a coating obtaining on tool ceramics has bigger grains and a smaller adhesion to substrate rather than a coating on <b>sintered</b> <b>carbides.</b> Furthermore, the investigations were shown that both single and double-sided delamination was a principal defect mechanism during the scratch test. Practical implications: The gradient Ti(B,N) coating carried out on multi point inserts (made on <b>sintered</b> <b>carbides</b> WC-Co type) can be used in the pro-ecological dry cutting processes without using cutting fluids. However, application of this coating to cover sialon ceramics demands still both elaborating and improvement adhesion to substrates in order to introduce these to industrial applications. Originality/value: The paper presents some researches of gradient Ti(B,N) nanocrystaline coatings deposited by CAE-PVD method on <b>sintered</b> <b>carbides</b> and sialon tool ceramics...|$|R

40|$|It {{was found}} in the 1 st report that <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> K type is most {{suitable}} tool material for lathe turning of titanium alloy because of its large thermal conductivity and small affinity for titanium alloy. From this fact, <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> K 10 as tool material was used in this experiment. we have tried to see how machinability of titanium alloy is effected by hot machining, using two methods, sectional electric resisting and gasoline burner heating. To compare with titanium alloy, carbon steel S 45 C on which built up edges grow easily has been machined in same cutting condition as titanium alloy. The results are as follows. (1) When titanium alloy is machined with <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> tool K 10,being heated by sectional electric resisting heating, cutting resistance is reduced. But tool life decrease because the cutting edge is softened by high cutting temperature. (2) When alternating current is used as heating current, owing to cycle of it, variation of cutting resistance and surface roughness become larger, these tendencies are particularly remarkable in titanium alloy. (3) When the gasoline burner heating is used, the work is stisfactoly heated unlike in sectional electric resisting heating, and accordingly variation of cutting resistance and surface roughness become smoller...|$|E

The wear tests {{have been carried out}} on AISI 1040 steel with cutting speeds from 5 m/sec to 11 m/sec. The silicon nitride, <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide,</b> cubic boron nitride and alumina reinforced with SiC whiskers inserts, have shown, at each assigned cutting parameter, poor wear resistance when cutting steel. Alumina and alumina in submicron grain, which has been toughened by ZrO 2 phase transformation, and the oxide-based alumina, have been the better wear resistance. The mixed based alumina has shown a wear resistance, a little lower than the previous materials. The low chemical stability seems to be the reason for the poor performances of the silicon nitride and the silicon carbide whiskers reinforced alumina inserts. The high wear rate of the <b>sintered</b> <b>carbide</b> and the cubic boron nitride is essentially due to the pull out of the ceramic particles. From the other hand, the chemical stability, together with their good mechanical properties can explain the appreciable results obtained with the other alumina based materials...|$|E
