40|$|Choosing a <b>specialty</b> {{within the}} {{occupation}} of medicine is problematic {{given the number of}} available <b>specialty</b> choices. A need exists for the development and modification of invento-ries to be used to help students with selecting a medical <b>specialty.</b> Furthermore, ratings of job satisfaction, regardless of <b>specialty,</b> are mixed with some physicians regretting choosing medicine as a career. Despite its use in medi-cal <b>specialty</b> counseling, research is lacking regarding the Medical <b>Specialty</b> Preference Inventory (MSPI). We examined the predictive validity of the MSPI and compared job satis-faction of physicians (N = 51) whose <b>specialty</b> was correctly (i. e., congruent) versus incor-rectly (i. e., incongruent) predicted by the MSPI. The MSPI correctly predicted the spe-cialty for 33 %. Congruent physicians had higher job satisfaction than incongruent phy-sicians.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals focusing on high margin procedures has generated significant controversy. Yet, {{it is unclear}} whether physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals differ significantly from non physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals and thus merit the additional scrutiny that has been proposed. Our objective was to assess whether physician owned <b>specialty</b> orthopedic hospitals and non physician owned <b>specialty</b> orthopedic hospitals differ with respect to hospital characteristics and patient populations served. Methods We conducted a descriptive study using Medicare data of beneficiaries who underwent total hip replacement (THR) (N = 10, 478) and total knee replacement (TKR) (N = 15, 312) in 29 physician owned and 8 non physician owned <b>specialty</b> orthopedic hospitals during 1999 – 2003. We compared hospital characteristics of physician owned and non physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals including procedural volumes of major joint replacements (THR and TKR), hospital teaching status, and for profit status. We then compared demographics and prevalence of common comorbid conditions for patients treated in physician owned and non physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals. Finally, we examined whether the socio-demographic characteristics of the neighborhoods where physician owned and non physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals differed, as measured by zip code level data. Results Physician owned <b>specialty</b> hospitals performed fewer major joint replacements on Medicare beneficiaries in 2003 than non physician owed <b>specialty</b> hospitals (64 vs. 678, P Conclusion Physician owned <b>specialty</b> orthopedic hospitals differ significantly from non physician owned <b>specialty</b> orthopedic hospitals and may warrant the additional scrutiny policy makers have proposed. </p...|$|R

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many <b>specialties</b> of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major <b>specialties</b> of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} the Greens were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, {{a student in}} his twenties {{completing}} his last year of medical school. Farrar was struck by Green's intelligence and vitality, though he was embarrassed by her habit of explosively losing her temper at minor slights. In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, dependable presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio. Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched <b>specialties.</b> She began a second residency in internal medicine, joining Farrar's program.|$|E
