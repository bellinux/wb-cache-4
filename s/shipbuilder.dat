5|$|Deutschland {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1872. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser were ordered shortly {{after the end of}} the Franco-Prussian War, under the assumption that the French would quickly attempt a war of revenge. The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. Deutschland cost the German government 8,240,000gold marks. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign <b>shipbuilder.</b>|$|E
5|$|Friedrich der Grosse {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under {{construction}} number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard, while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private <b>shipbuilder.</b> The ship cost the German government 7,303,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|Hela was the {{culmination}} {{in the development}} of the aviso type in the Imperial German Navy. German avisos were developed from earlier torpedo boats and were intended for use in home waters with the fleet. The first aviso, , was purchased from a British <b>shipbuilder</b> in 1875; seven more ships were built in German yards before Hela was laid down in 1893. The aviso type culminated in what would later be referred to as the light cruiser; Helas successors, the s, were the first true light cruisers built.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1982, British <b>Shipbuilders</b> {{had closed}} half of its shipyards {{in an effort to}} reduce over-capacity. The terms of the British <b>Shipbuilders</b> Act 1983 then {{required}} the company to begin a process of privatising its remaining assets. The various divisions that had remained under integrated nationalised ownership were divested throughout the 1980s as the company wound up operations. The profitable warship-builders were sold off initially, with the merchant shipyards sold off or closed on a piecemeal basis, culminating in the sale of Govan <b>Shipbuilders</b> to Kvaerner in 1988 and Ferguson <b>Shipbuilders</b> to the privatised marine engine builder, Clark Kincaid, in January 1989. British <b>Shipbuilders</b> finally ceased active shipbuilding operations in 1989, with the closure of its last shipyards; North East <b>Shipbuilders</b> Ltd.'s Pallion and Southwick Shipyards at Sunderland. The remaining assets of North East <b>Shipbuilders</b> Ltd. were then privatised.|$|R

5|$|Planning for a {{new design}} to replace the RAN's Oberon-class {{submarines}} {{began in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. Proposals were received from seven companies; two were selected for a funded study to determine the winning design, which was announced in mid-1987. The submarines, enlarged versions of Swedish <b>shipbuilder</b> Kockums' Västergötland class and originally referred to as the Type 471, were constructed between 1990 and 2003 in South Australia by the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC).|$|E
5|$|The Prussian Navy ordered Friedrich Carl from a French <b>shipbuilder</b> in 1865. She {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne {{shipyard}} in Toulon the following year.

5|$|When all {{remaining}} post-launch work on West Lianga {{was completed}} {{and she was}} delivered on 4 May, 67 working days after her keel laying, it was another world record for ocean-going vessels. By 1920, West Lianga still counted as the third-fastest delivery, behind two ships that were over one-third smaller than West Lianga. <b>Shipbuilder</b> Skinner & Eddy received a $71,600 bonus ($ million today) for completing West Lianga early.|$|E
5|$|Calment {{was born}} in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhone, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (28 January 1838 – 22 January 1931), was a <b>shipbuilder,</b> and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was {{from a family of}} millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, {{although}} none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to six days shy of 93, and her mother to 86.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the Royal Edward Dock {{was built}} in Avonmouth and in 1972 the large deep water Royal Portbury Dock was {{constructed}} {{on the opposite side}} of the mouth of the Avon, making the Bristol City Docks in the floating harbour redundant as a freight dock. In 1977 Charles Hill & Sons, the last <b>shipbuilder</b> at the Albion Yard, closed after delivering the 1541 tonne beer tanker Miranda Guinness. Part of the yard reopened in 1980 when Abels Shipbuilders began operating, who still produce a steady stream of small ferries, survey vessels, tugs and other craft.|$|E
50|$|Then in 1968 {{the company}} was made part of Upper Clyde <b>Shipbuilders,</b> which {{collapsed}} in 1971 when a strike and work-in received national press attention. As part of the recovery deal, Fairfields was formed into Govan <b>Shipbuilders</b> in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British <b>Shipbuilders</b> in 1977. On the break-up of British <b>Shipbuilders</b> under denationalisation in 1988, the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kværner group and renamed Kvaerner Govan. The yard passed to BAE Systems Marine in 1999 and {{is now part of}} BAE Systems Surface Ships.|$|R
50|$|In February 1972, Heath's {{government}} relented and restructured {{the yards}} around two new companies: Govan <b>Shipbuilders</b> was established (formerly Fairfields) {{along with its}} subsidiary Scotstoun Marine Ltd (formerly Connells). Yarrow <b>Shipbuilders</b> had already withdrawn from UCS in April 1970 and regained its status as an independent company (until 1977, when it was nationalised as part of British <b>Shipbuilders,</b> along with Govan <b>Shipbuilders).</b> A fourth yard at Clydebank (formerly John Brown) was sold to Marathon Oil as an oil-rig fabrication yard, which eventually closed in 2001. The former Alexander Stephens and Sons yard at Linthouse was closed in 1972 after the liquidation of UCS.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s and 1980s the European {{shipbuilding}} suffered of a {{too high}} capacity and unhealthy competition. The Asian <b>shipbuilders</b> had grown fast and taken {{over a large}} part of the market. Combination of increasing salary costs and price dumping lead to an untenable situation for many European <b>shipbuilders.</b> Swedish <b>shipbuilders</b> had faced difficulties already in the 1970s and the yards had been kept alive through massive subsidies.|$|R
5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local <b>shipbuilder</b> and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought a small office {{in the basement of a}} Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one in the basement of the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish <b>shipbuilder</b> John Elder {{published}} an article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Kreml, {{named after}} the Kremlin, was ordered on 20 April 1863 when a {{contract}} was signed with the Russian <b>shipbuilder</b> Semiannikov & Poletika for a total cost of 898,000 rubles. Construction had not yet begun when the Russian Admiralty Board amended the contract on 20 July to shorten the construction time by one year for a payment of an extra 48,000 rubles {{in response to the}} adverse foreign reaction to the brutal Russian suppression of the revolts in Poland and Lithuania that year. Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid down until 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E

5|$|Moncton's {{shipbuilding}} era {{began in}} 1840 {{with the arrival}} of Stewart Russell, a <b>shipbuilder</b> from Hopewell. Russell built the Aginora, which sailed down the Petitcodiac River to trade at the ports in Saint John and New England. The ship and its crew sank in a storm on 24 December 1850, during a trip to Boston for Christmas. A ferry service on the Petitcodiac River was launched around 1841, thanks to a license obtained by Simon Outhouse. The Larch, built by Stephen Binney in 1845, was another important vessel, becoming the largest to sail on the river. But {{it was not until the}} arrival of Joseph Salter in 1846 that the shipbuilding boom began: a shipyard founded by Binney and Salter produced 24 vessels from 1847 to 1859, and employed almost 500 of the 1,000 inhabitants in Moncton. Salter would become the first mayor of Moncton in April 1855, the year the town was incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Romas keel {{was laid}} by the Italian <b>shipbuilder</b> Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico on 18 September 1938, {{and she was}} {{launched}} on 9 June 1940. After just over two years of fitting-out, the new battleship was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of Taranto on 21 August, and {{was assigned to the}} Ninth Naval Division. Although Roma took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, Naples, and La Spezia, in the next year, she did not go on any combat missions as the Italian Navy was desperately short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three Vittorio Venetos because the fuel shortage had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the capital ships, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|The Nathan F. Cobb was a three-masted {{schooner}} {{named after}} the <b>shipbuilder</b> and founder of Cobb’s Salvaging Company whose many rescues of stranded ships help lead {{to the formation of}} the United States Life-Saving Service. Despite its namesake's history of shipwreck rescues, the Nathan F. Cobb capsized in heavy seas on 1 December 1896 en route from Brunswick, Georgia to New York with a cargo of timber and cross ties. The cook and a shipmate drowned when they were swept overboard in violent seas. The crew righted the vessel by removing the three masts and they drifted for four days until they became grounded on a sandbar off Ormond Beach, Florida. Rescue attempts led to the drowning of volunteer Ferd Waterhouse, whose body was never recovered, but no other crew members were lost. A plaque commemorates Ferd Waterhouse’s rescue efforts. The Cobb Cottage, a structure built using materials salvaged from the ship, is part of Ormond Beach’s Historic Trail.|$|E
