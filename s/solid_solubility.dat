The smaller size of the yttrium group allows it a greater <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> in the rock-forming minerals that comprise Earth's mantle, and thus yttrium and the yttrium earths show less enrichment in Earth's crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the cerium earths.

Corresponding ore bodies for yttrium tend to be rarer, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of yttrium originates in the [...] "ion-absorption clay" [...] ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% yttrium oxide, with the heavy lanthanides being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo–Harkins rule: even-numbered heavy lanthanides at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered lanthanides at abundances of about 1% each.

The ZnO activity was calculated by graphical Gibbs-Duhem integration. The activity-composition plots of both components exhibit a strong positive deviation from ideality and are characterised by a miscibility gap.

40|$|The {{isothermal}} {{section of}} the Mg-Mn-Nd ternary diagram at 450 °C was constructed by means of experimental investigation and thermodynamic modeling. Key samples designed to cover the whole system compositions were annealed and analyzed. ICP, XRD, DSC, and SEM/EPMA experiments were applied to reveal the phase equilibria of the annealed samples. Moreover, diffusion couples were designed to present the phase relation-ships in the system. The composition profile of the diffusion layers was measured using EPMA line scan. Mn-Nd and Mg-Nd binaries were reinvestigated experimentally to overcome the shortcomings that {{pointed out in the}} literature. Besides, the sys-tem was optimized using CALPHAD methodology in the FactSage software package. The initial ternary model was ex-trapolated from the databases of its boundary binary systems. Modified quasi-chemical model was used to describe the liquid phases, sublattice model for the intermediate binary and ternary <b>solid</b> <b>solubilities,</b> and BW for terminal <b>solid</b> <b>solubilities.</b> First principle calculations were applied to calculate the heat of for-mation of the system compounds.

50|$|In a {{physical}} or geochemical system, a solvus {{is a line}} (binary system) or surface (ternary system) on a phase diagram which separates a homogeneous solid solution from a field of several phases which may form by exsolution or incongruent melting. The line determines a <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> limit which changes {{as a function of}} temperature. It is a locus of points on the equilibrium diagram. An example is the formation of perthite when an alkali feldspar is cooled down. It defines the limit of <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> in an equilibrium diagram.|$|E

The solvents include water, inorganic compounds, {{and a variety}} of organic compounds as hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, esters, and nitrogen compounds. A total 474 systems published through 1993 are compiled. For 39 systems sufficient data were available to allow critical evaluation. All data are expressed as mass and mole fractions as well as the originally reported units.

50|$|In hydride forming metals like titanium, {{zirconium}} and vanadium, {{hydrogen absorption}} causes severe embrittlement. At low concentrations of hydrogen, below the <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> limit, stress-assisted hydride formation causes the embrittlement which {{is enhanced by}} slow straining. At hydrogen concentrations above the solubility limit, brittle hydrides are precipitated on slip planes and cause severe embrittlement. This latter kind of embrittlement is encouraged by increased strain-rates, decreased temperature and {{by the presence of}} notches in the material.|$|E

50|$|SiSn can be {{obtained}} experimentally using several approaches. For small quantity of Sn in silicon, the Czochralski process is well known.Diffusion of tin into silicon has also been tried extensively in the past.Sn has the same valency and electronegativity as silicon {{and can be found}} in the diamond cubic crystal structure (α-Sn). Thus, silicon and tin meet three out of the four Hume-Rothery rules for <b>solid</b> state <b>solubility.</b> The one criterion that is not met is that of difference in atomic size. The tin atom is substantially bigger than the silicon atom (31.8%). This reduces the <b>solid</b> state <b>solubility</b> of tin in silicon.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{grades of}} tin (99.8%) resist {{transformation}} {{because of the}} inhibiting effect of the small amounts of bismuth, antimony, lead, and silver present as impurities. Alloying elements such as copper, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, and silver increase its hardness. Tin tends rather easily to form hard, brittle intermetallic phases, which are often undesirable. It does not form wide solid solution ranges in other metals in general, and few elements have appreciable <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> in tin. Simple eutectic systems, however, occur with bismuth, gallium, lead, thallium and zinc.|$|E
5000|$|Although [...] "commercially pure" [...] {{titanium}} has acceptable {{mechanical properties}} {{and has been}} used for orthopedic and dental implants, for most applications titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium, typically 6% and 4% respectively, by weight. This mixture has a <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> which varies dramatically with temperature, allowing it to undergo precipitation strengthening. This heat treatment process is carried out after the alloy has been worked into its final shape but before it is put to use, allowing much easier fabrication of a high-strength product.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the work}} done at Raytheon, optical {{properties}} in nanocomposite ceramic materials had received little attention. Their studies clearly demonstrated near theoretical transmission in nanocomposite optical ceramics for the first time. The yttria/magnesia binary system is an ideal model system for nanocomposite formation. There is limited <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> in either one of the constituent phases, permitting {{a wide range of}} compositions to be investigated and compared to each other. According to the phase diagram, bi-phase mixtures are stable for all temperatures below ~ 2100 °C. In addition, neither yttria nor magnesia shows any absorption in the 3 - 5 μm mid-range IR portion of the EM spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Dicarboxylic acids are {{crystalline}} <b>solids.</b> <b>Solubility</b> {{in water}} and melting point of the α,ω- compounds progress in a series as the carbon chains become longer with alternating between odd and even numbers of carbon atoms, so that for even numbers of carbon atoms the melting point is higher than for the next in the series with an odd number. These compounds are weak dibasic acids with pKa tending towards values of ca. 4.5 and 5.5 as the separation between the two carboxylate groups increases. Thus, in aqueous solution at pH about 7, typical of biological systems, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation indicates they exist predominantly as dicarboxylate anions.|$|R
25|$|Solubility occurs under dynamic equilibrium, {{which means}} that {{solubility}} results from the simultaneous and opposing processes of dissolution and phase joining (e.g., precipitation of <b>solids).</b> The <b>solubility</b> equilibrium occurs when the two processes proceed at a constant rate.|$|R
40|$|Formation {{energies}} and vibrational frequencies for H in wurtzite GaN were calculated from density functional theory {{and used to}} predict equilibrium state occupancies and <b>solid</b> <b>solubilities</b> for p-type, intrinsic, and n-type material. The solubility of deuterium (D) was measured at 600 [...] 800 C {{as a function of}} D{sub 2 } pressure and doping and compared with theory. Agreement was obtained by reducing the H formation energies 0. 2 eV from ab-initio theoretical values. The predicted stretch-mode frequency for H bound to the Mg acceptor lies 5 % above an observed infrared absorption attributed to this complex. It is concluded that currently recognized H states and physical processes account for the equilibrium behavior of H examined in this work...|$|R

It is manufactured from silicon dioxide and carbon in an Acheson furnace between 1600 and 2500 °C. There are 250 known crystalline forms with alpha silicon carbide the most common. Silicon itself is an important semiconductor material used in microchips. It is produced commercially from silica and carbon at 1900 °C and crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure. Germanium silicide forms a solid solution and is again a commercially used semiconductor material. The tin-silicon phase diagram is a eutectic and the lead-silicon phase diagram shows a monotectic transition and a small eutectic transition but no <b>solid</b> <b>solubility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Precipitation {{hardening}} {{relies on}} changes in <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> with temperature to produce fine particles of an impurity phase, which impede the movement of dislocations, or defects in a crystal's lattice. Since dislocations are often the dominant carriers of plasticity, this serves to harden the material. The impurities play the same role as the particle substances in particle-reinforced composite materials. Just as the formation of ice in air can produce clouds, snow, or hail, depending upon the thermal history of a given portion of the atmosphere, precipitation in solids can produce many different sizes of particles, which have radically different properties. Unlike ordinary tempering, alloys must be kept at elevated temperature for hours to allow precipitation to take place. This time delay is called [...] "aging". Solution treatment and aging is sometimes abbreviated [...] "STA" [...] in metals specs and certs.|$|E

50|$|Metals are {{insoluble}} {{in water}} or organic solvents unless they undergo a reaction with them. Typically this is an oxidation reaction that robs the metal atoms of their itinerant electrons, destroying the metallic bonding. However metals are often readily soluble in each other while retaining the metallic character of their bonding. Gold, for example, dissolves easily in mercury, even at room temperature. Even in solid metals, the solubility can be extensive. If the structures of the two metals are the same, there can even be complete <b>solid</b> <b>solubility,</b> {{as in the case}} of electrum, the alloys of silver and gold. At times, however, two metals will form alloys with different structures than either of the two parents. One could call these materials metal compounds, but, because materials with metallic bonding are typically not molecular, Dalton's law of integral proportions is not valid and often a range of stoichiometric ratios can be achieved. It is better to abandon such concepts as 'pure substance' or 'solute' is such cases and speak of phases instead. The study of such phases has traditionally been more the domain of metallurgy than of chemistry, although the two fields overlap considerably.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} a strong {{magnetic}} field on the <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> and the microsegregation during directional solidification of Al-Cu alloy at lower growth speeds (1 - 10 mu m/s) has been investigated experimentally. Results indicate that the magnetic field causes {{the reduction of the}} grain boundary and promotes the amalgamation of the grains. Further, measurement results reveal that the magnetic field increases the <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> and decreases the microsegregation. It is also found that the value of the <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> increases as the magnetic field and the temperature gradient increase. The modification of the <b>solid</b> <b>solubility</b> and the microsegregation under the magnetic field is attributed to the thermoelectric magnetic force acting on the solid and the interdendritic thermoelectric magnetic convection.
