5|$|The Denver MSA has a gross {{metropolitan}} {{product of}} $157.6 billion in 2010, {{making it the}} 18th largest metro economy in the United States. Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection {{to some of the}} country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally the Australian Army had {{relied on}} its major allies to provide {{logistic}} support, primarily raising combat units rather than support arms {{during times of}} conflict. Consequently, these services were relatively underdeveloped, and they remained so during {{the first years of}} the war. While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941, the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war. As a result, the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic, including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining. These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships, food and petroleum <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas. In addition, with Australia's national support base located well to the rear, in the major cities in the south-east of the country, significant expansion of the Army's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea. Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia, while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Butanol better tolerates water {{contamination}} and is less corrosive than ethanol and {{more suitable for}} distribution through existing pipelines for gasoline.

They erected sumptuous residences in Hama, including the Azem Palace and Khan As'ad Pasha which were built by As'ad Pasha al-Azem, who governed Hama {{for a number of years}} until 1742. By then, there were 14 caravansaries in the city, mostly used for the <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of seeds, cotton, wool, and other commodities. After the passing of the Vilayet Law in 1864, Hama became the capital of the Sanjak of Hama (gaining the city more administrative powers), part of the larger vilayet of Sham.|$|E

25|$|The Yemeni {{quality of}} life is {{affected}} by the civil war and have suffered enormous hardships. Although mines are banned by the government, the Houthi forces lie anti-personal mines in many parts of Yemen including Aden. Thousands of civilian are injured when they accidentally stepped on mines; many lose their legs and injure their eyes. In addition, the nine country coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched several airstrikes against the Houthi forces. However, strikes between 2015 and 2016 killed more than 1920 civilians and destroyed many civilian economics structures for good and food production, <b>storage,</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution.</b> Factories ceased their production and thousands of people lost their job. Due to decreased production, food, medicines, and other consumer staples became scarce. The price of these goods went up and civilian can no longer afford them for sustenance.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{industry}} {{of the later}} Industrial Revolution was gas lighting. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this {{was the work of}} William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton & Watt, the Birmingham steam engine pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution.</b> The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.|$|E
