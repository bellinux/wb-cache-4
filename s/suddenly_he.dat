5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) unwell and horribly {{discolored}} in hospital. His veins are a sickly purple hue and are pulsating ominously. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> goes into cardiac arrest {{and the doctors}} pronounce him dead.|$|E
5|$|Then <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> faltered—and the {{disturbing}} truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes a {{pregnant}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{to the hospital}} when she doubles over in pain. There, Reyes phones him {{to ask about the}} case, but Mulder cedes to the authority of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> notices something wrong with his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin.|$|E
50|$|As a new recruit of the Intrasolar Forces, Tom's life {{completely}} changes. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he's</b> someone important. He has new opportunities, friends, and a shot {{at having}} a girlfriend. But there's a price to pay...|$|R

5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared <b>suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great. Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan remarks that the warmth they feel must also have been felt by Saint Peter. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> asks if the widows have been reading the Twelve Passion Gospels to which Vasilisa replies that they have.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>suddenly</b> stiffened. <b>He</b> {{leaned forward}} into the dark, listening. This time there was no mistake. A cry, faint and pitiful though it was, reached his ears distinctly.|$|R
6000|$|Bailey's hands fell slack. <b>He</b> <b>suddenly</b> remembered something. <b>He</b> {{brushed his}} hand over his brow as if to clear his vision: ...|$|R

5|$|At school, Cartman begins farting fire, and Kyle unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{convince}} his teacher, Mr. Garrison, to excuse him from class to find his brother. When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa. Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back, propelling Kenny into the road. As he gets back up, he is trampled over by a herd of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 France met eternal arch-rivals England in the quarterfinal at Parc des Princes. Earlier in {{the year}} at Twickenham the two sides had played off for the Five Nations Grand Slam. The French scored three {{magnificent}} tries but were denied by the fearsome English forward pack. In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline. French number eight Marc Cecillon looked set to score the try that would have won the game for the French. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> was hit and driven back in a tackle from opponent Mick Skinner, a tackle which changed {{the momentum of the}} match. England went on to win 19–10 and eventually reached the Final. At the end of the match, France coach Daniel Dubroca angrily assaulted New Zealand referee David Bishop in the players tunnel. He resigned soon afterwards.|$|E
60|$|The Hon. Ojoy coughed. Then <b>he</b> <b>suddenly</b> remembered <b>he</b> {{was in the}} {{presence}} of a lady and took off his hat. Next he slid slowly into the vacant chair at the end of the table.|$|R
50|$|Author Ted Angelo discovers a UFO in the Columbian jungle. When {{he tries}} to spread the word, he earns {{more than the usual}} disbelief: <b>suddenly</b> <b>he's</b> hunted by almost every organization, like CIA, KGB, the mob, Nazis... and even extraterrestrials - Those ETs {{obviously}} do not want to go home.|$|R
60|$|The man's eyes <b>suddenly</b> opened. <b>He</b> was feverishly, frantically anxious.|$|R
5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
25|$|On January 5, 1900, four friends {{arrive for}} a dinner at the London home of their {{inventor}} friend George (Rod Taylor), {{but he is not}} there. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> arrives, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins to describe the strange experiences he has had since the group last met.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} and {{regarded}} the table thoughtfully. There were ink stains upon it, and <b>he</b> <b>suddenly</b> discovered that <b>he</b> was fond of it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> drew rein <b>suddenly</b> as <b>he</b> came {{abreast of}} the group, so <b>suddenly</b> that <b>he</b> pulled his horse until it almost sat down like a cat; yet he {{retained}} his saddle. Then he came through the snow that was all squelched and mudded just about the forge, and leered at Sir Oliver.|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} <b>suddenly</b> immovable. <b>He</b> {{turned his head}} very slightly.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the factors}} that caused Sir Alan to fire Matthew was his confrontational {{attitude}} with other candidates, affecting the unity of any team he was part of. This was noted during a fight with Tim from First Forte, when <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> made a baseless accusation about Tim stealing their equipment.|$|E
25|$|While {{he was in}} the Nice prison, Calderone became {{convinced}} {{that he was about to}} be killed by other Sicilian inmates. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> began screaming for a prison guard and demanded to see the head of the prison.

Mrs Sturt was granted a civil list pension of £80 a year, and the queen granted her the title of Lady Sturt as if her husband's nomination to a knighthood {{of the order of}} St Michael and St George had been gazetted. Reproductions of portraits by Crossland and Koberwein will be found in Mrs N. G. Sturt's Life, which suggest the charm and refinement of Sturt's character.|$|E
25|$|Despite poor health, Grand Duke Andrei {{lived to}} be 77 years old, an age reached by few in the Romanov family.

Having finished a letter on his typewriter, he felt dizzy, went to his bed to lie down and died <b>suddenly.</b> <b>He</b> was buried wearing the uniform of the Horse Guard Artillery Brigade, which he had commanded during World War I.
