40|$|A novel {{technique}} is presented based on self-organizing neural networks for prediction of fertilizer distribution patterns of spreaders {{as a function}} of spreader settings and fertilizer properties. The main aim of the presented {{technique is}} to predict tendencies in the <b>spreading</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern {{as a function of}} machine configurations and physical fertilizer properties. The Self-Organizing Map is used in a novel way to represent input-output relationships between high-dimensional spaces. Other NN methods {{would be very difficult to}} use because of the high dimensions of the input and output spaces. In the case of a multilayer perceptron, the global connectivity would lead to a prohibitively large number of free parameters giving rise to learning time problems. The <b>spreading</b> <b>distribution</b> patterns are predicted with a high performance with the proposed technique. (C) 2003 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Understanding {{the cement}} {{injection}} behaviour in cancellous bone and accurately predicting the cement placement within the vertebral body is extremely challenging. We propose a novel method using reproducible and pathologically representative 2 D and 3 D bone surrogates to help study {{the influence of}} cement properties on injection behaviour. Bespoke methodology was developed to control the injection volume and flow rate, measure the injection pressure, and allow visualization and quantitative analysis of the <b>spreading</b> <b>distribution.</b> Morphology analysis showed that the variability in the 2 D and 3 D bone surrogates was very low, indicating that the geometrical structure of the surrogates was constant. The overall pore size of the surrogates was {{very similar to that}} reported for human osteoporotic vertebral cancellous bone, indicating that the surrogates were pathologically representative. Injections performed into the 3 D surrogates revealed that an increase in the fluid starting viscosity significantly increases the injection pressure in all surrogates, decreases the risk of leakage for osteoporosis surrogates only, decreases the mean spreading distance for multiple myeloma surrogates only and increases the sphericity causing a more uniform spreading pattern for the metastasis surrogates only. Injections performed into the 2 D surrogates highlighted the influence of cement formulations and model structure on the injection behaviour and showed that (i) cements with similar composition/particle size have similar flow behaviour, (ii) cements with a high liquid-to-powder ratio cause irregular filling patterns and have a high risk of leakage, and (iii) the injection behaviour of certain cement formulations improves in the presence of lesion or fracture, suggesting the notion of pathology specific bone cements. The developed methodology provides a fast, robust tool for discerning subtle differences in bone cement formulations and allows comprehensive assessment of cement flow behaviour through controlling the surrogate morphology, controlling the injection parameters, measuring the injection pressure, and allowing the visualization and quantitative analysis of the <b>spreading</b> <b>distribution.</b> The advantage of this methodology is that it provides a clinically relevant representation of cement flow patterns and a tool for validating computational simulations...|$|E

Seventyseven amphibians belonging to four species were sampled in four regions of Transylvania: Sighisoara, Corund, Miercurea-Ciuc and Apuseni Mountains. Infected individuals were found in Sighisoara and Apuseni. Long term studies in Sighisoara region suggests that no unusual mass mortality occurs in the amphibian populations sampled for this study.

40|$|Understanding {{the cement}} flow {{behaviour}} and accurately predicting the cement placement within the vertebral body is extremely challenging. Vertebral cancellous bone displays highly complex geometrical structures and architectural inhomogeneities over {{a range of}} length scales, thus making the scientific understanding of the cement injection behaviour difficult in clinical or cadaveric studies. Previous experimental studies on cement flow have used open-porous aluminum foam to represent osteoporotic bone. Although the porosity was well controlled, the geometrical structure {{of each of the}} foams was inherently unique. This paper presents novel methodology using customized, reproducible and pathologically representative three-dimensional bone surrogates to help study biomaterial–biofluid interaction. The aim was to provide a robust tool for comprehensive assessment of biomaterial injection behaviour through controlling the bone surrogate morphology and the injection parameters (i. e. needle gauge, needle placement, flow rate and injected volume), measuring the injection pressure, and allowing the visualization and quantitative analysis of the <b>spreading</b> <b>distribution.</b> This methodology provides a clinically relevant representation of cement flow patterns and a tool for validating computational simulations...|$|E
40|$|For small samples, classi# er design {{algorithms}} typically {{suffer from}} over# tting. Given {{a set of}} features, a classi# er must be designed and its error estimated. For small samples, an error estimator may be unbiased but, owing to a large variance, often give very optimistic estimates. This paper proposes mitigating the small-sample problem by designing classi# ers from a probability distribution resulting from spreading {{the mass of the}} sample points to make classi# cation more dif# cult, while maintaining sample geometry. The algorithm is parameterized by the variance of the <b>spreading</b> <b>distribution.</b> By increasing the spread, the algorithm # nds gene sets whose classi# cation accuracy remains strong relative to greater spreading of the sample. The error gives a measure of the strength of the feature set {{as a function of the}} spread. The algorithm yields feature sets that can distinguish the two classes, not only for the sample data, but for distributions spread beyond the sample data. For linear classi# ers, the topic of the present paper, the classi# ers are derived analytically from the model, thereby providing an enormous savings in computation time. The algorithm is applied to cancer classi# cation via cDNA microarrays. In particular, the genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are associated with a hereditary disposition to breast cancer, and the algorithm is used to # nd gene sets whose expressions can be used to classify BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 tumors...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} to {{localize}} and characterize coherently distributed (CD) sources in near-field. Indeed, {{it appears that}} in some applications, the more the sources {{are close to the}} array of sensors, the more they can seem scattered. It thus appears of the biggest importance {{to take into account the}} angular distribution of the sources in the joint direction of arrival (DOA) and range estimation methods. The methods of the literature which consider the problem of distributed sources do not handle with the case of near field sources and require that the shape of the dispersion is known. The main contribution of the proposed method is to estimate the shape of the angular distribution using an additional shape parameter to address the case of unknown distributions. We propose to jointly estimate the DOA, the range, the spread angle and the shape of the <b>spread</b> <b>distribution.</b> Accurate estimation is then achieved even when the shape of the angular <b>spread</b> <b>distribution</b> is unknown or imperfectly known. Moreover, the proposed estimator improves angular resolution of the sources...|$|R
