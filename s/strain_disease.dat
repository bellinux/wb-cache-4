40|$|Influenza A and B infections cause {{significant}} {{morbidity and}} mortality. Over the past 30 years, two main influenza B strains have been circulating globally. The trivalent influenza vaccine {{used in the}} last 25 years contains one B strain, with approximately 31 % of B <b>strain</b> <b>disease</b> coverage over the last 10 years. Fluarix quadrivalent vaccine, containing two A and two B strains, combines the components of two existing trivalent vaccines to prevent this mismatch. This review gives {{an overview of the}} published data about Fluarix quadrivalent vaccines, showing an immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine comparable with the two licensed trivalent vaccines containing the same strains, but with no evidence for efficacy in the literature.

40|$|Two {{studies of}} adult volunteers were {{performed}} to determine whether prior enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection confers protective immunity against rechallenge. In the first study, a naive control group and volunteers who had previously ingested an O 55 :H 6 strain were fed an O 127 :H 6 strain. In the second study, a control group and volunteers who had previously ingested either the O 127 :H 6 strain or an isogenic eae deletion mutant of that strain were challenged with the homologous wild-type strain. There was no significant effect of prior infection on the incidence of diarrhea in either study. However, in the homologous-rechallenge study, disease was significantly milder in the group previously challenged with the wild-type <b>strain.</b> <b>Disease</b> severity was inversely correlated {{with the level of}} prechallenge serum immunoglobulin G against the O 127 lipopolysaccharide.

Alternative BCG vaccination strategies may improve protection in model species, including rhesus macaques. This study compares the immunogenicity {{and efficacy of}} BCG administered by ID and intravenous (IV) injection, or as an intratracheal mucosal boost (ID + IT), against aerosol challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Erdman <b>strain.</b> <b>Disease</b> pathology was significantly reduced, and survival improved, by each BCG vaccination strategy, relative to unvaccinated animals. However, IV induced protection surpassed that achieved by all other routes, providing an opportunity to explore protective immunological mechanisms using antigen-specific IFN-γ ELISpot and polychromatic flow cytometry assays. IFN-γ spot forming units and multifunctional CD 4 T-cell frequencies increased significantly following each vaccination regimen and were greatest following IV immunisation. Vaccine-induced multifunctional CD 4 T-cells producing IFN-γ and TNF-α were associated with reduced disease pathology following subsequent M. tb challenge; however, high frequencies of this population following M. tb infection correlated with increased pathology. Cytokine producing T-cells primarily occupied the CD 4 transitional effector memory phenotype, implicating this population as central to the mycobacterial response, potentially contributing to the stringent control observed in IV vaccinated animals. This study demonstrates the protective efficacy of IV BCG vaccination in rhesus macaques, offering a valuable tool for the interrogation of immunological mechanisms and potential correlates of protection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Currently in the U. S. it is {{recommended}} that tuberculosis screening and treatment programs be targeted at high-risk populations. While a strategy of targeted testing and treatment of persons most likely to develop tuberculosis is attractive, it is uncertain how best to accomplish this goal. In this study we seek to identify geographical areas where on-going tuberculosis transmission is occurring by linking Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology with molecular surveillance. Methods This cross-sectional analysis was performed on data collected on persons newly diagnosed with culture positive tuberculosis at the Tarrant County Health Department (TCHD) between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2000. Clinical isolates were molecularly characterized using IS 6110 -based RFLP analysis and spoligotyping methods to identify patients infected with the same strain. Residential addresses at the time of diagnosis of tuberculosis were geocoded and mapped according to strain characterization. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis models were used to identify risk factors involved in clustering. Results Evaluation of the spatial distribution of cases within zip-code boundaries identified distinct areas of geographical distribution of same <b>strain</b> <b>disease.</b> We identified these geographical areas as having increased likelihood of on-going transmission. Based on this evidence we plan to perform geographically based screening and treatment programs. Conclusion Using GIS analysis combined with molecular epidemiological surveillance may be an effective method for identifying instances of local transmission. These methods can be used to enhance targeted screening and control efforts, with the goal of interruption of disease transmission and ultimately incidence reduction. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) {{is a major}} tomato {{virus in}} {{tropical}} and subtropical regions. The resistance to TYLCV disease in the tomato accession FLA 456 and the breeding line CLN 2498 E was analysed by screening the parents, F 1 and BC 1 F 1 population using a sequence tagged site (STS) marker, linked to Ty- 2 gene, T 0302, at the Biotechnology and Molecular Breeding Unit of the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre (AVRDC), the World Vegetable Centre at Taiwan. Results showed that CLN 2498 E carried Ty- 2 gene and FLA 456 did not carry it. The BC 1 F 1 plants segregated for Ty- 2 gene in a ratio of 46 : 66 which is closed to 1 : 1 (χ= 3. 33, P< 0. 05), which indicated that Ty- 2 gene was simply inherited. The phenotypic screening showed that the breeding line CLN 2498 E was susceptible to TYLCV-Thailand strain although it carried the Ty- 2 locus. The accession FLA 456 was tolerant to TYLCV-Thailand strain. Although the F 1 plants carried the Ty- 2 locus, with heterozygous alleles, they showed tolerance to TYLCV-Thailand <b>strain</b> <b>disease.</b> All the plants in the BC 1 F 1 bearing the two bands 900 bp and 800 bp were tolerant to the disease, while others with only 900 bp were susceptible. The results concluded that CLN 2498 E carries Ty- 2 gene and does not resistant to TYLCV-Thailand strain whereas FLA 456 does not carry Ty- 2 gene and resistant to TYLCV-Thailand strain...|$|E
40|$|In {{male athletes}} from {{different}} sports, isokinetic knee extensor, and in orienteers also plantar flexor peak torque (PT), contractional work (CW) and integrated surface electromyograms (iEMG) were analysed. Single contraction PT, CW and iEMG in sprinters and marathon runners were signi­ficantly correlated to the cross-sectional area (CSA) of m. quadriceps, {{and to the}} Type II fibre area of m. vastus lateralis. When correcting PT, CW and iEMG for CSA of m. quadriceps, such correlations were found only for Type IIA fibre area at 180 ° s~ 1. Elec- tromyographically, m. vastus lateralis (biopsied muscle) was representative for m. quadriceps. Calculated optimal mean power (CW s~ 1) and electrical efficacy (CW/iEMG) approximated for sprinters 450 ° s- 1 and for marathon runners 270 ° s~ 1, i. e. velocities {{at or above the}} upper limit of the dynamometers. In orienteers, plantar flexor PT increased during winter training, but decreased during competitive season. Knee extensor PT increased over the whole year. At 30 and 60 ° s~ 1 only knee extensor PT was negatively associated with the running velocity at onset of blood lactate accu­mulation (VOBLA) - Changes in VOBLA during winter period were negatively associated with changes in knee extensor PT at 180 ° s~ 1. During competitive season, changes in Vobla were negatively associated with the ratio quality : quantity running. In ice hockey players PT varied non-systematically with training and games. The biopsy specimens of marathon runners showed irregular fibre shapes, an in­creased amount of connective tissue and central fibre nuclei, indicating an early <b>strain</b> <b>disease</b> or functional adaptation to extreme demands. During repetitive contractions in sprinters and marathon runners, fatigue, i. e. slope of decline in CW, was significantly associated with the Type II fibre area of m. vastus lateralis. For knee extensors of sprinters, ice hockey players and orienteers, a steep de­crease in CW/iEMG was observed. In contrast, knee extensors of marathon runners and plantar flexors of orienteers showed an almost unaltered CW/iEMG throughout the test. The knee extensor endurance level (CW/iEMG) was significantly correlated to the maximal oxygen uptake. In orienteers, an increase in endurance level of both tested muscle groups during winter training parallelled an increase in VOBLA and V 02 obla- In hockey players, fatigue and endurance pattern (CW and CW/iEMG) changed non-systematically with training and games. In conclusion, isokinetic measurements and iEMG reflect the structural properties of the knee extensor muscles in sprinters and marathon runners. The demonstrated characteristics and changes in leg muscle function in different groups of athletes apparently reflect varying demands from different sports activities.

Plasmid pIH 120 was constructed, which contains the gene cluster that codes for adhesive F 107 fimbriae. The major fimbrial subunit gene, fedA, was sequenced. An {{open reading frame}} that codes for a protein with 170 amino acids, including a 21 -amino-acid signal peptide, was found. The protein without the signal sequence has a calculated molecular mass of 15, 099 Da. Construction of a nonsense mutation in the open reading frame of fedA abolished both fimbrial expression {{and the capacity to}} adhere to isolated porcine intestinal villi. In a screening of 28 reference edema <b>disease</b> <b>strains</b> and isolates from clinically ill piglets, fedA was detected in 24 cases (85. 7 %). In 20 (83. 3 %) of these 24 strains, fedA was found in association with Shiga-like toxin II variant genes, coding for the toxin that is characteristic for edema <b>disease</b> <b>strains</b> of E. coli. The fimbrial subunit gene was not detected in enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. Because of the capacity of E. coli HB 101 (pIH 120) transformants to adhere to isolated porcine intestinal villi, the high prevalence of fedA in edema <b>disease</b> <b>strains,</b> and the high correlation with the Shiga-like toxin II variant toxin-encoding genes, we suggest that F 107 fimbriae are an important virulence factor in edema <b>disease</b> <b>strains</b> of E. coli...|$|R

Objective: To profile genomic signatures and antiviral drug resistance of A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 viruses and to discuss the potential role of mutated residues in human host adaptation and virulence. Study design: A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 viruses circulating in Portugal during pandemic and post-pandemic periods and 2009 / 2010 season. Viruses were isolated in MDCK-SIAT 1 cell culture and subjected to mutation analysis of surface and internal proteins, and to antiviral drug susceptibility profiling. Results: The A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 strains circulating during the epidemic period in Portugal were resistant to amantadine. The majority of the strains {{were found to be}} susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir, with five outliers to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) identified. Specific mutation patterns were detected within the functional domains of internal proteins PB 2, PB 1, PA, NP, NS 1, M 1 and NS 2 /NEP, which were common to all isolates and also some cluster-specific. Discussion: Modification of viral genome transcription, replication and apoptosis kinetics, changes in antigenicity and antiviral drug susceptibility are known determinants of virulence.

40|$|Fusarium wilt diseases, {{caused by}} the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, lead to {{significant}} yield losses of crops. One strategy to control fusarium wilt {{is the use of}} antagonistic, root-colonizing Pseudomonas spp. It has been demonstrated that different strains of these bacteria suppress disease by different mechanisms. Therefore, application of a mixture of these biocontrol strains, and thus of several suppressive mechanisms, may represent a viable control strategy. A prerequisite for biocontrol by combinations of biocontrol agents can be the compatibility of the co-inoculated micro-organisms. Hence, compatibility between several Pseudomonas spp. strains, that have the ability to suppress fusarium wilt of radish, was tested in vitro on KB agar plates. Growth of P. fluorescens strain RS 111 was strongly inhibited by Pseudomonas spp. strains RE 8, RS 13, RS 56 and RS 158, whereas a mutant of strain RS 111 (RS 111 -a) was insensitive to inhibition by these strains. Strains RS 111 and RS 111 -a only slightly inhibited some other strains. Suppression of fusarium wilt of radish in a potting soil bioassay by the incompatible combination of RE 8 and RS 111 was comparable to the effects of the single <b>strains.</b> However, <b>disease</b> suppression by the compatible combination of RE 8 and RS 111 -a was significantly better as compared to the single strains. In contrast, the incompatible combination of RS 56 with RS 111 resulted in enhanced disease suppression as compared to the single <b>strains.</b> Increased <b>disease</b> suppression by combinations of RS 13 or RS 158 with RS 111 or RS 111 -a was not observed.
