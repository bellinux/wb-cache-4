5|$|A crucial safety {{aspect of}} {{international}} airports is medical facilities and practices. In particular, controlling transmissible disease, such as SARS, is deemed important at international airports. While these <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> regulated by ICAO Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs) and WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), local authorities have considerable say {{in how they}} are implemented.|$|E
5|$|Academic <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> high: 93% of GCSE {{students}} attain A*-C grades; {{there is}} a 100% pass rate at A-Level; and 100% of A-Level leavers take up places at universities (10% to Oxbridge) or on gap year schemes. The school's most recent inspection rated much of the education and pastoral provision as 'outstanding'.|$|E
5|$|Seven athletes {{qualified}} in {{the swimming}} events - six in individual events and one (Keren Siebner) in the relay events. The qualifying <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> up {{to a maximum}} of 2 swimmers in each event at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST).|$|E
50|$|This <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> {{superseded}} in 2001 by American National Standard T1.523-2001, Telecom Glossary 2000, {{which is}} published by ATIS. The old <b>standard</b> <b>is</b> still frequently used, because the new <b>standard</b> <b>is</b> not in the public domain.|$|R

5|$|The journal has {{developed}} {{standards for the}} publication of mouse mutant studies. Many mouse mutant studies have serious methodological problems leading to fatally flawed scientific conclusions, causing a waste of time, effort, and research resources, and leading to ethical problems because of the unnecessary use of live animals for flawed studies. These <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> gradually being accepted more widely in the field.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{great deal}} of variety among Labradors.

5|$|A unique form of {{circulating}} specie is {{the fuel}} ration coupon, {{which has been}} issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 5, 10, 20, 25, & 50 litres of petrol (gasoline), kerosene and/or diesel, and translate roughly into the local petrol price (about 1 UK pound sterling per litre or US$1.50 in late 2008). Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency. As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals, and laws and <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E

5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|Jazz <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> musical {{compositions}} {{that are}} widely known, performed and recorded by jazz artists {{as part of}} the genre's musical repertoire.

5|$|The Taiwan North-South High Speed Rail Project {{was awarded}} the first prize for the “Outstanding Civil Engineering Project Award” by the Asian Civil Engineering Coordination Council (ACECC) in Sydney on 10 August 2010. The project's award {{indicates}} that Taiwan's engineering <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> gaining international recognition, and THSRC, running through {{the northern and southern}} region of Taiwan, has overcome the problems of topography and other technical challenges.|$|E
5|$|The nominal working {{pressure}} {{is not necessarily}} the same as the actual {{working pressure}} used. Some steel cylinders manufactured to US <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E

5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux {{tapestry}}, <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; {{as one of the}} combatants at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E
5|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Developed as an {{all-around}} farm and riding horse in eastern Kentucky, it {{is related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds. In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain Horse Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns. Conformation <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> the same for the two groups of horses, with the main difference being the color requirements. The KMSHA studbook is now closed to horses from unregistered parents, although it cross-registers with several other registries, while the SMHA studbook remains open.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E
