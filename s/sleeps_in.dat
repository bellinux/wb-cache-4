5|$|After Nana and Nunung fight, their guardians {{decide that}} it is best for Nunung to go the home of her uncle Tamsil (Usmar Ismail) in Bandung and rest. While there, Nunung writes a letter to her father that Joni kisses her goodnight every day. This news sparks Nenny's titillation and Toto's jealousy. Nana insists that Toto choose between her and Nunung; Toto decides to go to Bandung and protest Joni's impropriety. He confronts Nunung and confesses his love for her. She spitefully tells him that she <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> the same room as Joni every night.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
25|$|There are {{significant}} similarities between <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> birds and <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> mammals, {{which is one}} of the reasons for the idea that <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> higher animals with its division into REM and NREM sleep has evolved together with warm-bloodedness. Birds compensate for <b>sleep</b> loss <b>in</b> a manner similar to mammals, by deeper or more intense SWS (slow-wave sleep).|$|R
60|$|Is {{not that}} one thought that our beloved ones <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Christ Jesus enough? They <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Jesus, and {{therefore}} in infinite tenderness, sympathy, care, and love. They <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Jesus; and He is the Life, and therefore they <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Life. They <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Jesus; and He is the Light, and therefore they <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Light. They <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Jesus; and He is Love, and therefore they <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Love. And what better? This is better--that they who <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Jesus must surely awaken. For, as it is written, His is a quickening, awakening, life-giving Spirit, and so to <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Him is to <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> the very fount and core of life and power. If from Jesus all our powers and talents come here on earth, surely He will give us more and nobler, when we <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Him, and wake in Him to a risen and eternal life. And more, it is written that them that <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> Jesus will He bring with Him. At the last day we shall see face to face those we loved--and before that--oh! doubt it not. Oftentimes when Christ draws near our spirits He comes not alone, but loving souls, souls whom we knew in the flesh on earth, bear up His train, and hover near our hearts and join their whispers to the voice and inspiration of Him who loved us, and who will guide us with counsel here, and after that receive us into glory, where we shall meet those beloved ones--not as our forefathers dreamed, as meagre shadows flitting through dreary and formless chaos--but as we knew them once--the body of the flesh alone put off, but the real body, the spiritual body to which flesh and blood was but a husk and shell, living and loving more fully, more utterly, than even before, because it is in Christ who is the fount of life, and freed in Him for ever from hell and death.|$|R

5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role. The deputy of a Clan is {{generally}} in charge of less urgent, but still important duties, such as deciding which cats will go on a hunting patrol and which will check the borders. Although the Clan deputy still <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E
5|$|During {{a festival}} honoring Spider-Man, Peter kisses Gwen Stacy, infuriating Mary Jane. The superpowered Marko robs an armored car, and Peter confronts him. Marko easily subdues Peter, and escapes. NYPD Captain George Stacy informs Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's true killer; the {{deceased}} Dennis Carradine was Marko's accomplice. While a vengeance-obsessed Peter <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> his Spider-Man suit, the symbiote assimilates his suit. Peter later awakens and discovers his costume changed and his powers enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out Peter's dark side. Wearing the new suit, Peter locates Marko and battles {{him in a}} subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Peter breaks a water pipe, causing water to reduce Marko into mud, washing him away and believing him to be dead.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>in</b> some {{invertebrates}} {{has also}} been extensively studied, e.g., <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> fruitflies (Drosophila) and honeybees. Some of the mechanisms of <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> these animals have been discovered while others remain quite obscure. The features defining sleep have been identified for the most part, and like mammals, this includes reduced reaction to sensory input, lack of motor response {{in the form of}} antennal immobility, etc.|$|R
25|$|In {{the weeks}} after a human baby is born, as its nervous system matures, neural {{patterns}} <b>in</b> <b>sleep</b> begin to show a rhythm of REM and non-REM <b>sleep.</b> (<b>In</b> faster-developing mammals this process occurs in utero.) Infants spend more time <b>in</b> REM <b>sleep</b> than adults. The proportion of REM sleep then decreases significantly in childhood. Older people tend to sleep less overall but <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> REM for about the same absolute time, and therefore spend {{a greater proportion of}} <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> REM.|$|R
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E

5|$|Back {{in present-day}} Washington D.C., Scully brings to Mulder's {{attention}} news about a body found in New Jersey with its arm and shoulder missing. Upon {{arriving at the}} Atlantic City morgue, Scully and Mulder discover that the body was eaten by a human. However, the local detective, Thompson, denies the agents access to the investigation. Scully returns to Washington to attend her godson's birthday party, while Mulder stays in New Jersey. At the party, Scully meets Rob, the divorced father {{of one of the}} guests. Meanwhile, Mulder questions homeless people about the case. A man shows him a drawing of a humanoid and tells him that he saw it and that the other homeless people and cops know about it. Mulder gives his hotel room key to the man and <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> the alley, where he sees a shadowy, human-like creature. He chases the creature, but is arrested before he can catch it.|$|E
5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} department features Angela Martin, an admitted uptight and hypocritical woman {{who wishes to}} keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible; Kevin Malone, a lovable, but dim-witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and M and Oscar Martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't like {{to take part in}} time wasting meetings and sometimes <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration across the hall from the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, and often the target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fiancé Roy Anderson, who was fired in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E

25|$|This {{description}} is strongly {{reminiscent of a}} common brushtail possum which despite being primarily arboreal <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> burrows or dens. It usually forages in trees but this is more subject to food availability than a genuine preference of this voracious and quite indiscriminate carnivore. They have wreaked havoc among New Zealand's unwary reptiles and (often semi-terrestrial) birds. While the introduced species seems a near-perfect match, {{it is not known}} to have been established until 1858; it was numerous enough to be encountered in many places from 1860 at the earliest.|$|E
25|$|The Indiana bat is an {{important}} predator within the Great Plains. The Indiana bat perpetuates biodiversity by consuming moths, mosquitoes, and flies under the night sky. This bat <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> abandoned caves and mines {{during the winter months}} for hibernation and under tree bark during the warmer seasons. This Indiana bat is endangered mainly due to human disturbance within the caves. However, help is underway to protect this species. Besides showing hospitality to these bats, gates are going up to prohibit visitors from entering the caves and mines during the hibernation months. Studies are also ensuing to try and discover other factors diminishing the Indiana bat’s population.|$|E
25|$|Tiangong-1's {{experimental}} module {{is equipped}} with exercise gear and two sleep stations. The interior walls of the spacecraft have a two-color paint scheme – one color representative of the ground, and the other representative of the sky. This is intended to help the astronauts maintain their orientation in zero gravity. High-resolution interior cameras allow manned missions to be closely monitored from the ground, and the two sleep stations have individual lighting controls. Toilet facilities and cooking equipment for the manned missions are provided by the docked Shenzhou spacecraft, rather than being integrated into the Tiangong module itself. Similarly, {{one member of the}} module's three-person crew <b>sleeps</b> <b>in</b> the Shenzhou spacecraft, preventing overcrowding.|$|E
