Models of such media {{are based on the}} multiconductor transmission line theory. In this paper, we apply a statistical approach in order to estimate the <b>level</b> of <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> on a low voltage distribution network. First, we describe how a test network can be modelled by means of the electromagnetic topology method used inside the CRIPTE code developed by the French Aerospace Lab (ONERA). We have chosen the classical TT earthing scheme. Then we explain how connected loads are characterized. After showing how uncertainty in the geometry of the cable bundle and variability of connected loads can {{have an effect on the}} <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> <b>levels</b> from 1 MHz to 100 MHz, the influence of both factors (geometry of cable bundle and variability of loads) has been studied. Then, the statistics of the extreme values of <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> has been derived. Last, the hierarchy of those factors has been discussed...|$|R

It is demonstrated that about − 20 dBc of in-RF-band spurious level can be tolerated. For out-of-RF-band spurious, on the other hand, a level of about − 15 to − 10 dBc can be tolerated depending on the frequency separation between the LO and the <b>spurious</b> <b>signal.</b> Index Terms — Heterodyne detection, saturation, spuriou...|$|R

When a signal is received, additional <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> are produced within the receiver because it is not truly a linear device. When these <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> have a power level that is less than the thermal noise power level, then the receiver is operating normally. When these <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> have a power level that is higher than the thermal noise floor, then the receiver is desensitized.

50|$|In {{case of a}} radio {{receiver}} application, the definition is slightly different. The reference is the minimum detectable <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> at the input of a receiver, which can be calculated through {{a knowledge of the}} noise figure and the input signal bandwidth of the receiver or the system. The difference between this value and the input level which will produce distortion products equal to the minimum detectable signal referred to the input of the system is the SFDR of the system. However, this procedure is mainly reliable for ADCs. In RF systems where output <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> are nonlinear function of input power, more precise measurement is required to take into account this non-linearity in power.|$|R

In practice, such intermittent chaotic operations can be eliminated by incorporating appropriate design measures to combat interference of <b>spurious</b> <b>signals.</b> In this paper, we explain the mechanism that causes "intermittent" chaos in a popular type of switching converters, namely, current-mode controlled switching converters. The circuit model used to study the phenomenon incorporates a coupling process through which a <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> is coupled to the current sensing and ramp compensation circuitry, resulting in a modulation of the compensation slope which causes the system to become unstable intermittently.

The {{received}} signal {{may contain}} {{not only the}} desired signal and white noise but also some <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> and interference. The <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> may be generated by Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) due to its nonlinearity [79] or other intentional/unintentional transmitters. If the sensing antenna is near some electronic devices, the <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> generated by the devices can be strong in the received signal. For some sensing methods, such unwanted signals will be detected as signals rather than noise. This will increase the probability of false alarm. There are methods to mitigate the <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> at the device <b>level</b> [79]. Alternatively, <b>signal</b> processing techniques {{can be used to}} eliminate the impact of spurious signal/interference [53]. It is very difficult, if possible, to estimate the interference waveform or distribution because of its variation with time and location. Depending on situations, the interference power could be lower or higher than the noise power. If the interference power is much higher than the noise power, it is possible to estimate the interference first and subtract it from the received signal. However, since we usually intend to detect signal at very low SNR, the error of the interference estimation could be large enough (say, larger than the primary signal) such that the detection with the residue signal after the interference subtraction is still unreliable. If the interference power is low, it is hard to estimate it anyway. Hence, in general we cannot rely on the interference estimation and subtraction, especially for very low-power signal detection.|$|R
40|$|Background: Delusions of {{reference}} (DOR) are {{a group of}} highly prevalent psychotic symptoms. In DOR, patients experience attentional capture by certain otherwise neutral aspects in the environment, which were regarded as self-referential. Theoretically, aberrant salience {{as a result of}} excessive dopamine firing may lead to <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection in patients with DOR. We test the hypothesis that patients presenting with and DOR have increased false alarms in a visual and an auditory signal detection task, compared with patients not experiencing the symptom and with healthy controls. Methods: A total of 32 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (mean age 24. 3 ± 6. 9 years, 19 men) and 17 healthy controls (mean age 24. 7 ± 7. 7 years, 9 men) were recruited. Controls and patients were matched in age, sex and education. Patients were further divided into a DOR group (n= 15) and a non-DOR group (n= 17). DOR was assessed using the Ideas of Reference Interview Scale (IRIS). <b>Spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection was tested using the randomized and sequential Contour Integration Test (Field, Hayes, and Hess 1993) for visual processing and the Babble Task (Hoffman et al, 2007) for auditory processing. Performance was compared between groups using ANOVA and post-Hoc analysis. Signal detection analyses were carried out to differentiate between genuine <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection and response bias. Relationship between IRIS scores and false alarm rates was explored. Results: <b>Spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection was observed in both DOR groups and healthy controls in low signal-to-noise trials. In the Contour Integration Test, patients with DOR were more likely to detect <b>spurious</b> <b>signals</b> particularly when the stimuli were presented at a moderate signaltonoise ratio compared with the other two groups (p< 0. 01), with an effect size of 1. 11 (Cohen’s d). False alarms are correlated with DOR severity (r= 0. 39, p< 0. 01). All three groups demonstrated good sensitivity and conservative response in signal detection. A similar trend was seen in the Babble Task. Discussion: <b>Spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection is a common phenomenon under noisy conditions, which can be elicited also in healthy subjects. In DOR, there appears to be increased <b>spurious</b> <b>signal</b> detection, at a moderate signal-to-noise ratio. This observation cannot be accounted for by a general decline in task performance or a more liberal response bias, suggesting genuine false detection of signals in patients with DOR.
