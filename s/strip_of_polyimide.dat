40|$|Locating low {{frequency}} radio observatories on {{the lunar surface}} {{has a number of}} advantages, including positional stability and a very low ionospheric radio cutoff. Here, we describe the Radio Observatory on the lunar Surface for Solar studies (ROLSS), a concept for a {{low frequency}}, radio imaging interferometric array designed to study particle acceleration in the corona and inner heliosphere. ROLSS would be deployed during an early lunar sortie or by a robotic rover as part of an unmanned landing. The preferred site is on the lunar near side to simplify the data downlink to Earth. The prime science mission is to image type II and type III solar radio bursts with the aim of determining the sites at and mechanisms by which the radiating particles are accelerated. Secondary science goals include constraining the density of the lunar ionosphere by measuring the low radio frequency cutoff of the solar radio emissions or background galactic radio emission, measuring the flux, particle mass, and arrival direction of interplanetary and interstellar dust, and constraining the low energy electron population in astrophysical sources. Furthermore, ROLSS serves a pathfinder function for larger lunar radio arrays. Key design requirements on ROLSS include the operational frequency and angular resolution. The electron densities in the solar corona and inner heliosphere are such that the relevant emission occurs below 10 M Hz, essentially unobservable from Earth's surface due to the terrestrial ionospheric cutoff. Resolving the potential sites of particle acceleration requires an instrument with an angular resolution of at least 2 deg at 10 MHz, equivalent to a linear array size of approximately one kilometer. The major components of the ROLSS array are 3 antenna arms, each of 500 m length, arranged in a Y formation, with a central electronics package (CEP) at their intersection. Each antenna arm is a linear <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyimide</b> film (e. g., Kapton(TradeMark)) on which 16 single polarization dipole antennas are located by depositing a conductor (e. g., silver). The arms also contain transmission lines for carrying the radio signals from the science antennas to the CEP. Operations would consist of data acquisition during the lunar day, with data downlinks to Earth one or more times every 24 hours...|$|E

In this work, {{the effects}} of atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>polyimide</b> films on surface and dielectric characteristics were studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface free energies, and dielectric spectrometer.

40|$|A {{series of}} homo- and copolyimides based on mixed thioetherdiphthalic {{anhydride}} isomers (mixed-TDPA) were synthesized with {{several kinds of}} aromatic diamines. The properties <b>of</b> these <b>polyimides</b> were characterized by glass transition temperature (Tg), thermal decomposition temperature, and melt processability. A series of copolyimides were prepared to achieve high Tg concurrently with melt processability by means of selecting appropriate diamines and their composition in the copolyimides. As a result, we obtained rheological information for a series <b>of</b> <b>polyimide</b> resins {{as a function of}} temperature, time and shear rate. It is found that the processability (e. g., melt viscosity <b>of</b> <b>polyimides)</b> and ultimate product properties (e. g., Tg <b>of</b> <b>polyimides)</b> can be systematically varied by changing the variety and composition of the aromatic diamines.

The UV-Visible spectra <b>of</b> <b>polyimide</b> films showed a blue {{shift in the}} absorption compared to Kapton. This behaviour was attributed {{to the presence of}} bulky groups and kinks along the polymer chains which disrupt the formation of a charge transfer complex. The UV-Visible spectra showed also that UV irradiation <b>of</b> <b>polyimides</b> result extensively in surface degradation, leaving the bulk of the polymer intact. ESR spectra <b>of</b> <b>polyimides</b> irradiated in vacuum revealed the formation of stable carbon-centred radicals which give a singlet ESR spectrum, while polyimides irradiated in air produced an asymmetric signal shifted to a lower magnetic field, with a higher g value and line width. This signal was attributed to oxygen-centred radicals of peroxy and/or alkoxy type. The rate of radical formation in air was two fold higher than for vacuum irradiation, and reached a plateau after a short time. This suggests a continuous depletion of radicals on the surface via an ablative degradation process. FTIR, XPS and weight loss studies supported this postulate. An XPS study of the surface indicated a substantial increase in the surface oxidation after irradiation in air.
