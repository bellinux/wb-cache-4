5000|$|Type 89 Mine-Laying Vehicle - Has a {{modified}} rear hull that mounts a <b>scatterable</b> <b>mine</b> system, consisting of 6 launchers. Each launcher has 36 tubes of 122 mm with each tube containing 5 SATM mines, 15 SAPM mines, 45 SAPEM mines or {{a mix of}} SAPM and SAPEM mines.|$|E
50|$|The BM-27 can use HE-FRAG, chemical, {{explosive}} or <b>scatterable</b> <b>mine</b> (PTM-3 or PFM-1) submunition equipped rockets, all {{of which}} are detonated by electric timing fuses. Each rocket weighs 280.4 kilograms. The warheads weigh between 90 and 100 kilograms, depending on type. A full salvo of 16 rockets can be fired in 20 seconds and can engage targets within a range of 35 kilometers.|$|E
5000|$|The T-93 is an Egyptian scatterable {{anti-tank}} mine similar in appearance to the German AT-2 <b>scatterable</b> <b>mine.</b> It can be dispensed from launchers deployed {{on the ground}} or mounted on vehicles which can hold as many as 600 mines. The mine is cylindrical with twelve spring-loaded legs folded up against the sides of its body during storage. After the mine is dispensed and strikes the ground, the legs spring open, pointing the mine upright.|$|E
50|$|Upgrades to the cannon, ammunition, fire control, survivability, {{and other}} {{electronics}} systems over the design's lifespan have expanded the system's capabilities, including tactical nuclear projectiles, Cannon Launched Guided Projectiles (CLGP or Copperhead), Rocket Assisted Projectile (RAP), FAmily of <b>SCAtterable</b> <b>Mines</b> (FASCAM), and improved conventional munitions (the Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, DPICM).|$|R
50|$|Family of <b>Scatterable</b> <b>Mines</b> (FASCAM) is an {{umbrella}} appellation {{for a range}} of systems of the armed forces of the United States, which allows a maneuver commander to rapidly place mines as a situational obstacle; as a reserve obstacle emplacement capability; and to directly attack enemy formations through disrupt, fix, turn, and block. Modern fusing, sensing, and anti-disturbance devices allow <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines</b> to defeat enemy attempts to reduce and/or clear the minefield. FASCAM mines are delivered through artillery, rocket launchers, indirect crew served weapons, special mine sowing vehicles, helicopters and aircraft. FASCAM mines utilize a random or pre-programmed self-destruct period, countermeasure hardening and anti-disturbance features. All FASCAM mines have an active life cycle and self-destruct (SD) time after their active life has expired. The duration of the active life varies from 4 hours to 15 days depending on the system.|$|R
5000|$|Base Ejection: {{dual purpose}} {{improved}} conventional munitions (DPICM)-bomblets, which arm themselves and function after a set number of rotations {{after having been}} ejected from the projectile (this produces unexploded sub-munitions, or [...] "duds", which remain dangerous), <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines,</b> illuminating, coloured flare, smoke, incendiary, propaganda, chaff (foil to jam radars: originally known as [...] "window") and modern exotics such as electronic payloads and sensor-fuzed munitions.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The Janus simulation model was initially designed {{to operate in}} a stand-alone mode. There is an ongoing research project to link Janus to other constructive simulations and virtual simulators. The present standard used to connect different models is Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). Janus can operate in a DIS environment using a cell adapter unit called the World Modeler. The combination of Janus and the World Modeler is known as JLink. A goal of the JLink system is to replicate the analytical and training fidelity of stand-alone Janus in a distributed exercise. The purpose of this thesis is to assess {{the current state of}} JLink development. The experiment simulated three scenarios: armored, armored coalition, and light infantry battalions attacking against a defending company. All scenarios were executed in two contrasting environments. The simulation included the recently developed JLink features Family of <b>Scatterable</b> <b>Mine</b> (FASCAM) and chemical artillery. The thesis used five Measures of Performance to base the assessment: (1) FASCAM kills, (2) Chemical Artillery Kills, (3) Detection Ranges, (4) Kill Ranges, and (5) Loss Exchange Ratio. The statistical tests used for analysis were the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, two-sample t-test, and Wilcoxon test. The results of the analysis show that JLink requires adjustments to artillery delivery methods in order to correct chemical artillery discrepancies and detection range issues. In general, JLink accurately portrays coalition warfare and satisfactorily replicates armored and infantry scenarios in contrasting environments[URL] United States Arm...|$|E
50|$|Artillery and {{aircraft}} <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines</b> allow minefields {{to be placed}} in front of moving formations of enemy units, including the reinforcement of minefields or other obstacles that have been breached by enemy engineers. They {{can also be used to}} cover the retreat of forces disengaging from the enemy, or for interdiction of supporting units to isolate front line units from resupply. In most cases these minefields consist of a combination of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, with the anti-personnel mines making removal of the anti-tank mines more difficult. Mines of this type used by the United States are designed to self-destruct after a preset period of time, reducing the requirement for mine clearing to only those mines whose self-destruct system did not function. Some designs of these <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines</b> require an electrical charge (capacitor or battery) to detonate. After a certain period of time, either the charge dissipates, leaving them effectively inert or the circuitry is designed such that upon reaching a low level, the device is triggered, thus destroying the mine.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedScatterable mines {{are currently being}} evaluated in the material acquisition process. This new concept of landmines will be examined by an analysis of field experiment data provided by the Combat Developments Experimentation Command (CDEC), Fort Ord, California. An experimental design and analysis plan is presented to measure the effectiveness of <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines.</b> The experimental design considered two models. A "normal" model is designed without considering CDEC's instrumentation, equipment, and personnel, and a "modified" model which takes into consideration CDEC's limitations. The experimental design, analysis methodology, and a hypothetical example are presented to indicate implementation of the "modified" model. Finally, {{a comparison of the}} "modified" model is made with CDEC's "Tactical Effectiveness of Mines in the Armor Weapons System" model design. Dynamic measures of effectiveness are used to discriminate between levels of five factors (e. g., location of minefield, type of minefield, threat tactic, minefield density, defensive force mix) and to determine if there is a synergistic effect with employment of <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines.</b> [URL] United States Arm...|$|R
5000|$|Since 1994 {{there have}} been {{widespread}} use of mines, by both sides. Russia is {{a party to the}} 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on mines, booby traps, and other devices. In addition to using hand-emplaced mines, Russian forces have also deployed anti-personnel mines from airplanes, helicopters and rockets, resulting in large tracts of mined land that is unmarked and unfenced. Most of this <b>scatterable</b> <b>mining</b> took place in 1999 and 2000. In addition, only half of the cluster munitions dropped in Chechnya actually detonated.|$|R
50|$|The SAPM (<b>Scatterable</b> Anti-Personnel Fragmentation <b>Mine)</b> is a Chinese <b>scatterable</b> anti-personnel {{fragmentation}} <b>mine.</b> It {{is typically}} deployed from either 122 mm rockets or truck based mine layers. Once the mine hits the ground, two tripwires are deployed {{to a maximum}} distance of 10 meters from the mine. Tension on these wires triggers the mine.|$|R
50|$|The PTM-3 is a Russian <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine</b> {{that can}} be deployed either by hand, vehicle, artillery, or helicopter. The mine's case is configured to produce a shaped charge effect on five sides.|$|R
50|$|The AT2 <b>mine</b> is a <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine</b> {{developed by}} Dynamit Nobel. It can be scattered from artillery rockets or from mine laying systems, {{and was used}} by the British, German and Norwegian armed forces until the signing of the Ottawa Treaty.|$|R
50|$|When submunition-based {{weapons are}} used to {{disperse}} mines, their submunitions do not detonate immediately, but behave like conventional land mines that detonate later. The submunitions usually include a combination of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. Since such mines usually lie on exposed surfaces, the anti-personnel forms, such as the US Area Denial Artillery Munition normally deploy tripwires automatically after landing to make clearing the minefield more difficult. In order to avoid rendering large portions of the battlefield permanently impassable, and to minimize the amount of mine-clearing needed after a conflict, <b>scatterable</b> <b>mines</b> used by the United States are designed to self-destruct {{after a period of}} time from 4 to 48 hours. The internationally agreed definition of cluster munitions being negotiated in the Oslo Process may not include this type of weapon, since landmines are already covered in other specific international instruments.|$|R
5000|$|The SATM mine is a Chinese {{copy of the}} AT2 <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine.</b> It is scattered {{either from}} a mine scattering vehicle or by 122 mm Type 84 rockets which hold eight mines each. The mine functions {{in the same way}} as the AT-2 with a seismic sensor that activates the mine and a magnetic influence sensor combined with a [...] "scraping wire" [...] sensor to ensure optimum detonation.|$|R
5000|$|The VS-1.6 is an Italian {{circular}} plastic-cased <b>scatterable</b> anti-tank blast <b>mine.</b> It {{has very}} few metal components and is resistant to overpressure and shock. The mine {{can also be}} deployed conventionally and from helicopters. It was produced by Valsella Meccanotecnica, but production has ceased.|$|R
5000|$|The POMD-1 is a {{cylindrical}} <b>scatterable</b> Bulgarian anti-personnel <b>mine,</b> {{used in the}} KNURS-DM 122 mm rocket {{fired from}} the BM-21 vehicle mounted rocket launcher. In one 122 mm rocket, a single POMD-1 mine was carried along with 16 PMD-1 AP pressure mines, and four TMD-1 anti-tank mines.|$|R
50|$|The MN-123 is a Polish <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine.</b> The mine is a flat cylinder, with a bevelled edge. It {{is normally}} deployed from a ground vehicle, using a dispensing system holding 80 mines. The mine {{can also be}} manually laid. Like the MN-121 mine, it uses a magnetic influence fuze which detects when a vehicle passes over it. It also has an anti-handling device. Both faces of the mine have a Misznay Schardin effect shaped charge, which is reportedly able to penetrate 60 millimeters of armour at an offset of 0.3 meters.|$|R
5000|$|The MN-121 is a Polish <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine,</b> externally {{similar to}} the German AT-2 mine. The mine is cylindrical with ten wire legs which fold outward to keep the mine upright. The mine uses a magnetic influence fuze, which triggers the mine when a vehicle passes over it. The mine also has an anti-handling device which triggers the mine if it is moved. The mine's warhead is a shaped charge design containing approximately 700 grams of RDX. The manufacturer claims that {{it is capable of}} penetrating 60 millimeters of armour at an offset of half a meter.|$|R
50|$|The MI AC Disp F1 Minotaur mine is a French <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine.</b> The mines {{can also}} be scattered from 155 millimetre artillery shells, which can hold six of the mines. The mine is cylindrical with two Misznay Schardin effect warheads, {{one on each side}} of the mine, with a 600 gram charge. The warhead is claimed to be able to penetrate 90 mm of armour at a distance of 0.5 m. It uses a magnetic influence fuze combined with an anti-handling device which arms itself 64 seconds after launch. At the end of its active life, which is set to between one and 96 hours the mine self-destructs. The land based scattering system can launch mines to a range of up to 300 m.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} BMP-1s were fitted with {{mountings}} for the KMT-10 plow-type mine-clearing {{system in the}} early 1980s. It is installed {{on the front of}} the hull in line with the tracks. The plow weighs 450 kg and can be attached in 30 minutes. Emergency detaching takes around 10 minutes. The KMT-10 is intended for clearing anti-tank mines under different ground conditions. It is pneumatically driven and takes four seconds to switch from the traveling position to the digging position. The mine-clearing plows are very narrow, with just two digging tines, each 300 mm wide, (the same as each track), which limits them to clearing surface-laid <b>mines,</b> in particular <b>scatterable</b> anti-tank <b>mines.</b> A chain mounted between the plows can detonate tilt-rod mines. Maximum mine-clearing speed is 15 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The Type 84 is a Chinese air-dispersed <b>scatterable</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine,</b> normally deployed by the GBL212 122 mm artillery rocket, or the Type 122-15 ATML rocket {{for export}} versions. Each rocket can carry {{six or eight}} mines and has a range of around six or seven kilometres. The rockets are launched from a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher system that can hold up to 24 of the rockets. A time fuse on the rocket is set before launch, which activates at a predetermined distance after firing. Upon activation, the rocket head bursts, ejecting the mines, which descend with small green parachutes that slow their fall. The mine consists of a cylindrical body with three prong legs that form a spike, which pierces the ground and arms. If the mine strikes soft ground, the spike is driven {{into the ground and}} the mine is held upright.|$|R
50|$|The VS-MK-2 is {{a plastic}} bodied <b>scatterable</b> anti-personnel blast <b>mine</b> {{manufactured}} by the now-defunct Valsella Meccanotecnica, SpA, an Italian high-tech defence contractor that specialized {{in the development}} and production of area denial systems. The mine is extremely difficult to detect because of its low metal content i.e. it is a minimum metal mine. Additionally, it is resistant to blast overpressure due to a pneumatic system in the fuze. The mine will also function in up to 1 metre of water. An electrically fused anti-handling version of the mine was also produced designated VS-MK-2-EL, VS-MK-2-E or VS-MK2 AR-AN to hinder clearance attempts. Although Italy has ceased production of this mine it may still be found in uncleared minefields located in Angola, Sudan and the Western Sahara.|$|R
