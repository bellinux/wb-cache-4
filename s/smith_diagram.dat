Thesis aim is to pass judgment on influence of stress cycle asymmetry on fatigue characteristics on high cyclic loading on above mentioned steel. Design Haigh and <b>Smith</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Component of the thesis is metallographical and chemical analysis, mathematical values processing obtained from fatigue tests and also determine primary mechanical properties. Further Wohler´s curves are stated at different stress cycle asymmetry. According to mathematical values processing is designed Haigh and <b>Smith</b> <b>diagrams</b> and fatigue index is calculated. From obtained data result that medium stress of cyclic stress, has of principle influence on appreciate fatigue limit of engaged material...|$|R

An examples of {{the assessment of the}} fatigue macrocrack initiation period, Ni, and the failure period, Nf, of a notched specimens on the base of unified model using fatigue macrocrack growth rates only are shown. Some backgrounds and well-known fatigue phenomena (Kitagawa's and <b>Smith's</b> <b>diagrams,</b> etc) are discussed...|$|R

Fatigue bechaviour is described by analysing properties of the substrate and surface layer. The eect of microhard-ness of the substrate on fatigue properties of nitrided layers is obtained. <b>Smith's</b> <b>diagrams</b> for carbonitrided layers are presented. A graphical pat-tern for prediction of the place of failure initiation is suggested. Future directions of the examination with tribology and corrosion eects taken into account are marked in the paper...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The way of {{reshaping}} the {{crack growth rate}} formulae in the form enabling their use in fatigue design at non-stationary loading is demonstrated. This new derived formula suggests an additional damage increase when crossing from one stress block to another. Herein, the reshaped crack growth rate formula is applied for the fatigue design of aircraft components made of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and subjected to combined HCF/LCF loading. For the stress history simplified {{in the way that}} it consists of one LCF stress block at load ratio r = 0, followed by one HCF stress at load ratio r> 0, the closed form expression is derived for estimating the crack propagation life at combined HCF/LCF loading. <b>Smith</b> and Haigh <b>diagrams</b> as design tools for estimating the fatigue strengths for designed fatigue life, known load ratio and various number of HCF cycles per one combined stress block, are obtained and presented for the parts made of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and subjected to combined HCF/LCF loading...|$|R
