5000|$|Geared, torque-sensitive {{mechanical}} limited-slip differentials use {{worm gears}} and spur gears to distribute and differentiate input power between two drive wheels or {{front and back}} axles. This is a completely separate design from the most common beveled <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> designs seen in most automotive applications. As torque {{is applied to the}} gears, they are pushed against the walls of the differential housing, creating friction. The friction resists the relative movement of the outputs and creates the limiting torque Trq d [...]|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other friction-based LSD {{designs that}} combine a common <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> [...] "open" [...] {{differential}} {{in combination with}} friction materials that inhibit differentiation, the torque sensing design is a unique type of differential, with torque bias inherent to its design, not as an add-on. Torque bias is only applied when needed, and does not inhibit differentiation. The result is a true differential that does not bind up like LSD and locking types, but still gives increased power delivery under many road conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{clutch type}} has {{a stack of}} thin clutch-discs, half of which are coupled {{to one of the}} drive shafts, the other half of which are coupled to the <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> carrier. The clutch stacks may be present on both drive shafts, or on only one. If on only one, the {{remaining}} drive shaft is linked to the clutched drive shaft through the spider gears. In a cone type the clutches are replaced by a pair of cones which are pressed together achieving the same effect.|$|E
5000|$|The two crown wheels {{interface}} to the <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> {{at different}} diameters, and so produce different torque when turned by the <b>spider</b> <b>gears.</b> This is engineered {{to produce a}} 40:60 static torque split front and rear.|$|R
5000|$|The central {{carrier and}} {{associated}} <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> interface directly to two crown wheels {{connected to the}} front and rear drive shafts ...|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> {{of an open}} differential {{can also}} be welded {{together to create a}} locked axle; this method is not recommended as the welding process seriously compromises the metallurgical composition of the welded components, and can lead to failure of the unit under stress. If it is desirable to have a spooled axle, the better option is to install either a mini-spool or a full spool.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} primary designs for a drum magazine. The most common is the {{cylinder}} type, {{that has a}} <b>spider</b> <b>gear</b> assembly that has an opening in each gear {{for two to three}} rounds of ammunition and can be loaded from the rear, used primarily in the AK-47. Another common design is the double-stack dual-horn drum, which operates like a standard stick magazine, but diverges the ammo into two separate feed chutes that run on a single cog. Rimmed ammunition including shotgun ammunition operated drums primarily run off a cogged (gear shaped) design which feeds each individual round of the ammo from the outermost edge of the drum. Recently a single-stack compact design has been released, which uses most of the interior capacity of the drum. It is driven by a single hub and telescopic shaft.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the axle shafts, <b>spider</b> <b>gears,</b> and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
5000|$|One {{method for}} {{creating}} the clamping force {{is the use of}} a cam-ramp assembly such as used in a Salisbury/ramp style LSD. The <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> mount on the pinion cross shaft which rests in angled cutouts forming cammed ramps. The cammed ramps are not necessarily symmetrical. If the ramps are symmetrical, the LSD is 2 way. If they are saw toothed (i.e. one side of the ramp is vertical), the LSD is 1 way. If both sides are sloped, but are asymmetric, the LSD is 1.5 way. (See the discussion of 2, 1.5 and 1 way below) ...|$|R
50|$|The Mount Copperhead <b>gear</b> <b>spider</b> (Chinese: 铜头摩挡蛛), (Modunda aeneiceps), is {{a species}} of spider of the genus Modunda. It is found only in China and Sri Lanka.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic lockers {{lock and}} unlock {{automatically}} with no direct {{input from the}} driver. Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will [...] "unlock" [...] only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed [...] "automatic unlocking" [...] differentials, because their at-rest position is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the differential carrier or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed. The most common example of this type would be the famous [...] "Detroit Locker," [...] made by Eaton Corporation, {{also known as the}} [...] "Detroit No-Spin," [...] which replaces the entire differential carrier assembly. Others, sometimes referred to as [...] "lunchbox lockers," [...] employ the stock differential carrier and replace only the internal <b>spider</b> <b>gears</b> and shafts with interlocking plates. Both types of automatic lockers will allow for a degree of differential wheel speed while turning corners in conditions of equal traction, but will otherwise lock both axle shafts together when traction conditions demand it.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the Savage X, the Savage X SS, has a [...]28ci (4.6cc) engine that has 10% more displacement than the S-25 Model. The Savage X SS also features a hardened steel spur gear, chromed dog bones and 6 <b>gear</b> <b>spider</b> diffs for enhanced drivetrain durability {{to cope with the}} extra power of the [...]28 engine. With this engine the SS version will easily pull wheel stands and an optional wheelie bar is available for the Savage to prevent it from flipping over backwards under hard acceleration.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the <b>spider</b> and side <b>gears</b> to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
