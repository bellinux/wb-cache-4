The Regency, together with other political organizations such as Tammany Hall, {{played a major role in}} expanding the spoils system and making it a recognized and accepted procedure. While organizing and overseeing the operations of the Regency, Van Buren resided in Albany; his housemate was Roger Skinner, a lifelong bachelor who was also a key Van Buren lieutenant in the State Senate and as Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. Van Buren was the prime architect of the first nationwide political party: the Jacksonian Democrats or Democratic Party, which evolved from the Democratic-Republicans and relied on party loyalty and patronage to prevent contentious <b>sectional</b> issues, including <b>tariffs</b> and slavery, from becoming national crises. In Van Buren's words, [...] "Without strong national political organizations, there would be nothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states." [...] As had James Madison and other Democratic Party organizers who favored states' rights and local control, Van Buren was struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution's seeming inability to prevent concentration of power in an administrative republic.|$|R
