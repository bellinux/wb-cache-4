5|$|On 12 October, for {{the third}} time, Farnese {{supplied}} the garrison of Zutphen, personally, {{as he had done}} the first time. Later on, he sent Verdugo back to Friesland and left Johann Baptista von Taxis in charge of Zutphen. After that, the Spanish army took its winter quarters. When Farnese moved to Brussels to spend the winter there, the Earl of Leicester continued the siege of Zutphen. He was not able to take the town, but succeeded in occupying several forts beyond the IJssel, including Zutphen's sconce, which was carried by surprise by Edward Stanley, brother of William <b>Stanley,</b> <b>and</b> 12 other soldiers. Shortly after the English and Dutch also took their winter quarters. Sir William Stanley was given the command of Deventer, Sir John Burroughs of Doesburg, and Rowland York of Zutphen's sconce. <b>Stanley</b> <b>and</b> York's appointments were met with suspicion by the Dutch States, because Stanley was openly Catholic and York a man of dissolute character. Leicester expressed his full confidence in both soldiers, but in 1587 <b>Stanley</b> <b>and</b> York shifted sides to the Spanish party and handed Deventer and Zutphen's sconce over to Taxis.|$|E

5|$|According to Lennon, the Stanley family {{once owned}} {{the whole of}} Woolton village. William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby did once own the manorial rights to Woolton but Lennon's Stanley family were from humbler origins and only came to Liverpool in the 1870s. Mimi's {{grandfather}} was born in Birmingham and her great grandfather was born in London. Mimi's father, George Ernest Stanley, {{was born in the}} Everton district of Liverpool in 1874 to William Henry <b>Stanley</b> <b>and</b> Eliza Jane Gildea. George's mother, Eliza Jane Gildea, was born in Omagh, County Tyrone, Ireland. By 1891 the Stanleys were living in Upper Frederick Street, south of the city centre, in the same inner city area of Liverpool as the family of George's future wife, Annie Millward. Mimi's mother, Annie Jane Millward, was born in Chester in 1873, to Welsh parents. George Ernest <b>Stanley</b> <b>and</b> Annie Millward were married at St Peter's Church, Liverpool on 19 November 1906.

When they arrive back at the office, a drunk <b>Stanley</b> <b>and</b> Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him.
