2500|$|The film {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of the Enterprise-B. The ship model was a modification of the Excelsior vessel, designed and built by Bill George and effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for [...] a decade earlier. Coproducer Peter Lauritson, illustrator John Eaves, and Zimmerman designed the Enterprise-B with additions to its hull, {{some of which were}} added so that they could depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model's surface, and to improve the look of the ship when it was filmed from angles called for in the script. The ship's bridge was based on previous designs for the Enterprise-A and Excelsior sets he had created for The Undiscovered Country, using pieces from each. The surrounding spacedock for Enterprises maiden voyage was a modification of the model created for [...] (1979), refurbished and slightly modified by removing a row of lights to fit better into the anamorphic <b>screen</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Typical gyratory {{equipment}} operation circulates around eccentric weight and <b>screen</b> <b>frames.</b> Materials are distributed along the screen surface and undersize materials {{are allowed to}} penetrate the screen. A general {{rule of thumb is}} to be followed for high separation efficiency and smooth operation: ...|$|R
5000|$|Atkins {{designed}} furniture, fireplace equipment, candlesticks, urns and screens, shop windows, jewelry, garden gates, clocks, crosses, dishes, trays, chests, <b>screens,</b> <b>frames</b> and chandeliers. [...] He {{also designed}} complete interiors, including the main reading {{room of the}} Doe Memorial Library at the University of California, Berkeley.|$|R
50|$|As a gyratory {{screening}} machine employs {{the use of}} smaller stacked <b>screen</b> <b>frames,</b> the <b>screens</b> can be accurately placed to the precise requirements of each separation. This puts a gyratory screener at an advantage {{over a number of}} other mechanical screening devices, as many other devices would require the use of additional equipment to cope with a different type of feed.|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{composite}} screens {{tend not}} to use adhesives but rather heat the mesh and melt it into the <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> to form a bond.|$|E
50|$|Binding Agent- The {{binding agent}} is the {{material}} used to bind the mesh to the <b>screen</b> <b>frame,</b> {{it is designed}} to maximize adhesion to both materials while being able to handle high heat, strong vibration, abrasive cuttings and corrosive drilling fluids.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, {{engineer}} Bernard Ashley met Welsh secretary Laura Mountney at a youth club in Wallington, London. While {{working as}} a secretary and raising her first two children, part-time she designed napkins, table mats, tea-towels which Bernard printed on a machine he had designed in an attic flat in Pimlico, London The couple had invested £10 in wood for the <b>screen</b> <b>frame,</b> dyes and a few yards of linen.|$|E
50|$|Frames (2004, 53 minutes, Henry Corra, Charlene Rule) In {{this film}} about legendary media artist Grahame Weinbren, Corra {{effectively}} captures the complexity, mystery and {{excitement of the}} creative process. The film takes its lead from Weinbren’s work where spectators become characters and subjects, living participants as they interact with sound and story, image and <b>screen.</b> <b>Frames</b> had its world premiere at the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.|$|R

50|$|In late 1943, {{expansion}} of the base was begun {{with an increase in}} apron area, structures more permanent than the original canvas-covered ones, and the reconstruction of housing facilities. Two PSP ramps each 50 ft wide, and a coral apron, 150 ft by 850 ft, were installed. Dock facilities were constructed, consisting of a small-boat wharf, 16 ft by 72 ft and a boat refueling wharf, 6 ft by 50 ft. Twelve <b>screened</b> <b>frame</b> wards with canvas roofing were provided for a 200-bed bas hospital.|$|R
50|$|The {{couple had}} {{invested}} £10 in wood for the <b>screen</b> <b>frame,</b> dyes {{and a few}} yards of linen. Ashley's inspiration to start producing printed fabric came from a Women's Institute display of traditional handicrafts at the Victoria & Albert Museum. When Ashley looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs to help her make patchworks, she found no such thing existed. Here was an opportunity, and she started to print Victorian style headscarves in 1953.|$|E
50|$|The {{split screen}} {{has also been}} used {{extensively}} in television programs. Newscasts often show two reporters in a split <b>screen</b> <b>frame.</b> The sitcom That '70s Show, Nickelodeon teen sitcom Drake & Josh, Disney Channel teen sitcom Lizzie McGuire, USA Network's Burn Notice and Fox's 24 made extensive use of split screens. It is sometimes used in game shows to show two contestants simultaneously, and on cable news shows, when participants in a discussion are in different locations.|$|E
50|$|In common usage, {{the name}} Letraset {{originally}} referred to sheets of transfer lettering which was originally manufactured as a wet process in 1959, with each character selected and {{cut from a}} sheet, placed face-down on a small silk <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> and wetted with a paint brush to soften and release the gum arabic adhesive which held it. The frame was then turned over and the letter located over the artwork, and the character pressed {{into contact with the}} page, with the mounting base slid away as with model aircraft transfers.|$|E
50|$|By 1891, {{the firm}} {{provided}} employment to 350 men and turned out among other specialties ten distinct styles of patent parlor sliding door hangers, barn door hangers, {{a number of}} different kinds of patented locks, barn door locks, window and door screens, door and window <b>screen</b> <b>frames,</b> hinges, adjustable stove-pipe thimbles, adjustable screw and door frame clamps, vises, spoke shaves and pointers, jack screws, hollow augers, cast-iron stable hay racks and feed boxes, saw vises, bench drills, mallets, chisel handles, lawn mowers, iron sinks, and stable fixtures, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} born in Moscow in December 1998. The {{official}} premiere of the show was held in St. Petersburg, in March 1999 in Oktyabrskiy Big Concert Hall. It was a super-show based on the songs of the Moscow composer Vladimir Evzerov. The format was different from past shows of the singer, so that the actor had decided to use laser pyrotechnics, that decorate the program. In the form of decorations on the stage, there were three huge <b>screens,</b> <b>framed</b> by intricate attributes, thereby giving the camera view.|$|R
50|$|Wide use of {{rectangles}} (with four {{angles and}} four sides) {{because they have}} effective form and capability for close adjacency to each other (houses, rooms, tables, bricks, sheets of paper, <b>screens,</b> film <b>frames).</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{wire-frame}} renderings {{are relatively}} simple and fast to calculate, {{they are often}} used in cases where a high <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> rate is needed (for instance, when working with a particularly complex 3D model, or in real-time systems that model exterior phenomena). When greater graphical detail is desired, surface textures can be added automatically after completion of the initial rendering of the wire frame. This allows the designer to quickly review solids or rotate the object to new desired views without long delays associated with more realistic rendering.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{joining the}} program's cast in 2015, Richards first {{appeared}} as a host of Eat Bulaga!s various segments, such as the [...] "That's My Bae" [...] portion; while Mendoza originally appeared as Yaya Dub in the show's portion [...] "Problem Solving". During {{the first few months}} of Kalyeserye, they exclusively interacted through the show's split <b>screen</b> <b>frame,</b> the AlDub couple's main communication is through lip syncing audio clips from popular songs, films and TV series. After they personally met in September 2015 and Yaya Dub was later allowed to speak, the couple's interaction is no longer limited to split screen and lip-syncing.|$|E
50|$|Heavily loaded metal workpieces, {{which are}} {{components}} {{designed and built}} {{with the ability to}} withstand heavy loads. Examples include lifting yokes, clamshell buckets, crane bases, vibratory <b>screening</b> system <b>frames,</b> ingot processing equipment, and rolling mill equipment.|$|R
50|$|Typically, metal <b>screen</b> <b>frames</b> (roll form) are 1/4 in, 5/16 in, 3/8 in or 7/16 in in {{thickness}} by 3/4 in and 1 in. The {{most common}} sizes are 5/16 in and 7/16 in by 3/4 in. The 1/4 in and 5/16 in sizes are generally used for single hung windows, {{while the two}} larger sizes are used for double hung windows. As 3/8 in is not a common size, the 5/16 in thickness may be used instead and shimmed as needed. They {{come in a variety}} of colors including unpainted, white, bronze, tan, black, desert sand, etc. The screen may also include a crossbar for added strength.|$|R
5000|$|His {{next show}} was an Easter Crucifixion {{exhibition}} at the Sigi Krauss gallery featuring a life-size sculpture of a sitting man made entirely of meat and offal, similar to Robert Whitaker's controversial [...] "butcher" [...] cover photos for the Beatles' 1966 Yesterday and Today album. At this exhibition Mora also screened his 8 mm 'film painting' Passion Play back-projected onto a <b>screen</b> <b>framed</b> in gold leaf. Although none of the exhibits were by Mora, Stanley Kubrick's art director purchased some of artist Herman Makkink's work {{for use in the}} film A Clockwork Orange, notably the giant white phallus and the chorus line of dancing Jesus sculptures.|$|R

5000|$|AlDub {{is derived}} from a {{portmanteau}} of the show's main characters' names, namely Filipino actor Alden Richards, who portrays a fictionalized version of himself, and Yaya Dub, portrayed by comedian Maine Mendoza. Both joining the program's cast in 2015, Richards first appeared as a host of Eat Bulaga!s various segments, such as the [...] "That's My Bae" [...] portion; while Mendoza appears only as [...] "Yaya Dub" [...] in the [...] "Juan for All, All for Juan" [...] segment. The couple exclusively interact through the show's split <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> and only {{communicate with each other}} by dubbing audio samples of popular songs, films and TV series as well as handwritten messages (or [...] "fan signs") on screen. As of early October 2015, the AlDub couple have yet to meet in person.|$|E
50|$|In March 2012, XSEED Games {{announced}} {{that they will be}} starting publishing Japanese PC games through Steam, starting with the PC version of Ys: The Oath in Felghana on 19 March 2012. On 31 May 2012, XSEED Games released an English version of Ys Origin on Steam. Ys I & II were also released via Steam on 14 February 2013 as Ys I & II Chronicles+ - XSEED's Steam programmer Sara managed to combine Falcom's PC port of Ys I & II Chronicles with the earlier fan-favorite PC release Ys I & II Complete, effectively mixing all the best features of both versions like selectable soundtracks (PC-88 original, Complete and Chronicles) and art styles from both Chronicles and Complete, alongside the visual flexibility of Complete, such as greater viewing area, togglable <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> and support for windowed mode.|$|E
5000|$|Considerable use of {{wood was}} made in the {{internal}} trim of the [...] "Y" [...] Type. Door windows, front and rear <b>screens</b> were <b>framed</b> in burr walnut, the instrument panel set in bookmatched veneer offsetting the passenger side glove box.|$|R
50|$|A {{shaker screen}} {{consists}} of the following parts:*Screen Frame- Much like a canvas for painting a screen has to be supported on a frame {{in order to do}} its job, this frame differs between manufacturers in both material and shape. <b>Screen</b> <b>frames</b> can be made from materials such as, square steel tubing, flat steel sheets, plastic type composites or they can just be supported on the ends with strips of steel (similar idea to a scroll). These frames consist of a rectangular shaped outer perimeter which is divided into small individual inner panels. These smaller panels differ in shape from manufacturer to manufacturer and have been known to come in shapes such as square, hexagonal, rectangular and even triangular.|$|R
50|$|Gyratory {{equipment}} is divided to a {{top and a}} bottom unit. The unit on top consists of <b>screening</b> <b>frames</b> supported with rugged springs attached to the circular base, which allows free vibration of the top unit. Secondary support springs are attached to for heavy duty operation, preventing the vibration of the top unit from reaching the floor. The base of the machine (bottom unit) consists of top and bottom eccentric weights attached to a heavy duty motor. Minimum energy is consumed with the installation of double extended shafts on the motors, which are attached to both {{the top and bottom}} eccentric weights. Screen decks can be mounted on top of another within the machine assembly with spacing frames connected together via stainless steel quick release clamps.|$|R
5000|$|As Daffy tries {{once again}} to {{negotiate}} with the animator to have an understanding, the <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> falls on him. After failing to keep the frame up with a stick, Daffy goes ballistic and rips apart the black background. Now {{at the end of his}} rope, Daffy demands [...] "Let's get this picture started", so the camera does an iris-out to black, followed by [...] "The End" [...] slide which Daffy frustratingly pushes off camera, screaming [...] "NO, NO!" [...] as he does so. Daffy suggests that he and the animator go their separate ways and (hoping, against hope, that nothing further will happen) begins a dance routine which is quickly interrupted when the film runs out of alignment, resulting in two Daffys on the screen. They argue with each other and almost start a fight, but one Daffy is erased just as the other throws a punch.|$|E

5000|$|Regaining his composure, Daffy demands {{some new}} scenery and is given an amateurish line-art {{cityscape}} background in pencil. Daffy asks for color, prompting the animator to slap various colors and patterns {{all over him}} ("NOT ME, YOU SLOP ARTIST!!"). All but Daffy's face is erased and upon asking where {{the rest of him}} was, he is redrawn as a bizarre mismatched animal with a [...] "screwball" [...] flag on its tail. As Daffy walks off (wondering to himself if he wasn't living up to his contract and if he hadn't been keeping himself trim), he becomes suspicious of his new form until the animator creates a mirror and Daffy scolds the animator upon seeing his hideous self ("EEK! You know better than that!"). Everything is erased and Daffy is redrawn again, this time as a sailor. He begins to sing [...] "The Song of the Marines" [...] as the animator draws an ocean scene with an island in the background, but he does not draw anything under Daffy, resulting in him falling into the ocean and surfacing on the distant island where he asks for a closeup, only to have the <b>screen</b> <b>frame</b> contract around him (to which he screams [...] "A CLOSEUP, YA JERK! A CLOSEUP!!"), as the camera then zooms up uncomfortably close to his angry bloodshot eyes before he walks away, saying to the animator [...] "Thanks for the sour persimmons, cousin." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a practice-led methodology that combines contemporary art theory and processes, {{as well as}} concepts of fan studies to construct a space for the critical and creative exploration of screen culture. The research promotes new possibilities for purposeful creative engagements with the <b>screen,</b> <b>framed</b> {{through the lens of}} what I term the digital-bricoleur. This performative, link-making approach documents the complicit tendencies that arise out of my affective relationship with screen culture, mapping out a cultural terrain in which I can creatively and critically ‘play’. The creative exploitation of this improvisational and aleatory activity then forms the creative research outputs. It appropriates and reconfigures content from screen culture, creating digital video installations aimed at engendering new experiences and critical interpretations of screen culture...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2009 {{the company}} {{introduced}} new Gresso Grand Monaco [...] phone collection. The phone case was made using titanium alloy {{and covered with}} several layers of ceramic. Front and back phone panels were made from carbon. The <b>screen</b> was <b>framed</b> in a 42 carat sapphire glass.|$|R
5000|$|Many LCDs {{also use}} a {{technology}} called [...] "overdrive" [...] which buffers several frames ahead and processes the image to reduce blurring and streaks left by ghosting.
