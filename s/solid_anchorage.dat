50|$|The SB {{launched}} at the October 1933 London Motor Show {{had a new}} cruciform braced chassis, {{slightly longer}} at 124 in, with independent front suspension using a single transverse leaf spring with a long <b>solid</b> <b>anchorage</b> in the centre. Steering was improved using new designs employed for racing Alvis cars since 1925. Road shocks were not transmitted from one wheel to the other nor did they affect {{the steering wheel and}} the gyroscopic effect was eliminated. Rear springs damped by Hartford Telecontrol dampers are long and underslung. The engine remained the same but the new all-silent gearbox, the first of its type, gained synchromesh on bottom gear and was mounted separately from the engine. A built-in jacking system was fitted as standard.|$|E
30|$|All the canines {{were exposed}} using CT {{by the same}} oral surgeon and {{orthodontic}} traction was applied using the “easy cuspid” device [21], {{in order to move}} the impacted PDC towards occlusal plane. The easy cuspid appliance was suggested as modification of the Jones Jig appliance, originally developed for molar distalization, and combined with the original idea of Jacoby’s ballista spring [4]. The major difference is a soldered double terminal with a larger end for insertion into the molar band’s headgear tube and a smaller end for the auxiliary tube. A triple-tube molar band is used so that a stabilizing wire can be inserted into the main archwire tube, providing <b>solid</b> <b>anchorage</b> for the traction system [21].|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{measurement of}} the cosmic ray (CR) energy spectrum and anisotropy in their arrival direction distribution needs {{the knowledge of the}} elemental composition of the radiation to discriminate between different origin and propagation models. Important information on the CR mass composition can be obtained studying the EAS muon content through the {{measurement of the}} CR rate at different zenith angles. In this paper we report on the observation of the anisotropy of galactic CRs at different angular scales with the ARGO-YBJ experiment. We report also on the study of the primary CR rate for different zenith angles. The light component (p+He) has been selected and its energy spectrum measured in the energy range (5 - 200) TeV for quasi-vertical events. With this analysis {{for the first time a}} ground-based measurement of the CR spectrum overlaps data obtained with direct methods for more than one energy decade, thus providing a <b>solid</b> <b>anchorage</b> to the CR spectrum measurements carried out by EAS arrays in the knee region. Finally, a preliminary study of the non-attenuated shower component at a zenith angle θ > 70 ^∘ (through the observation of the so-called horizantal air showers) is presented.

5000|$|An {{example of}} the Anchorage {{independent}} growth assay is the soft agar assay. The assay is assessing the cells' ability to grow in a gel or viscous fluid. Transformed cells can grow in this environment and are considered anchorage independent. Cells that can only grow when attached to a <b>solid</b> surface are <b>anchorage</b> dependent untransformed cells. This assay {{is considered one of}} the most stringent for detection of malignant transformation ...|$|R
