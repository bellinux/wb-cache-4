40|$|Abstract. A {{frictional}} contact model is adopted {{for the analysis}} of conventional solid rivet setting. Material properties for the selected plates and rivets are obtained from analytical method using elastic constants and tensile strengths for each material. Rigid- and elasto-plastic models are selected for process analysis in this paper. Process variables are selected to investigate the effect of variables on the successful rivet setting and servicing in any structure as force transmitting member. Major variables in riveting process are material variables such as material properties and geometrical variables, which are dimensions of head, shank, and blank diameters. Analysis in this study is concentrated on the influence of variety of materials and of shank dimensions on the contact area after rivet setting, i. e. after forming process of rivet head. Soft and hard materials are selected as mother materials to investigate how the selection of material influences on the riveting process in quantitative manner. The geometry of head is closely investigated through simulation in terms of contact status, i. e. contact area between rivet head and mother material, which would affect the <b>snap</b> <b>fit</b> <b>joint</b> by riveting...|$|E

30|$|Joint {{models are}} used to {{quantify}} association between an internal time-dependent covariate and time until an event of interest occurs (Wulfsohn and Tsiatis 1997). It involves two separate models: a model {{that takes into account}} measurement error in the time-dependent covariate to estimate its true values (longitudinal model), and another model that uses these estimated values to quantify the association between this covariate and the time to the occurrence of the event (time-to-event model). The idea behind the joint modeling technique is to couple the time-to-event model with the longitudinal model. The general framework of the maximum likelihood method and large sample theory can be found in Rizopoulos (2012). Maximization of the log-likelihood function for joint modeling is computationally challenging, as it involves evaluating multiple integrals that do not have an analytical solution, except in very special cases. The R package JM has been developed by Rizopoulos (2010) to <b>fit</b> <b>joint</b> models using Weibull baseline hazard, piecewise-constant baseline hazard, spline approximation of the baseline hazard and unspecified baseline hazard functions. We have modified the source codes for Weibull to <b>fit</b> <b>joint</b> models using the generalized log-logistic baseline hazard function.

In order to deal with impacts, friction and constrained motion, the proposed methods are not based on elaborate control schemes. Rather, a model-based optimization approach is suggested, which relies on a detailled dynamic model of the manipulator itself, the process dynamics of the task and the interactions between those two. These models are used to define an optimization problem, which is then solved using numerical programming methods. It is illustrated with an assembly task, namely mating a pair of <b>snap</b> <b>fits.</b> Utilizing a pre-optimized dynamic response behavior of the robot as developed in former work, [6], we plan trajectory and design parameters of the parts to be assembled, which influence the process dynamics and thus the external excitation of the manipulator dynamics.

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{developments and}} experimental investigations performed {{in assessing the}} effect of internal friction on rotor systems dynamic performance are documented. Analytical component models for axial splines, Curvic splines, and interference <b>fit</b> <b>joints</b> commonly found in modern high speed turbomachinery were developed. Rotor systems operating above a bending critical speed were shown to exhibit unstable subsynchronous vibrations at the first natural frequency. The effect of speed, bearing stiffness, joint stiffness, external damping, torque, and coefficient of friction, was evaluated. Testing included material coefficient of friction evaluations, component joint quantity and form of damping determinations, and rotordynamic stability assessments. Under conditions {{similar to those in}} the SSME turbopumps, material interfaces experienced a coefficient of friction of approx. 0. 2 for lubricated and 0. 8 for unlubricated conditions. The damping observed in the component joints displayed nearly linear behavior with increasing amplitude. Thus, the measured damping, as a function of amplitude, is not represented by either linear or Coulomb friction damper models. Rotordynamic testing of an axial spline joint under 5000 in. -lb of static torque, demonstrated the presence of an extremely severe instability when the rotor was operated above its first flexible natural frequency. The presence of this instability was predicted by nonlinear rotordynamic time-transient analysis using the nonlinear component model developed under this program. Corresponding rotordynamic testing of a shaft with an interference <b>fit</b> <b>joint</b> demonstrated the presence of subsynchronous vibrations at the first natural frequency.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{compliant}} mechanism kit as a {{parallel to the}} kits available for rigid-body mechanisms. The kit consists of flexible beams and connectors {{that can be easily}} hand-assembled using <b>snap</b> <b>fits.</b> The mechanisms assembled using the kit accurately capture the aspects of the topology, shape, and size of joint-free compliant mechanisms. Thus, the kit enables designers to conceive and design new, practicable, single-piece compliant mechanisms that do not require assembly. The concept of the kit also resolves a discrepancy in the finite element (FE) modeling of beam-based compliant mechanisms. The discrepancy arises when two or more beams are joined at one point and thus leading to increased stiffness. After resolving this discrepancy, this work extends the topology optimization to automatically generate designs that can be assembled with the kit for quick and easy validation instead of time-consuming prototyping. Thus, the kit and the accompanying analysis and optimal synthesis procedures comprise a self-contained educational as well as a research and practice toolset for compliant mechanisms. The paper also illustrates how human creativity finds new ways of using the kit beyond the original intended use and how it enables even a novice to design compliant mechanisms.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{estimating}} the extreme quantiles for {{a function of}} several dependent random variables. In contrast to the conventional approach based on extreme value theory, we do not impose the condition that {{the tail of the}} underlying distribution admits an approximate parametric form, and, furthermore, our estimation makes use of the full observed data. The proposed method is semiparametric as no parametric forms are assumed on all the marginal distributions. But we select appropriate bivariate copulas to model the joint dependence structure by taking the advantage of the recent development in constructing large dimensional vine copulas. Consequently a sample quantile resulted from a large bootstrap sample drawn from the <b>fitted</b> <b>joint</b> distribution is taken as the estimator for the extreme quantile. This estimator is proved to be consistent. The reliable and robust performance of the proposed method is further illustrated by simulation. Comment: 18 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
