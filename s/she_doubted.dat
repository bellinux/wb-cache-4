25|$|In Nonnus Dionysiaca, Aura was Greek {{goddess of}} breezes and cool air, {{daughter}} of Lelantos and Periboia. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis {{and proud of}} her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and <b>she</b> <b>doubted</b> her virginity. Artemis asked Nemesis for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by Dionysus. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis. Iakhos later became an attendant of Demeter {{and the leader of}} Eleusinian Mysteries.|$|E
500|$|The Earl of Essex accused Lopez {{of conspiring}} to poison the Queen in January 1594. Insisting on his innocence, {{the doctor was}} convicted of high treason in February and hanged, drawn and {{quartered}} in June, reportedly after averring from the scaffold that [...] "he loved the Queen {{as well as he}} loved Jesus Christ"—a statement that, from a man of Jewish background, prompted mocking laughter from the crowd. Elizabeth's three-month delay signing Lopez's death warrant is sometimes interpreted as evidence that <b>she</b> <b>doubted</b> the case against him. In any case she returned almost all of his estate to his widow and children.|$|E

500|$|By 1903 Pankhurst {{believed}} that years of moderate speeches and promises about women's suffrage {{from members of}} parliament (MPs) had yielded no progress. Although suffrage bills in 1870, 1886, and 1897 had shown promise, each was defeated. <b>She</b> <b>doubted</b> that political parties, with their many agenda items, would ever make women's suffrage a priority. She even broke with the ILP when it refused to focus on Votes for Women. It was necessary to abandon the patient tactics of existing advocacy groups, she believed, in favour of more militant actions. Thus on 10 October 1903 Pankhurst and several colleagues founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organisation open only to women and focused on direct action to win the vote. [...] "Deeds," [...] she wrote later, [...] "not words, was to be our permanent motto." ...|$|E

2500|$|Margaret Ng of the Civic Party {{expressed}} concern that the political appointments would only further delay the move towards universal suffrage, as it would encourage people to align themselves to a pro-government party. <b>She</b> <b>doubted</b> that it would nurture independent and civic-spirited individuals, as it [...] "excludes those who do not blindly support the chief executive." ...|$|E
