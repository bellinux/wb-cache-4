5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle is guilty of the murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three pronged attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting marshalling yards at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons flying high cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it briefly and it caught fire while emitting white smoke. Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E

25|$|The coroner inquest was {{the first}} {{investigation}} to be completed, occurring shortly after the crash. Its purpose was not to decide absolute culpability, but rather to determine exactly the manner of death of the involved individuals.

25|$|The stadium {{hosted the}} 1941, 1951 and 1971 MLB All-Star Games. All three games {{featured}} home runs. Ted Williams won the 1941 game with an upper deck shot. The ball was also carrying {{well in the}} 1951 and 1971 games. Of the many homers in those games, the most often replayed is Reggie Jackson's drive to right field that hit so {{high up in the}} light tower that the TV camera lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> until it dropped to the field below. Jackson dropped his bat and watched it sail, seemingly astonished at his own power display.|$|E

It passes through Oamaru, from where it turns inland briefly, crossing undulating hill country before again reaching the coast at Moeraki. From here {{the road again}} hugs the coast along Katiki Beach, remaining closer to the ocean than at any point since Kaikoura. The highway turns inland at Shag Point, passing through Palmerston and Waikouaiti.|$|E

Suddenly the aggrieved look upon his flushed face changed to one of absolute bewilderment. The driver in the dark car had sprung out of the seat, a black, long-barrelled, wicked-looking pistol was poked in the traveller's face, and behind the further <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was a circle of black cloth with two deadly eyes looking from as many slits.|$|R

25|$|The highway {{begins at}} Maple Road {{north of the}} {{community}} of Bonfield, travelling north alongside a Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) track, curving northeast with a vista of a large swamp on the Kaibuskong River. It follows parallel to the river for its entire length, but is not within <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> aside from here. The highway enters a forest and diverges from the railway, curving north. From here to its northern terminus, residences dot both sides of the highway, with coniferous forests between them. The route curves back to the northeast and travels straight for , ending at Highway17 next to a restaurant and motel.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, 20 October 1805, {{a strange}} sail was {{reported}} off {{the entrance to}} the harbour. Prowse asked for and was given permission by Blackwood to investigate, and closed on the stranger. By the time this had been achieved the 74-gun Héros had come within range and opened fire. Sirius nevertheless stopped the stranger with a shot across her bow and sent an officer over to inspect her. It was determined that the ship in question was a neutral American merchant, and she was allowed to continue on her way. Prowse recovered the boat and hauled away from the French warship. The entire combined fleet had finally put to sea by 10 a.m., whereupon a burst of rainy squalls caused the frigates to lose <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until midday.|$|E

In game two, five different Boston players scored goals, {{giving them a}} 5–2 win. The Bruins then won game three, 2–1, as Daniel Paille scored the game winner with 03:31 left in regulation after the puck deflected off of Henrik Lundqvist's head, popped {{into the air and}} then bounced in an area around the goal crease where the Rangers goalie lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The Rangers avoided elimination in game four, as Chris Kreider scored at 07:03 of overtime, redirecting Rick Nash's shot into the Bruins net, giving New York a 4–3 victory. But Boston was victorious in game five, 3–1, scoring three unanswered goals, including two from Gregory Campbell.|$|E

500|$|Watts's {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} the image of Hope had near-miraculous redemptive powers. In his 1908 work Sermons in Art by the Great Masters, Stoke Newington Presbyterian minister James Burns wrote of a woman who had been walking to the Thames with the intention of suicide, but had passed the image of Hope in a shop window and been so inspired by the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that rather than attempting suicide she instead emigrated to Australia. In 1918 Watts's biographer Henry William Shrewsbury wrote of [...] "a poor girl, character-broken and heart-broken, wandering about the streets of London with a growing feeling that nothing remained but to destroy herself" [...] seeing a photograph of Hope, using the last of her money to buy the photograph, until [...] "looking at it every day, the message sank into her soul, and she fought her way back to a life of purity and honour". When music hall star Marie Lloyd died in 1922 after a life beset with alcohol, illness and depression, it was noted that among her possessions was a print of Hope; one reporter observed that among her other possessions, it looked [...] "like a good deed in a naughty world".|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{mounted a}} loose {{blockade}} {{of the combined}} fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed to be putting to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. William Pryce Cumby, Bellerophons first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS Mars. The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{on the morning of}} 21 October. The officer and sailors of Bellerophon prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words [...] "Victory or Death" [...] on their gun barrels. At 11 am Bellerophons signal midshipman, John Franklin, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal [...] "England expects that every man will do his duty", and {{an hour and a half}} later Bellerophon entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee column. She was astern of the 80-gun HMS Tonnant and ahead of the 74-gun , with the 74-gun [...] close by her port side.|$|E
500|$|Intense media {{interest}} in the opinions and private lives {{of the royal family}} during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: [...] "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards." [...] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: [...] "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost <b>sight</b> <b>of...</b> <b>it</b> is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." [...] It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party – Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed [...] "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift – membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter – to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a [...] "behind the scenes force" [...] in ending apartheid.|$|E
