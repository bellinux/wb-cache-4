40|$|The {{importance}} of soil water flow paths to {{the transport of}} nutrients and contaminants has long been recognized. However, effective means of detecting concentrated subsurface flow paths in a large landscape are still lacking. The flow direction and accumulation algorithm based on single-direction flow algorithm (D 8) in GIS hydrologic modeling is a cost-effective way to simulate potential concentrated flow paths over a large area once relevant data are collected. This study tested the D 8 algorithm for simulating concentrated lateral flow paths at three interfaces in soil profiles in a 19. 5 -ha agricultural landscape in central Pennsylvania, USA. These interfaces were (1) the interface between surface plowed layers of Ap 1 and Ap 2 horizons, (2) the interface with subsoil water-restricting clay layer where clay content increased to over 40 %, and (3) the soil-bedrock interface. The <b>simulated</b> flow <b>paths</b> were validated through soil hydrologic monitoring, geophysical surveys, and observable soil morphological features. The results confirmed that concentrated subsurface lateral flow occurred at the interfaces with the clay layer and the underlying bedrock. At these two interfaces, the soils on the <b>simulated</b> flow <b>paths</b> were closer to saturation and showed more temporally unstable moisture dynamics than those off the <b>simulated</b> flow <b>paths.</b> Apparent electrical conductivity in the soil on the <b>simulated</b> flow <b>paths</b> was elevated and temporally unstable as compared to those outside the <b>simulated</b> <b>paths.</b> The soil cores collected from the <b>simulated</b> flow <b>paths</b> showed significantly higher Mn content at these interfaces than those away from the <b>simulated</b> <b>paths.</b> These results suggest that (1) the D 8 algorithm is useful in simulating possible concentrated subsurface lateral flow paths if used with appropriate threshold value of contributing area and sufficiently detailed digital elevation model (DEM); (2) repeated electromagnetic surveys can reflect the temporal change of soil water storage and thus is a useful indicator of possible subsurface flow path over a large area; and (3) observable Mn distribution in soil profiles {{can be used as}} a simple indicator of water flow paths in soils and over the landscape; however, it does require sufficient soil sampling (by excavation or augering) to possibly infer landscape-scale subsurface flow paths. In areas where subsurface interface topography varies similarly with surface topography, surface DEM can be used to simulate potential subsurface lateral flow path reasonably so the cost associated with obtaining depth to subsurface water-restricting layer can be minimized...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{evolution}} mechanisms of a hydrochemical field and to promote its benefits to the living standards of local people and to the local economy in the southern plain area of Pengyang County, in Ningxia, China. Based on understanding of the hydrogeological conditions in Pengyang County, the chemical evolution characteristics of groundwater in the plain area were analyzed. PHREEQC geochemical modeling software was used to perform hydrochemical modeling of water-rock interaction and to quantitatively analyze the evolution processes and the formation mechanisms of the local groundwater. Geochemical modeling was performed for two groundwater paths. The results showed that, along path 1, Na+ adsorption played the leading role in the precipitation process and its amount was the largest, up to 6. 08 mmol/L; cation exchange was significant along path 1, while along <b>simulated</b> <b>path</b> 2, albite accounted for the largest amount of dissolution, reaching 9. 06 mmol/L, and the cation exchange was not significant. According to the modeling results, along the groundwater flow path, calcite and dolomite showed oversaturated status with a precipitation trend, while the fluorite and gypsum throughout the <b>simulated</b> <b>path</b> were not saturated and showed a dissolution trend. The total dissolved solids (TDS) increased and water quality worsened along the flow path. The dissolution reactions of albite, CO 2, and halite, the exchange adsorption reaction of Na+, and the precipitation of sodium montmorillonite and calcite were the primary hydrogeochemical reactions, resulting in changes of hydrochemical ingredients...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} efficiency gains from schemes that reduce the expected cost of a <b>simulated</b> <b>path,</b> which allows more paths given a fixed computational budget. Many such schemes impart bias, so {{we look at the}} bias-variance tradeoff in terms of mean squared error. The work reduction schemes we consider are fast numerical evaluation of functions, such as the exponential, as well as changes to simulation structure and sampling schemes. The latter include descriptive sampling, reducing the number of time steps, and dispensing with some factors in a multi-factor simulation. In simulations where computational budgets are tightly constrained, such as risk management and calibration of financial models, using cheaper, less accurate algorithms can reduce mean squared error. ...|$|E

40|$|Asset {{allocation}} {{decisions are}} critical for investors with diversiåed portfolios. Institutional investors must manage their strategic asset mix over time to achieve favorable returns subject to various uncertainties, policy and legal constraints, and other requirements. In {{order to determine the}} asset mix explicitly, we can use a multi-period portfolio optimization model. The notion of scenarios is typically employed for modeling random parameters in the multi-period stochastic programming(MSP) model, and the path of uncertainties is revealed as a scenario tree. On the other hand, a <b>simulated</b> <b>path</b> model is proposed and formulated as a linear programming model by Hibiki[4, 5]. The path of uncertainties is revealed as simulated paths associated with any stochastic process, and we can get a better accuracy of uncertainties by using simulated paths rather than a scenario tree. Two kinds of stochas-tic optimization models involve trading oã the appropriate decisions and the accuracy of uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization model by using simulated paths and decision tree in order to do both describing the accuracy of uncertainties and making the conditional decisions. We have sample paths associated with asset returns using Monte Carlo simulation as used in the <b>simulated</b> <b>path</b> model, while we allow the model to expand the decision space and to make the conditional decisions as used in the scenario tree model. We test some cases using numerical examples We ånd that we can control the risk and return of the terminal wealth in some degree directly by using this model. The hybrid model can be formulated as its compact representation form to reduce the pro-gram size. We ånd that we can decrease its computation time, according to some numerical tests. ÉThe hybrid optimization model is originally proposed by Hibiki[6, 7](written in Japanese).

40|$|With the {{scaling of}} CMOS technology, {{critical}} paths in digital circuits have become largely sensitive to process, voltage and temperature variations {{as well as}} to aging effects, generally resulting into a mismatch between the <b>simulated</b> <b>path</b> delay of the circuit obtained with CAD tools and the actual path delay on the manufactured chip. In order to solve this issue and to also avoid conservative strategies based on increasing time margins, adaptive techniques are the most desirable solution because they should automatically sense and correct timing variations online.

40|$|We {{advocate}} in {{this paper}} {{the use of a}} Sequential Partial Indirect Inference (SPII) approach, in order to account for calibration practice where dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (DGSE) are studied only through their ability to reproduce some well-chosen moments.

Such likely misspecification is even more detrimental than for direct inference, since the misspecified model is used for building <b>simulated</b> <b>paths.</b> The only way to get robust estimators, but also to assess the model despite misspecification consists in examining the structural model through a convenient and parsimonious instrumental model, which basically does not capture what goes wrong in the <b>simulated</b> <b>paths.</b> We argue that a well-driven SPII strategy might be seen as a rigorous calibrationnist approach, that captures both the advantages of this approach (accounting for structural “astatistical” ideas) and of the inferential approach (precise appraisal of loss functions and conditions of validity).
