40|$|Engineering {{surfaces}} {{are characterized by}} the form, waviness and roughness features that are comprised {{of a range of}} spatial wavelengths. Filtering techniques are commonly adopted to separate these different wavelength components into well-defined bandwidths for further processing. The Gaussian filtered surface in which a 2 D Gaussian filter is employed for surface assessments has been recommended by the ISO 11562 - 1996 and ASME B 46 - 1995 standards to establish a reference surface. For Gaussian filtering, computational efficiency is a key problem when it is issued on a large set of surface metrology data. In the past this problem was tackled through reducing computation amount by the design and adoption of some fast algorithms. In this paper, a general purpose computing on GPU (GPGPU) framework is discussed to accelerate 2 D Gaussian filtering for surface characterization. This framework takes advantage of the GPUpsilas parallel computing ability and has achieved better data efficiency without reducing the computational amount while maintaining the filtering quality.

40|$|AbstractThe {{solution}} of a continuum mechanical {{boundary value problem}} requires a constitutive response that connects deformation and stress at each material point. Such connection {{can be regarded as}} three separate hierarchical problems. At the top-most level, partitioning of the (mean) boundary values of the material point among its microstructural constituents and the associated homogenization of their response is required, provided {{there is more than one}} constituent present. Second, based on an elastoplastic decomposition of (finite strain) deformation, these responses follow from explicit or implicit time integration of the plastic deformation rate per constituent. Third, to establish the latter, a state variable-based constitutive law needs to be interrogated and its state updated. The Düsseldorf Advanced MAterial <b>Simulation</b> <b>Kit</b> (DAMASK) reflects this hierarchy as it is built in a strictly modular way. This modular structure makes it easy to add additional constitutive models as well as homogenization schemes. Moreover it interfaces with a number of FE solvers as well as a spectral solver using an FFT. We demonstrate the versatility of such a modular framework by considering three scenarios: Selective refinement of the constitutive material description within a single geometry, component-scale forming simulations comparing di_erent homogenization schemes, and comparison of representative volume element simulations based on the FEM and the spectral solver...|$|E
40|$|Creating {{effective}} agroforestry {{systems with}} broad public support requires simultaneously addressing landowner and societal goals while paying respect to ecological processes that cross spatial and political boundaries. To meet this challenge, {{a variety of}} planning and design tools are needed that are straight-forward and flexible enough to accommodate the range of issues and the many individual decision-making processes involved. In this paper, we offer some principles {{that should be considered}} when developing planning and design tools for agroforestry. To illustrate how these principles might be used, we will present a few tools from the Comprehensive Conservation Buffer Planning project at the USDA National Agroforestry Center. At the regional scale, the Regional Atlas for Conservation Planning enables stakeholders to quickly review and incorporate a range of issues in their agroforestry planning effort. The landscape scale is supported by GIs-guided assessments addressing water quality, wildlife habitat, and income diversification options for landowners. The real value of these assessments is the ability to combine them to identify locations where multiple objectives can be achieved with a buffer investment. At the site scale, landowner's economic and social concerns can be addressed with Buffers, an economic analysis tool, and the Can Vis Visual <b>Simulation</b> <b>Kit,</b> a computer-based visualization tool for creating photo-realistic simulations of buffer alternatives.

40|$|Natural {{resource}} professionals {{often hear}} the words, “What will it look like? ” from landowners who have difficulty in understanding a proposed agroforestry or conservation plan. Planting plans and engineering drawings, while necessary, often mean {{little to the}} general public. When practices require a long-term commitment like agroforestry, landowners {{want to know what}} it will actually look like on the ground before committing to a plan. Now resource professionals have a tool to translate these plans into real-life pictures or images called visual simulations. Visual simulations are digital images which have been altered to illustrate design alternatives. Using image-editing software, proposed designs can be “created ” by adding images of plants and other landscaping materials onto a base image of the landowner’s property that has been acquired from either a scanned or digital photo. In a relatively short time, windbreaks, riparian buffers, and other agroforestry practices can be illustrated at various stages of development, compositions, and arrangements on the landscape. The USDA National Agroforestry Center has developed the CanVis Visual <b>Simulation</b> <b>Kit</b> consisting of the Visual Simulation Guide, a multimedia, CD-reference manual on how to create simulations for natural resource planning and CanVis, an image-editing software program designed specifically for conservation applications.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in cosmology to model large-scale structure observables as lognormal random fields, and this approach has been successfully applied {{in the past to}} the matter density and weak lensing convergence fields separately. We argue that this approach has fundamental limitations which prevent its use for jointly modelling these two fields since the lognormal distribution's shape can prevent certain correlations to be attainable. Given the need of ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys for fast joint simulations of clustering and weak lensing, we propose two ways of overcoming these limitations. The first approach slightly distorts the power spectra of the fields using one of two algorithms that minimises either the absolute or the fractional distortions. The second one is by obtaining more accurate convergence marginal distributions, for which we provide a fitting function, by integrating the lognormal density along the line of sight. The latter approach also provides a way to determine directly from theory the skewness of the convergence distribution and, therefore, the parameters for a lognormal fit. We present the public code Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields <b>Simulation</b> <b>Kit</b> (FLASK) which can make tomographic realisations on the sphere of an arbitrary number of correlated lognormal or Gaussian random fields by applying either of the two proposed solutions, and show that it can create joint simulations of clustering and lensing with sub-per-cent accuracy over relevant angular scales and redshift ranges.

40|$|High energy {{neutrino}} emission from GRBs is discussed. In this paper, {{by using}} the <b>simulation</b> <b>kit</b> GEANT 4, we calculate proton cooling efficiency including pion-multiplicity and proton-inelasticity in photomeson production. First, we estimate the maximum energy of accelerated protons in GRBs. Using the obtained results, neutrino flux from one burst and a diffuse neutrino background are evaluated quantitatively. We also take account of cooling processes of pion and muon, which are crucial for resulting neutrino spectra. We confirm the validity of analytic approximate treatments on GRB fiducial parameter sets, but also find {{that the effects of}} multiplicity and high-inelasticity can be important on both proton cooling and resulting spectra in some cases. Finally, assuming that the GRB rate traces the star formation rate, we obtain a diffuse neutrino background spectrum from GRBs for specific parameter sets. We introduce the nonthermal baryon-loading factor, rather than assume that GRBs are main sources of UHECRs. We find that the obtained neutrino background can be comparable with the prediction of Waxman & Bahcall, although our ground in estimation is different from theirs. In this paper, we study on various parameters since there are many parameters in the model. The detection of high energy neutrinos from GRBs {{will be one of the}} strong evidences that protons are accelerated to very high energy in GRBs. Furthermore, the observations of a neutrino background has a possibility not only to test the internal shock model of GRBs but also to give us information about parameters in the model and whether GRBs are sources of UHECRs or not.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the {{research}} on fundamental magnetic structures, like domainwalls, spinwaves and vortices, resulted in a detailed understanding of the magnetizationdynamics in ferromagnetic materials, without which the development of modernstorage devices {{would not have been}} possible. On the pathway to this level of understandingmicromagnetic simulations played an important role due to their abilityto reproduce experimental results in great detail and, especially, to predict magneticpatterns and their dynamic properties. An example of the predictive power is theresearch eld of vortex dynamics. Another fundamental magnetic structure is theBloch point, which is particularly complex since the description of the processes andenergy terms responsible for its formation lie within the scope of the continuum theoryof micromagnetism, but the study of its detailed properties requires a dierentframework. In terms of topology and concerning the exchange energy density, theBloch point displays a point singularity in the theory of micromagnetism. Bloch points are not a marginal phenomenon; they play, e. g., an important roleas transient structures during the switching of vortex cores and reside inside of thearchetypal example of vortex domain walls in solid cylindrical nanowires. In the 1960 s, E. Feldtkeller and W. Döring described and characterized Bloch points withthe then available methods, yet their dynamics eluded a detailed description, since onone hand a large volume is necessary to stabilize a Bloch point structure and on theother hand an atomistic description of its center is required. To solve this problem wedeveloped a multiscale multimodel simulation framework {{in the context of this}} thesis,which is able to detect automatically Bloch points as well as other micromagneticallycritical structures. In that <b>simulation</b> <b>kit</b> we apply a classical Heisenberg model tothe critical regions, while using the framework of micromagnetism for the remainingsample, which is discretized with nite elements. The program allows not only for astatic examination of Bloch points residing in a localized Heisenberg approximatedregion, but also for dynamic simulations due to its ability to detect regions of interestautomatically as well as to track them with the multimodel region. The simulations within this thesis focus on ferromagnetic cylindrical nanowireswith vortex domain walls. The simulations describe the depinning eld necessaryto trigger a propagation of the domain wall with the Bloch point in its center andthe impact of the relative orientation of the lattice to the Bloch point propagationdirection. In addition, we could identify dierent propagation patterns of the structureconsisting of domain wall and Bloch point. In addition to regimes with a continuousdomain wall movement, this thesis highlights and discusses several complex modes ofdomain wall/Bloch point propagation. In particular, we nd a propagation regimein which the Bloch point and domain wall propagate with constant velocity abovethe minimum spin wave phase velocity. This velocity remains constant within abroad interval of external eld strength. Using analytic calculations we could ascribethis maximum velocity, which is a feature of potential interest from a technologicalperspective, to an intrinsic property of the Bloch point [...] ...|$|E

The solar atmosphere was approximated by 10 vertically-stacked zones. The simulation took into account two important physical processes,that the bremsstrahlung photons emitted by precipitating relativistic electrons are strongly forward beamed toward the photosphere, and {{that the majority of}} these gamma-rays must be Compton back-scattered by the solar atmosphere in order to reach the observer. Then, the Compton degradation was found to make the observable gamma-ray spectra much softer than is predicted by simple analytic calculations. The gamma-ray signals were found to be enhanced by several conditions, including a broad pitch-angle distribution of the electrons, a near-limb flare longitude, and a significant tilt in the magnetic field lines if the flare longitude is rather small. These results successfully explain several important flare properties observed in the hard X-ray to gamma-ray range, including in particular those obtained with Yohkoh. A comparison of the Yohkoh spectrum from a GOES X 3. 7 class limb flare on 1998 November 22, with a simulation assuming a broad electron pitch-angle distribution, suggests that gamma-rays from this particular solar flare were a mixture of direct bremsstrahlung photons and their Comptonization.
