Reducing polluting emissions in air remains a field in which there are needed important investments, considering the commitments assumed by Romania for reducing emissions and the poor quality of the air in certain areas. The paper analyzes the evolution of the main emissions, respectively the ones coming from large burning installations and greenhouse gases and identifies financing possibilities for the reduction of those emissions by using structural and cohesion funds or by using <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes.</b> air pollution; emissions reduction; large burning installations; financing; Romania...|$|E
40|$|This study, {{according}} to our knowledge is among the few ones dealing with the analysis of state aid impact and {{of the way it}} was used at national level. Firstly, the goal of our study is to analyze the evolution of state aid in Romania, the impact on regional development, on creating jobs and value added. Secondly it is intented to see the contribution of automotive sector which received the highest amount of state aid to the trade balance from the current account between 2008 - 2015. Automotive sector is a key sector for the development of Romanian economy in the last 10 years for the manufacturing and assembly of cars and for companies producing equipment or auto parts. The paper is structured in seven parts which deal with topics like the state aid in the European Union and Romania, <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> and funded sectors in Romania, sectorial and geographical distribution of the state aid, the analysis of the automotive sector for Romania...|$|E

The main objectives of investment incentives in both countries are regional development, employment, labourforce, modernization and use of renewable energy sources.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the most significant}} elements related to the direct enactment by the executive authority – following the most difficult moments {{of the financial crisis}} (2009 - 2010) – of some key measures in determining the economic recovery/growth. Special attention is given to the problem of growth strengthening and sustainable competitiveness of small and medium enterprises, {{as well as to the}} issue of stimulating the set up and development of micro enterprises by junior entrepreneurs. Considering things from the legal perspective, we also stop upon the legislative measures taken by the Government to support SME access to financial guarantees and credits. Obviously, in the context following the peak of the financial crisis, we took into consideration the regulation on stimulating the development of new jobs and the regime of state aids, as well. This latter issue includes, we believe, the most important references to <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> on stimulating the investments with a major impact in the economy, the ‘de minimis’ aid for the investments made by small and medium-sized enterprises, and also to the issues arising from the implementation of a State aid scheme to support the investments which promote the regional development by creating jobs...|$|E

The objectives of this paper were to examine the pathway of European cinema market and the relationship with its consumers along with their interests and attitudes towards European films and to research the most important measures taken by European Union institutions under their competition policy to support European films through <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes.</b> In order to give shape to these objectives, in-depth interviews with five elite specialists from the Romanian film industry were used, specialists who possess international expertise and recognition. The problems of the qualitative research are: the modification of consumer behaviour face to European cinema and support measures. The findings suggest that regarding its relationship with consumers and their interests in the seventh art, European cinema faces many different difficulties ranging from the competition with American films and insufficient funds, to the increased comfortableness or coziness of the movie consumers of our times. The paper concludes with examples of measures suggested by the respondents, to help European cinema become more attractive to consumers, measures which are already being implemented by the industry, making the results of our study useful for policy and decision makers within this cultural area. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that that over 60 % of private investment contracts have been canceled {{due to the lack}} of private co-financing. Basically, a large part of the EU funds for agricultural development cannot be accessed due to the current poor access to finance of (small and medium-size) farmers. Several factors, such as guarantees of up to 150 % of the loan value, low profitability, or high default risk that hinder the sector’s access to the credit market, should be mitigated by state intervention. Such a measure can be included in the 2014 - 2020 RDP, consistent with the European Commission’s recommendation to include financial instruments for supporting access to finance for farmers and agricultural associations. The analysis presented in this paper builds on the solutions proposed in a previous CRPE report focusing on microcredit, based on the existing mechanisms of the state. Firstly, it aims to support OUG 43 / 2013 by establishing: (1) a fund for middle-size farms for investment of up to 300, 000 Euro, significantly lower than the previous ceiling of 3 mil. Euro and (2) a microcredit fund (max. 25, 000 Euro), both measures coupled with an interest rate subsidy facility. Ultimately, the aim is to reduce the interest rate that farmers are facing by at least 4 percentage points. Secondly, we propose extending and improving the instruments designed for bearing part of the risk burden, through (1) a <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> for reducing the cost of the guarantees for projects undertaken by young farmers and start-ups, and (2) providing 100 % guarantee for young farmers that access RDP funds for agricultural investment. ...|$|R

From that point, numerous EU initiatives have been employed {{to facilitate the}} country's legal, economic and political change in order to prepare it for (potential) EU membership. The cornerstone of {{the relations between the}} country and the EU is the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which mandates the full alignment of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> measures to EU standards. Since 2006, subsequent governments have been working on aligning the substantive rules for the granting of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> to the (ever-changing) EU framework, with a growing number of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> measures and <b>schemes</b> being notified to and approved by the Commission for <b>State</b> <b>Aid</b> Control. However, this period was also characterised by a severe economic crisis that created the challenge for the Serbian government of aligning with the EU <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> regime, on the one hand, and facing pressure to save failing banks and companies, and prevent job losses, on the other. By examining the institutional structure of the regime's control body and the overall experiences of {{the first phase of the}} implementation of the Law on <b>State</b> <b>aid,</b> this paper draws conclusions on the major challenges and obstacles to introducing a new regulatory regime in the context of a deep economic crisis, ongoing enlargement fatigue and conflicting political legacies...|$|R

40|$|Both the European Commission’s {{decision-making}} and the EU case-law on <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> are symptomatic of the uncertainty, {{and sometimes even}} contradiction, that is implicit in treatments of State aid, a discipline which form part of the Treaty’s rules on competition, in which, nonetheless the rights that undertakings enjoy are quite limited. This article examines the current position in the case-law on whether {{it is possible for}} undertakings (whether aid beneficiaries, or their competitors) to challenge the Commission’s decision on aid schemes, meaning state measures, often implemented in the form of legislation, that address a number of beneficiaries and that may fall under the prohibition set forth in Articles 107 et seq. TFEU. This is an area in which the Commission and the Community judicature are constantly doing battle. The Commission tends to view its decisions as purely general measures, and as such not open to challenge, the judicature has shown greater flexibility towards the undertakings that bring actions before it, frequently finding that these decisions affect applicants’ positions, and are thus subject to review. The article looks in particular at recent developments in the case-law that have applied Article 263 (4) TFEU, final limb, to State aid, finding that a decision on an aid scheme may in some cases constitute a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures. The aim is to show how in this field the case-law of the European courts, while complex and not always consistent, has nonetheless sought to listen to businesses’ concerns, gradually eroding the principle favoured by the Commission, that decisions on aid schemes are an exclusive matter between the Commission and the Member States...|$|E

40|$|Liberalization of the European {{internal}} market for energy {{by means of}} unbundling and third party access alone {{is not enough to}} make renewable energy on a par with fossil fuels. To increase the production of renewable energy in its Member States, the EU has in place a set of legal instruments to promote the scale up of renewable energy production through i. e. setting binding targets for renewables and providing a legal framework for support schemes. However, while arguably consistent with EU disciplines pertaining to <b>State</b> <b>aid,</b> EU support <b>schemes</b> can easily fall foul of WTO subsidy disciplines. This article argues that EU and WTO law are disconnected paradigms in this respect: EU legislation by its design at-tempts to legitimize support schemes for renewable energy, not necessarily taking into account their consistency with the WTO ASCM.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen both a {{significant}} shift in EU <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> policy towards a more sophisticated economic approach and a great enrichment of the economic literature on <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> This paper examines the control of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the EU {{in the light of}} the new literature. It begins with a discussion of the objectives of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control, taking account of the principle of subsidiarity. We discuss whether <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control should concentrate on limiting the effects of aid on trade and competition (i. e. harm to rivals) or whether the purpose is broader and includes also considerations such as avoiding government failures and encouraging Member States to use <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> more sparingly and target it more efficiently. This leads to a brief analysis of how the appropriate welfare standard to be applied in <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control would vary according to the weight given to different objectives. The paper then considers the objectives pursued by governments in granting aid with particular emphasis on the concept of market failure. The nature and magnitude of the market failure addressed by a <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> together with the design of the aid, will strongly influence the extent of any anti-competitive effects. The last two parts (4 and 5) of the paper are devoted to specific problems of assessing anti-competitive effects using the types of information normally available to the aid-granting authorities and the European Commission. Part 4 discusses the problem of assessing the effects on competition of <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> and broad classes of aid, when the beneficiaries and even the affected markets are not known. Because Member States grant a vast number of individual aids every year, the Commission has to apply simple criteria to screen out those aids that are unlikely to have significant anti-competitive effects. We survey a range of indicators that can be used for this purpose and conclude that they all have drawbacks. Part 5 deals with the problems of assessing individual awards of aid which have failed the screening test, discussing how the main characteristics of firms (e. g. market share, vertical integration) and markets (such as product differentiation and market growth) may influence a <b>state</b> <b>aid's</b> impact on competition.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master's {{thesis is}} to assess how the first {{criterion}} {{of the notion of}} <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> laid down in Article 107 (1) TFEU, that of aid having been granted by the Member State or through State resources, is interpreted. The purpose is to assess what the basic rules governing the interpretation and application of the criterion are, how the criterion has been interpreted and applied in practice, and what problematic aspects and challenges the application of the criterion has brought about. Instead of attempting to identify an exhaustive list of <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> in which the assessment of the criterion has been relevant, the focus of this thesis is on its interpretation through a series of interesting categories of <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> and recent examples of cases. The analysis of the research question relies primarily on the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The main rule guiding the interpretation of the criterion is simple: it consists of two cumulative subconditions. In order to fulfil the public origin criterion, a measure must be imputable to the State and granted through State resources. The concept of State is interpreted broadly. Nevertheless, case law shows that the application of this test in practice is not necessarily as clear as it may seem. Although the Court of Justice of the European Union has rendered a number of significant judgments on the matter in recent years, what the first criterion of Article 107 (1) TFEU actually means remains unclear. <b>Aid</b> <b>schemes</b> can be very complex in one way or another. For example, they might involve intermediary bodies or areas previously uncontested {{from the point of view}} of State intervention in terms of <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> control. Sometimes it can prove challenging to apply principles already laid down in case law to other schemes in a consistent manner. The difficulty of assessing public undertakings' actions in terms of the fulfilment of the criterion lies in the necessity of case-by-case assessments of whether the State has influenced an undertakings' actions. Applying the indicators for imputability in a clear, consistent and detailed way may prove challenging. It is evident that the issue of forgone revenue can be relevant in more creative schemes than one would think. The issue of private bodies and private resources involved in <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> is particularly problematic due to the fluctuating results it has led to and the seemingly illogical outcomes of cases with very similar circumstances and effects. One of the challenges regarding the interpretation of the criterion is finding a balance between the influence of the organisational model chosen by the State for the execution of an <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> and the influence of the effects of the measure on its categorisation as <b>State</b> <b>aid.</b> Another important issue surrounding the interpretation of the criterion is whether its second leg, the requirement of the use of State resources, should be abandoned. Nevertheless, no clear signs of a permanent shift towards this approach have been witnessed. For the moment, the general principles surrounding the interpretation of the criterion are not so clear as to remove the need for a detailed case-by-case analysis of whether measures fulfil the criterion or eliminate the risk of surprising results for stakeholders and Member States. Clearer guidance on the interpretation of the criterion would be more than welcome in order to improve legal certainty...|$|R

The European Union and its member states are increasingly recognizing {{the need to}} rethink the balance between the various objectives of state intervention.
