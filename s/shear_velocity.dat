They reported there are two thresholds of the influence of water content on <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocity.</b> The laboratory test results show that, as the volumetric water content varies from zero to the first threshold of around 0.15, the <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocities</b> of different soils decrease sharply. When the water content is in the range of approximately 0.15 – 0.40, the <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocities</b> gradually decrease with a mild rate as the water content increases. After the water content exceeds the second threshold of about 0.40, the <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocities</b> decrease significantly with the water content increases.

The <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocity</b> of soil in the city of Bangalore was mapped using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Wave (MASW) technique. An empirical relationship was found between the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) corrected N value ((N 1) 60 cs) and measured <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocity</b> (Vs). The survey points were selected {{in such a way that}} the results represent the entire Bangalore region, covering an area of 220 km 2. Fifty-eight 1 -D and 20 2 -D MASW surveys were performed and their velocity profiles determined. The average <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocity</b> of Bangalore soils was evaluated for depths of 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 25 m and 30 m. The sub-soil classification was made for seismic local site effect evaluation based on average <b>shear</b> wave <b>velocity</b> of 30 -m depth (Vs 30) of sites using the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and International Building Code (IBC) classification. Mapping clearly indicates that the depth of soil obtained from MASW closely matches with the soil layers identified in SPT bore holes.
