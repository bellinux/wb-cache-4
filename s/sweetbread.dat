5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or <b>sweetbread</b> mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E

25|$|The Argentine {{barbecue}} asado, includes suculent {{types of}} meat, among them chorizo, <b>sweetbread,</b> chitterlings, and morcilla (blood sausage). Thin sandwiches, known as sandwiches de miga, are also popular. Argentines {{have the highest}} consumption of red meat in the world.|$|E
25|$|Grilled {{meat from}} the asado (barbecue) is a staple, with steak and beef ribs {{especially}} common. The term asado itself refers to long strips of flank-cut beef ribs. Popular items such as Chorizo (pork sausage), morcilla (blood sausage), chinchulines (chitterlings), mollejas (<b>sweetbread),</b> {{and other parts of}} the animal are also enjoyed. In Patagonia, however, lamb and chivito (goat) are eaten more frequently than beef. Whole lambs and goats are traditionally cooked over an open fire in a technique known as asado a la estaca.|$|E
500|$|Also among Schwa's {{best known}} dishes is the <b>sweetbread</b> dessert. [...] Combining {{caramelized}} sweetbreads with vanilla beanparsnip custard, the dish {{has been described}} as [...] "unequivocally adored". [...] Other notable dishes include pad Thai made with jellyfish instead of noodles, antelope meat dusted with curry powder and coated with white chocolate pudding, [...] "pine cones" [...] (sea urchin ice cream served in pine-flavored cones), and something Carlson calls [...] "onion glue". Innovative drinks, such as beet juice flavored with bacon, are also available. [...] However, Schwa does not serve bread or wine. [...] Customers wishing wine are required to bring their own, although Carlson will offer suggestions of what to bring upon request.|$|E

50|$|Chongoyape is {{also known}} for their <b>sweetbreads.</b> One of their special <b>sweetbreads</b> is called “Chongoyape”. Also, since Chongoyape belongs to the region of Lambayeque, they are known for a pastry called King Kong. This {{delicacy}} is made with the same old methods and provided by the Valera family (heirs of the great Eufemio Valera). Another dish Chongoyape is known for is shurumbo, a soup made with green banana, cassava, beans and pork. This plate is traditional in Chongoyape.|$|R
500|$|Glasse set out {{her views}} of French cuisine in the book's introduction: [...] "I have indeed given {{some of my}} Dishes French Names to {{distinguish}} them, because they are known by those names; And where there is great Variety of Dishes, and a large Table to cover, so there must be Variety of Names for them; and it matters not whether they be called by a French, Dutch, or English Name, so they are good, and done with as little Expence as the Dish will allow of." [...] An {{example of such a}} recipe is [...] "To à la Daube Pigeons"; a daube is a rich French meat stew from Provence, traditionally made with beef. Her [...] "A Goose à la Mode" [...] is served in a sauce flavoured with red wine, home-made [...] "Catchup", veal <b>sweetbread,</b> truffles, morels, and (more ordinary) mushrooms. She occasionally uses French ingredients; [...] "To make a rich Cake" [...] includes [...] "half a Pint of right French Brandy", as well as the same amount of [...] "Sack" [...] (Spanish sherry).|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} of [...] calf (ris de veau) {{and lamb}} (ris d'agneau), and, less commonly, of beef and pork, {{are used as}} food under the culinary name of <b>sweetbread.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} {{was first}} identified by Herophilus (335–280 BC), a Greek anatomist and surgeon. A few hundred years later, Rufus of Ephesus, another Greek anatomist, gave the pancreas its name. Etymologically, the term [...] "pancreas", a modern Latin adaptation of Greek πάγκρεας, , originally means <b>sweetbread,</b> although literally meaning all-flesh, presumably {{because of its}} fleshy consistency. It was only in 1889 when Oskar Minkowski discovered that removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic (insulin was later discovered by Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best in 1921).|$|E

2500|$|Food critics {{generally}} {{appreciate what}} Carlson does. Writing for the Chicago Tribune, food critic Phil Vettel describes Carlson as [...] "creative with his ingredients, artistic in his presentations and utterly fearless with flavor pairings." [...] Another critic {{called him a}} [...] "culinary maverick ... whose choices often [...] {{in the face of}} fine-dining expectations." [...] Alan Richman describes Schwa's caramelized <b>sweetbread</b> dessert as [...] "the finest dessert ever to emerge from foodstuffs that have no logical reason being used in a dessert." [...] BlackBook Magazine has described Carlson as [...] "culinary genius" [...] and [...] "one of Chicago’s best chefs," [...] while Frommer's remarks [...] "Carlson's sensory imagination sometimes rises to the level of sheer poetry." [...] Fellow Chicago chef and mentor, Grant Achatz, sums Carlson up: [...] "This guy can cook. [...] He {{was one of the most}} talented and dedicated chefs that I have ever worked with." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr and Mrs Lupex {{had eaten}} a <b>sweetbread</b> {{together}} in much connubial bliss {{on that day}} which had seen Cradell returning to Mrs Roper's hospitable board. They had together eaten a <b>sweetbread,</b> with some other delicacies of the season, in the neighbourhood of the theatre, and had washed down all unkindness with bitter beer and brandy-and-water. But of this reconciliation Cradell had not heard; {{and when he saw}} them come together into the drawing-room, a few minutes after the question he had addressed to Miss Spruce, he was certainly surprised.|$|E
50|$|Court-bouillon or {{court bouillon}} is a quickly-cooked broth used for {{poaching}} other foods, most commonly fish or seafood. It is also sometimes used for poaching vegetables, eggs, <b>sweetbreads,</b> cockscombs, and delicate meats.|$|R
50|$|Combs were {{formerly}} used in French cuisine as garnishes. They {{were also}} used to prepare salpicons served in vol-au-vents, profiteroles, etc. {{in which they were}} often combined with other luxury ingredients such as truffles, <b>sweetbreads,</b> or morels in a cream sauce.|$|R
60|$|As {{additional}} reserves there were <b>sweetbreads,</b> and five milts, sewed {{up at one}} side {{in the form of}} a chrysalis, and stuffed with thyme, sage, parsley, mint, groats, rice, milk, chopped egg, and other ingredients. They were afterwards roasted before a slow fire, and eaten hot.|$|R

50|$|The ragout-filled dish was {{regarded}} as a French cuisine delicacy, first described in a recipe from 1691 by the chef of the French king Louis XIV and using ingredients such as truffles, <b>sweetbreads,</b> and cream cheese.

5000|$|À la Maréchale ("marshal's wife-style" [...] in French) is {{a method}} of food {{preparation}} in haute cuisine.

By this time Hannah Protheroe had got herself comfortably into a chair, and no doubt her {{personal}} pleasure in the evening's occupation was considerably enhanced by the unconscious feeling {{that she was the}} richer woman of the two. But she behaved very well, and I am inclined to think, in preparing buttered muffins for her guest, she was more particular in the toasting, and more generous with the butter, than she would have been had she been preparing the dainty for drawing-room use. And when she learned that Margaret had eaten nothing since breakfast, she herself went out and brought in a <b>sweetbread</b> with her own hand, though she kept a servant whom she might have sent to the shop. And, for the honour of lodging-house keepers, I protest that that <b>sweetbread</b> never made its appearance in any bill.|$|E

50|$|Tripoux (or Tripous) is a dish {{made with}} small bundles of sheep tripe, usually stuffed with sheep's feet, <b>sweetbreads</b> and various herbs and garden vegetables.
