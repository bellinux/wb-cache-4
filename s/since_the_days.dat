5|$|Competition {{emerged in}} the New Zealand wrestling {{industry}} during May 2006 in Wellington, when Rip Morgan split from Stirling's company and Kiwi Pro Wrestling was established, {{made up of a}} number of Stirling's former stars. These new promotions also brought back televised wrestling, which had been absent <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of Rickard's On the Mat, with the debut of IPW Ignition and KPW's Off the Ropes.|$|E
5|$|I neither fear nor eschame to say, is {{the most}} perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the apostles.

60|$|Nor <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of <b>the</b> caveman has man's {{efficiency}} for food-getting and shelter-getting diminished. It {{has increased}} a thousandfold. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of <b>the</b> caveman, matter has been mastered. The secrets of matter have been discovered. Its {{laws have been}} formulated. Wonderful artifices have been made, and marvellous inventions, all tending to increase tremendously man's natural efficiency of in every food-getting, shelter-getting exertion, in farming, mining, manufacturing, transportation, and communication.|$|R
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of {{the stage}} road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, {{partly due to the}} massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction. No attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} army {{received}} sufficient recruits, Diocletian {{appears to have}} instituted systematic annual conscription of Roman citizens {{for the first time}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the Roman Republic. In addition, he was probably responsible for the decree, first recorded in 313, compelling the sons of serving soldiers and veterans to enlist.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{became a}} Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, with his {{appointment}} as Chaplain in 1946, and in 1950 {{advanced to the}} position of Dean. His rising academic reputation was confirmed in 1953 with the publication of a project which had occupied him <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of his curacy—his new translation of Origen's Contra Celsum, with introduction and notes. He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley Sparks) of the Journal of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, {{and with}} renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening}} of the General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|While {{considering}} {{the character of}} Chang, absent since The Blue Lotus, Hergé thought of his artistic Chinese friend Zhang Chongren, whom {{he had not seen}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of their friendship over twenty years earlier. Hergé and Zhang used to spend every Sunday together, during which Hergé learned much about Chinese culture for his work on The Blue Lotus. Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost contact with his friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{resistance}} revived {{under the}} rule of the Cometopuli dynasty, but the new emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal. Basil's first expedition against Bulgaria, however, resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan. For the next few years, the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia, while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans. The war dragged on for nearly twenty years. The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army, and in annual campaigns, Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds. At the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated: their army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the hundredth man left with one eye so he could lead his compatriots home. When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once formidable army, he died of shock. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered, and the country became part of the Empire. This victory restored the Danube frontier, which had not been held <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the emperor Heraclius.|$|E

5|$|During this timeframe, they {{produced}} 100-peso banknotes featuring the lamb, Puerto Rico's official emblem. The bank was inaugurated on February 1, 1890, with Juan Róspide y Navarro and José Manuel López Sainz as governor and vice governor respectively. The Royal Decree permitted the issuing of paper money in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 pesos. These banknotes were manufactured by the American Bank Note Company. The original bank {{was located in}} San Juan, with a second one being established in Mayagüez in 1894. Until 1898, the institution issued four series A, B, C and D, though apparently C was put into production after D and didn't circulate under Spanish control. Series D began distribution on December 1, 1894; this became {{the first time that}} the lamb, which had continued being used <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the Sociedad Anónima de Crédito Mercantil de Puerto Rico, was replaced by the profile of Maria Christina of Austria. The Ministerio de Ultramar issued 1 peso notes in 1895.|$|E
25|$|The name 'Red Hill' was gazetted as {{a suburb}} name in 1928. This {{was the name}} {{associated}} with the hill <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the early settlers and probably suggested by the red soil in the area. Streets are named after ships and explorers. Mugga Way is named after an Aboriginal word also associated with the locality <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the early settlers.|$|E
