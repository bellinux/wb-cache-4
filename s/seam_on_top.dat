40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare stature, weight and backset (the horizontal distance (x) between the back of the occupant's head and the front of the <b>seam</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the head restraint) of the Biofidelic Rear Impact Dummy (BioRID II) to the same variables on seated volunteers in a car. The following methods were used. Data were collected from 154 randomly selected Swedish individuals (78 males and 76 females). The volunteers and the BioRID II were examined in a Volvo V 70 car, year model 2003, in three positions: driver (hands on steering wheel), front passenger (hands in lap) and rear passenger. The study results were as follows: the BioRID II was found to correspond approximately to a 35 th- 45 th percentile male in stature (- 2 cm), a 35 th percentile male in weight (- 7 kg), a 96 th percentile female in stature (+ 11 cm) and a 69 th percentile female in weight (+ 8 kg). The BioRID II was designed to represent a male driver. The BioRID II backset corresponded well with the average of the male drivers of its stature. Larger deviations in backset were found for other volunteer sizes and other seating positions. The average backsets were 26 mm for females and 63 mm for males in the front seat positions. The volunteers had larger backset in the driver position (60 mm) than in the front passenger position (29 mm). Smaller differences in backset were seen between the BioRID II and the volunteers in the rear passenger position. This study provides data regarding the occupant size coverage of BioRID II, and unique data regarding backset, of different occupant positions in the car; driver with hands on steering wheel, and front and rear passengers with hands in lap, for female and male in relation to the BioRID II dummy...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first use}} of this {{technique}} {{goes back to the}} 1920s, when leather, canvas and vinyl were sometimes used along with landau bars, to give a fairly accurate reproduction of a horse-drawn carriage's movable top. An early example of this was the 1928 - 1929 Ford Model [...] "A" [...] Special Coupe, that featured a roof completely covered with a vinyl-like material. This Model [...] "A" [...] Special Coupe's vinyl roof had two exposed <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> the back corners, with a lateral <b>seam</b> <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> covered with a narrow trim strip; landau bars were not provided on this model. The technique fell out of favor in the 1930s and 1940s, when smoother, [...] "envelope" [...] bodies began to be fashionable; for these designs, the look of the modern, integrated metal roof was important.|$|R
50|$|Historical {{evidence}} of shallow coal drift-mining of the Ringinglow <b>seam</b> which lies <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the Chatsworth Grit {{has been found}} in the Barber Fields area. The workings extended beneath the watercourse. Stratigraphically this was the lowest coal seams ever worked in the Sheffield area. The mine was served by a short railway which, along with the mine is no more. All that remains is a spoil-heap on the North bank of the brook. The mine {{is one of the few}} known examples of a shallow drift to have been worked by a small number of men in the Sheffield area.|$|R

30|$|The lignites of the Barmer basin are chiefly {{composed}} of the huminite group of macerals while the liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in low concentrations. There is not much variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII. Huminite (85.9  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis) is comprised mainly of telohuminite and detrohuminite. Telohuminite is mainly contributed by ulminite-A (24.4  %) and ulminite-B (20.9  %). Detrohuminite consists of densinite (32.2  %) and attrinite (7.6  %). Gelohuminite is present in very small amounts. Among the liptinites (8.8  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis), resinite (5 – 40  µm) (5  %) sporinite (1.1  %), cutinite (0.5  %) are common. Few sections show megaspores and megacuticles. Few patches of suberinite are seen, showing clearly developed cortex cells. Among the inertinites (5.3  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis), fusinite (2.2  %) with bogen structure was observed especially in Seam-IV and VIII. Seam-I and Seam-VI from the Giral mine have shown good fungal bodies. Mineral matter (11.6  vol%, mean of all the seams) occurs in moderate concentration in all the seams of the Giral mine.|$|R
