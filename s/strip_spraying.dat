40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{take-off}} performance of {{a model of the}} hull of a typical flying boat, Navy PH- 1, of fitting <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> of four different widths, each at three different angles, was determined by model tests in the NACA Tank. <b>Spray</b> <b>strips</b> of widths up to 3 percent of the beam improve the general performance at speeds near the hump and reduce the spray thrown. A downward angle of 30 degrees to 45 degrees in the neighborhood of the step seems most favorable for the reduction of the <b>spray.</b> The <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> have a large effect in reducing the trimming moments at speeds near the hump speed, but have little {{effect on the}}m at high speeds...|$|R
40|$|This note {{presents}} the results of a series of tests made in the N. A. C. A. tank on a one-sixth full-size model of the hull and side floats of the Navy P 3 M- 1 flying boat for the purpose of finding a method of reducing the amount of spray thrown into the propellers of this craft when taking off and landing. The model was tested without <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> and with five different spray-strip arrangements. The best arrangement was an improvement over the bare hull with no <b>spray</b> <b>strips,</b> but the improvement was not sufficient to be satisfactory with the propellers in the designed position...|$|R
50|$|As the {{experiment}} progressed, participants assigned to guard positions escalated their aggression. Although guards were instructed not {{to hit the}} prisoners, they found ways to humiliate/disrupt them via systematic searches, <b>strip</b> searches, <b>spraying</b> for lice, sexual harassment, denying them of basic rights (i.e., bathroom use) and waking inmates from their sleep for head counts. Social and moral values initially held by the guards were quickly abandoned as they became immersed in their role.|$|R
40|$|Four {{models with}} {{longitudinal}} {{steps on the}} forebody were developed by modification of {{a model of a}} conventional hull and were tested in the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) tank. Models with longitudinal steps were found to have smaller resistance at high speed and greater resistance at low speed than the parent model that had the same afterbody but a conventional V-section forebody. The models with a single longitudinal step had better performance at hump speed and as low high-speed resistance except at very light loads. <b>Spray</b> <b>strips</b> at angles from 0 degrees to 45 degrees to the horizontal were fitted at the longitudinal steps and at the chine on one of the two step models having two longitudinal steps. The resistance and the height of the spray were less with each of the <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> than without; the most favorable angle was found to lie between 15 degrees and 30 degrees...|$|R
40|$|Aerobic plate counts (APCs), presence/ {{absence of}} Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp., and visual color {{evaluations}} {{were used to}} determine the microbiological and display quality of steaks fabricated from beef <b>strip</b> loins <b>sprayed</b> with lactic acid (1. 5 % v/v) or water before, after, o r both before and after vacuum storage (14, 28, 56, 84, or 126 days) at either 30 E or 36 EF compared to nonsprayed or nonstored controls. Lactic acid applied pre- and poststorage (126 days) at 30 EF reduced APCs of steak s up to 2 log (99 %). L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were absent from all steaks. Lactic acid caused slightly more rapid color deterioration, resulting in slightly shorter display-life for steaks...|$|R

One of them, Stefan Bauer answered a question from a German-speaking guard {{and said he was}} from the European Union and he had the right to go where he wanted. He was hauled out, beaten, sprayed with pepper <b>spray,</b> <b>stripped</b> naked and put under a cold shower. His clothes were taken away and he was returned to the freezing cell wearing only a flimsy hospital gown.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{aerodynamic}} drag {{were made in}} the 20 -foot wind tunnel on a representative group of 11 flying-boat hull models. Four of the models were modified to investigate the effect of variations in over-all height, contours of deck, depth of step, angle of afterbody keel, and the addition of <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> and windshields. The results of these tests, which cover a pitch-angle range from - 5 to 10 degrees, are presented in a form suitable for use in performance calculations and for design purposes...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time the type's predecessor, the Kawanishi H6K, was going into service in 1938 the Navy ordered the {{development}} of a larger, longer-ranged patrol aircraft under the designation Navy Experimental 13-Shi Large-size Flying Boat. The result was a large, shoulder-winged design that is widely regarded as the best flying boat of the war. Despite this, initial development was troublesome, with the prototype displaying terrible handling on the water. Deepening of the hull, redesigning of the planing bottom and the addition of <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> under the nose rectified this Two further prototypes— actually pre-production aircraft— joined the development program in December 1941.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} from {{experience}} that when spraying concrete it spreads on the wall, being the distribution of concrete around the axis depending -at the remaining factors constant- on nozzle designo The shape of these "spreadings" have been analysed by different authors [1][2], who shown that a relation between the cross section of single layer <b>strips</b> of <b>sprayed</b> concrete and the spraying process parameters exist. However, no analytical mode 1 s of this relationship {{have been found in}} the literature [1]. The way concrete spreads on the wall can be modelled using a statistical approach by introducing a spraying density function. This [continuous] density function represents the probability of a differential volume of sprayed concrete landing on a differential area around certain coordinates. In this paper a semi-empirical model of the spraying process, based on a parametric family of such density functions is presented. This model allows the estimation of sprayed concrete thickness from operational data (concrete and compressed air flow, distance to wall, nozzle trajectory and actual thickness of sprayed concrete, etc.) The calibration of the main parameters of the model using experimental data is also presented.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} boat {{may encounter}} severe wave-making at {{the bow and}} become wetter at high speed. Some measures {{can be taken to}} overcome these disadvantages. In order to compare the effect of bow <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> and Ω-type freeboards on a high-speed boat, hull wetness, resistance, hull motion, stability and the restoring moment of the heel at high speed of models with these two kinds of auxiliaries were calculated and measured. CFD methods and model tests were adopted. Both of these two auxiliaries can reduce hull wetness, and the model with a Ω-type freeboard has a better initial stability and larger restoring moment of the heel at high speed. A free running model test also indicates that the Ω-type freeboard has a fine performance...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A {{robotised}} mobile {{fluorescence imaging}} system {{was used to}} visualise {{the early stages of}} the Cercospora fungal infection in attached sugar beet leaves. To further explore the possibilities of fast disease resistance screening, excised leaf pieces were continuously monitored after infection. Materials and Methods: For infection of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) with Cercospora beticola, the upper sides of a leaf from the 4 th leaf pair or excised leaf <b>strips</b> were <b>sprayed</b> with a spore solution. A chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system, a thermal camera and a video camera, mounted side-by-side on a gantry (Cartesian XYZ) robot (measuring area 2 m x 1 m) were positioned sequentially above the same attached leaf region or excised leaf piece to capture the respective co-localized chlorophyll fluorescence emission, thermal and video images. Results and conclusions: At Cercospora infection loci, pre-symptomatic high-intensity spots became first apparent 6 days post infection (dpi) in the chlorophyll fluorescence images. Apart from photosynthetic efficiency also transpiration was affected, as witnessed by the appearance of co-localised, low temperature spots in the thermal image, a few hours after the increase in chlorophyll fluorescence intensity. This is in striking contrast with the decrease in transpiration observed after TMV infection of resistant tobacco (Chaerle et al., 1999). At 6. 5 dpi, a central dark spot formed at the center of the white spots in the chlorophyll fluorescence images - a co-localised visible lesion appeared at 7 dpi. At the 7 dpi timepoint, chlorophyll fluorescence symptoms were maximal. An increase in chlorophyll fluorescence emission, was also observed early during the resistance response of tobacco to TMV, but in this case was rapidly followed by a pronounced intensity decrease. Recognition of differences in the (the kinetics of the) pre-visual response(s) could lead to a rapid differentiation of emerging (biotic) stresses by imaging...|$|R
40|$|Strips of {{magnesium}} (A-Z 91 and AM 50) and aluminum (AA 6111) alloys were cast on a moving mold system devised for simulating single belt casting operations. Different type of substrates {{were used for}} the moving mold; copper, low carbon steel, alumina coated steel, nickel coated steel, and zirconia coated steel. Interfacial heat fluxes between the solidifying strip and the moving mold substrate were calculated by the IHCP (Inverse Heat Conduction Problem) technique. The temperature history of the solidifying strip was calculated using the Enthalpy FVM (Finite Volume Method) associated with Scheil's model of solidification. The influence of thermophysical and morphological properties of mold substrates, wetting environment, casting speed, melt superheat, and grain refiner, on strip microstructures and their cooling rates, were thoroughly investigated. Maximum heat fluxes appeared about 0. 1 ~ 0. 2 seconds after the moment of thermal contact. For a copper substrate, these reached up to 7 MW/m 2, whereas those for a steel substrate were ~ 3 MW/m 2. The rate of heat transfer to coated substrates was significantly delayed and reduced because of the low thermal conductivity of coating layers. Maximum cooling rates of aluminum and magnesium strips reached about 200 °C/s on copper and about 150 °C/s on steel. It was found that the major thermal resistance resided in an interfacial layer separating the strip from the substrate. This interfacial layer presumably corresponded to the shrinkage of solidified skin or the entrainment of a thin air film resulting in numerous air pockets at the bottom surface of <b>strips.</b> Oil <b>spraying</b> onto the mold surface changed the interfacial wettability and dramatically improved the cast surface of the strips. The good quality of strip samples obtained suggests the high potential for the direct casting of these alloys on single belt casters...|$|R
40|$|Three {{models of}} V-bottom floats for twin-float {{seaplanes}} (N. A. C. A. models 57 -A, 57 -B, and 57 -C) having angles of dead rise of 20 degrees, 25 degrees, and thirty degrees, respectively, {{were tested in}} the N. A. C. A. tank and in the N. A. C. A. 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel. Within the range investigated, the effect of angle of dead rise on water resistance {{was found to be}} negligible at speeds up to and including the hump speed, and water resistance was found to increase with angle of dead rise at planing speeds. The height of the spray at the hump speed decreased with increase in angle of dead rise and the aerodynamic drag increased with dead rise. Lengthening the forebody of model 57 -B decreased the water resistance and the spray at speeds below the hump speed. <b>Spray</b> <b>strips</b> provided an effective means for the control of spray with the straight V sections used in the series but considerably increased the aerodynamic drag.

40|$|The {{dropping}} of a water-ﬁlled latex balloon onto a ﬂat, rigid {{surface is}} an experiment {{that is known}} and has been performed by many, but on {{which there is no}} existing published work. High-speed images taken of the process revealed a range of phenomena, many of which had not been previously observed. After release, a water-ﬁlled balloon accelerates down and impacts with the tank ﬂoor. Upon impact, the balloon deforms through the propagation of waves up the balloon from the impact point. If the balloon does not rupture during this deformation, it then bounces up oﬀ the surface, the whole process similar to that when a water droplet bounces on a hydrophobic surface. Often, however, the balloon ruptures. This occurs through the propagation of one or more cracks through the balloon, leading to the rapid retraction of the membrane over the water’s surface, and consequent ejection of a ﬁne spray of water droplets behind it. If there are any waves on the balloon at the moment of rupture, a larger-scale growth of the interfacial amplitude occurs, of the same wavelength as the preburst waves. Eventually, gravity dominates, as the water slumps down and spreads over the ﬂat surface. In this thesis, the process described above is examined in detail, both experimentally and theoretically. To gain some insight into the behaviour of the latex balloons, their static and quasi-static behaviour is examined. A experimental method better than simply dropping the balloons was derived, permitting the accurate quantitative measurement of the process. In this new method, the balloons were held stationary, forced at a set frequency, then ruptured with a pin. The pre-burst waves are then shown to be accurately modelled by linear theory, with tension in the membrane acting much like a ﬂuid surface tension. The behaviour of the rubber in retraction from large initial stretches is shown to be disperse, in contrast with that observed for retractions from small initial stretches, due to both non-linearity in the rubber and drag from the water on the <b>strip.</b> The <b>spray</b> ejected behind the rubber is explained as consequence of the inherent instability of the Gaussian velocity ﬁeld in the wake. Finally, the late-time growth of the interfacial amplitude is examined, and argued to be closely-related to the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. A model is then derived for the case of a balloon oscillated and burst with water both inside and outside, and is shown to be in approximate agreement with experiments.
