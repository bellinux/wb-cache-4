5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and <b>suggested</b> <b>emotion</b> through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E

Also, whereas a statement or a diagram takes us to many things of the same kind, an expressive object is individualized, for example in expressing a particular depression.|$|R

She could also be <b>suggesting</b> <b>emotion</b> felt through music through the use of line and the intense blue color, perhaps influenced by Wassily Kandinsky.

Thus, a social life-style may play a role in basic emotions developing into complex emotions.|$|R
50|$|The broaden-and-build {{theory of}} {{positive}} <b>emotions</b> <b>suggests</b> that positive <b>emotions</b> (viz. enjoyment/happiness/joy, and perhaps interest/anticipation) broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that negative affect {{is an important}} mediator {{in the relationship between}} body dissatisfaction and bulimic symptoms. This study examines the mediation-al role of specific emotion regulation processes (i. e., negative emotionality, poor aware-ness of emotion, nonconstructive coping with negative emotion) in bulimic symptoms. In addition to these emotion regulation variables, body dissatisfaction and bulimic symp-toms were assessed in 234 girls in Grades 6 to 8 (mean age = 12 years, 11 months). The results indicated that negative affect, poor awareness of emotion, and nonconstructive coping with negative emotion partially mediated the relationship between body dissatis-faction and bulimic behaviors. The findings are discussed in light of previous research that <b>suggests</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation needs to be viewed as a multidimensional construct...|$|R

This paper describes a two level competitive/collaborative multiagent approach for autonomous, non-deterministic, computer music composition. Our aim {{is to build a}} high modular system that composes music on its own by using Experts Systems technology and rule-based systems principles. To do that, rules issued from musical knowledge are used and emotional inputs from the users are introduced. In fact, users are not allowed to directly control the composition process. Two main goals are sought after: investigating relationships between computers and emotions and how the latter can be represented into the former, and developing a framework for music composition that can be useful for future experiments. The system has been successfully tested by asking several people to match compositions with <b>suggested</b> <b>emotions...</b>|$|R

50|$|It {{has also}} been <b>suggested</b> that <b>emotions</b> (affect heuristics, {{feelings}} and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} {{in the study of}} social and psychological affective preferences (i.e., what people like or dislike). Specific research has been done on preferences, attitudes, impression formation, and decision making. This research contrasts findings with recognition memory (old-new judgments), allowing researchers to demonstrate reliable distinctions between the two. Affect-based judgments and cognitive processes have been examined with noted differences indicated, and some argue affect and cognition are under the control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other {{in a variety of ways}} (Zajonc, 1980). Both affect and cognition may constitute independent sources of effects within systems of information processing. Others <b>suggest</b> <b>emotion</b> is a result of an anticipated, experienced, or imagined outcome of an adaptational transaction between organism and environment, therefore cognitive appraisal processes are keys to the development and expression of an emotion (Lazarus, 1982).|$|R
40|$|Anhedonia, a {{pleasure}} deficit, {{is an important}} symptom of schizophrenia that remains poorly understood. Recently researchers have <b>suggested</b> that <b>emotion</b> dysregulation, particularly emotional ambivalence in positive situations, may be one mechanism for understanding anhdonia in schizophrenia. Using ecological momentary assessment, we examined emotion dysfunction in {{the daily lives of}} patients and controls. Participants with schizophrenia (n = 29) and controls (n = 21) were provided a cellular telephone and called four times a day for one week. During each call participants rated their emotions, described their current activities, and rated enjoyment from those activities. Supporting an emotion dysregulation hypothesis, patients experienced higher negative emotions compared to controls {{over the course of the}} week, but equivalent levels of positive emotion and activity enjoyment. Importantly, there was a weaker relationship between emotional state and activity enjoyment in patients. These findings <b>suggest</b> that <b>emotion</b> dysregulation as an in important affective dysfunction in schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> that <b>emotion</b> {{regulation}} improves with aging. Here, we investigated age differences in emotion regulation by studying modulation {{of the late}} positive potential (LPP) by emotion regulation instructions. The electroencephalogram of younger (18 - 26 years) and older (60 - 77 years) adults was recorded while they viewed neutral, unpleasant, and pleasant pictures and while they were instructed to increase or decrease the feelings that the emotional pictures elicited. The LPP was enhanced when participants were instructed to increase their emotions. No age differences were observed in this <b>emotion</b> regulation effect, <b>suggesting</b> that <b>emotion</b> regulation abilities are unaffected by aging. This contradicts studies that measured emotion regulation by self-report, yet accords with studies that measured emotion regulation by means of facial expressions or psychophysiological responses. More {{research is needed to}} resolve the apparent discrepancy between subjective self-report and objective psychophysiological measures...|$|R

40|$|Measurement effects exist {{throughout}} the sciencesâ€“the act of measuring often changes {{the properties of}} the observed. We <b>suggest</b> <b>emotion</b> research is no exception. The awareness and conscious assessment required by self-report of emotion may significantly alter emotional processes. In this study, participants engaged in a difficult math task designed to induce anger or shame while their cardiovascular responses were measured. Half of {{the participants were asked to}} report on their emotional states and appraise their feelings {{throughout the}} experiment, whereas the other half completed a control questionnaire. Among those in the anger condition, participants assigned to report on their emotions exhibited qualitatively different physiological responses from those who did not report. For participants in the shame condition, there were no significant differences in physiology based on the self-report manipulation. The study demonstrates that the simple act of reporting on an emotional state may have a substantial impact on the bodyâ€™s reaction to an emotional situation...|$|R
40|$|Although emotion {{regulation}} capacities {{have been}} linked to adjustment among people with chronic pain, researchers have yet to determine whether these capacities are related to functioning independent of established facets of pain coping. The present study was designed to address this gap. A sample 128 Australian adults with chronic pain (44 men, 84 women) completed self-report measures of adjustment (quality of life, negative affect, and pain-related disability), pain coping, and features of emotion regulation (emotion appraisal, perceived efficacy in emotion regulation, emotion utilization). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that efficacy in emotion regulation was related to quality of life and reduced negative affect even after statistically controlling for effects of other measures of adjustment, pain coping efficacy, and pain coping. Conversely, features of emotion regulation did not improve the prediction model for pain-related disability. Findings <b>suggest</b> <b>emotion</b> regulation capacities may have a unique role in the prediction of specific facets of adjustment among people with chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model of emotionally {{influenced}} perception in an affective agent. Via a multidimensional representation of emotion, a mechanism called the affective space is used to emotionally filter sensed stimuli in the agent's environment. This filtering process allows different emotional states in the agent to create dissimilar emotional reactions when the agent is exposed to the same stimuli. In humans, emotion cannot be a mechanism that enhances intelligence and then isolated from other psychological and physiological functions. As this paper <b>suggests,</b> <b>emotion</b> {{is an integral part}} of the human as a biological being and therefore they cannot be turned on and off on a whim. However, this luxury is afforded to the artificial agent. This approach builds on contemporary affective agent architectural concepts as it not only gives an agent the ability to use emotion to produce human-like intelligence, but it also investigates how emotion should affect the agent's other abilities, such as perceptio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physiological, self-reported, and facial correlates of emotion regulation in psychopathy. Specifically, we compared psychopathic offenders (n = 42), nonpsychopathic offenders (n = 42), and nonoffender controls (n = 26) {{in their ability to}} inhibit and express emotion while watching affective films (fear, happy, and sad). Results showed that all participants were capable of drastically diminishing facial emotions under inhibition instructions. Contrary to expectation, psychopaths were not superior in adopting such a "poker face. " Further, the inhibition of emotion was associated with cardiovascular changes, an effect that was also not dependent on psychopathy (or its factors), <b>suggesting</b> <b>emotion</b> inhibition to be an effortful process in psychopaths as well. Interestingly, psychopathic offenders did not differ from nonpsychopaths in the capacity to show content-appropriate facial emotions during the expression condition. Taken together, these data challenge the view that psychopathy is associated with either superior emotional inhibitory capacities or a generalized impairment in showing facial affect...|$|R

40|$|Mindfulness - an attentive, non-judgmental {{focus on}} present {{experiences}} - is increasingly incorporated in psychotherapeutic treatments as a skill fostering emotion regulation. Neurobiological mechanisms of actively induced emotion regulation {{are associated with}} prefrontally mediated down-regulation of, for instance, the amygdala. We were interested in neurobiological correlates of a short mindfulness instruction during emotional arousal. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated effects of a short mindfulness intervention during the cued expectation and perception of negative and potentially negative pictures (50 % probability) in 24 healthy individuals compared to 22 controls. The mindfulness intervention was associated with increased activations in prefrontal regions during the expectation of negative and potentially negative pictures compared to controls. During the perception of negative stimuli, reduced activation was identified in regions involved in emotion processing (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus). Prefrontal and right insular activations when expecting negative pictures correlated negatively with trait mindfulness, suggesting that more mindful individuals required less regulatory resources to attenuate emotional arousal. Our findings <b>suggest</b> <b>emotion</b> regulatory effects of a short mindfulness intervention on a neurobiological level...|$|R

In this paper, I attempt to provide a single, unified framework of humor, grounded in recent developments on emotion and dual-process cognition. I propose that humor comprehension consists of a four-step dynamic process: surprise, reflection, dismissal and compensation. The proposed theory provides a modern update on existing theories of humor, and is capable of explaining several phenomena that cannot be easily explained by existing theories. I also discuss the implication of the theory on creating computational systems that can create or perceive humor...|$|R
