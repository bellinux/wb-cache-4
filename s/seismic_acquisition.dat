2500|$|The treaty entered {{force on}} 7 July 2011, ending the 44-year-old border dispute. The treaty {{stipulates}} conditions for fishing cooperation, {{providing for the}} retention of the mechanism to jointly regulate fishing in the Barents Sea. The treaty also defines the principles of cooperation in hydrocarbons deposits exploration. A deposit which is crossed by the maritime border may only be exploited as a whole subject to a bilateral agreement. The border treaty is economically significant, as it makes possible to conduct geological surveys and hydrocarbons drilling in the formerly disputed area, which is estimated to contain up to 6.8billion tons of oil and gas. The area is located west of Shtokman, one of the world's largest natural gas fields. According to Anatoly Zolotukhin, vice president of World Petroleum Council, it is [...] "a very prolific area—maybe even more prolific than Shtokman."

Extensive seismic modelling studies are conducted in order to quantify the accumulated error for three different overburden complexities. Channels in the overburden above the Nelson Field, North Sea, are found to cause errors in the time-lapse amplitudes.

40|$|Abstract — Seismology is the {{scientific}} study of earthquakes & the propagation of seismic waves through the earth. The large improvement has been seen in seismology from around hundreds of years. The seismic data {{plays an important role in}} the <b>seismic</b> data <b>acquisition.</b> The recorded <b>seismic</b> data is used by seismologists for analysis purpose. This analysis includes mapping of Earth’s interior, locating an earthquake properly, and measuring magnitude of an earthquake. The more efficient systems are used now a day to locate the earthquakes as large improvements has been done in this field. In older days analog systems are used for data acquisition. The analog systems record seismic signals in a permanent way. These systems are large in size, costly and are incompatible with computer. Due to these drawbacks these analog systems are replaced by digital systems so that data can be recorded digitally. In this paper, a recent development in <b>seismic</b> data <b>acquisition</b> has been focused. A cost-effective, small size <b>seismic</b> data <b>acquisition</b> system is implemented successfully based on ARM. The system consists of an Accelerometer sensor for sensing seismic signal along 3 -axis corresponding to accelerations and can save the respective data in the memory which can be used for further analysis. The software routines written in MATLAB give graphical representation of seismic data along X, Y, and Z axis. An ARM processor compares the input signal with reference signal which is already set into the ARM processor. If the value of input signal exceeds reference signal then an alarm about possibility of an earthquake rang in PC...|$|R

50|$|Seismic {{reflection}} {{data are}} initially only {{available in the}} time domain. In order that the geology encountered in a borehole can be tied to the seismic data, a 1D synthetic seismogram is generated. This is important in identifying the origin of seismic reflections seen on the seismic data. Density and velocity data are routinely measured down the borehole using wireline logging tools. These logs provide data with a sampling interval {{much smaller than the}} vertical resolution of the seismic data. The logs are therefore often averaged over intervals to produce what is known as a 'blocked-log'. This information is then used to calculate the variation in acoustic impedance down the well bore using the Zoeppritz equations. This acoustic impedance log is combined with the velocity data to generate a reflection coefficient series in time. This series is convolved with a seismic wavelet to produce the synthetic seismogram. The input seismic wavelet is chosen to match as closely as possible to that produced during the original <b>seismic</b> <b>acquisition,</b> paying particular attention to phase and frequency content.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNear-surface seismic {{methods are}} mainly used to {{determine}} the geometrical characteristics of hydrosystems (and to provide elements that are interesting for hydrogeologists such as separating aquifer layers, setting up systems boundaries, highlighting fractures etc.). Recent methodological advances suggest the high potential of seismic methods to investigate the mechanical properties of the Critical Zone (CZ), by exploiting the full wealth of seismic records. Indeed, the behavior of Shear (S) and Pressure (P) waves in the presence of water is partially decoupled, so that the ratio of their propagation velocities VP/VS is strongly linked to water saturation. We propose here a time-lapse application of this approach. Two <b>seismic</b> <b>acquisitions</b> were carried out under distinct hydrogeological conditions along the same line at the Ploemeur hydrogeological observatory (South Brittany, France). Vertical component seismic data were recorded to extract: (i) P-wave first arrival times and (ii) Rayleigh-wave phase velocities. The significant variations with time and space, of both datasets, indicate marked changes in mechanical properties of the CZ that have to be compared to soil moisture variations in the unsaturated zone and groundwater level variations...|$|R
