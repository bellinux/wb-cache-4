5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured <b>subtle</b> <b>differences,</b> such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Gorgosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} weighing {{more than}} two metric tons as an adult; dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. Gorgosaurus was most closely related to Albertosaurus, and more distantly related to the larger Tyrannosaurus. Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in the teeth and skull bones. Some experts consider G. libratus to be a species of Albertosaurus; this would make Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of that genus.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the}} 'open' back models Vs. 'closed' back models was {{the method of}} body {{attachment}} to the chassis.|$|R

5|$|Psilocybe pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight <b>subtle</b> <b>differences.</b> For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically {{indistinguishable from}} several other morel {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M.sextelata. Although there are <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> {{in the structure of}} the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences were consistent.|$|E
50|$|The Eritrean cuisines shares {{similarities}} {{with the}} northern half of Ethiopian but with a <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> in the foods, given {{the history of the}} two countries.|$|R
50|$|This raga {{is closer}} to Bhagyasree as for Bhagyasree Gandharam is sung softly. Thus a <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> of Gandhara makes a {{listener}} to feel this raga as Bhagyasree.|$|R
5000|$|...vo: {{it has a}} <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> with hína {{in which}} vo {{indicates}} not necessarily what's being done {{at the moment of}} speaking. amba'apóvo, [...] "I'm working (not necessarily now)".|$|R
5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E
5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates the <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have either}} {{presently}} or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With {{the diversity of}} adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, {{three of the five}} species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.|$|E
50|$|A rather <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> is {{the moment}} a stack trace is created when an {{exception}} is being thrown. In Java, the stack trace is created in the moment the exception is created.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{question}} {{usually do}} not qualify as standard Turkish questions (see the example above) because question suffixes are usually dropped by native Turkish Cypriots. Another <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> is the emphasis on verbs.|$|R
60|$|Agatha's curiosity was excited, {{because she}} thought she had noted a <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> in Thirlwell's manner. There was a hint of reserve, and {{sometimes}} he looked disturbed. Then Drummond interrupted his companion.|$|R
25|$|A slide can be {{made with}} any type of smooth hard {{material}} that allows tones to resonate. Different materials cause <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in sustain, timbre, and loudness, and glass or metal are the most common choices.|$|E
25|$|Creatine {{is sold in}} {{a variety}} of forms, {{including}} creatine monohydrate and creatine ethyl ester, amongst others. Though all types of creatine are sold for the same purposes, there are <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> between them, such as price and necessary dosage.|$|E
25|$|Many commentaries {{have been}} written about the <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> between the translations. There is an {{emphasis}} on the oneness of God and on the sole worship of God by Israel. There are other translations, though most retain one or the other emphases.|$|E

50|$|York Catholic {{has been}} a major force in {{education}} since the 1920s. Employers seek out YC students and graduates because they notice something different—something special. This <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> is often mentioned and duly recognized. It is a source of pride for all those who support York Catholic.|$|R
25|$|Akzidenz-Grotesk is {{sometimes}} {{at first glance}} mistaken for the Helvetica or Univers typefaces. The similarities of Helvetica and Akzidenz-Grotesk are apparent, but the <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> include the uppercase and lowercase C and the uppercase G, J, R and Q. Aside from the <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in these individual letters, Miedinger's primary change to Akzidenz-Grotesk is Helvetica's higher x-height, {{the distance from the}} baseline to the height of the lowercase letter x, and the consistently horizontal terminals. The general effect is that Helvetica appears more oblong while Akzidenz-Grotesk maintains circular counters and bowls. Both Helvetica and Univers are more regular and have a greater consistency of stroke weight and details, for instance unifying all or most strokes to terminate on horizontals or verticals.|$|E
25|$|In the DC Comics Multiverse, {{there are}} several {{versions}} of Superman originating from different parallel Earths. Most of these counterparts have <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in their origins. Alterations to Superman's origin are also frequently used as the premises for Elseworlds and imaginary stories published by DC Comics.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> {{that have}} been {{reported}} include slightly longer limbs and larger hands and feet due to a proportionally greater stature than unaffected women, larger teeth, minimal or no acne, well developed breasts, and a greater incidence of meibomian gland dysfunction (i.e. dry eye syndromes and light sensitivity).|$|E
30|$|We {{note that}} the {{asymptotic}} behavior of the key capacity in the high SNR regime summarized in Corollary 1 {{is similar to the}} idea of secrecy degree of freedom introduced in [35].

25|$|Not all leagues {{chose to}} {{affiliate}} {{with the new}} body, which was seen {{by some to be}} increasingly swayed by the increasingly professional aspect of the sport. The Australian Amateur Football Council was formed in 1933. As a result, many amateur leagues interpret the laws of the game with <b>subtle</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wallpaper {{groups are}} {{two-dimensional}} symmetry groups, intermediate in complexity between the simpler frieze {{groups and the}} three-dimensional crystallographic groups, also called space groups. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. <b>Subtle</b> <b>differences</b> may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may {{belong to the same}} group.|$|E
25|$|Within the Hasidic world, it is {{possible}} to distinguish different Hasidic groups by <b>subtle</b> <b>differences</b> in dress. Some details of their dress are shared by non-Hasidic Haredim. Much of Hasidic dress was historically the clothing of all Eastern European Jews, influenced by the style of Polish–Lithuanian nobility. Furthermore, Hasidim have attributed religious origins to specific Hasidic items of clothing.|$|E
60|$|That {{quick change}} of Kells's marked a <b>subtle</b> <b>difference</b> {{in the spirit}} of the bandits and the occasion. Gaiety and good humor and badinage ended. There were no more broad grins or {{friendly}} leers or coarse laughs. Gulden and his groups clustered closer to the table, quiet, intense, watchful, suspicious.|$|R
40|$|Partitioned {{preemptive}} EDF scheduling is {{very similar}} to bin packing, but there is a <b>subtle</b> <b>difference.</b> Estimating the probability of schedulability under a given total utilization has been studied empirically before.

50|$|Multiple social {{procedures}} {{can serve}} {{to achieve the same}} end. Justice, as an example, in the U.S. achieved through the use of 2 adversarial lawyers, a neutral judge, and a jury of peers. In Canada, the judge is less neutral.
