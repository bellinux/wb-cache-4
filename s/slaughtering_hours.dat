Changes in the peritoneum and gallbladder wall, observed at slaughter, were minimal. During the 10 -day observation period, general behavior, attitude, and appetite of the 10 cows were normal. A transient, slight increase in rectal temperature was observed in 6 cows at 4, 5, or 8 days after cholecystocentesis. Total and differential WBC counts and total protein and fibrinogen concentrations, determined daily, were all within normal ranges. Bile samples from 20 cows were examined microscopically and biochemically. Fasciola hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum eggs were observed in bile from 7 and 12 cows, respectively. Fecal examination revealed F hepatica eggs in 4 cows; D dendriticum eggs were not identified in any of the fecal samples. In 1 cow, F hepatica eggs were observed in the feces, but not in the bile. Bile acids concentration in bile varied from 12. 5 to 68. 5 mmol/L (mean +/- SD, 45. 3 +/- 3. 05 mmol/L) and in serum from 3. 8 to 281. 0 mumol/L (41. 6 +/- 17. 24 mumol/L).

40|$|The {{quality and}} {{production}} of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) /white clover (Trifolium repens) pastures are seasonal in New Zealand. Earlier research showed that a sward mix of plantain (Plantago lanceolata), chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), white- and red-clover (Trifolium pratense) resulted in greater lamb live weight gains {{in the late summer}} early autumn period. However, this has not been tested across all the seasons in New Zealand. Therefore, research was undertaken for two consecutive years (2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013) on three sward mixes; Pasture mix, Plantain mix and Chicory mix in early spring, late spring and early summer (late spring), summer and autumn. The Pasture mix consisted of perennial ryegrass and white clover. The Plantain mix consisted of plantain, white- and red-clover. The Chicory mix consisted of plantain, chicory, white- and red-clover. It was hypothesised that lamb performance (live weight, live weight gain (LWG) and carcass weight) and apparent carcass weight production per ha would be greatest in the Plantain and Chicory mixes in all four periods. Secondly it was hypothesised that Plantain and Chicory mixes would have lower feed conversion ratios (FCR) with higher herbage utilization efficiencies (EHU%) than the Pasture mix. In each period weaned lambs were reared in the three herbage treatments for a maximum of two months. Lambs were weighed fortnightly and they were <b>slaughtered</b> within 12 <b>hours</b> of being off the pasture {{at the end of the}} experiment. Carcass weights were obtained from the abattoir. The Plantain and Chicory mixes had a higher feeding value than the Pasture mix during early spring to autumn. Both Plantain and Chicory mixes produced heavier (P< 0. 05) lambs, higher (P< 0. 05) live weight gains (LWG) and carcass weights compared to the Pasture mix in all periods. Total apparent carcass weight production per ha were 407, 748 and 709 kg/ha in year one and 474, 607 and 642 kg/ha in year two in the Pasture mix, Plantain mix and Chicory mix, respectively. Both Plantain and Chicory mixes had lower (P< 0. 05) feed conversion ratios (FCR) and higher (P< 0. 05) herbage utilization efficiencies (EHU%) compared to the Pasture mix.

Lambs were fed lot for 51 days, where they received daily a commercial concentrate ration (18 % CP and 74 % TDN), {{in the proportion of}} 1. 5 % of body weight, and had free access to chopped in natura sugar cane. The average age and weight at the initiation of the experiment were, respectively, 120 days and 31. 0 kg. At the end of the experimental period lambs were <b>slaughtered</b> after 16 <b>hours</b> of fasting of solids. There was no significant difference (P > 0. 05) for cold carcass weight and dressing percentage. Averages were 17. 30 kg and 41. 94 %, respectively. Regional composition (neck, shoulder, ribs and leg) and carcass morphological characteristics (length and compactness) did not differed (P > 0. 05) among the genetic groups. Tissue composition of the neck and meat quality (tenderness, juiciness and flavor), evaluated by a sensory panel, were similar (P > 0. 05) among the three genetic groups. It can be concluded that in the lamb production any of the genetic groups studied can be used, for their carcass and meat characteristics were quite similar.

40|$|Feed {{restriction}} {{and handling}} of animals {{destined to be}} slaughtered have are two factors that affect meat quality negatively. Where handling of slaughter animals is inevitable, fasting is applied to meat producing animals in the ante mortem period to minimise microbial contamination of carcasses or to lower the metabolic rate of certain cattle breeds as an adaptive mechanism to hot climates. From the present study, animals that are historically more docile had higher urinary catecholamine concentrations per se. By quantifying the relationship between catecholamines and animal temperament in cattle, selection of animals with a more favourable catecholamine profile, could enhance the ease of handling slaughter animals and reduce carcass bruising. The difference in urinary catecholamines of three commercial beef breeds types; Brahman, Nguni and Simmental; retained in lairages at an abattoir for either 24 or 3 hours ante mortem was measured. This was done in order to investigate whether longer feed withdrawal periods will lead to increased urinary catecholamine concentrations; a shift in post mortem energy metabolism and negative effects on meat quality. Catecholamine turnover rate from dopamine to norepinephrine and epinephrine, differed between breed types and feed withdrawal periods. Results indicated a relationship between energy metabolism, feed withdrawal period and catecholamine turnover. Twenty four hours feed withdrawal increased the rate of catecholamine turnover for Brahman and Nguni. Lower early post mortem glycogen together with higher glucose- 6 -phosphate indicated that glycogenolysis increased for this Brahman and Nguni just before <b>slaughter.</b> Twenty four <b>hours</b> feed withdrawal triggered glycogenolysis via increased catecholamine turnover from dopamine to norepinephrine and epinephrine for Brahman and Nguni. In contrast, feed restriction {{had no effect on}} catecholamine turnover. Slightly higher early post mortem glycogen and lower glucose- 6 -phosphate indicated lower energy metabolism for the Simmental breed type just before slaughter. It seemed as if feed restriction had an energy sparing effect on Simmental type cattle with a consequent negative effect on meat quality. Warner-Bratzler shear force results were the same among breed types when feed withdrawal was not longer than 3 hours and the values emphasise the importance of providing feed to animals kept in lairages or transported over long distances. When feed is available up until 3 <b>hours</b> before <b>slaughter,</b> irrespective of breed type, meat tenderness was not affected negatively. When feed was restricted, additional sarcomere shortening and creatine phosphate depletion while the carcass was still warm, occurred {{to such a degree that}} the meat from Simmental was tougher. It is clear that feed withdrawal of 24 hours has a significantly negative impact on Warner-Bratzler sheer force of Simmental. In this study with non-electrically stimulated carcasses it is clear that feed must be provided to Simmental up until 3 <b>hours</b> before <b>slaughter</b> to prevent excessive sarcomere shortening and meat toughness. This was explained by a probable lowered metabolic rate and changes in mitochondrial ATP turnover for the Simmental breed type. Cattle from differend breed types react differently to feed withdrawal periods and this knowledge should be applied in the meat industry to assure more consistent meat quality.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to determine the effect of distance travelled (DT), lairage duration (LDhr) and animal-related factors (animal class, breed, sex) on pre-slaughter stress indicators, carcass characteristics, nanostructure and technological properties of beef. The study was conducted in an Eastern Cape abattoir under the Buffalo City District Municipality. Six genotypes of cattle (Beefmaster, Bonsmara, Brahman, Holstein-Friesian, Non-descript and Nguni) brought for slaughter at the abattoir on different days were used in the study. Slaughter weight (SWT), warm and cold carcass weight (WCW and CCW), fatness and conformation of each animal were measured and recorded. Representative samples of blood plasma and meat quality from the Muscularis thoracis et lumborum (LTL) were collected at <b>slaughter</b> and 24 <b>hours</b> after <b>slaughter,</b> respectively. Heat shock proteins 70 kDa (HSPA 1 A), glucose (GLU), cortisol (CORT), creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined from the blood plasma. The representative LTL muscle was used to determine ultimate pH (pHu), lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), meat temperature (Tm), Warner Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) and histological structure of beef. There were significant effects of distance on pHu, Tm, a*, b*, TL%, CK and LDH. Pearson correlations were observed between distance travelled (DT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ultimate pH (pHu), colour coordinates (L*, a* and b*) and Warner Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the 1 st (pHu), 2 nd (Tm) and 3 rd (L*) principal components were the critical meat quality attributes. Positive relationships between carcass weights and beef quality characteristics for bovine cattle where the cumulative percentage of the first six principal component`s (PC`s) (SWT, WCW, CCW, DP, pHu and Tm contributed to 93. 4 % of the total variance. Significant correlation coefficients between DT (r = 0. 15), LDhr (r = 0. 29), Ta (r = - 0. 52), Tm (r = 0. 26), L* (r = 0. 33), a* (r = 0. 32) and WBSF (r = - 0. 49) were observed. Meat from Brahman (BR), Non-descript (ND) and Nguni (NG) cows had visible skeletal muscle fibres which were thin and long indicating improved tenderness of beef. Exposing animals to longer hours of transportation did not only reduce glucose levels but also increased the expression of HSPA 1 A and levels of cortisol. The CK and LDH were not related to beef quality. Therefore, CK and LDH can be used as indicators of animal welfare in slaughter cattle but cannot be used to predict the quality of meat. Bulls were the heaviest, although heifers had the highest dressing percentage than cows. Furthermore, the nanostructure of beef indicated that heifers had the best muscle fibres, sarcomere length and visible intercalated discs. The observed nanostructures of Nguni genotype are an indication of tender meat. Beef from heifers of Nguni had visible and tender meat with traces of intramuscular fat while males had shorter sarcomere length and tougher meat.
