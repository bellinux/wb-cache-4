5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals had {{played a role in the}} killing of Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E

Bahá'í cemeteries have been desecrated and property has been seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of Mírzá Buzurg, Bahá'u'lláh's father. The House of the Báb in Shiraz, one of three sites to which Bahá'ís perform pilgrimage, has been destroyed twice.|$|E

50|$|Life {{imprisonment}} is the severest form {{of punishment}} in New Zealand since {{the abolition of}} the death penalty in 1989. It is the mandatory <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> treason, the presumptive <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> murder, and an optional <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> terrorism, manslaughter and certain drug-related offences. People sentenced to life imprisonment remain in prison or on parole for the remainder of their life.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other <b>sentences,</b> <b>for</b> refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E

50|$|Life {{imprisonment}} is {{the mandatory}} <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> treason. It is the presumptive <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> murder; a <b>sentence</b> of life imprisonment for murder is mandatory unless {{in the circumstances}} it would manifestly unjust to impose life imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> the murder convictions.|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> drug-related offences.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Wilberforce leased a {{house in}} Old Palace Yard, Westminster, {{in order to be}} near Parliament. He began using his {{parliamentary}} position to advocate reform by introducing a Registration Bill, proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures. He brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists, arsonists and thieves. The bill also advocated the reduction of <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> women convicted of treason, a crime that at the time included a husband's murder. The House of Commons passed both bills, but they were defeated in the House of Lords.|$|E
50|$|In January 2014, the Romanian Supreme Court {{sentenced him to}} a {{four-year}} prison <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> taking bribes and a three-year prison <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> blackmail, to run concurrently. As a result, Năstase lost {{his status as a}} professor.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 he {{was sentenced}} to an eight-week jail <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> kicking and {{punching}} his partner and smashing the window of a vehicle. In 2015 he received a suspended jail <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> breaching a domestic violence order.|$|R
50|$|In 1880 Alexander Pindikowski, a Polish fresco painter, then {{serving a}} 15-month prison <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> forgery {{received}} a one-month reduction in his <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> the immaculate fresco painting work he completed at both Colonial Building and Government House.|$|R
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> possession of {{small amounts of}} cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> war crimes handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and {{of which he was}} probably unaware. Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.|$|E
40|$|The Act {{increases}} the minimum penalty for furnishing a pistol or a revolver {{to a minor}} from two to three years. The Act also {{increases the}} minimum <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> unlawful possession of firearms from one to five years and raises the minimum <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> carrying a concealed weapon to two years. The Act increases the minimum <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> carrying specified weapons into a school zone. Further, the Act makes it a felony for a person convicted of a forcible felony to attempt to obtain a firearm and increases the penalty for these individuals for possessing a firearm. Finally, the Act raises the minimum fine and <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> possession of a pistol or a revolver by a minor...|$|R
25|$|In 1984, Buenoano {{was convicted}} {{for the murders}} of Michael and the {{attempted}} murder of Gentry. In 1985 she was convicted {{of the murder of}} James Goodyear.

She was convicted of multiple counts of grand theft (for insurance fraud), and is thought to have committed multiple acts of arson (again, for purposes of insurance fraud).|$|R
5000|$|Angel Gonzalez was exonerated {{after serving}} more than 20 {{years of a}} 55-year <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> rape and kidnapping, but was not freed {{immediately}} {{because he had been}} sentenced to three more years for breaking a sink while serving the original <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> his wrongful conviction.|$|R
5|$|On 13 February 2006, Lawrence and Rush, {{the first}} of the nine to face sentencing, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The next day, Czugaj and Stephens were sentenced to life imprisonment, and the group ringleaders, Chan and Sukumaran, were sentenced to death by firing squad, the first ever death {{sentences}} imposed by the Denpasar District Court. The other three, Norman, Chen and Nguyen, were all sentenced to life imprisonment on 15 February 2006. On 26 April 2006, Lawrence, Nguyen, Chen, and Norman appealed and had their sentences reduced to 20 years, while the life <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> Czugaj and Stephens were upheld. Prosecutors launched appeals against the changes in their sentences.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1944, Admiral Osterhaus and {{the other}} six {{members of the court}} deliberated for 80minutes and found all 50 {{defendants}} guilty of mutiny. Each man was reduced in rank to seaman apprentice and sentenced to 15years of hard labor to be followed by dishonorable discharge. The men were held under guard while their sentences were passed to Admiral Wright for review. On November 15, Wright reduced the <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> 40 of the men: 24 were given 12years, 11 were given 10years and the five youngest sailors were given eight-year sentences. The full 15-year sentences remained in place for ten of the men including Joe Small and Ollie Green. In late November, the 50 men were transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island in San Pedro Bay near the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{supporters}} {{have been involved}} in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial. In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14Liverpool fans were given three-year <b>sentences</b> <b>for</b> involuntary manslaughter; half of the terms were suspended.|$|E
