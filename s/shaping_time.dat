Because base current noise will increase with <b>shaping</b> <b>time,</b> a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states.

The electronics has also been adopted by the EMCal detector of ALICE with the same APD readout, but operated at an ambient temperature of + 20 C and with a <b>shaping</b> <b>time</b> of 100 ns. The CR-RC 2 signal shapers on the FEE cards are implemented in discrete logic on a 10 -layer board with two shaper sections for each input channel. The two shaper sections with gain ratio of 16 : 1 are digitized by 10 -bit ADCs and provide an effective dynamic range of 14 bits. Gain adjustment for each individual APD is available through 32 bias voltage control registers of 10 -bit range. The fixed gains and shaping times of the pole-zero compensated shapers are defined prior to FEE production by the values of a few R and C components. For trigger purposes, "fast OR" outputs with 12 -bit dynamic range are available.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the testing of}} several prototype detectors, designed {{to be used in}} a radiation detector called the UoYTube. This detector can be used to detect charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation reactions. In this work, several UoYTube prototypes were designed, fabricated and characterised/tested. These included prototypes with different scintillator crystals (Caesium Iodide and plastic), prototypes with different geometries (truncated pyramid and cuboid), and prototypes that included different types of light guides (Acrylic and 3 D Printed). These prototypes were characterised in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the optimum bias value, the energy resolution, the Acrylic versus 3 D-Printed light guides, the number of counts and the optimum amplifier <b>shaping</b> <b>time.</b> Two different methods used to fabricate light guides (one 3 D Printed and the other with the HURCO VMX 60 m Machining Centre), are also described. The light guides were then characterised and compared to each other in terms of their light output, energy resolution, and the optimum <b>shaping</b> <b>time.</b> Using these results, it was inferred that the plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) and Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated a range of the optimum bias values, over which there was little variation in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. The Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated good energy resolution. The transmittance of light from the spectrometer through the 3 D Printed light guide was significantly poorer than that of the acrylic light guide. The difference in recorded energy resolution between the light guides was not very significant. The recorded number of counts was greater for the Acrylic light guide, when compared to the 3 D Printed light guide. It was also concluded that both the acrylic and 3 D Printed light guided prototypes should be operated with the highest values of <b>shaping</b> <b>time,</b> corresponding to the best resolution. These results were then used to decide upon the optimum design for the next generation UoYTube detector. ...|$|E

One experienced operator shaped two groups of simulated canals. Groups 1 and 3 each comprised 30 blinded L-shaped canals or S-shaped canals, respectively. Photographs were taken before and after shaping and digitally assessed centering after superimposition of the pictures. Time of shaping, number of passes, canal aberrations, and instrument degradation were recorded.

For non-irradiated detectors, where the reverse current is three orders of magnetude smaller compared with irradiated detectors, the series noises dominates over the whole range of shaping times investigated (20 - 150 ns).
