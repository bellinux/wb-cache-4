40|$|In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics Modeling (CFD) {{was applied}} to model a room-and-pillar mining working area to {{investigate}} the airflow patterns for dust control. Room-and-pillar mining is a conventional underground mining technique used for the extraction of coal by cutting excavations called 2 ̆ 2 rooms 2 ̆ 2 using a continuous mining machine and leaving the remaining coal as 2 ̆ 2 pillars 2 ̆ 2 for supporting the coal seam. The FLUENT software was {{used to analyze the}} airflow in the mine whose structure was designed and meshed in GAMBIT. The analysis was carried out in four different stages. First, airflow patterns were studied in the roadway without any equipment. Next, a line curtain, which extends along the height of the coal seam, was simulated in the roadway to direct the flow of air towards the active mining face. In the third stage, a continuous miner was inserted between the mining face {{and the end of the}} line curtain. Three and six meters deep box and <b>slab</b> <b>cuts</b> were simulated and the airflow patterns were investigated.

40|$|On a {{continuous}} miner coal face methane concentrations {{are affected by}} the quantity of fresh intake air reaching the face. When mining the box cut on a 12. 2 -m (40 -ft) two-pass extended cut face, the continuous miner is always at the point of deepest penetration, and operation of the machine-mounted dust scrubber and water spray system improve the flow of fresh air {{to the end of the}} box cut. However, when the continuous miner leaves the box cut to begin cutting the 40 -ft slab, little is known about how much ventilation air reaches the end of the box cut. The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a full-scale study to answer this question. Tests were run to determine how much ventilation air reaches the end of the box cut with the continuous miner at three locations in the 40 -fttwo-pass extended cut mining sequence; at the end of the 40 -ft box cut, at the start of the 40 -ft <b>slab</b> <b>cut,</b> and 6. 1 m (20 ft) into the <b>slab</b> <b>cut.</b> During these tests, methane gas was uniformly released at the end of the 40 -ft box cut. Methane concentrations measured 0. 3 m (1 ft) from the roof and face of the box cut were used to estimate face airflow quantities. Fresh air flow rates of 1. 89 and 4. 72 m/sec (4, 000 and 10. 000 cfm), scrubber flow rates of 0, 4, 000 and 10, 000 cfm, water spray pressures of 0 and 3827 kPa (0 and 120 psi), and a blowing curtain setback position of 15. 2 m (50 ft) were used during these tests.

These machine mounted dust control systems must be designed to function within the localized face ventilation system at the mining section to control both dust and methane. Spray systems can impede or improve the scrubber effectiveness in controlling dust or methane at the mining face. Laboratory experiments were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} spray type, spray pressure, machine body blocking sprays, and scrubber airflow on dust and gas levels while using a 12. 2 m (40 ft) exhaust ventilation curtain setback from the face.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{efficient}} interference detection frequently arises in computer graphics, robotics, virtual prototyping, surgery simulation, computer games, and visualization. To prevent bodies passing directly through each other, the simulation {{system must be}} able to track touching or intersecting geometric primitives. In interactive simulations, in which millions of geometric primitives may be involved, highly efficient collision detection algorithms are necessary. For these reasons, new adaptive collision detection algorithms for rigid and different types of deformable polygon meshes are proposed in this thesis. The solutions are based on adaptive bounding volume hierarchies. For deformable body simulation, different refit and reconstruction schemes to efficiently update the hierarchies as the models deform are presented. These methods permit the models to change their entire shape at every time step of the simulation. The types of deformable models considered are (i) polygon meshes that are deformed by arbitrary vertex repositioning, but with the mesh topology preserved, (ii) models deformed by linear morphing of a fixed number of reference meshes, and (iii) models undergoing completely unstructured relative motion among the geometric primitives. For rigid body simulation, a novel type of bounding volume, the <b>slab</b> <b>cut</b> ball, is introduced, which improves the culling efficiency of the data structure significantly at a low storage cost. Furthermore, a solution for even tighter fitting heterogeneous hierarchies is outlined, including novel intersection tests between spheres and boxes as well as ellipsoids and boxes. The results from the practical experiments indicate that significant speedups can be achieved by using these new methods for collision queries as well as for ray shooting in complex deforming scenes. ...|$|E
40|$|Heat and {{moisture}} transfer in wood wool slabs (shredded wood with Portland cement binder) {{has been investigated}} both experimentally and theoretically. The {{purpose of this study}} is the analysis of the process of moisture redistribution taking place inside wood wool slabs conditioned to moisture equilibrium (e. g., in a climatic chamber) and then mounted in a guarded hot plate or heat flux meter apparatus to measure the specimen thermal resistance. A theoretical analysis of the heat and mass transfer process for such a material was performed and then a suitable numerical model was used to predict and analyse the moisture redistribution. The porous media may be modelled as a multiphase system constituted by a solid matrix and a network of interconnected pores, partly filled with liquid water and partly with moist air. Three equations have been derived: conservation of the mass of the dry air, the conservation of the mass of water species (liquid and vapour) and the energy balance. These equations have been supplemented with the thermodynamic relations and the constitutive equations needed for the closure of the model. The experimental work was performed on a <b>slab</b> <b>cut</b> into several slices. During the experimental tests, the temperature and heat flow rate data was collected both during the steady state conditions to get the thermal resistance and during the initial transient period, when the heat flow rate is continuously varying. At the end of the test, the slices were weighed to get information on the moisture redistribution. The moisture data versus heat flow rate and temperature on the two faces of the specimen, and information about the final moisture distribution were compared with those obtained by numerical simulation.
