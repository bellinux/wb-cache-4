40|$|Abstract In total hip arthroplasty, {{determining}} the impingement free {{range of motion}} requirement is a complex task. This is because in the native hip, motion is restricted <b>by</b> both <b>impingement</b> as well as soft tissue restraint. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine a range of motion bench-mark which can identify motions which are at risk from impingement and those which are constrained due to soft tissue. Two experimental methodologies were used to determine motions which were limited <b>by</b> <b>impingement</b> and those motions which were limited <b>by</b> both <b>impingement</b> and soft tissue restraint. By comparing these two experimental results, motions which were limited <b>by</b> <b>impingement</b> were able to be separated from those motions which were limited by soft tissue restraint. The results show motions in exten-sion as well as flexion combined with adduction are limited by soft tissue restraint. Motions in flexion, flexion combined with abduction and adduction are at risk from osseous impingement. Consequently, these motions represent where the maximum likely damage will occur in femoroacetabular impingement or at most risk of prosthetic impingement in total hip arthroplasty...|$|R

40|$|Abundant {{glass is}} present along grain {{boundaries}} in coarse-grained, glass-bearing, crystalline gabbroic and peridotitic nodules entrained and erupted in lavas from Iceland, Santorini and Mauna Loa (Hawaii), {{even when the}} total porosity {{is less than a}} few volume per cent. The glass films vary from a few microns to a few tens of microns thick, and are associated with strings of small lensoid grain boundary pockets formed <b>by</b> <b>impingement</b> during crystal growth. Additional porosity occurs as extensive liquid-filled pockets adjacent to included grains within oikocrysts and as large triangular pockets formed <b>by</b> <b>impingement</b> of planar-sided grains. Interstitial material within glass films, and the irregularity of film thickness along a single grain boundary, suggest that the present pore structure is repre-sentative of the pore structure before entrainment and eruption. Pore geometry is consistent with a dominant control by crystal growth during solidification, with little or no evidence for control by minimi-zation of internal energies driven by textural equilibration. Similarities between liquid distribution in the crystalline nodules and that of late-stage, interstitial phases in fully solidified mafic cumulates from the Rum and Skaergaard intrusions demonstrate that the crystalline nodules provide information about the latest stages of solidification in slowly cooled mafic plutons. The highly permeable network of intersecting liquid films, lenses and pockets may promote in situ crystallization in the solidifying mush, explain-ing the common presence of adcumulates in such intrusions...|$|R
