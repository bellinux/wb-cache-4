40|$|Continuous {{optimization}} {{of advanced}} coatings {{is required to}} achieve technology advances and strict emission standards in automotive systems. Integration of conventional ceramic coatings and hard amorphous graphite-like carbon (GLC) with low friction is an economically feasible way of achieving superior efficiency of oil and durability as well as scuffing resistance. This work evaluates the scuffing resistant capacity and durability of engineered coating materials. The presence of GLC not only combats the <b>scuffing</b> <b>damage</b> and running instability effectively for conventional chromium-based coatings, and also improves the reliability and robustness of the piston rings. The scuffing mechanism of the engineered rings with and without GLC surface will be discussed by the observation of the damaged characteristics and the chemistry of the rubbing parts. This will potentially benefit to optimize the coating material in the piston assembly of engine...|$|E
40|$|This {{milestone}} report {{summarizes the}} general characteristics of <b>scuffing</b> <b>damage</b> to solid surfaces, then describes transient effects on scuffing observed during oscillating sliding wear tests of candidate material pairs for high-temperature diesel engine applications, like waste-gate bushings in {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) systems. It is shown that oxidation {{and the formation of}} wear particle layers influence the friction of such components. In the case of metallic materials in cylindrical contacts where there is a generous clearance, debris layers can form which reduce the torque over time. For ceramic combinations, the opposite effect is observed. Here, the accumulation of wear debris leads to an increase in the turning torque. High-temperature transient scuffing behavior is considered in terms of a series of stages in which the composition and morphology of the contact is changing. These changes are used to explain the behavior of 11 material pairs consisting of stainless steels, Ni-based alloys, Co-based alloys, and structural ceramics...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{testing of}} {{packaging}} {{is a critical}} part of the distribution packaging analysis process. The accuracy of simulated vibration is important for packaging optimization. Because of this, several researchers have developed improved simulation methods to produce more realistic vibration tests. Correlation studies are required to verify these methods, ideally using actual packaged products in transit. Unfortunately, cost, time and complexity issues make carrying out studies with actual product difficult. This article uses a specially designed and proven test rig, which simulates the damage mechanism of scuffing, to carry out a correlation study. The study compares the level of damage produced when performing simulations using a range of improved techniques in comparison with the time-history reproduction of a journey (used as a benchmark) and the established method using the average power density spectrum to create a Gaussian simulation signal. The level of <b>scuffing</b> <b>damage</b> produced varied between the different simulation methods, with the modulated root mean square (RMS) technique and the accelerated power density spectrum (with a time compression of 5 and a k equal to 2) best reproducing the level of damage observed from the benchmark time replication test.

5000|$|In recent years, {{the engine}} has {{developed}} a noise, referred to as [...] "The Squeak". While {{the cause of this}} noise is not definitively known, it is presumed to come from the low pressure valve. There are no physical indications of <b>scuffing,</b> galling, or <b>damage</b> to components indicating a metal-to-metal contact. The squeak is more pronounced as the engine warms up, and goes away as the engine speed increases. The problem has so vexed the engineers that they have started a tongue-in-cheek fund, whereby visitors are required to donate $1 to the repair fund if they wish to talk to an engineer about it. (This fund may also be diverted to a beer fund, at the discretion of the engineer.) ...|$|R
40|$|Scuffing-like {{damage has}} been found on the tooth {{surfaces}} of gears 5 and 6 of the NASA space shuttle rudder/speed brake power drive unit (PDU) number 2 after the occurrence of a transient back-driving event in flight. Tests were conducted using a pair of unused spare flight gears in a bench test at operating conditions up to 2866 rpm and 1144 in. -lb at the input ring gear and 14, 000 rpm and 234 in. -lb at the output pinion gear, corresponding to a power level of 52 hp. This test condition exceeds the maximum estimated conditions expected in a backdriving event thought to produce the <b>scuffing</b> <b>damage.</b> Some wear marks were produced, but they were much less severe than the scuffing damaged produced during shuttle flight. Failure to produce scuff damage like that found on the shuttle {{may be due to}} geometrical variations between the scuffed gears and the gears tested herein, more severe operating conditions during the flight that produced the scuff than estimated, the order of the test procedures, the use of new hydraulic oil, differences between the dynamic response of the flight gearbox and the bench-test gearbox, or a combination of these. This report documents the test gears, apparatus, and procedures, summarizes the test results, and includes a discussion of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} of three reports {{published}} {{on the results of}} this project. In the first report, results were presented on nineteen tests performed in the NASA Glenn Spiral Bevel Gear Fatigue Test Rig on spiral bevel gear sets designed to simulate helicopter fielded failures. In the second report, fielded helicopter HUMS data from forty helicopters were processed with the same techniques that were applied to spiral bevel rig test data. Twenty of the forty helicopters experienced damage to the spiral bevel gears, while the other twenty helicopters had no known anomalies within the time frame of the datasets. In this report, results from the rig and helicopter data analysis will be compared for differences and similarities in condition indicator (CI) response. Observations and findings using sub-scale rig failure progression tests to validate helicopter gear condition indicators will be presented. In the helicopter, gear health monitoring data was measured when damage occurred and after the gear sets were replaced at two helicopter regimes. For the helicopters or tails, data was taken in the flat pitch ground 101 rotor speed (FPG 101) regime. For nine tails, data was also taken at 120 knots true airspeed (120 KTA) regime. In the test rig, gear sets were tested until damage initiated and progressed while gear health monitoring data and operational parameters were measured and tooth damage progression documented. For the rig tests, the gear speed was maintained at 3500 RPM, a one hour run-in was performed at 4000 in-lb gear torque, than the torque was increased to 8000 in-lbs. The HUMS gear condition indicator data evaluated included Figure of Merit 4 (FM 4), Root Mean Square (RMS) or Diagnostic Algorithm 1 (DA 1), + 3 Sideband Index (SI 3) and + 1 Sideband Index (SI 1). These were selected based on their sensitivity in detecting contact fatigue damage modes from analytical, experimental and historical helicopter data. For this report, the helicopter dataset was reduced to fourteen tails and the test rig data set was reduced to eight tested gear sets. The damage modes compared were separated into three cases. For case one, both the gear and pinion showed signs of contact fatigue or <b>scuffing</b> <b>damage.</b> For case two, only the pinion showed signs of contact fatigue damage or scuffing. Case three was limited to the gear tests when scuffing occurred immediately after the gear run-in. Results of this investigation highlighted the importance of understanding the complete monitored systems, for both the helicopter and test rig, before interpreting health monitoring data. Further work is required to better define these two systems that include better state awareness of the fielded systems, new sensing technologies, new experimental methods or models that quantify the effect of system design on CI response and new methods for setting thresholds that take into consideration the variance of each system...|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{increased}} offensive output {{can be explained by}} the 1920 rule change outlawing tampering with the ball, which pitchers had often done to produce [...] "spitballs", [...] "shine balls" [...] and other trick pitches which had [...] "unnatural" [...] flight through the air. Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored. This rule change was enforced all the more stringently following the death of Ray Chapman, who was struck in the temple by a pitched ball from Carl Mays in a game on August 16, 1920 (he died the next day). Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since. There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without <b>scuffs</b> and other <b>damage</b> to the balls, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.|$|R

40|$|Scuffing {{failure is}} a catastrophic thermal failure mode {{induced by the}} extreme surface {{temperature}} of the contacting components. As two mechanical elements roll against each other with high sliding motion, the frictional heat flux elevates the surface temperature to exceed the critical limit, resulting in the welding of the surfaces. The relative motion then tears the welded surfaces apart, causing the <b>damage.</b> <b>Scuffing</b> failure {{has been an important}} failure mode for rolling machine elements such as bearings and gears in aerospace applications, owing to the very high operating speeds. Recently, this failure mode has extended to the automotive field, where the power density of the transmission system has been continuously increasing. Employing a two-disk contact set-up, this experimental study investigates the scuffing load carrying capacity of two new alloys, which are paired with the lubricant of the Mil-PRF- 23699 turbine fluid, in comparison to the baseline material of AISI 5120, under different speed conditions. The variations of the friction coefficient with the sliding are also quantified for all the three alloy-lubricant pairs under various load and speed conditions. It is observed that the new materials failed to improve the scuffing performance with the lubricant and the operating conditions considered. It is suggested to use a different additive package in the lubricant, which may be more effective for the formation of the protective tribo-film along the new material surfaces. It is also suggested to extend the operating speed range for higher speed applications...|$|R
