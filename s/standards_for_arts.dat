40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a basis for {{understanding}} among Tech Prep and School-to-Work change agents, and educational leaders, of the role that Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE) can perform as a part of the core curriculum, within the framework of these reform movements. The literature indicated that the federally supported Tech Prep and School-to-Work reform movements were not acquainted with DBAE reform initiative which were supported by the Getty Education Institute <b>for</b> the <b>Arts</b> through the work of Regional Institutes. Therefore, they had no ideas about the possible worth of art as an education core component. Also, DBAE was not acquainted with Tech Prep and School-to-Work and therefore had established no common terminology to communicate the power of what they do in a manner which was relevant to that audience. The DBAE Regional Institutes provided individuals to assist in the development and validation of the study tools, and to participate in the pilot study. The Regional Institutes also identified the 10 Discipline-Based Art Education experts who composed the national Delphi panel for the study. The findings were reported according to research questions.

40|$|Helping {{students}} to understand and appreciate music of the worlds cultures is an important long-term goal in music education, a position supported in documents dating from the Tanglewood Declaration (Choate, 1968) to the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> Education (Consortium of National Arts Education Associations, 1994). Currently the position is endorsed in the Housewright Declaration (Madsen, 2000), a summation of agreements made during the Housewright Symposium on the Future of Music Education. Although music teachers believe in the value and benefit of world music instruction, they often are uncertain {{as to how to}} provide that instruction effectively (Moore, 1993; Norman, 1994; Young, 1996). This uncertainty remains an ongoing concern. What constitutes effective world music instruction? One component involves providing music experiences that are likely to increase students preferences for the music style studied, as this is a desired long-term outcome for music instruction. Reimer (1965) indicated that teaching methods, among other considerations, should be examined to determine how and to what extent the teaching-learning process affects learners in terms of achievement and levels of music preference. LeBlanc (1982) theorized that music preference decisions are based upon th...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge, {{as central}} to {{sustaining}} society and culture, is becoming increasingly dependent on the visual. While other signs and symbol systems such as text and numbers have dominated, and other arts forms such as music and dance are able to express and reveal the pulse of human existence, it {{is the emergence of}} new visual technologies and new multimodal forms of the visual that see us expressing and communicating, as never before, {{in a wide variety of}} visual forms and materials- including multi-media, web, video, photography and film- along with expressions and communications through design objects and the more traditional forms of art and crafts. Many of these forms of visual expression and presentation are penetrating deeply into everyday work and life. As the nature of the (visual) world is transforming and enlarging, so is the way we develop knowledge and act in the world.

40|$|Project (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Education, 2008 Although aural {{learning}} and improvisation of music have been fundamental components of music learning theories {{for at least}} two hundred years, published resources for beginning instrumentalists usually take a notation-first approach. An analysis of popular beginning band method books published {{in the last six years}} further reveals an emphasis on the teaching of techniques necessary to play music in the Western classical tradition, an emphasis which might influence instrumental teachers' values and teaching approaches. An alternative approach in beginning instrumental music instruction emphasizes improvisation and the development of music listening and speaking vocabularies prior to the development of music literacy. Jazz offers an ideal medium for this exploration, as improvisation is integral to this art form, and it is a genre outside of the Western Classical tradition. 	The call to incorporate improvisation and jazz into the beginning instrumental curriculum will necessitate the revision of current curricula, the adoption of new learning goals, and the development of additional teaching strategies. This project aims to help fill this void and to make improvisation and jazz available to all instrumentalists through the creation of a jazz-based beginning band improvisation curriculum unit for grades 5 through 8. The unit that is the content of Chapter Four of the project meets the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> Education improvisation content standard and can be taught within the typical time constraints of beginning instrumental instruction in a school setting...|$|E
