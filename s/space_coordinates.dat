[...] If one also diagonalizes the rigid body's moment of inertia tensor (with nine components, six of which are independent), then one has a set of coordinates (called the principal axes) in which the moment of inertia tensor has only three components.|$|E

2500|$|On September 26, 1905 (received June 30), Albert Einstein {{published}} his annus mirabilis paper {{on what is}} now called special relativity. Einstein's paper includes a fundamental new definition of space and time (all time and <b>space</b> <b>coordinates</b> in all reference frames are on an equal footing, so there is no physical basis for distinguishing [...] "true" [...] from [...] "apparent" [...] time) and makes the aether an unnecessary concept, at least in regard to inertial motion. Einstein identified two fundamental principles, the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of light (light principle), which ostensibly served as the axiomatic basis of his theory. To better understand Einstein's step, a summary of the situation before 1905, as it was described above, shall be given (it must be remarked that Einstein was familiar with the 1895 theory of Lorentz, and Science and Hypothesis by Poincaré, but not their papers of 1904-1905): ...|$|E
