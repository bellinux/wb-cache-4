5|$|At {{some unknown}} date the {{symbolic}} snowball and calf tokens {{owed to the}} Campbells were commuted to payment of money rent which increased over the years. In 1806, the chief was forced to relinquish the tenancy of Glen Noe due to inability to meet the payments. The chief and his family emigrated to the United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> family continues to reside. Although {{the identities of the}} chiefs were always known to interested clan members, the chiefship of the clan was not officially recognized by Scottish authorities until 1991, when the coat of arms of James Wallace MacIntyre of Glenoe was confirmed by the Lord Lyon, King of Arms. The current chief of the clan is Donald Russell MacIntyre of Glenoe. The MacIntyre chiefs hold membership in the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs.|$|E
5|$|He was {{promoted}} to rear-admiral on 1 July 1904, in which year his family connections to the royal courts of Europe helped resolve the Dogger Bank incident peacefully. The following February, he was given command of the Second Cruiser Squadron, with HMS Drake as his flagship. During a successful two years the squadron visited Greece, Portugal, Canada, and the United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> American press commented favourably on Prince Louis's courtesy, unassuming manner and democratic nature. After two years {{at the head of}} the Second Cruiser Squadron, and further visits to Spain (where his niece Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg was Queen), he was appointed second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet as acting vice-admiral with HMS Venerable as his flagship.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa {{now turned}} to a more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki {{at the very end}} of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E

It was the first training camp she took part in since July 2004. McLeod was named to a 17-women roster for two matches against the Netherlands in March 2006. She started in goal for the March 4 match, allowing one goal in the 90 minutes played. In April, she made the 18-women roster for the four-city, five-match tour of the United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Canadian team played various college teams. Following the tour, McLeod appeared and started in seven friendlies for Canada from June to August, allowing eight goals total and recording two shutouts.|$|E

5|$|Sato {{estimated}} the game's budget at US$3–5 million. He {{said that the}} development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> presentations of movies and in-game scenes garnered applause from the audience. This favorable reception persuaded Konami to allot more personnel and public relation initiatives to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London, and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{allege that}} Jinnah's courting {{the rulers of}} Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are {{evidence}} of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states. In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the hope the principle would be established for Kashmir. However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely <b>States</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference {{to the will of}} the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western <b>states</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E

5|$|Andalusians only {{began to}} be {{exported}} from Spain in 1962. The first Andalusians were imported into Australia in 1971, and in 1973 the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia was formed for the registration of these Andalusians and their offspring. Strict quarantine guidelines prohibited the importation of new Andalusian blood to Australia for many years, but since 1999, regulations have been relaxed {{and more than half}} a dozen new horses have been imported. Bloodines in the United States also rely on imported stock, and all American Andalusians can be traced directly to the stud books in Portugal and Spain. There are around 8,500 animals in the United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA) registers around 700 new purebred foals every year. These numbers indicate that the Andalusian is a relatively rare breed in the United States. In 2003, there were 75,389 horses registered in the stud book, and they constituted almost 66 percent of the horses in Spain. Breed numbers have been increasing during the 21st century. At the end of 2010, a total of 185,926 Pura Raza Española horses were recorded in the database of the Spanish Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, y Medio Rural y Marino. Of these, 28,801 or about 15% were in other countries of the world; of those in Spain, 65,371 or about 42% were in Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|The same tournament format {{was used}} at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States. The NHL's Olympic break did not start until {{the second week of}} the Games. Because the Olympics were in the United <b>States,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of NHL teams are located, teams participating in the preliminary tournament were allowed to use NHL players who were not obligated to play with their NHL club. Slovakia was particularly affected by the inability to use all of its NHL players, and the team failed to advance to the final round. Three months later, Slovakia won gold at the 2002 World Championships. Finnish centre Raimo Helminen became the first ice hockey player to compete in six tournaments. In the quarter-finals, Belarus defeated Sweden in one of the biggest upsets since the Miracle on Ice. The team advanced to the bronze medal game, but lost to Russia. The Canadian team rebounded from a disappointing first round and defeated the American team in the gold medal game, winning their first gold medal in 50 years.|$|E
5|$|All these {{achievements}} were {{a prelude}} to the 1927 Wimbledon Championships where in successive rounds Cochet defeated two leading Americans Frank Hunter and Bill Tilden and finally Jean Borotra in remarkable five set matches, {{all of whom had}} a two-sets advantage against him. Tilden served for the match, leading 5–1 in the third set and had a match ball. In the final Borotra left six match points unconverted to open the route for Cochet's revival. With the latter one Cochet set a Wimbledon final comeback record that stands up to this day. He then again met Hunter and Tilden in the final of the doubles, this time he joining forces with Jacques Brugnon and lost the championship despite having a match point. This was the first of three consecutive encounters between the French and American teams as in early September the 1927 Davis Cup final took place in the United <b>States</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> US Davis Cup team led by Tilden and Hunter faced the challenging team of the Musketeers. France won 3–2 with Cochet victorious in the decider against Bill Johnston and reclaiming the Davis Cup for France the first time since 1920. A couple of days later the French troupe went to compete in the U.S. National Championships at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. Cochet and Eileen Bennett became the mixed doubles champions. When he returned home {{in the first week of}} October Cochet took revenge on Christian Boussus in their second meeting in the final of the Coupe Porée of Paris. The same week he was ranked third in the world for the second consecutive year although this time he finished ahead of compatriot Borotra. In November he won the Swiss Covered Courts Internationals in a short twenty-five-minute final against Donald Greig.|$|E
