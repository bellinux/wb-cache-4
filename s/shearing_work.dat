40|$|Mozzarella {{cheese is}} a pasta filata type of cheese. Its {{manufacture}} includes a kneading – stretching step {{that creates a}} fibrous protein network and distributes fat-serum channels to attain desirable melt functionality on a pizza. During processing and manufacturing of pasta-filata cheese, large deformations take place. For appropriate characterization of a food material, rheological evaluation should be conducted in similar operating conditions, length scales and time scales to those {{taking place in the}} actual process. Development of the typical fibrous pasta-filata structure of mozzarella cheese depends on composition and process variables. Critical process variables in the development of cheese structure are time, temperature and shear. In this study we studied the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> on rheology, structure and melt functionality of model Mozzarella cheese. Three types of model cheeses (full-fat, non-fat and full-fat with added tri-sodium citrate) were prepared by working cheese components together at 70 oC in a twin screw Blentech cooker. Varied amounts of <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input (2. 8 - 185 kJ/kg) were given to the cheese samples using 50, 150 and 250 rpm screw speeds. Samples were subjected to a range of rheological tests, confocal laser scanning microscopy, fat particle size measurements (DLS) and melt functionality evaluation. While measuring steady shear viscosity of Mozzarella-type cheeses in a rotational rheometer at 70 oC, three main difficulties were encountered; wall slip, structural failure during measurement and viscoelastic time dependent effects. A flow curve method was successfully devised to measure steady shear rheology by using serrated plates as surface modification to avoid wall slip, giving enough measurement duration at low shear rate to avoid viscoelastic effects and selecting limited shear steps to cause minimum structural changes. These techniques enabled successful measurement of steady shear viscosity of molten Mozzarella-type cheeses at 70 oC at shear rates up to 250 s- 1. Strong work thickening was observed for full fat Mozzarella cheese from steady shear rheology, oscillatory rheology, creep, elongational viscosity and tensile testing data. Steady shear rheology and melt functionality were found to be strongly dependent on total <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input. An exponential increase in consistency coefficient (K from power law model) was observed with increasing amounts of accumulated <b>shear</b> <b>work,</b> indicating work thickening behaviour. An exponential work thickening equation is proposed to describe this behaviour. Excessively worked cheese samples exhibited liquid exudation, poor melting and poor stretch. Nonfat cheese exhibited similar but smaller changes after excessive <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input. At lower <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> inputs (70 kJ/kg) it behaved like a viscoelastic solid with low frequency dependence. A definite critical point for structural and viscoelastic transition was identified at a medium <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> level (~ 58 kJ/kg at 150 rpm). Similar viscoelastic property changes occurred in non-fat cheese suggesting that major changes were taking place in the protein matrix during working. Confocal microstructures plus macroscopic observations showed systematic changes in structure with increased <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> inputs with unmixed buttery liquid observed at 58 kJ/kg. At very high <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> inputs, > 75 kJ/kg, striations or anisotropy in the microstructures had disappeared and small micro-cracks were evident. Volume-weighted mean fat particle size decreased with <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input and particle size distributions also changed. To account for the short and long term relaxation response behaviour, a 4 -element Burger‘s model was found adequate for fitting the creep data of model cheese at 70 oC but a 6 -element model was required at 20 oC. As <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input increased, retarded compliance decreased and zero shear viscosity increased indicating the more elastic behavior of the cheeses with higher <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input. Fracture stress and strain for longitudinal samples from elongated full fat cheese did not vary significantly with <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input up to 26. 3 kJ/kg then decreased dramatically at 58. 2 kJ/kg. Longitudinal samples with <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> input G‘ > elongational viscosity > consistency coefficient, K. It was concluded that the dominant contributor to the changes in rheology, structure and melt properties with increased <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> was <b>shear</b> induced structural changes to the protein matrix. An increase in calcium induced protein-protein interactions after high <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> at 70 oC. In summary, this thesis provides useful insights to <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> induced changes in material properties. It proposes useful linkages between the manufacturing process and the application of model Mozzarella cheese using appropriate rheological methods. Since the linkages were validated for only one composition and in only one processing environment, it is proposed that they should be tested in other conditions. In order to build a more complete picture, a molecular level study is proposed for future work to elucidate chemical changes during working and find appropriate linkages with physical and functional characteristics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of viscous dissipation, {{pressure}} <b>work,</b> <b>shear</b> <b>work,</b> rarefaction and axial heat diffusion on convective heat transfer in a microtube gaseous flow. The problem is investigated numerically for the whole flow region using a finite difference scheme and the line Gauss-Seidel iterative technique. Exact solutions {{of the problem in}} terms of temperature distribution and Nusselt number variations are also derived under fully developed flow conditions. The microtube is assumed to be sufficiently long, so that fully developed conditions are established. The analysis presented demonstrate that the effect of the boundary <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> is significant and its contribution to heat transfer can be as high as that due to heat conduction close to the upper limit of the slip flow regime. As the <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> {{is a result of the}} combined effects of viscous dissipation and pressure work at the boundary, including these effects in the analysis leads to better predictions of heat transfer phenomena.

40|$|Study of {{the energy}} {{separation}} phenomenon in vortex tube (VT) at cryogenic temperature (temperature range below 123 [*]K) has become important {{because of the potential}} application of VT as in-flight air separator in air breathing propulsion. In the present study, a CFD model is used to simulate the energy separation phenomenon in VT with gaseous air at cryogenic temperature as working fluid. Energy separation at cryogenic temperature is found to be considerably less than that obtained at normal atmospheric temperature due to lower values of inlet enthalpy and velocity. Transfer of tangential <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> from inner to outer fluid layers is found to be the cause of energy separation.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the laminar flow in flexible tubes and channels could {{be influenced by the}} flexibility of the walls, and these instabilities are qualitatively different from those in rigid tubes and channels. In this paper, the instabilities of the laminar flow in flexible tubes and channels are classified according to the asymptotic regime in which they are observed, the flow structure, the scaling of the critical Reynolds number (rVR/m) with the dimensionless parameter å = (rGR 2 /m 2), and the mechanism that destabilizes the flow. Here, r and m are the fluid density and viscosity,G is the shear modulus of the wall material, R is the cross stream length scale and V is the maximum velocity. Three types of instabilities have been analysed. The viscous instability is observed in the limit of low Reynolds number when the fluid inertia is insignificant, and the critical Reynolds number scales as Re µ å. The destabilizing mechanism is the transfer of energy from the mean flow to the fluctuations due to the <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> done by the mean flow at the surface. In the high Reynolds number inviscid modes, the critical Reynolds number scales are Re µ å 1 / 2, and there is a critical layer of thickness Re– 1 / 3 where viscous stresses are important. The destabilizing mechanism is the transfer of energy from the mean flow to the fluctuations due to the Reynolds stresses in the critical layer. The high Reynolds number wall mode instability has a wall layer of thickness Re– 1 / 3 at the wall, where viscous stresses are important and the critical Reynolds number scales as Re µ å 3 / 4.

It is determined that interaction of the foundations of the bridge towers with the supporting soil plays a decisive role in the overall structural behaviour. The key factor governing the changes of the soil properties at this site is pore-water pressure buildup, which results in liquefaction of the saturated surface soil layers under large dynamic loads. Models of the soil and structure are created and initially validated by accurately simulating the system response to a small earthquake. Soil parameters reßecting the pore-water pressure buildup in the strong earthquake are determined by an advanced non-linear e¤ective stress analysis, combining the RambergÐOsgood model of stressÐstrain dependence with a pore pressure model based on <b>shear</b> <b>work</b> concept.
