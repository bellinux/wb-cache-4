In this case, automatic refers to the loading mechanism, not the firing capability.|$|E

Before the convoy departed for the church, Minh reportedly gestured to Nhung with two fingers, which some have claimed was to be taken as an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were killed.

25|$|Video of the {{shooting}} shows that Van Dyke was advancing on McDonald, while McDonald was walking away from Van Dyke when the first shot was fired. The first shot hit McDonald, who spun {{and fell to the}} ground. As McDonald lay on the ground, still holding the knife, Van Dyke fired more shots into him. In total, Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times in 14–15 seconds, expending the maximum capacity of his 9mm <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>firearm.</b> Van Dyke was on the scene for less than 30 seconds before opening fire and began shooting approximately six seconds after exiting his car. The first responding officer said that he did not see the need to use force, and none of the at least eight other officers on the scene fired their weapons.|$|E
25|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the Ngô {{brothers}} in the APC. Before dispatching the convoy, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken as the order to kill the Ngô brothers. As the convoy on the route to the General Headquarters, Xuân ordered the APC to stop over at a National Police station where he brutally tortured Nhu and Diệm, asking them where they had hidden money. When they refused to release the information, Xuân killed them with his pistol. An investigation by Đôn later determined Nghĩa shot the brothers at point-blank range with a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>firearm</b> and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife without realizing that both the brothers had already been killed by Xuân.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>firearm,</b> or self-loading firearm, is {{one that}} not only fires a bullet each time the trigger is pulled, but also {{performs}} all steps necessary to prepare it to discharge again—assuming cartridges remain in the firearm's feed device. Typically, this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the firing chamber, re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the firing chamber. To fire again, the trigger is released and re-pressed.|$|E
2500|$|In Illinois, {{proposed}} legislation in 2013 would have defined the term [...] "semi-automatic assault weapon" [...] to mean any <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>firearm</b> {{able to accept}} a detachable magazine, {{but it was never}} brought to a vote. The Illinois State Rifle Association said most of the state's firearms owners owned one or more guns that would have been banned under the proposal. The NRA said the proposal would have restricted about 75 percent of handguns and 50 percent of long guns in circulation. As municipalities, Chicago and Cook County bans certain firearms defined as assault weapons and have no provision for legal possession of firearms owned before their laws were passed. [...] Minnesota also defines certain firearms as assault weapons and regulates their sales.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of 2 November, Diệm and Nhu agreed to surrender. The ARVN {{officers}} had promised the Ngô brothers safe exile and an [...] "honorable retirement". The U.S. did not want Diệm and Nhu near Vietnam [...] "because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power". When Dương Văn Minh found the palace empty, he was angered, but was soon informed of the Ngô brothers' location. Nhu and Diệm fled to the nearby Catholic Church of St. Francis Xavier, where they were taken into custody and put into an armoured personnel carrier, to be taken back to military headquarters. The convoy was led by General Mai Hữu Xuân and the brothers were guarded inside the APC by Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa and Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, Minh's bodyguard. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. An investigation by General Trần Văn Đôn later determined that Nghĩa shot the brothers at point-blank range with a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>firearm</b> and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.|$|E

2500|$|The RFB is a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>firearm</b> {{chambered}} for 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester ammunition. The RFB uses metric FAL magazines, which insert {{straight into}} the magazine well and {{do not need to}} rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system. The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axis of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. [...] Empty cases remain in the ejection chute until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute {{to the left of the}} barrel. To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a floating linkage bar between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger. The weapon is fully ambidextrous, much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights. A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories.|$|E
