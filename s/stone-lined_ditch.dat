50|$|Lyon {{set about}} {{creating}} rudimentary defenses, {{taking into account}} the position of a Malay household. The danger of accidentally involving the occupants of the shack in the forthcoming battle led Lyon to switch the position of his defenses away from this location, a formidable task given that the tiny island was bereft of significant cover, and almost entirely indefensible in the daylight. Lyon and Ross climbed a large Ru tree, having first equipped themselves with a massive amount of magazines and grenades. Corporal Stewart was positioned in a <b>stone-lined</b> <b>ditch,</b> about 30 m to their left, together with a cache of grenades and ammunition for the Silent Stens that all three carried.|$|E

40|$|Repeated {{erosion of}} over 7, 000 miles of unpaved roads in Vermont is {{degrading}} {{water quality and}} draining limited town budgets. Best Management Practices (BMPs), including <b>stone-lined</b> <b>ditches,</b> turn outs, check dams, revetments, culverts and vegetative controls, are recommended by the Vermont Department of Transportation as low cost means of reducing the sediment and phosphorous run-off from backroads. However, their effectiveness, longevity and cost benefit are unknown. To address this gap, I assessed 100 BMPs at 43 erosion control projects constructed between 2005 and 2012 with funding from the Vermont Better Backroads program. BMP condition was compared to environmental factors that foreseeably affected how long they would remain intact. Increased road grade and exposure to flood events were the most significant predictors of project deterioration, although increased age affected specific BMPs. Only ten percent of assessed BMPs had failed, indicating that when properly maintained, BMPs may remain operable for over eight years. To understand the availability and distribution of town funds spent on backroad maintenance, I interviewed road foremen in five small, mountainous towns in Vermont. Town expenditures on repairing repeated road washouts were comparable to annual funds needed for “permanent fixes” of roads preliminarily identified to pose the highest risk to water quality. All towns indicated a willingness to construct more BMPs with further funding, suggesting that a proactive approach to erosion control on backroads will be an efficient use of state money allocated to improving water quality...|$|R
50|$|Luke Mountain Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located near Covington, Alleghany County, Virginia. The district encompasses 12 contributing buildings, 4 contributing sites, 6 contributing structures, and 1 contributing object on Luke Mountain overlooking the city of Covington. It includes three high style dwellings all built {{for members of the}} Luke family, the earliest of which was built in 1919. Other contributing resources include the former farm manager's house; agricultural barns, shelters, greenhouses, and storage buildings; and domestic structures such as swimming pools and garages. Other landscape features include a winding entrance drive, a pair of gateposts, <b>stone-lined</b> drainage <b>ditches,</b> a concrete bridge/culvert over Lindsay Glen Run, a reservoir and private water system, terraced fields,pastureland, formal garden spaces, and walking/hiking paths.|$|R
500|$|After the war, Falkes made Bedford Castle his {{headquarters}} and he expanded it considerably, resulting in what David Baker has {{described as a}} [...] "major refortification". Falkes destroyed the neighbouring churches of St Paul's and St Cuthbert's to make space for a new bailey, reusing the stone for the castle. The exact form of the castle after this expansion remains uncertain. The castle {{appears to have been}} quadrangular, with the western edge running along the rear of the modern High Street and the northern edge running along the modern roads of Ram Yard and Castle Lane. The castle had a new barbican; an outer and an inner bailey, with the inner bailey in the south-east corner, protected by an internal <b>ditch</b> and a <b>stone-lined</b> palisade; further stone lined ditches lay around the castle; and a new keep was built on the motte. Brown suspects that the new keep was probably a shell keep with a tower, similar to those built at Launceston or Bungay. The <b>stone-lined</b> palisades and <b>ditches</b> built at Bedford were very unusual in England – their closest equivalent are those found at Skenfrith Castle in Wales. The castle had a postern watergate facing towards the river, and a great hall within the inner bailey in the middle, at least 13 m (43 feet) wide and 40 m (131 feet) long. There was possibly a large stone gatehouse positioned on the outer bailey wall. A mound in the north-east corner of the castle probably supported a large tower.|$|R
