In {{the line of}} duty in various work settings, guards may be {{expected}} to maintain order and to detain criminal violators while appointed to a single property or placed on patrol for various sites or territories. Concisely, a <b>security</b> <b>guard</b> may encounter a variety of situations, locations, and behaviours. With such a heavy responsibility and important duties, {{it is very important to}} make sure that the <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> are mentally and behaviourally healthy and safe. Concerning these issues, this study aimed to identify types of mental health problem and aggression among <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> In addition, association between mental health problems and aggression, and difference between male and female <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> in terms of mental health problems were examined. Self-report surveys were conducted among 300 <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> in data collection. The findings identified four subtypes of mental health problems: substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and depression, experienced by the <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> The <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> were also reported to be performing physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. Male and female <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> showed significant difference in occurrence of mental health problems. The association between the mental health problems and aggression were also found mostly significant. Concisely, prevalence of mental health problems and aggressive behaviours was identified among <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> These findings suggest that people wh...|$|R

40|$|Organisation {{operating}} in the tourism industry are high priority targets for terrorists. In {{the aftermath of the}} 9 / 11 attacks tourism destinations, hotels and modes of public transportation have regularly been targeted by terrorists seeking to convey their violent message. As such, leaders and managers in the tourism industry carefully plan their security and counter-terrorism responses, often involving the hiring of <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> It is here that I believe a significant gap in counter-terrorism preparedness exists. I argue that protecting tourism destinations is only possible if consideration is given the effectiveness of <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> and understanding that their well-being will impact upon their ability to deliver security. I want {{to draw attention to the}} often ignored social role of <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> On 9 / 11, 42 <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> died whilst helping save the lives of thousands.

40|$|The {{high levels}} of crimes in society have led people to seek {{assistance}} outside public law enforcement agencies such as police and the army, to private law enforcement {{agencies such as the}} private <b>security</b> industry. <b>Security</b> <b>guards</b> are involved in providing protection to people, properties and their valuables and in South Africa, they intervene in high crime and violence situations, resulting in their working environment being dangerous and unpredictable. The study aimed to understand some of the factors contributing to the work-related challenges encountered by contract <b>security</b> <b>guard</b> officers. The study utilised a qualitative research design in exploring the narrations of 14 contract <b>security</b> <b>guards,</b> identified and selected using a non-probability purposive sampling procedures. For triangulation purposes, two key informants namely: senior supervisor and a site manager were interviewed. Semi-structured interview schedules were conducted, where in-depth one-on-one interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into verbatim and subsequently analysed using thematic content analysis. The results revealed that economic factors such as poverty and unemployment contribute to one becoming a <b>security</b> <b>guard</b> officer. Furthermore, factors such as low wages, long working hours, lack of respect, safety, lack of water and sanitation facilities were identified as challenges encountered by <b>security</b> <b>guard</b> officer in the industry. The results also showed that the identified challenges impact on the work discipline and work motivation of <b>security</b> <b>guards,</b> their family responsibilities and to their occupational wellbeing. Recommendations emanating from the study included the involvement of occupational social workers in the private security industry, for the developing of interventional programmes in enhancing the effective use of coping strategies by <b>security</b> <b>guards,</b> and the collaboration between security companies and <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> within the contractual service negotiations process with clients...|$|R
