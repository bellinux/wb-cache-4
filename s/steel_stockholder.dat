5000|$|The {{youngest}} of three children, Walker {{was born in}} Blackburn and left school at 13. Walker worked as a sheet metal worker and a conscript craftsman in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. In 1951, {{following the death of}} his father Charles, Walker took over the family sheet metal business. Walkersteel was built from a back-street scrap metal business to a major force in the steel industry. By 1990 Walker had built up the business so successfully that it had become the largest <b>steel</b> <b>stockholder</b> in Britain, employing 3,400 people at 50 sites. In 1988 the business was making an annual profit of £48m. Walkersteel completed a major deal with GKN, purchasing subsidiary GKN Steelstock. [...] Following this Walker decided it was the right time to sell and opened negotiations with British Steel Corporation. Walkersteel was sold for a reported £360m, the highest price ever paid for a private company at the time. Walker's sale of Walkersteel proved to be a less successful investment for its new owners British Steel, as the steel market entered a steep slump as a result of the early 1990s recession. The Walkersteel brand has been revived following Walker's death but is linked in name only.|$|E

40|$|Bandsawing is a {{preferred}} method used by <b>steel</b> <b>stockholders</b> and <b>steel</b> users in industry for cutting-off to {{size in the}} primary and secondary processes. The state-of- the-art features in current industrial bandsaw machines have transformed this method for cutting-off stock to size into a hi-tech operation capable of storage and handling. This method is particularly suitable for use in engineering factories involved in fast, highly automated mass-production techniques, providing the user with continuous batches of cut-to-length materials. Bandsaw machines have now superseded power hacksaws and circular saws in cutting rate and lower kerf loss due to better computer- controlled saw machines and improved blade designs (bi-metal HSS, carbide tipped). Although, {{there have been some}} new developments in bandsaw blades (tooth geometry, band material etc.) there are continuous new demands made on the bandsaw blades by materials engineers, challenged with introducing new materials to satisfy the needs of the design engineers, e. g. aerospace industry. There is therefore a need to improve the bandsaw blade. In order to do this we need to have an understanding of the mechanics of the cutting process associated with bandsawing and the various parameters affecting cutting forces, specific cutting energy, metal removal rates etc. One of the primary problems in evaluating metal bandsaws and developing newer variants, including new saw tooth materials, their heat treatment, or special tooth forms and quality, has been the use of costly and time consuming sawing tests. Furthermore, there are no simple ways of quantitatively evaluating the performance and life of these bands during sawing. Traditional method used by machine operators to assess the performance of blades only give global data, which is difficult to apply to individual teeth. Therefore {{there is a need to}} develop "time compression" test methods for evaluating the performance of bandsaw blades to replace full bandsaw blade testing. The work presented in this thesis is on the development of a single tooth testing method to simulate the intermittent cutting action of a bandsaw blade. Cutting tests have been performed to assess the testing method by comparing single tooth test results to full bandsaw blade test results. The test method developed is capable of producing scientific data for bandsawing associated with forces, metal removal rate and specific cutting energy when cutting a variety of workpiece materials at different speeds and feeds. Thus, it can be used as a substitute to full bandsaw blade testing. The cutting data for the workpiece materials tested using the single tooth test method was obtained in 25 % of the full bandsaw blade evaluation time. This represents a significant saving in time and cost, which should prove useful to design engineers when designing and testing new prototype bandsaw blades for the future needs of the steel and manufacturing industry involved in metal cutting.

40|$|<b>Steel</b> {{manufacturers}} and <b>stockholders</b> prefer bandsawing for cutting off raw materials {{compared to other}} techniques as it enjoys competitive advantages of higher accuracy of cut, better surface finish, lower kerf loss, better straightness of cut, long tool life and high metal removal rate. Along with the geometries of the bandsaw tooth, bandsaw cutting edge condition (e. g., edge sharpness and burr) significantly affects the cutting performance of a bandsaw. Currently the production of bandsaw is largely done by milling operation due to the scale of manufacturing and the economics of milling compared to other processes (e. g., grinding). Ideally, the bandsaw teeth should possess sharp cutting edges with no burr. In general, two types of burr are commonly seen in the bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling operation namely tooth tip burr and side burr. Current research undertaken at Northumbria University in collaboration with a major bandsaw producer {{is focused on the}} mechanism of burr formation in the bandsaw teeth. This paper briefly outlines the factors affecting the burr formation in bimetal (High Speed Steel edge wire and soft steel backing material) bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling process and suggests the necessary steps to be considered for manufacturing burr free bandsaw with sharp cutting edges. The investigation showed that flank wear in the milling cutter has a major influence on the side burr formation in the bandsaw teeth, whereas tooth tip burr was influenced by both flank wear and ''V'' type notch wear found at the crossover point on the flank face. It was also concluded that TiN coating on the milling cutter could control the burr formation in bandsaw teeth to some degree...|$|R
