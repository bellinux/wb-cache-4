40|$|Abstract   The purpose {{with this}} study is to study the {{individual}} setting of <b>salary</b> <b>rates</b> among branch heads. We have chosen to look deeper into which criteria that are the base for the branch heads’ individual setting of wage rates within geriatric care and the care of disabled people. One other aspect we have looked into is how the setting of <b>salary</b> <b>rates</b> appears from a gender perspective. The empirical material in our thesis consists of both qualitative and quantitative methods {{in the shape of a}} questionnaire study and three open interviews. Our theoretical benchmarks are made up of the gender and power order and economic sociological perspectives. This study has partially brought a somewhat for us surprising result concerning the setting of salary through a gender perspective. The individual setting of <b>salary</b> <b>rates</b> is based on several factors like education, years within the profession and work experience. Our questionnaire study showed that most of the branch heads´ asked think that individual settings of <b>salary</b> <b>rates</b> are positive. Nevertheless there are not as many of those that are satisfied with their salary trend. Our interviews showed that gender does matter at the time of employment, because the organization strives for employing more men in this female-intensive occupation. Men generally had a higher average salary than their female colleagues when we compared informants with similar suppositions.                                                                         Katarina MacDonald Marie Ericson Hol...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} memo is to review the requirements and clarify how to determine the “regular rate of pay ” when calculating overtime. Background Information: Collective bargaining agreements for represented employees and California State University (CSU) policy for non-represented employees typically define overtime as authorized time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a designated workweek period. CSU employees are paid under the state pay plan whereby an employee’s monthly salary is paid {{on the basis of}} 12, nearly equal pay periods each year. The pay period is called a calendar month and contains either 21 or 22 “normal ” workdays (Monday through Friday including holidays during the week). Under the state pay plan, when a monthly rate employee is paid overtime, the hourly rate equivalent is derived by dividing the employment history base monthly <b>salary</b> <b>rate</b> by 173. 33. 1 The hourly rate is then multiplied by the number of overtime hours worked at the overtime factor (e. g., 1. 5 x) to calculate the overtime payment.

40|$|Introduction Significant {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} impact of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) in a number of areas. This report focuses on two of these areas by examining the ChAFTA’s provisions on labour mobility. The first area of controversy is whether the ChAFTA will enable Chinese workers to replace local workers in the Australian labour market. This question hinges upon whether the Australian Government can impose labour market testing to determine whether a genuine skills shortage exists in the local labour market. Without labour market testing there is no regulatory mechanism to ensure that local job opportunities are protected. The second area of controversy is whether the ChAFTA allows for, or will result in, Chinese workers receiving poorer wages and conditions than local workers in the Australian labour market. This report is structured in two parts. Part One considers the three provisions in the ChAFTA that provide the opportunity for Chinese workers to access the Australian labour market. The labour mobility clauses in Chapter 10 and the two memorandums concerning large-scale infrastructure development projects and the annual entry of working holiday makers each facilitate this opportunity. This report identifies each of these entry pathways into the Australian labour market and examines how they will operate in practice. Part One of the report makes a number of findings. Firstly, the report finds the ChAFTA greatly increases the access of Chinese workers to the Australian labour market. The report recommends the Australian Government use its enabling legislation to clarify that labour market testing will apply to certain categories of Chinese workers. In particular, there needs to be labour market testing {{in a manner that is}} consistent with Australia’s 457 visa program, before employers can access Chinese workers who are ‘contractual service suppliers’ or ‘installers and servicers’. Without labour market testing, there is no regulatory mechanism to prevent an employer from preferencing a Chinese worker over a local worker for these two categories. Secondly, the report also finds that there needs to be greater protection to ensure Chinese workers are not used as a way of undercutting local wages and conditions. This can be done by making it a requirement that Chinese workers be paid the applicable market <b>salary</b> <b>rate</b> and not merely the award rate for their occupational category. The market <b>salary</b> <b>rate</b> can be determined through taking into account the current major employing collective agreement registered by the Fair Work Commission in the sector and/or region, ABS average <b>salary</b> <b>rate</b> data and the Department of Employment’s Job Outlook data. Thirdly, the report finds that the current regulatory framework for Investment Facilitation Arrangements (IFAs) requires reform in order to ensure it is a legislated framework that mandates labour market testing, market salary rates and the achievement of greater public accountability and transparency around IFAs...|$|E

40|$|Sensitivity analysis, or {{so-called}} ‘stress-testing’, {{has long}} {{been part of the}} actuarial contribution to pricing, reserving and management of capital levels in both life and non-life assurance. Recent developments in the area of derivatives pricing have seen the application of adjoint methods to the calculation of option price sensitivities including the well-known ‘Greeks’ or partial derivatives of option prices with respect to model parameters. These methods have been the foundation for efficient and simple calculations of a vast number of sensitivities to model parameters in financial mathematics. This methodology has yet to be applied to actuarial problems in insurance or in pensions. In this paper we consider a model for a defined benefit pension scheme and use adjoint methods to illustrate the sensitivity of fund valuation results to key inputs such as mortality rates, interest rates and levels of <b>salary</b> <b>rate</b> inflation. The method of adjoints is illustrated in the paper and numerical results are presented. Efficient calculation of the sensitivity of key valuation results to model inputs is useful information for practising actuaries as it provides guidance as to the relative ultimate importance of various judgments made in the formation of a liability valuation basis. 13 page(s...|$|E

In the case of Indonesia, despite {{of the fact that there}} are two official types of Islamic bank, as they are accommodated by Banking Act No. 7 1992, as well as Banking Act No. 10 1998, there is an additional type as what so-called Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, or abbreviated as BMT. BMTs have even attracted more attention. First, because they are generally unregistered under the normal practice rule such as Central Bank. Second, they have developed very significantly in quantity and spread in very wide areas of different provinces. Currently, there are about two thousand BMTs around the country. This indicates that BMTs have been contributing to the national economy. Third, although the country is hit by the crisis, many BMTs operate smoothly. This is contrary to what might be seen in the fact faced by many formal conventional banks. Based on the above factors, we are interested in investigating what the influencing factors are behind the good performance of BMTs in general. This is the main objective of this study. To answer the research problems, the data were collected from the best 47 BMTs in five different provinces, i. e., West Java, Jakarta Special Territory of Capital, Middle Java, Special Region of Yogyakarta, and East Java.
