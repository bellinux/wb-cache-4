40|$|Laser seeding {{technique}} {{have been}} envisioned to produce nearly transform-limited pulses at soft X-ray FELs. Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) is a promising, recent technique for harmonic generation with an excellent up-conversion to very high harmonics, {{from the standpoint}} of electron beam physics. This paper explores the constraints on <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> performance for reaching wavelengths of 1 nm. We show that the main challenge in implementing the EEHG scheme at extreme harmonic factors is the requirement for accurate control of temporal and spatial quality of the <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> pulse. For example, if the phase of the laser pulse is chirped before conversion to an UV seed pulse, the chirp in the electron beam microbunch turns out to be roughly multiplied by the harmonic factor. In the case of a Ti:Sa <b>seed</b> <b>laser,</b> such factor is about 800. For such large harmonic numbers, generation of nearly transform-limited soft X-ray pulses results in challenging constraints on the Ti:Sa laser. In fact, the relative discrepancy of the time-bandwidth product of the seed-laser pulse from the ideal transform-limited performance should be no more than one in a million. The generated electron beam microbunching is also very sensitive to distortions of the <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> wavefront, which are also multiplied by the harmonic factor. In order to have minimal reduction of the FEL input coupling factor, it is desirable that the size-angular bandwidth product of the UV <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> beam be very close to the ideal i. e. diffraction-limited performance in the waist plane at the middle of the modulator undulator.

40|$|Free-electron lasers (FELs) seeded with {{external}} lasers hold great promise for generating high power radiation with nearly transform-limited bandwidth in soft x-ray region. However, {{it has been}} {{pointed out that the}} initial <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> noise will be amplified by the frequency up-conversion process, which may degrade the quality of the output radiation produced by a harmonic generation scheme. In this paper, theoretical and simulation studies for laser phase error amplification in seeded FEL schemes with slippage effect taken into account are presented. It is found that, the <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> imperfection experienced by the electron beam can be significantly smoothed by the slippage effect in the modulator when the slippage length is comparable to the laser pulse length. This smoothing effect allows one to preserve the excellent temporal coherence of seeded FELs in presence of large laser phase errors. For ultra-short UV seed lasers with FWHM around 16 fs, the slippage length in a modulator with ~ 30 undulator periods is typically comparable to the laser width; for longer <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> pulses with FWHM around 80 fs, the slippage length can be made comparable to the laser width using a modulator tuned at the sub-harmonic of the UV <b>seed</b> <b>laser.</b> Three-dimensional simulations have been carried out for a soft x-ray facility using <b>seed</b> <b>laser</b> pulses with large frequency chirp and the results show that the sensitivity of the bandwidth of the seeded FEL to the initial frequency chirp can be significantly reduced by a proper design of the modulator such that the slippage length is comparable to the laser width.
