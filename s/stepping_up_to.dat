5|$|O'Rourke {{left for}} a second time in May 1930, after he {{resigned}} because he was not allowed to sign a player he wanted. City spent eight seasons back in Division Two but the nearest they came to <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the top flight was in 1933–34 when at one point they topped the division. Their sixth-place finish was the highest position since the club had been in Division One and would not be bettered until the 1980s. Relegation back to Division Three (North) came in 1936–37. City were runners-up in the Division Three North Challenge Cup a year later before they won the same competition in the last year before league football was again suspended because of war.|$|E

25|$|Things {{were further}} {{complicated}} when founder William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. The newly formed Southern California Symphony Association was created {{with the goal}} to stabilize the orchestra's funding, with the association's president, Harvey Mudd, <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> personally guarantee Klemperer's salary. The Philharmonic's concerts at the Hollywood Bowl also brought in much needed revenue. With that, the orchestra managed {{to make it through}} the worst of the Great Depression years still intact.|$|E
25|$|The garden {{forecourt}} is a flat {{public space}} fronting Boundary Street. The garden {{is laid out}} in sharp and dynamic lines of concrete, defining contrasting flat areas of mature trees, grass, paths and water to create a bold, abstract effect. A wide entrance path from the street bisects the garden, bridging across a pond and <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the front portico entrance. The Red Cube, a large metal sculpture, stands on the path {{in front of a}} marble slab engraved to commemorate the opening of the building.|$|E

This coincided with sponsor Smithfield Foods <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fund 29 races in each the next three seasons with brands Smithfield, Farmland, Eckrich, and Gwaltney. Almirola had a rather slow start to 2014, being involved in a 12 car wreck in the 2014 Daytona 500. At Bristol, Almirola posted his best career finish to date of 3rd, only behind winner Carl Edwards and Ricky Stenhouse Jr.|$|E

25|$|The Greys {{made another}} {{move out of}} Junior B, <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Ontario Junior Hockey League in 1985. They {{affiliated}} with the Guelph Platers of the Ontario Hockey League and performed very well in their new surroundings, finishing in third place in their first season and topping the standings in their second. They also won the Frank L. Buckland Trophy as playoff champions in 1986-87, their first title since 1974-75, and advanced to the all-Ontario championship against the Nickel Centre Power Trains of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 a {{child was}} born in south central Tibet amidst all the usual {{extraordinary}} signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the 12th Dalai Lama in 1858. The use of the Chinese Golden Urn {{at the insistence of}} the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed Trinley Gyatso and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> rule Tibet at the age of 17.|$|E

25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being wrong about anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her abrasiveness could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, they found him unconvincing in the interviews and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E
25|$|Australian Royce Simmons {{took over}} from compatriot Mick Potter {{for the start}} of the 2011 season. As the club awaited {{completion}} of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances.|$|E
500|$|Although Piquet's {{result was}} fortuitous, Renault Engineering Director, Pat Symonds, {{subsequently}} praised him for <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the job of}} staying with {{the leaders in the}} final stint of the race. Meanwhile, Massa commented that his car was not in good order during the race: [...] "It was just slow with difficult stability and also on braking I think I had a little problem as well and lost a lot of performance. I didn’t have the car to fight. I tried but it was not possible." [...] Teammate Räikkönen also struggled with low grip and hot brakes {{for the duration of the}} race, while Kovalainen and Kubica had problems with their tyres.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{and lead}} {{designer}} Billy Thomson had previously confirmed that Crackdown was designed {{from the outset}} to be a long-running series of games, stating that sequels for the game are very likely to be produced, especially if Crackdown performed well commercially. However, during the Industry All Stars event in September 2007, Wilson confirmed that Realtime Worlds was not working on a sequel to the game, saying [...] "Microsoft was a little late in <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the plate to ask for Crackdown 2, and by then we had already started working on bigger, better things". However, then-corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, Shane Kim, stated that Microsoft still holds the intellectual property rights for Crackdown and that a Crackdown sequel was still a possibility. [...] Realtime Studios manager Colin MacDonald clarified that {{if they have the}} resources after completion of , they could approach Microsoft to discuss a sequel.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{performed}} a medley, which included [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Wearing casual white blouse and black skinny jeans, Swift performed [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] and then announced, [...] "Its a fairly tale and {{an honor to}} share the stage with Stevie Nicks". Following, the two {{performed a}} cover of Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Rhiannon" [...] (1976). Swift then grabbed her acoustic guitar for {{the third and final}} part in her medley, jumping into a twangy version of [...] "You Belong with Me". Nicks stood back, tapping her tambourine and nodding, every so often <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the microphone to sing with Swift. Eric Ditzian of MTV News was disappointed at Swift's and Nicks' harmonies, but said the two [...] "made for a compelling twosome". The performance followed much backlash in regards to Swift's off key singing, which caused Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, to issue a statement defending the performance.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E

500|$|Margate Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} seaside resort of Margate, Kent. [...] The club was founded in 1896 and played only friendlies and cup matches until 1909, when the team joined the Thanet and District League. Two years later Margate joined the Kent League, initially also playing in the Thanet League due to the county league's small fixture list, before <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Southern League in 1933. [...] After four seasons at this level, however, the club {{was forced to resign}} on financial grounds and return to the Kent League. [...] Margate returned to the Southern League in 1959 and remained there until 2001 when they gained promotion to the Football Conference, the highest level of English non-League football. [...] During their stay at this level they were forced to groundshare with other clubs due to drawn-out and problematic redevelopment work at their Hartsdown Park ground. [...] This led to the club being expelled from the Conference National in 2004 for failing to meet the division's stadium requirements. [...] After one season in the Conference South the club was relegated to the Isthmian League.|$|E
