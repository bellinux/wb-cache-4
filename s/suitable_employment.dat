5|$|In late 1873, Brunner {{suffered}} a paralysis {{of his left}} side which prevented him from working. By mid-April 1874, he had sufficiently recovered to begin soliciting the provincial government for <b>suitable</b> <b>employment.</b> However, {{on the morning of}} 22 April he {{suffered a}} stroke and died few hours later. His funeral service was held at Nelson Cathedral and was attended by several hundred people. A large Māori contingent, including his long-time friend Kehu, was also present. Brunner was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, who moved to England soon after his death. She lived with her brother until her death in 1895. The couple had no children.|$|E
5|$|In 1787 Dennie was {{admitted}} to the sophomore class of Harvard College, where he was very popular with his peers. This popularity did not extend to his tutors, and he was suspended in December 1789 for six months after insulting the faculty. Dennie had difficulty finding <b>suitable</b> <b>employment</b> after earning his degree in 1790, but by 1793 he was practicing law (though earning very little for his work). In a January 1794 letter to his parents, however, Dennie reports that he had been appointed as a reader for the Episcopalian church in Charlestown, New Hampshire. Nevertheless, he insisted that this new vocation would not deter him from his goal of practicing law, though by then he was planning on remaining in New Hampshire to practice rather than returning to Massachusetts. Shortly after writing the letter, Dennie {{was admitted}} to the Court of Common Pleas and opened a practice in Charlestown. However, he rarely appeared in open court; indeed, he probably made only one appearance.|$|E

For all these reasons, Ybor City’s WWII generation was the first to leave the area in large numbers since Vicente Martinez-Ybor had first cleared the scrubland in 1885.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{shows that}} there are routes besides job search {{that can lead to}} <b>suitable</b> (re-) <b>employment.</b> Employability is - by providing both the resources to engage and persist in proper job search methods and to eventually land suitable reemployment - a more fruitful route when pursuing genuine reemployment success. Moreover, particularly preparation (i. e., career adaptability) is essential for the quality of (re-) employment. Thus, in the pursuit of <b>suitable</b> (re-) <b>employment,</b> employability and preparation are the right routes for maximizing the chances on finding a suitable job...|$|R
25|$|In 1925 {{and again}} in 1926, Alfred Stephens {{suggested}} in newspaper articles that more <b>suitable</b> <b>employment</b> should be found for him. The difficulty was that Neilson's poor eyesight unfitted him for most kinds of work. However, a movement began in Melbourne to help {{him and he was}} granted a small literary pension; and eventually in 1928 a position was found for him as an attendant {{in the office of the}} Victorian Country Roads Board. This office was in the Exhibition Gardens, Melbourne, and in these pleasant surroundings Neilson spent his days until near the end of his life.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that individuals can learn to inhibit category-based stereotypes, but feature-based biases may be harder to control. This study was conducted to determine the impact of gender appearance on perceptions of suitability for stereotypical professions. One hundred forty students from a university in central California indicated their impressions of how suitable 54 men and women were for employment in the medical field, both as a doctor and a nurse. Stimuli were computer-generated faces of nine men and nine women presented in three versions ??? the original, unaltered face, a version manipulated to appear more feminine, and a version manipulated to appear more masculine. It was predicted that perceivers would inhibit categorical-based stereotyping (i. e., rate males and females to be similarly <b>suitable</b> for <b>employment</b> as a doctor and nurse) but demonstrate feature-based stereotyping (i. e., rate feminized faces of both genders as more <b>suitable</b> for <b>employment</b> in nursing and masculinized faces of both genders as more <b>suitable</b> for <b>employment</b> as a doctor). As predicted, participants inhibited category-based stereotypes, but rated feminized faces of both genders as more suitable for nursing. Hypotheses regarding suitability for employment as a doctor were not confirmed: Ratings did not differ by gender appearance for males, and feminized female faces were rated as more suitable than masculinized female faces. A physical attractiveness bias may account for the unexpected results. These findings add to the converging evidence regarding the subtle, yet powerful influence of feature-based stereotyping...|$|R

Sometimes I managed to live fairly well, sometimes I suffered. Always I suffered from the stigma of my father's crime, always in the eyes of the community in which I lived--a community, I am sorry to say, incapable, as a rule, of making correct judgments in delicate cases like these--I was looked upon as belonging to the ranks of the dishonest.

60|$|The {{moment of}} relief had come at last! The only {{question}} now left to discuss was evidently {{the question of}} amount. Lady Janet considered a little. The question of amount was (to her mind) in some sort a question of conscience as well. Her love for Mercy and her loathing for Grace, her horror of seeing her darling degraded and her affection profaned by a public exposure, had hurried her--there was no disputing it--into treating an injured woman harshly. Hateful as Grace Roseberry might be, her father had left her, in his last moments, with Lady Janet's full concurrence, to Lady Janet's care. But for Mercy {{she would have been}} received at Mablethorpe House as Lady Janet's companion, with a salary of one hundred pounds a year. On the other hand, how long (with such a temper as she had revealed) would Grace have remained in the service of her protectress? She would probably have been dismissed in a few weeks, with a year's salary to compensate her, and with a recommendation to some <b>suitable</b> <b>employment.</b> What would be a fair compensation now? Lady Janet decided that five years' salary immediately given, and future assistance rendered if necessary, would represent a fit remembrance of the late Colonel Roseberry's claims, and a liberal pecuniary acknowledgment of any harshness of treatment which Grace might have sustained at her hands. At the same time, and for the further satisfying of her own conscience, she determined to discover the sum which Grace herself would consider sufficient by the simple process of making Grace herself propose the terms.|$|E

60|$|Jack was {{fourteen}} {{when his father}} apprenticed him to a firm of cabinet-makers. For the first year, he worked away contentedly at legs and mouldings; {{but as soon as}} he had learnt the rudiments of the trade he persuaded his masters to change his indentures, and let him take the more <b>suitable</b> <b>employment</b> of carving woodwork for ornamental furniture. He must have been a good workman and a promising boy, one may be sure, or his masters would never have countenanced such a revolutionary proceeding {{on the part of a}} raw apprentice. Young Gibson was delighted with his new occupation, and pursued it so eagerly that he carved even during his leisure hours from plaster casts. But after another year, as ill-luck or good fortune would have it, he happened to come across a London marble-cutter, who had come down to Liverpool to carve flowers in marble for a local firm. The boy was enchanted with his freer and more artistic work; when the marble-cutter took him over a big yard, and showed him the process of modelling and cutting, he began to feel a deep contempt for his own stiff and lifeless occupation of woodcarving. Inspired with the desire to learn this higher craft, he bought some clay, took it home, and moulded it for himself after all the casts he could lay his hands on. Mr. Francis, the proprietor of the marble works, had a German workman in his employ of the name of Luge, who used to model small figures, chiefly, no doubt, for monumental purposes. Young Gibson borrowed a head of Bacchus that Luge had composed, and made a copy of it himself in clay. Mr. Francis was well pleased with this early attempt, and also with a clever head of Mercury in marble, which Gibson carved in his spare moments.|$|E
