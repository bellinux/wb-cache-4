2500|$|Plywood is {{also used}} as an {{engineering}} material for stressed-skin applications. It {{has been used for}} marine and aviation applications since WWII. Most notable is the British de Havilland Mosquito bomber, with a fuselage made of birch plywood sandwiching a balsa core, and using plywood extensively for the wings. Plywood was also used for the hulls in the hard-chine Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) and Motor Gun Boats [...] (MGB) built by the British Power Boat Company and Vosper's. Plywood is currently successfully used in stressed-skin applications. The American designers Charles and Ray Eames are known for their plywood-based furniture, as is Finnish Architect Alvar Aalto and his firm Artek, while Phil Bolger has designed a wide range of boats built primarily of plywood. Jack Köper of Cape Town designed the plywood Dabchick <b>sailing</b> <b>dinghy,</b> which [...] is still sailed by large numbers of teenagers.|$|E
