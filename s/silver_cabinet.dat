5000|$|The {{original}} version of Silver Strike Bowling had a difficulty setting with three selections: Easy, Medium and Hard. However, {{it was not}} possible to determine the setting by playing the game as the setting was controlled by the operator or owner of the game <b>cabinet.</b> <b>Silver</b> Strike Bowling 2007 does not have this feature and all games have exactly the same physics at all times to ensure a level playing field for online play. While game play between them is otherwise similar, SSB 2009 can always be identified by [...] "Silver Strike Bowling 2009" [...] graphics in the attract mode and usually the game cabinet will have graphics which clearly identify it as an SSB 2009 or later unit. Silver Strike Bowling 2009 Bowler's Club games also have wireless online functionality which is not present in the original Silver Strike Bowling games.|$|R

It is awarded to the platoon {{commander}} who has exhibited the highest qualities of leadership and who is therefore, the junior officer most fit to command the {{men who have been}} placed in his charge.The Mons Box, a ceremonial cigar box, was presented to then Lieutenant Gregg by the Burgomaster of Mons, Belgium in November 1918. In addition, all members of the Canadian Corps who had reached the Mons area by Armistice Day were presented with a souvenir medallion of the City of Mons. Duplicates of this medallion are affixed to the box. Brigadier Gregg presented the Mons Box to 2 RCR on 1 June 1973. It has been presented annually since then to the winning platoon commander on the first appropriate battalion function after 1 June. The winner of the Mons Box is determined by a selection committee consisting of the Commanding Officer, the Adjutant, Company Commanders and any previous winners of the Mons Box serving in 2 RCR. These previous winners are no longer eligible to compete. All Subalterns, who have spent at least eight consecutive months of the previous year as a platoon commander, are eligible for the award. The Mons Box is displayed in the <b>silver</b> <b>cabinet</b> or the Saint Andrew's Barracks Officers' Mess in CFB Gagetown. It is placed in front of the current winner during all Mess Dinners and it contains the after dinner cigars. Each winner of the Mons Box receives a souvenir trophy.|$|E
