2500|$|Musterles wing {{was mounted}} over the {{fuselage}} on a low, ply covered pylon which blended into the fuselage and extended well behind the wing trailing edge, gradually decreasing in height. The fuselage was ply covered and ovoid in cross section, formed by ply covering over three longerons held in transverse frames; it was distinctly [...] pointed on its underside and tapered aft. [...] The cockpit was {{just ahead of}} the wing under a removable, largely ply cover; the only transparencies were the windscreen and a small rectangular roof window, though there were open circular portholes on either side. All tail surfaces were built in a similar way to the wing. [...] Both the tall rudder and elevators were all-moving and balanced, with straight edges and rounded tips. The elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage and the rudder extended down to the keel, so a generous cut-out in the elevators was provided for its movement. Musterle had a landing skid under the forward fuselage, reaching back almost to the wing trailing edge, and a <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> tailskid.|$|E

40|$|A {{sample of}} winter faba bean {{germplasm}} from China was compared with germplasm from outside China, using AFLP analyses. Both sets of germplasm {{were obtained from}} the National Genebank of China, Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China. A sample of 39 winter type accessions from outside of China and 204 Chinese landraces and varieties (201 winter <b>types</b> and 3 <b>spring</b> <b>types)</b> were characterized with 10 AFLP primers. These detected 266 polymorphic bands. The Chinese germplasm was clearly separated {{from the rest of the}} world in principal component analysis and clustering analysis, with the <b>spring</b> <b>types</b> from China showing the greatest separation. Yunnan germplasm, both landraces and commercial varieties, showed the greatest separation among the germplasm of Chinese winter faba bean provinces.

50|$|Cool-season cereals are well-adapted to {{temperate}} climates. Most {{varieties of}} a particular species are either winter or <b>spring</b> <b>types.</b> Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become dormant during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>type</b> - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a pressure plate, squeezing the friction disk between the inner pressure plate and the outer cover plate. This frictional clamping force is transferred to the hub, which is mounted to a shaft.|$|E

50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> {{accumulator}} {{is similar}} in operation to the gas-charged accumulator above, except that a heavy spring (or springs) is used to provide the compressive force. According to Hooke's law {{the magnitude of the}} force exerted by a spring is linearly proportional to its change of length. Therefore, as the spring compresses, the force it exerts on the fluid is increased linearly.|$|E

5000|$|The FN Kégresse 3T was a {{half-track}} with a two man driver-cabin {{and a heavy}} platform {{equipped for}} towing large trailers or artillery pieces. Back suspension was of the Citroën Kégresse half-track type, with a leaf <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> suspension with 2 two-wheel bogies attached to a single sidebar, connected to the back idler-wheel, with only the frontal wheel providing traction. The frontal suspension {{was the same as}} used in the Minerva CM-3 truck and of the elliptical <b>spring</b> <b>type.</b> The engine of the first version of the FN Kégresse 3T was a water cooled 6 cylinder Minerva 36 gasoline engine with an internal volume of 3 litres and a power rating of 55 hp, the second version had a 4 litre FN 63T 8 cylinder water cooled gasoline engine producing 60 hp. [...] As in the Minerva CM-3, the FN Kégresse 3T had a 4 speed transmission and an average autonomy of 400 km.|$|E
50|$|Several {{independent}} suspension designs have featured transverse leaf springs. Most applications used multi-leaf steel springs though more recent designs have used {{fiber reinforced plastic}} (FRP, typically fibers are fiberglass) springs. In addition to <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> (multi-leaf steel, FRP), a distinction can be drawn between systems where the spring also acts as a locating link and those where the spring only acts as a spring member.|$|E

On each side a V-strut, with the hub at its vertex, was hinged at about 45° to the vertical {{from the lower}} fuselage longerons. A vertical bungee strut acted as a shock absorber, placing the wheel below the joint between centre and outer wing panels. Its tailskid was of the steel leaf <b>spring</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E

50|$|High-lift {{safety valves}} are direct-loaded <b>spring</b> <b>types,</b> {{although}} the <b>spring</b> does not bear {{directly on the}} valve, but on a guide-rod valve stem. The valve is beneath {{the base of the}} stem, the spring rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat. This gives a steam flow through the valve equivalent to a valve one and a half or twice as large (depending on detail design).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{advances}} in genotyping with high-density markers nowadays enable genome-wide genomic analyses in crops. A detailed characterisation {{of the population}} structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) {{is essential for the}} application of genomic approaches and consequently for knowledge-based breeding. In this study we used the triticale-specific DArT array to analyze population structure, genetic diversity, and LD in a worldwide set of 161 winter and spring triticale lines. Results The principal coordinate analysis revealed that the first principal coordinate divides the triticale population into two clusters according to their growth habit. The density distributions of the first ten principal coordinates revealed that several show a distribution indicative of population structure. In addition, we observed relatedness within growth habits which was higher among the <b>spring</b> <b>types</b> than among the winter types. The genome-wide analysis of polymorphic information content (PIC) showed that the PIC is variable among and along chromosomes and that especially the R genome of <b>spring</b> <b>types</b> possesses a reduced genetic diversity. We also found that several chromosomes showed regions of high genetic distance between the two growth habits, indicative of divergent selection. Regarding linkage disequilibrium, the A and B genomes showed a similar LD of 0. 24 for closely linked markers and a decay within approximately 12 [*]cM. LD in the R genome was lower with 0. 19 and decayed within a shorter map distance of approximately 5 [*]cM. The extent of LD was generally higher for the <b>spring</b> <b>types</b> compared to the winter types. In addition, we observed strong variability of LD along the chromosomes. Conclusions Our results confirm winter and spring growth habit are the major contributors to population structure in triticale, and a family structure exists in both growth types. The specific patterns of genetic diversity observed within these types, such as the low diversity on some rye chromosomes of spring habits, provide a basis for targeted broadening of the available breeding germplasm.
