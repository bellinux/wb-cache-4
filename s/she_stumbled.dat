25|$|In 1999, a woman {{dropped her}} 18-months-old, {{disabled}} child off the bridge. She claimed <b>she</b> <b>stumbled</b> accidentally {{and the child}} slipped from her grasp. The child was not seriously injured. The woman lost legal custody of her child {{as a result of}} the incident. The woman took legal action against the owner of the bridge, alleging negligence by the owner. The case was settled out of court.|$|E
500|$|Broadcasters {{sometimes}} make sweeping changes to winning songs {{before they go}} to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with [...] "April, April". Performing after her victory, <b>she</b> <b>stumbled</b> on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with Lill-Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner [...] "Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola", performed by Lotta Engberg, is another example; the song's title was changed to [...] "Boogaloo" [...] for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix [...] "-loo".|$|E

It was the first time since April 2004 that David did not qualify for the quarters of a tournament, [...] losing to the same person who denied her the bronze medal of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne 9 months previously. In December, David won the inaugural Asian Sportswoman of the Year, beating more than 100 competitors who represented 25 sporting bodies.|$|E

500|$|In 1920, Lloyd {{appeared}} {{twice at}} Hendon Magistrates Court and gave {{evidence of the}} abuse she had suffered from Dillon. [...] Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. [...] When asked by prosecutors how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied [...] "I cannot tell you, {{there were so many}} [...] [...] It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk." [...] By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and <b>she</b> <b>stumbled</b> across the stage. [...] She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as [...] "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merope Gaunt [...] was the {{daughter}} of Marvolo, sister of Morfin. Harry's first impression of her was that she looked [...] "like the most defeated person he had ever seen", probably because she lived in raggedness, squalor, and abuse. She married Tom Riddle Sr and became pregnant within three months of the wedding. It is suggested that she tricked her husband into loving her by using a love potion, but when she became pregnant, she chose to stop administering the potion. It is implied that Merope had grown tired of living the lie and thought that her husband might have grown to love her, or that he might have stayed for the sake of their unborn child; however, he left her. Desperate, Merope wandered through the streets of London. The only thing she had left was the heavy gold locket that had once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, one of her family's most treasured items, which she sold for a small amount. When she was due to give birth, <b>she</b> <b>stumbled</b> into a Muggle orphanage, where she gave birth to her only son, Tom Marvolo Riddle. She died within the next hour.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a student}} at Kashima high school and has been Hazumu's classmate since {{their first year of}} high school. Ever since she was born, Yasuna has had a unique affliction which makes her {{incapable}} of seeing males, and instead to her males are covered in a gray, hazy blur, which makes it extremely difficult for her to tell one male apart from another except through the sound of their voice. Due to this, she was never able to get along well with others; on top {{of not being able to}} see the boys in her class at school, the girls who would normally interact with them were different compared to Yasuna, which built up a divide between her and everyone else. She ended up staying alone for years, and she thought she did not mind it; she did not intend to befriend anyone anyway. However, when <b>she</b> <b>stumbled</b> across Hazumu one day in her first year of high school, she was shocked to find that she could see most of him clearly, though his face was still a blur. From that point on, Yasuna wanted to learn more about Hazumu and gradually fell in love with him. However, even when Hazumu confessed his love to her in their second year of high school, she rejected him since he was still a boy, and she was afraid that he too would one day disappear from her vision. After Hazumu's transformation into a girl, Yasuna wastes no time trying to rectify her mistake and confesses her love to Hazumu finally, but Hazumu is very confused by this and does not know what to do, especially since her physical change.|$|E

2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so <b>she</b> <b>stumbled</b> toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
