40|$|Value Added Tax (<b>VAT)</b> <b>standard</b> rate Laffer curves are {{estimated}} for the European Union of twenty seven countries (EU 27) {{over the period}} 1995 - 2011, using a twice continuously differentiable VAT revenue quadratic flexible functional form. A business cycle effect on the Laffer curve is found. In recession years, VAT revenue is typically lower, the curve steeper, and the <b>VAT</b> <b>standard</b> rate that maximises VAT revenue slightly smaller than previously. These results can be explained with reference {{to changes in the}} composition of consumption and VAT collection enforcement. A countercyclical <b>VAT</b> <b>standard</b> rate policy (procyclical fiscal policy), observable in a few countries, not only increases the underlying business cycle volatility but may also result in long-term instability of VAT revenue. In 2011, the maximum <b>VAT</b> <b>standard</b> rates in expansion and recession were respectively 22. 0 and 21. 5 per cent. Most of the EU 27 countries were operating in the non-prohibitive range of the curve; although Portugal, with a <b>VAT</b> <b>standard</b> rate of 23 per cent, along with several other countries with similar rates, was already operating in the prohibitive range of the curve. <b>VAT</b> <b>standard</b> rate Laffer curves shifted to the left and maximum <b>VAT</b> <b>standard</b> rates declined during the analysed period. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary derogations granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of VAT based on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both VAT bases and rates among Member States. For the VAT bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the VAT rates, focusing on the statutory <b>standard</b> <b>VAT</b> rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the <b>standard</b> <b>VAT</b> rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT taxable transactions value was taxed at the <b>standard</b> <b>VAT</b> rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the <b>standard</b> <b>VAT</b> rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory <b>standard</b> <b>VAT</b> rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|E

Theory suggests that the collection efficiency is affected by political economy considerations - greater polarization and political instability would reduce the efficiency of the tax collection, and collection is impacted by structural factors affecting the ease of tax evasion (such as urbanization, agriculture share, openness). We evaluate the VAT collection efficiency (VAT revenue over the aggregate consumption divided by the <b>standard</b> <b>VAT</b> rate) in a panel of 44 countries over 1970 - 99. A one standard deviation increase in durability of political regime, and in the ease and fluidity of political participation, increases the VAT collection efficiency by 3. 1 % and 3. 6 %, respectively. A one standard deviation increase in urbanization, trade openness and the share of agriculture, changes the VAT collection efficiency by 12. 7 %, 3. 9 % and - 4. 8 %, respectively.

However, the tax remained to finance the 1970 FIFA World Cup, also held in Mexico. Ironically, the tax remains today in most states, and it must be paid year after year.This tax is variable depending of the car's value, number of cylinders, type of transmission, air conditioning and further features, adding up to a payment of up to 10% of the car's total value.A second tax exists as well when purchasing a new vehicle called Impuesto sobre Automóviles Nuevos or ISAN ("Tax on new cars"), also depending on a vehicle's specifications and cost.
