5|$|The Government of India {{declared}} a national {{disaster in the}} aftermath of the cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction wrought by the cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> led to a heightened risk of communicable disease outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odishan government reported 22,296cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.|$|E

40|$|Historically, <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} to do away with sensory experiences. As in the present phase of modernity the senses are assigned {{a crucial role in the}} perception of risks, a paradigm shift has emerged in the infrastructural provision of energy, water and waste services. This has led to a partial re-localization and resensitization of services. Present systems are designed to make the invisible visible again. This chapter analyzes what these tendencies mean for waste water and sanitation service provision. It outlines the paradigm shifts being made in infrastructural provision and its consequences for the senses, using case studies of sanitation innovation in Europe to illustrate new dynamics in the display and perception of <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Based on a theoretical discussion of sensitization of infrastructural service provisions, a framework is presented for analyzing the possible relationships between senses and sanitation...|$|R
25|$|Factors {{controlling}} the fate and transport of pathogens are quite complex {{and the interaction}} among them is not well understood. If the local hydrogeological conditions (which can vary within a space of a few square kilometres) are ignored, simple on-site <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> such as pit latrines can cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the reason}} for slow {{progress}} in sanitation {{may be due to the}} “urbanization of poverty,” as poverty is increasingly concentrated in urban areas. Migration to urban areas, resulting in denser clusters of poverty, poses a challenge for <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that were not originally designed to serve so many households, if they existed at all.|$|R
25|$|Before the outbreak, Haiti {{suffered}} from relatively poor {{public health and}} <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> As of 2008, 37% of Haiti's population lacked access to adequate drinking water, and 83% lacked improved sanitation facilities. This made Haiti particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of waterborne disease. In January, 2010, a massive earthquake hit Haiti, killing over 100,000 people and further disrupting healthcare and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in the country. In {{the aftermath of the}} earthquake, international workers from many countries arrived in Haiti to assist in the rebuilding effort, including a number of workers from countries where cholera was endemic. This presented an opportunity for cholera to spread to Haiti.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of is the provide sustainable sanitation, especially in developing countries.

50|$|Historically, the {{institutional}} framework has been fragmented and uncertain in Tegucigalpa. SANAA (Servicio Autonomo Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados), the state-run water company, continues {{to own and}} manage Tegucigalpa's water and sewer systems, but is facing steep challenges from its growing institutional uncertainty and reduced investment budget due to the Water Framework Law (2003) that began a decentralization of management duties away from state actors in favor of municipalities. The new General Law on Water (August 2009) continues this process further reducing the role of SANAA. For now though, water resources management in Tegucigalpa remains the responsibility of SANAA. Duties include construction, operation, and management of water infrastructures and water service provision. SANAA is also responsible for the management and operation of the urban water supply and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and programs in Tegucigalpa.|$|R
50|$|Modern Sanitation was a British journal {{published}} in the 20th century. It documented developments in <b>sanitation,</b> water <b>infrastructure,</b> and later building developments and maintenance in Britain, with a particular focus on London.By 1946 it was known as Sanitation, drainage and water supply, but by 1967 it was known as Modern Sanitation and Building Maintenance.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a {{world with}} an {{increasing}} urban population, analysing the construction impacts of <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is necessary for defining the best environmental management strategies. This {{study was conducted to}} assess the impact of barley production on environment under rain fed and watered farming systems in north of Iran. Data was collected using questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with 72 farmers in rural areas during the agricultural year 2011. In watered farming system, total green house gases emissions for barley production were calculated to be 497. 7 kgCO 2 eqha- 1. In rain fed farming system, total green house gases emissions for barley production were calculated to be 372. 6 kgCO 2 eqha- 1 calculated. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies can help to develop this long term perspective, linking performance to minimizing the overall energy consumption, use of resources and emissions...|$|R
40|$|Despite a long {{tradition}} {{on the extent to}} which Romanisation has improved human health, some recent studies suggest that Romanisation in general, and Roman sanitation in particular, may not have made people any healthier, given that in Roman times gastrointestinal parasites were apparently widespread, whilst in the present day such parasites rarely cause diseases. Unfortunately, this novel claim neglects the empirical evidence that worldwide infections in over 1. 5 billion people are caused by ubiquitous foodborne nematodes. Therefore, many may wonder if fossil remains of soil-transmitted helminths have been reported in ancient <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Beneficial access to improved sanitation should always be prioritized, hence how can historical sanitation efforts have ever been harmful? In this short article, a strong plea for caution is given, asking for an augmented nematological record and showing that there is not any evidence against Roman sanitation, neither in the past nor in the present...|$|R
40|$|The 2011 National Nutrition Survey (NNS) in Pakistan {{showed that}} Sindh {{province}} {{continues to have}} some of the worst undernutrition rates in South Asia. For determinants of acute and chronic malnutrition to be better understood, Action Against Hunger (ACF) conducted a Nutrition Causal Analysis (NCA) in two districts of Sindh province, where persistently critical prevalences of wasting were recorded, for example, Dadu district with GAM and SAM rates at 19. 5 per cent and 5. 3 per cent respectively (October 2011). ACF findings confirmed that Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices do not receive the attention required to prevent the irreversible damages caused by undernutrition when occurring during the critical 1, 000 days window. The study also showed a high occurrence of illnesses related to poor access to water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> as well as a high level of poverty paired with the lack of alternative income sources...|$|R
25|$|In {{the entire}} Sub-Saharan region, {{water supply and}} {{sanitation}} coverage in urban areas is almost double the coverage in rural areas, both for water (83% in urban areas, 47% in rural areas) as for sanitation (44% vs. 24%). Yet, the rural areas improve at fast pace, whereas in urban areas the extension of water supply and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> can barely keep up with the fast urban demographic growth.|$|E
25|$|The most {{efficient}} way to transport and deliver potable water is through pipes. Plumbing can require significant capital investment. Some systems suffer high operating costs. The cost to replace the deteriorating water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of industrialized countries may be as high as $200 billion a year. Leakage of untreated and treated water from pipes reduces access to water. Leakage rates of 50% are not uncommon in urban systems.|$|E

Only about 5% use septic tanks and an even smaller proportion is connected to a 43km-sewer network completed in 2006 in the city center and that serves mainly commercial, industrial and institutional clients. The network discharges to a 20-ha stabilization pond in the Kossodo industrial area, which also treats sludge from septic tanks brought in by tankers.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the optimal connection rate (CR) for regional {{waste water treatment}} is a challenge that has recently gained the attention of academia and professional circles throughout the world. We contribute to this debate by proposing a framework for a total cost assessment of <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in a given region for {{the whole range of}} possible CRs. The total costs comprise the treatment and transportation costs of centralised and on-site waste water management systems relative to specific CRs. We can then identify optimal CRs that either deliver waste water services at the lowest overall regional cost, or alternatively, CRs that result from households freely choosing whether they want to connect or not. We apply the framework to a Swiss region, derive a typology for regional cost curves and discuss whether and by how much the empirically observed CRs differ from the two optimal ones. Both optimal CRs may be reached by introducing specific regulatory incentive structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focused {{on the use of}} benthic macroinfauna to assess the {{ecological}} quality status of two specific areas in the Tagus estuary (Portugal), after the improvement in the <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> discharging in those areas. The sampling campaigns were held in summer of 2009, 2010 and 2011 in a set of impact and control stations. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the evolution of spatial and temporal patterns in benthic macroinfauna assemblages' composition. The ecological status of these assemblages was assessed by means of taxa richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity index and AMBI and M-AMBI biotic indices. The results obtained in both study areas seemed to indicate a trend for an improvement in the ecological condition of their benthic macroinfauna assemblages over time, although a consistent pattern was not found in all the analyses performed. When benthic macroinfauna assemblages under analysis are considerably degraded, the multimetric index M-AMBI seems to be more adequate for conducting monitoring studies than the AMBI index. However, the continuation of this work is indispensable to ensure the validity of this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Floods are {{the most}} {{frequent}} natural disasters, representing approximately 35 % {{of the total number}} of reported natural disasters worldwide. They may affect human health through either direct or indirect pathways, resulting in various health impacts whose magnitude, at the population level, will depend on the characteristics of the floods as well as on the environmental, economic, and social contexts of the areas in which these floods occur. Direct health impacts mainly consist of deaths and injuries at the acute phase of floods – mainly flash floods. Epidemics may emerge through indirect pathways; examples include the disruption of water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and overcrowding leading to waterborne and respiratory diseases, and environmental changes producing changes in vector- and rodent-borne disease transmissions. Other indirect effects include mental health problems as well as the worsening of chronic conditions due to disruption in health care and access to medication. This article will cover the most frequent health impacts of floods in light of the lessons and evidence gathered in the past decades about different types of floods and about various socioeconomic and environmental contexts, and apply these evidences for improving mitigation and preparedness among vulnerable populations...|$|R
25|$|Italy {{does not}} invest enough to {{maintain}} its drinking water supply and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> while water and sanitation tariffs are among {{the lowest in the}} European Union. The Galli Law, passed in 1993, aimed at raising the level of investment and to improve service quality by consolidating service providers, making them more efficient and increasing the level of cost recovery through tariff revenues.

25|$|Following the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, the World Bank {{reported}} severe {{damages to}} the water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in the Gaza Strip. Almost all sewage and water pumps were out of operation {{due to a lack}} of electricity and fuel. Spare parts and other maintenance supplies were in urgent need to be replenished.

25|$|Among the {{achievements}} {{is a significant}} increase in access to piped water supply in urban areas (88% to 93%) as well as in rural areas (50% to 74%) between 1990 and 2010. Additionally, a strong nationwide increase in access to improved sanitation (64% to 85%) was observed in the same period. Other achievements include the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> with a National Water Commission as its apex institution; and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as Aguas y Drenaje de Monterrey.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{aspects of}} the epidemiological situation following the November 1980 earthquake disaster in Campania and Basilicata, southern Italy. First, population displacements and the fluctuating state of homelessness after the catastrophe are described. Secondly, the level of medical provision prior to the disaster is assessed and damage caused by the earthquake to the medical care and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is outlined. Thirdly, the publicity given by news media {{to the threat of}} disease is examined and compared with the official government reaction, which took the form of emergency medical provision and intervention against the supposed threat of disease. The national epidemiological surveillance system, which was set up during the aftermath of the disaster, is outlined and some of its results, describing the post-impact epidemiological situation in the disaster zone, are examined. Despite the chaotic situation following the earthquake and the publicity given to the threat of disease outbreaks, there were no serious epidemics and the hospital system was able to cope with the aftermath. The government program of vaccinating survivors and relief volunteers can therefore be seen as an overreaction to the prevailing situation, although continuing disease surveillance was probably a wise precaution. ...|$|R

25|$|Even {{in areas}} of high prevalence, the {{frequency}} and severity of infection is not uniform within communities or families. A small proportion of community members harbour the majority of worms, and this depends on age. The maximum worm burden is at {{five to ten years}} of age, declining rapidly thereafter. Individual predisposition to helminthiasis for people with the same <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and hygiene behavior is thought to result from differing immunocompetence, nutritional status, and genetic factors. Because individuals are predisposed to a high or a low worm burden, the burden reacquired after successful treatment is proportional to that before treatment.|$|E
25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children {{do not have access to}} clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E
25|$|No major {{rehabilitation}} {{works were}} {{carried out in the}} period between 1987 and 2004 and at the time more than 60% of the water distribution infrastructure needed to be replaced.

In 2009 about 120 million USD was allocated for the rehabilitation and development of drinking water systems, and an additional 35 million USD for sewerage. However, according to another source actual government financing to improve water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was insignificant as of 2009, with only USD 10 million spent to improve water supply and USD 1 million to improve sewerage nationally — a mere 0.1% of gross domestic product.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, a comprehensive, data driven, {{mathematical}} model for cholera transmission in Haiti is presented. Along with {{the inclusion of}} short cycle human-to-human transmission and long cycle human-to-environment and environment-to-human transmission, this novel dynamic model incorporates both the reported cholera incidence and remote sensing data from the Ouest Department of Haiti between 2010 to 2014. The model has separate compartments for infectious individuals that include different levels of infectivity to reflect the distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in the population. The environmental compartment, {{which serves as a}} source of exposure to toxigenic V. cholerae, is also modeled separately based on the biology of causative bacterium, the shedding of V. cholerae O 1 by humans into the environment, as well as the effects of precipitation and water temperature on the concentration and survival of V. cholerae in aquatic reservoirs. Although the number of reported cholera cases has declined compared to the initial outbreak in 2010, {{the increase in the number}} of susceptible population members and the presence of toxigenic V. cholerae in the environment estimated by the model indicate that without further improvements to drinking water and <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> intermittent cholera outbreaks are likely to continue in Haiti...|$|R
50|$|Israel has {{continued}} the Ottoman policy of sedentarization of Negev Bedouins. In the 1950s Israel re-settled {{two-thirds of the}} Negev Bedouin {{in an area that}} was under a martial law.

40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>sanitation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is {{increasing}} {{due to a}} rise in the urban population. To meet the need for wastewater collection, the construction of sewer networks must comply with a series of technical parameters that indicate whether a solution is feasible or not. Considering that this construction implies a series of environmental impacts, this study coupled a structural analysis of one linear metre of sewer constructive solutions with their life cycle impacts. Different pipe materials (concrete, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE)) were combined with different trench designs and their environmental performance was assessed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). These solutions complied with technical parameters consisting of traffic loads and pavement conditions, among others. Concrete pipes embedded in granular matter result in fewer environmental impacts, such as Global Warming Potential or Cumulative Energy Demand. Further, re-using the excavated soil results in up to 80 % of environmental savings with respect to extracting new materials. Concerning traffic loads and pavement conditions, failures in plastic pipes could be avoided if these are embedded in concrete. Moreover, the environmental impacts of this solution are similar to those resulting from the substitution of pipes that do not comply with the mechanical requirements of the construction site. Therefore, proper planning is needed to provide cities with sewers that are resilient to time and external loads and reduce the urban environmental impacts...|$|R
