5000|$|... : The M26A2 {{was adopted}} in Israel as the M26, {{and is still}} in use in that country. Its variant added an {{improved}} <b>safety</b> <b>fuze</b> in 2012, aimed to ensure the grenade will not explode if struck by an enemy bullet.|$|E
5000|$|... "The bomb {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel container, painted grey, varnished internally, 3-3/4 in. in diameter, 9 in. high, weighing 6 lb. ... It holds 3½ lb. (about 2 pints) of mustard gas. Bombs will be issued, complete with ejection charges, in boxes of ten weighing 75 lb. The bomb is fitted with a metal lid 2in. deep {{which is a good}} push fit on the body. This lid is fastened to the body by adhesive tape. In the centre of the underside of the lid is a striker for use on the match composition head of the ejection charge. ... At one end of the bomb is a screwed plug. This is the filling plug. In order that any leakage may be readily detected the plug is coated with detector paint. ... When the lid is removed the ejection charge will be seen. It {{consists of}} about 1/7 oz. of gunpowder connected by 32 in. of <b>safety</b> <b>fuze</b> to the match composition head. This length of fuze gives a delay of two minutes. The <b>safety</b> <b>fuze</b> is coiled in concentric circles in a shallow metal saucer and is set in bakelite cement. ... The ejection charge has therefore the appearance of a circular plate 3½ in. in diameter. On the lower side is a threaded boss closed by a tin plate disc. This boss screwes into the bomb, the gunpowder charge being just above the tin plate disc. On the upper side of the ejection charge in the centre there is a flatened projection used for screwing the ejection charge into the bomb. The charge is also housed in the projection. On the rim there is another smaller projection holding the match composition head. The ejection charge is designed to blow out the end of the bomb fitted with the filling plug." ...|$|E
50|$|The W87 design {{includes}} all modern safety features, including insensitive high explosives LX-17 and PBX-9502 (primary component TATB), a fire-resistant pit, and advanced arming and <b>fuzing</b> <b>safety</b> features.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a variant}} of the M67 fitted with the M217 impact <b>fuze</b> and a <b>safety</b> clip on the <b>safety</b> lever. This <b>fuze</b> has an {{electrical}} impact function which arms within 1 to 2 seconds and will detonate the grenade upon impact, and a back-up pyrotechnic delay function which will initiate the grenade after 3 to 7 seconds if the impact function fails. The M68 has the same statistics and markings as the M67 except it has a red-painted fuze and lever to indicate it has an impact fuze.|$|R
40|$|Flash {{technology}} is being utilized in fuzed munition applications and, {{based on the}} development of digital logic devices in the commercial world, usage of flash technology will increase. Antifuse technology, prevalent in non-volatile field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will eventually be phased out as new devices have not been developed for approximately a decade. The reliance on flash technology presents a long-term reliability issue for both DoD and NASA safety- and mission-critical applications. A thorough understanding of the data retention failure modes and statistics associated with Flash data retention is of vital concern to the <b>fuze</b> <b>safety</b> community. A key retention parameter for a flash cell is the threshold voltage (VTH), which is an indirect indicator of the amount of charge stored on the cells floating gate. This paper will present the results of our on-going tests: long-term storage at 150 C for a small population of devices, neutron radiation exposure, electrostatic discharge (ESD) testing, and the trends of large populations (over 300 devices for each condition) exposed to three difference temperatures: 25 C, 125 C, and 150 C...|$|R

Initial test results based on a study of charge loss in flash cells in an FPGA device is presented. Statistical data taken from a small sample set indicates quantifiable charge loss for devices stored at both room temperature and 150 C. Initial evaluation of the distribution of threshold voltage in a large sample set (800 devices) is presented. The magnitude of charge loss from exposure to electrostatic discharge and electromagnetic fields is measured and presented. Simulated data (and measured data as available) resultant from harsh-environment testing (neutron, heavy ion, EMP) is presented...|$|R
40|$|A hazard {{and risk}} {{analysis}} is given for personnel from primary fragments of fast moving and variably oriented high-explosive sources with spatially distributed event probability of a single event, e. g. for conventional threat. The approach assumes scenarios with static person densities on earth's surface. The spatial initiation distribution is described with a probability density function along a curve. The density can be constructed using expert estimates, technical safety analysis of an existing fuzing system or minimal technical <b>safety</b> requirements for <b>fuzing</b> systems. Arena test data are used for dynamic point source launching conditions of representative fragments to compute the physical consequences. Hazard criteria visualize the fragment density. Vulnerability models determine the individual local risk. In addition using the person density collective risks are computed. The individual and collective risks can be compared with various risk criteria, in particular for F-N curves. In a case study the approach is applied to a fuzing system of an artillery shell. Thus the post launch safety and the overhead safety or post safe separation safety taking third party into account are assessed. In this case the hazards and risks of fragments dominate when compared to blast effects. Assessing multiple scenarios the initiation density can be assessed...|$|R
