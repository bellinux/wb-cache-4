5|$|In August 2014, Indonesian {{police and}} {{security}} forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of ISIS, citing that the terrorists planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues in Indonesia. The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of CCTV monitors and {{the implementation of a}} night patrol in and around the temple compound. The jihadist group follows a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Islam that condemns any anthropomorphic representations such as sculptures as idolatry.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by the Taliban {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Sharia. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} {{reflect a}} general philosophical difference between Haredi Judaism, which emphasizes <b>strict</b> <b>interpretations</b> {{in order to}} prevent possible transgressions, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is more likely to utilize leniencies rooted in classical rabbinic sources. The difference has tended to increase the social distance between Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews, as Haredi Jews who follow the <b>stricter</b> <b>interpretation</b> may find themselves unable to pray in some Modern Orthodox synagogues. As a result, and consistent with the general increasing influence of Haredi interpretations, many synagogues in recent years have raised the height of their mechitzot in order to accommodate members and guests who follow <b>stricter</b> <b>interpretations.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Baptists {{established}} the oldest extant churches in Hampshire County. After {{the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, Baptist preachers continued their attempt to gain a foothold in what is now the Eastern Panhandle region. During the Baptists' early growth in Hampshire County, the best known Baptist ministers were John Monroe (1750–1824) and Benjamin Stone (1743–1842). Monroe preached at the North River, Crooked Run, and Patterson's Creek churches during the early 19th century. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher in History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Monroe was a minister for Primitive Baptists, who were adherent to a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Calvinist theology of the Ketocton Association. Monroe probably established a Baptist church {{on the site of the}} present-day Capon Chapel, where he is buried in the church's cemetery. However, other sources claim that a Baptist congregation began gathering at the Capon Chapel site as early as 1756.|$|E
5|$|Aldaris is {{a member}} of the ruling judicator caste of Protoss society; in StarCraft he acts as liaison between the player {{character}} and the Protoss government. He is voiced by Paul Eiding in both StarCraft and Brood War. Aldaris is a fanatical believer in the Khala and does not hesitate to judge others through a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of its tenets. As a result, he is outraged by Tassadar's association with the dark templar, and following the outbreak of war between the judicator caste and the templar caste, commands the government forces against Tassadar. Aldaris captures Tassadar and puts him on trial for crimes of blasphemy and treason, though Tassadar is freed by Fenix, Raynor, and Zeratul. Aldaris later witnesses the rebels successfully penetrate the Zerg's core defenses, and wishes them luck in their final battle against the Overmind. In Brood War, Aldaris reluctantly allies with the dark templar when the Protoss flee Aiur for Shakuras. However, when Sarah Kerrigan is accepted as an ally by dark templar matriarch Raszagal, Aldaris is furious. While Artanis and Zeratul are absent, he discovers Raszagal is being mentally controlled by Kerrigan and instigates a rebellion amongst the Khalai refugees. When his insurrection is thwarted, the judicator tries to explain his actions to Artanis and Zeratul, but is murdered by Kerrigan before he can reveal her involvement.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} and modern hunting uses of Rhodesian Ridgebacks have included everything from upland game birds to larger 'dangerous game'. While the hunting versatility of the breed has served it {{well in the}} field, it has caused much confusion and contention among ridgeback fanciers about what these dogs are, and are not, as hunting companions. Throughout its history, the Rhodesian ridgeback has been a breed of dog that has somewhat defied the <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of most conventional group classification paradigms.|$|E
50|$|Both {{rules were}} more {{aggressive}} variants of similar rule changes later {{made in the}} AFL in 2016: the AFL limited interchanges to ninety per game, and adopted a <b>stricter</b> <b>interpretation</b> of deliberate out of bounds without automatically applying it to all untouched disposals out of bounds.|$|R

25|$|Almeida was {{represented}} by Walter Dorsey again, {{this time in the}} same court in which he normally presided as judge. Against expectations, Dorsey's defense was based on a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the scope of its own court to try the case, filing a writ of habeas corpus based on that Almeida's arrest by state authorities violated the U.S. Constitution, because piracy was a federal crime. Dorsey argued that a state could not implement federal criminal laws despite the Judiciary Act of 1789 in section 33 authorized him to. However, the argument was taken into account and Judge Theodorick Bland declared the detention unconstitutional and ordered the Almeida's release. Bland himself was involved in the business of financing privateering through his brother in law, the postmaster Skinner, and was about to be tried for it.|$|E
25|$|In 1222 {{the first}} {{inhabitants}} of the new monastery, {{under the leadership of}} Abbot Richard, arrived from Halesowen Abbey. They were not monks, instead they were canons regular belonging to the Premonstratensian order (also known as the 'white canons' from the colour of their robes and Norbertines from the name of their founder, St. Norbert). They lived communally, following a very <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Rule of St Augustine, but in addition to engaging in a life of study and prayer within their abbeys, they also had a pastoral mission and served as parish priests ministering to the spiritual needs of the laity. The order was well known for the austerity of the lives led by its members, something that made it — as with the Cistercians — especially popular with wealthy benefactors in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.|$|E
25|$|This {{clash of}} {{perspectives}} led to {{something of a}} stand-off {{and a lack of}} communication between the disciplines, resulting in little cooperation and progress for three decades. The stand-off was resolved by Holland's Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship which re-visited biological inclusive fitness theory to draw a distinction between the statistical evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of social traits and the non-deterministic proximate mechanisms through which they are expressed. In a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the theory, a statistical association of related genes (as would be present in the interactions of close genetic relatives) is understood as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the evolutionary emergence of certain traits relating to social cooperation (see kin selection). However, this does not entail that the proximate mechanisms governing the expression of such social traits in primates and humans necessarily depends on (or are determined by) conditions of genetic relatedness per se. For the vast majority of social mammals—including primates and humans—the formation of social bonds (and the resulting social cooperation) are based on familiarity from an early developmental stage, and the same kinds of mechanisms that attachment theorists (see above) have outlined. In short, in humans and in other primates, genetic relatedness is not necessary for the attachment bonds to develop, and it is the performance of nurture that underlies such bonds and the enduring social cooperation that typically accompanies them (see Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship).|$|E
50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.

50|$|The country's leading {{mosques and}} the Catholic Church {{have tried to}} {{eliminate}} some traditional indigenous practices from their places of worship, instituting practices that reflect a <b>stricter</b> <b>interpretation</b> of sacred texts; however, some Christian and Muslim adherents continue to incorporate traditional practices and rituals, and religious authorities have generally been permissive of such practices.|$|R
500|$|Historian Alan Brinkley {{stated that}} by 1935 the NRA was a [...] "woeful failure, even a {{political}} embarrassment."

500|$|Breyer's {{extensive}} experience in administrative law is accompanied by his staunch defense of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Breyer rejects the <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Sixth Amendment espoused by Justice Scalia that all facts necessary to criminal punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. [...] In many other areas on the Court, too, Breyer's pragmatism is considered the intellectual counterweight to Scalia's textualist philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Implementation of {{the laws}} led to much tension within Texas. [...] Much to the displeasure of the colonists, a new {{military}} post was established in Anahuac to begin collecting customs duties.

500|$|To {{remedy the}} defects {{revealed}} by {{the passage of the}} Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech. Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to [...] "a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it." [...] Freedom of the press was necessary, because [...] "chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression." [...] The Report supported a <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the First Amendment. While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press, but implying that such power existed, Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{belonged to}} the [...] "Doppers"—a group of about 6,000 that {{followed}} an extremely <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of traditional Calvinist doctrine. They based their theology almost entirely on the Old Testament and, among other things, wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from the Psalms. When the 1859 synod of the Nederduits Hervormde Kerk van Afrika (NHK), the main church in the Transvaal, decided to enforce the singing of modern hymns, Kruger led a group of Doppers that denounced the NHK as [...] "deluded" [...] and [...] "false" [...] and left its Rustenburg congregation. They formed the Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika (GK), thereafter known informally as the [...] "Dopper Church", and recruited the Reverend Dirk Postma, a like-minded traditionalist recently arrived from the Netherlands, to be their minister. This act also had secular ramifications as according to the 1858 constitution only NHK members could take part in public affairs.|$|E
500|$|Sackville Street {{was renamed}} O'Connell Street in 1924.

[...] Pressure continued, and in 1926 The Manchester Guardian reported that the Pillar was to be taken down, [...] "as it was a hindrance to modern traffic". Requests for action—removal, destruction or {{the replacement of the}} statue with that of an Irish hero—continued up to the Second World War and beyond; the main stumbling blocks remained the trustees' <b>strict</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the terms of the trust, and the unwillingness of successive Irish governments to take legislative action.
