As he was one day passing Fos's, Mamsell and the Medical Graduate are visible, standing together at the window inside.

The man was a Prince; no Reichshofrath, Speyer-Wetzlar KAMMER, or other Supreme Court, would much trouble itself, except with formal shakings of the wig, about such a peccadillo. In fine, it was better for Leopold to marry the Miss Fos; which he actually did (1698, in his twenty-second year), [...] "with the left-hand,"--and then with the right and both hands; having got her properly ennobled before long, by his splendid military services.

But {{it was not long}} till claim arose on Gylle's part, till war and fight arose between Magnus and him, till the skilful, popular, ever-active and shifty Gylle had entirely beaten Magnus; put out his eyes, mutilated the poor body of him in a horrid and unnamable manner, and shut him up in a convent as out of the game henceforth. There in his dark misery Magnus lived now as a monk; called [...] "Magnus the Blind" [...] by those Norse populations; King Harald Gylle reigning victoriously in his stead. But this also was only for a time. There arose avenging kinsfolk of Magnus, who had no Irish accent in their Norse, and were themselves eager enough to bear rule in their native country. By one of these,--a terribly stronghanded, fighting, violent, and regardless fellow, who also was a Bastard of Magnus Barefoot's, and had been made a Priest, but liked it unbearably ill, and had broken loose from it into the wildest courses at home and abroad; so that his current name got to be [...] "Slembi-diakn," [...] Slim or Ill Deacon, under which he is much noised of in Snorro and the Sagas: by this Slim-Deacon, Gylle was put an end to (murdered by night, drunk in his sleep); and poor blind Magnus was brought out, and again <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as King, or King's Cloak, in hopes Gylle's posterity would never rise to victory more. But Gylle's posterity did, to victory and also to defeat, and were the death of Magnus and of Slim-Deacon too, in a frightful way; and all got their own death by and by in a ditto. In brief, these two kindreds (reckoned to be authentic enough Haarfagr people, both kinds of them) proved now to have become a veritable crop of dragon's teeth; who mutually fought, plotted, struggled, {{as if it had been}} their life's business; never ended fighting and seldom long intermitted it, till they had exterminated one another, and did at last all rest in death. One of these later Gylle temporary Kings I remember by the name of Harald Herdebred, Harald of the Broad Shoulders. The very last of them I think was Harald Mund (Harald of the Wry-Mouth), who gave rise to two Impostors, pretending to be Sons of his, a good while after the poor Wry-Mouth itself and all its troublesome belongings were quietly underground.

A series of tests was initiated to evaluate the comparative weather forecasting and climate simulation skills of the GLAS Fourth Order GCM when the S 1 and Q 3 topographies are applied to the lower boundary. Three sets of Northern Hemispheric winter forecasts at the 2 deg x 2. 5 deg resolution indicate that the Q 3 topography gives slightly better results over the Northern Hemisphere than does the S 1 topography.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{efficient}} data dissemination in wireless sensor and mobile ad hoc networks. In wireless sensor networks we study two problems: (1) construction of virtual backbones and clustering hierarchies to achieve efficient routing, and (2) placement of multiple sinks, where each sensor is at a bounded distance to several sinks, to analyze and process data before sending it to a central unit. Often connected dominating sets {{have been used for}} such purposes. However, a connected dominating set is often vulnerable due to frequent node failures in wireless sensor networks. Hence, to provide a degree of fault-tolerance we consider in problem (1) a 2 -connected (k,r) -dominating set, denoted D(2,k,r), to act as a virtual backbone or a clustering hierarchy, and in problem (2) a total (k,r) -dominating <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as sinks in wireless sensor networks. Ideally, the backbone or the number of sinks in the network should constitute the smallest percentage of nodes in the network. We model the wireless sensor network as a graph. The total (k,r) -dominating set and the 2 -connected (k,r) -dominating set have not been studied in the literature. Thus, we propose two centralized approximation algorithms to construct a D(2,k,r) in unit disk graphs and in general graphs. We also derive upper bounds on the total (k,r) -domination number in graphs of girth at least 2 k+ 1 as well as in random graphs with non-fixed probability p. In mobile ad hoc networks we propose a hexagonal based beacon-less flooding algorithm, HBLF, to efficiently flood the network. We give sufficient condition that even in the presence of holes in the network, HBLF achieves full delivery. Lower and upper bounds are given on the number of forwarding nodes returned by HBLF in a network with or without holes. When there are no holes in the network, we show that the ratio of the shortest path returned by HBLF to the shortest path in the network is constant. We also present upper bounds on the broadcast time of HBLF in a network with or without holes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} increasing economic growth - increasing inputs, such as labour and capital, {{is not always}} possible. The wider, fundamental sources of economic growth {{need to be considered}} too. Foreign aid is a temporary lifeline and does not spur economic growth. Conversely, financial assistance negatively affects growth and can hamper development prospects. Economic freedom and economically freer countries have been associated with higher growth rates, higher per capita incomes, greater volumes of trade, prosperity and overall wellbeing. By improving their economic freedom, deregulating the economy and allowing economic freedom to prosper, countries can experience sustained GDP growth. Previous studies have shown that economic freedom and economic growth are exponentially related - and that by initially becoming freer, countires can increase their growth rates at higher rates. The main objective of the SADC is to achieve development and economic growth, to alleviate poverty and enhance the standard and quality of life for the peoples of Southern Africa. The SADC is attempting to achieve economic integration through macroeconomic convergence. A number of macroeconomic variables have been <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as primary indicators. These include inflation, fiscal balance, public debt and the current account balance. By introducing the concept that economic freedom can lead to higher growth rates and being able to identify economic freedom, it makes it possible to investigate how the SADC can achieve its set goals by becoming freer. By investigating individual components that constitute the overall freedom index, it becomes possible to establish the relationship that exists between this viriable and economic growth. This will illustrate where deregulation and freedom are most effective and where policy decisions need to be highlighted. The 2008 economic crisis revealed that countries that decreased their economic freedom have fared worse than countries allowing freedom to prosper. Government fiscal stimulus has had no positive impact on growth rates; the negative effects of reducing economic freedom will onlky be fully seen in future years. However, the majority of the SADC countries showed a relatively strong fiscal stance during the recession. This study established whether that a positive relationship between economic freedom and economic growth in the SADC. Secondly, the direction of causality that economic freedom leads to economic growth. The findings reveal that economic freedom fosters economic growth in general, and for the SADC in particular. Empirical evidence has been found for the SADC; and the implications of becoming freer are more fully explaine...|$|E
