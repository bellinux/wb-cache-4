Methods Male swiss albino mice, ulcerated with indomethacin (18 mg/kg, p. o., single dose) were treated up to 7 days with different doses of the methanol extract of P. kurroa rhizomes (designated as PK). The healing capacity of the most effective dose of PK (20 mg/kg, p. o. × 3 d) was compared with that of omeprazole (Omez) (3 mg/kg, p. o. × 3 d). The effects of the drug-treatment for one and three days on the biochemical parameters were assessed by comparing the results with that of untreated mice of the 1 st and 3 rd day of ulceration. The stomach tissues of the mice were used for the biochemical analysis. Results The macroscopic indices revealed maximum ulceration on the 3 rd day after indomethacin administration, which was effectively healed by PK.

The diets were offered to pigs on three trials to investigate {{effects on the}} performance of individually (n = 72) and group housed (n = 480) pigs and on nutrient digestibility in pigs housed in metabolizm crates (n = 24). Performance was assessed from 10 wks of age until slaughter and carcass characteristics were measured. For the group performance study, one pig from each pen (in total 24) at 10, 15 wks and at finish were slaughtered to ascertain scores for <b>stomach</b> <b>ulceration,</b> stomach weights and intestinal length. Level of wheat inclusion did not significantly (p> 0. 05) affect liveweight gain (LWG) or feed conversion ratio (FCR). Feed intake was lowest (p< 0. 05) for individually housed pigs offered diets containing 700 g/kg wheat during the 10 – 15 wk period, which indicated that individually housed pigs attempted to eat to a constant energy intake. There was little evidence of <b>stomach</b> <b>ulceration</b> across treatments and increasing wheat inclusion had no detrimental effect. Higher levels of wheat inclusion tended to increase backfat depth at the P 2 position which could lead to increasing grading penalties in a commercial situation although more research is required in this area. Increasing level of wheat inclusion increased digestible energy (DE) content but the lack of effect on FCR and killing out percentage indicated that utilization of energy from barley and wheat was similar.

40|$|The {{effect of}} zinc {{sulphate}} on <b>stomach</b> <b>ulceration</b> produced by ethanol and indomethacin was examined in rats. Oral or intraperitoneal pretreatment with zinc sulphate (20 mg/kg, expressed as zinc ion) strongly prevented ethanol-, but not indomethacin-induced gastric glandular ulceration. Indomethacin given beforehand did not influence the protective action of zinc sulphate against ethanol-evoked lesions. Ethanol decreased histamine levels, whereas indomethacin reduced the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) {{content in the}} gastric glandular mucosa. The alcohol also elevated the histamine content in gastric secretion. Zinc sulphate reversed the ethanol-induced changes in histamine levels in both mucosa and secretion, but did not modify PGE 2 reduction by indomethacin. Zinc sulphate also antagonised protein leakage from the stomach following ethanol administration. It is concluded that gastric ulceration by the currently employed doses of ethanol and indomethacin is caused by different mechanisms. Zinc sulphate prevents histamine-mediated lesions produced by the alcohol, but not ulceration due to PGE 2 depletion by indomethacin. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Materials and methodsThe phytochemical constitution of the extracts was analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Restriction- and cold-induced stress in rats treated for 14 days with 100 or 300 mg/kg of the extracts were used to evaluate parameters such as ulceration, adrenals, thymus and spleen weights, as well as ACTH and corticosterone plasmatic levels. The stress response also was evaluated in mice by self-analgesia induced by restraint stress, after 7 days of treatment at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg. The learning and memory of aged rats treated with extracts of root or branches at the dose of 50 mg/kg for 80 days were evaluated in the elevated T-maze test.

On endoscopic examination the oesophagus was found to be atonic and ulcerated, the cardia was permanently open and the <b>stomach</b> showed extensive <b>ulceration.</b> In addition, the nasal discharge was identified to have a gastric origin (gastroesophageal reflux). The electrolyte and acid-base profiles showed marked hyponatremia (99 mEq/l) and metabolic alkalosis (pH = 7. 46, Strong Ion Difference = 50 mEq/l). The foal was also uremic (plasma creatinine = 12. 6 mg/dl). Although the foal experienced an improvement in its hydroelectrolytic status after treatment with 7. 5 % NaCl for 36 h, the owner requested eutha-nasia. The foal described here developed severe hyponatremia and hyposmolarity but, contrary to most reported cases, showed metabolic alkalosis instead of metabolic acidosis. Another interesting feature of this case is the lack of overt neurologic signs in the face of extreme hyposmolarity.

It was found that experimental influenza virus infection is accompanied with significant changes in gastric mucosal integrity, as well as an increase in the products of lipid peroxidation in the stomachs of mice. Preliminary exposure of mice to immobilization stress and subsequent inoculation of influenza virus did not significantly influence gastric ulceration or lipid peroxidation compared with infected mice. Cold stress resulted in a significant decrease in the index of <b>stomach</b> <b>ulceration</b> and did not influence the fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation and MDA compared with infected animals. The simultaneous application of cold-restraint stress and influenza virus infection provoked synergism in the activity of all factors on the parameters under investigation.

In Exp. 2, 120 pigs (121 lb average initial body wt) were fed a pelleted wheat-soybean meal-based diet (355 μm mean particle size for the wheat) during a 64 -d growth assay. Treatments were: 1) control; 2) 1 % added NaHCO 3; and 3) 1 % added potassium bicarbonate (KHCO 3). Average daily gain, feed intake, feed/gain, backfat thickness, stomach keratinization score, plasma urea N concentration, and digestibilities of dry matter and nitrogen were not affected by treatment. However, addition of NaHCO 3 and KHCO 3 tended to decrease the incidence of ulcers and increased the digestibility of gross energy. These data indicate that a 1 % addition of either NaHCO 3 or KHCO 3 may help to reduce the severity of gastric ulcers in finishing pigs without adversely affecting growth performance or nutrient digestibility...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the presence of Helicobacter (H.) spp. in swine affected by gastric <b>ulceration.</b> <b>Stomachs</b> from 400 regularly slaughtered swine were subjected to gross pathological examination to evaluate the presence of gastric ulcers. Sixty-five samples collected from ulcerated pars esophagea and 15 samples from non-ulcerated pyloric portions were submitted to histopathological and molecular analyses, to detect Helicobacter spp., H. suis and H. pylori by PCR. Feces and saliva swabs were also collected from 25 animals in order to detect in vivo the presence of Helicobacter spp [...] Gastric ulcers were detected in 373 cases (93 %). The presence of ulcers in association with inflammatory processes was further confirmed by histological examination. Forty-nine percent (32 / 65) of the ulcerated esophageal portions as well as 53 % (8 / 15) of the non-ulcerated pyloric portions were positive for Helicobacter spp. by PCR. The Helicobacter spp. positive samples were also positive for H. suis, while H. pylori was not detected. These results were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. With regard to feces and saliva samples, 15 / 25 (60 %) and 16 / 25 (64 %) were positive for Helicobacter spp. PCR, respectively but all were negative in H. suis and H. pylori specific PCR...|$|R
40|$|Naproxen {{is widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of arthritic pain. It can induce gastrointestinal (GI) side effects ranging from <b>stomach</b> irritation to <b>ulceration</b> and bleeding. These complications are believed to be determined from the combined effect of the blockage of prostaglandin biosynthesis in the GI tract and direct action of free carboxylic groups. Prodrugs approach have been proposed to overcome the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) side effects by masking the carboxylic acid groups via formation of bioreversible bonds. It has been demonstrated that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important pathogenic role in gastrointestinal ulceration. Our goal was to develop a new Naproxen prodrug which integrates the concepts of prodrug and the beneficial antioxidant effect. For this purpose we designed and synthesized naproxen esters containing tocopherols. Among the possible antioxidant compounds we focused our attention on �-tocopherol for its potent antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, esterification of phenolic group on chroman ring of tocopherols, to form the prodrug, is expected to increase the stability to oxidation of the vitamin. In the present paper, we report the synthesis and the in vitro enzymatic and non-enzymatic hydrolysis of two prodrug esters of naproxen with �- and �-tocopherols. We also investigated the oral pharmacokinetic in rabbit and probed the preliminary pharmacological evaluation in rat. The synthesized prodrugs exhibited antiinflammatory activity with a strong and significant reduction in gastrolesivity...|$|R
40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: Heteropterys tomentosa: A. Juss (Malpighiaceae), {{commonly}} mistaken as Heteroptezys aphrodisiaca, is chronically {{used by the}} Brazilian {{population to}} improve general health due to its claimed protective effects against {{a wide range of}} medical conditions. Aim of the study: This study in rodents aimed to verify the adaptogenic potential of the hydroalcoholic extracts of the roots (the most commonly used portion), branches and leaves of the plant. Materials and methods: the phytochemical constitution of the extracts was analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Restriction- and cold-induced stress in rats treated for 14 days with 100 or 300 mg/kg of the extracts were used to evaluate parameters such as ulceration, adrenals, thymus and spleen weights, as well as ACTH and corticosterone plasmatic levels. the stress response also was evaluated in mice by self-analgesia induced by restraint stress, after 7 days of treatment at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg. the learning and memory of aged rats treated with extracts of root or branches at the dose of 50 mg/kg for 80 days were evaluated in the elevated T-maze test. Results: the chemical constituents of the three parts of the plant were relatively similar in the presence of saponins, hydrolysable tannins, flavonoids, polyphenols and triterpenes. None of the three extracts were capable of protecting the <b>stomach</b> from <b>ulcerations</b> in rats submitted to cold restraint stress or protecting from alterations in adrenal or spleen weight (p > 0. 05). Furthermore, the extracts did not inhibit increases in plasma levels of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Moreover, the extracts did not inhibit self-analgesia induced by restraint stress in mice and did not improve the performance of aged rats in the T-maze test (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: the tests employed in this study did not show evidence of adaptogenic activity in the three extracts of Heteropterys tomentosa. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
