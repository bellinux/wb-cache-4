40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 46 - 51. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Literature review [...] Chapter 3. Methods [...] Chapter 4. Results [...] Chapter 5. Discussion and conclusions. The {{distance}} that users need {{to walk to}} public <b>litter</b> <b>bins</b> is a strong predictor of littering behaviour. However, there is limited research that combines the spatial allocation of bins and users' preferences on access to <b>litter</b> <b>bins.</b> The goal of my thesis was to optimise the number and location of public <b>litter</b> <b>bins</b> by assessing the distance users are willing to walk to bins and incorporating these distances in a network analysis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales was the case study area. 200 face-to-face surveys were conducted to ascertain user opinion on the distances {{they were willing to}} walk to bins. I used the survey outputs to deveop 56 scenarios that provide managers of waste with a range of options to meet demand and user preferences, including allocating additional bins to the current distribution, redistributing bins and reducing the number of bins. I found that most users were willing to walk between 38 and 80 metres. Due to the heterogeneity of population distribution, I found that the most appropriate network analysis tools were maximise attendance and target market share. The approach I developed could be used to optimise the number and location of public <b>litter</b> <b>bins</b> at other locations of similar scale.
