2500|$|After the war Carrick quickly re-established {{his yard}} in Edinburgh and again began exhibiting at the RSA with 'Jock' and 'With Bayonet and Bomb'. [...] During {{the period from}} 1920 until around 1926 he was heavily {{involved}} in war memorial work. [...] Carrick was a <b>stone</b> <b>carver</b> and preferred working in freestone, especially Doddington stone quarried in the Cheviots. [...] War memorials featuring his carved sculptures include Lochawe, Killin, Oban, St Margaret's Hope, Kinghorn, Newburgh and Auchtermuchty. [...] He later received a commission from the South African Scottish Regimental Association to carve {{a copy of the}} Killin soldier for their own memorial which stands in Burghers Park in Pretoria. [...] Carrick also executed figures in bronze, including the figures of soldiers for the Dornoch, Forres, Blairgowrie and Walkerburn war memorials, and allegorical figures including 'Winged Victory' for Berwick Upon Tweed and 'Justice Guiding Valour' for the Fraserburgh memorial. [...] Despite being heavily engaged in this work, he did execute some other commissions in the early 1920s including carving the stone figures of 'The Leopard', 'The Vulture', and 'The Kangaroo' for the Animal Wall extension at Cardiff Castle, and the tomb featuring the recumbent figure of Walter Campbell of Lochawe in Saint Conan's Kirk.|$|E
2500|$|Birmingham is {{the only}} English city outside London to have an {{unbroken}} tradition of sculpture production extending back to the mid-18th century. [...] The town's sculpture workshops developed from earlier local traditions of working in stone and metal: {{there is evidence of}} stonemasons working in Birmingham {{as far back as the}} 14th century; richly ornamented sculptural metalwork was being produced in the town from the 17th century onwards; and humanistic small-scale figurative sculpture can be seen in the silverware and pattern books of Matthew Boulton from the 1750s. The first recognisably fine art <b>stone</b> <b>carver</b> was Edward Grubb of Birmingham, who was producing ecclesiastic carvings and statuary in Birmingham by 1769. The growth of Birmingham sculpture over the following decades was rapid, and by 1829 the majority of the 49 pieces of sculpture exhibited in the town's exhibitions that year came from local artists. The leading Birmingham sculptor of the Midlands Enlightenment, however, was Peter Hollins, who took over the studio of his father William Hollins in the Jewellery Quarter and produced over sixty major works. Hollins studied under Francis Chantrey in the early part of his career and his best work is considered the equal to that of Chantrey, although he was less famous at least partly because of being based outside London.|$|E

5000|$|Memory {{and history}} {{are the big}} players within The <b>Stone</b> <b>Carvers.</b> The {{building}} of the Vimy Memorial is mirrored {{in the construction of}} Father Gstir's church in Shoneval, and the castle of Bavarian King Ludwig II; thus [...] "de-centring" [...] the dominant history of the great victory of Vimy Ridge, and exhibiting the equivalence that these stories play in generating Canadian identity. This, along with the use of many character's various experiences with Vimy Ridge and World War I, Urquhart articulates the idea of memory and history being a [...] "process" [...] where [...] "the meanings of past events continue to change as time progresses." [...] Critics often use the term post-memory within analysis of The <b>Stone</b> <b>Carvers.</b> This term is coined by Marianne Hirsh, explained as a relationship between generations where the later generation is [...] "transmitted" [...] memories from the previous generation by way of stories, etcetera; however, these memories resonate deeply within the subsequent generation so that they feel like they have experienced it themselves. Post-memory within The <b>Stone</b> <b>Carvers</b> is evident from the very beginning as Urquhart outlines [...] "The nuns and the one spinster clung to the story, as if by telling the tale they became witnesses, perhaps even participants" [...] in the creation of Shovenal.|$|R
