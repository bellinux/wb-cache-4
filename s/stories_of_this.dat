5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year 2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man {{suffering}} from amnesia after having been critically wounded by assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> game and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} European/Asian Minor {{references to}} a vegetarian diet occur in Homer (Odyssey 9, 82–104) and Herodotus (4, 177), who mention the Lotophagi (Lotus-eaters), an indigenous {{people on the}} North African coast, who according to Herodotus lived on nothing but the fruits of a plant called lotus. Diodorus Siculus (3, 23–24) transmits tales of vegetarian peoples or tribes in Ethiopia, and further <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind are narrated and discussed in ancient sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of Shanna the She-Devil into Ka-Zar’s supporting cast changes Morse’s {{role in the}} <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period. Ka-Zar expresses clear attraction to the more jungle-friendly Shanna from the outset and Morse is cast as the secondary love interest. This dynamic is most notable in Morse’s lone appearance in the Ka-Zar strip in the black-and-white magazine Savage Tales (#8; Jan. 1975). Written by Gerry Conway, the story depicts Morse leading Shanna {{and a group of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into the Savage Land where they work with Ka-Zar to neutralise a threat to world security. During the course of the adventure Morse realises that Ka-Zar’s affections lie with Shanna. This story, first published in late-1974, is the last in which Morse appears as a Ka-Zar supporting character.|$|E

25|$|When {{the reading}} {{audience}} of superhero comic books became predominately young {{boys in the}} mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving extraterrestrials, fantasy creatures, and bizarre plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul and a man from the future. All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Though outnumbered, Geronimo {{fought against}} both Mexican and United States troops and became {{famous for his}} daring {{exploits}} and numerous escapes from capture from 1858 to 1886. One such escape, as legend has it, {{took place in the}} Robledo Mountains of southwest New Mexico. The legend states that Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. soldiers waited outside the entrance for him, but he never came out. Later, it was heard that Geronimo was spotted outside, nearby. The second entrance through which he escaped has yet to be found and the cave is still called Geronimo's Cave, even though no reference to this event or this cave has been found in the historic or oral record. Moreover, there are many <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other Apaches entered to escape troops, but were not seen exiting. These stories are in all likelihood apocryphal.|$|E

25|$|Ulster: The Ulaid proper {{were in a}} sorry state {{all during}} this era, being {{squeezed}} between the emergent Ó Neill of Tír Eógain in the west, the MacDonnells, Clann Aodha Buidhe, and the Anglo-Normans from the east. Only Mag Aonghusa managed to retain {{a portion of their}} former kingdom with expansion into Iveagh. The two great success <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> era were Ó Domhnaill of Tír Chonaill and Ó Neill of Tír Eógain. Ó Domhnaill was able to dominate much of northern Connacht to the detriment of its native lords, both Old English and Gaelic, though it took time to suborn the likes of Ó Conchobhair Sligigh and Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne. Expansion southwards brought the hegemony of Tír Eógain, and by extension Ó Neill influence, well into the border lordships of Louth and Meath. Mag Uidir of Fear Manach would slightly later be able to build his lordship up to that of third most powerful in the province, {{at the expense of the}} Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne and the MacMahons of Airgíalla.|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{compares the}} book to Alice in Wonderland in that both {{children}} and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongside Flatland, Phantastes, and The Wind in the Willows. W. H. Auden, in his review of the sequel The Fellowship of the Ring calls The Hobbit [...] "one of the best children's <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century". Auden was later to correspond with Tolkien, and they became friends. The Hobbit was nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction of the year (1938). More recently, the book has been recognized as [...] "Most Important 20th-Century Novel (for Older Readers)" [...] in the Children's Books of the Century poll in Books for Keeps.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, both Thrilling Wonder and Startling Stories began to publish much more mature fiction {{than they had}} during the war, and {{although}} Astounding was still the leading magazine in the field, {{it was no longer}} the only market for the writers who had been regularly selling to Campbell. [...] Many of the best new writers still broke into print in Astounding rather than elsewhere. [...] Arthur C. Clarke's first story, [...] "Loophole", appeared in the April 1946 Astounding, and another British writer, Christopher Youd, began his career with [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] in February 1949. [...] Youd would become much better known under his pseudonym [...] "John Christopher". [...] William Tenn's first sale, [...] "Alexander the Bait", appeared in May 1946, and H. Beam Piper's [...] "Time and Time Again" [...] in the April 1947 issue was his first story. [...] Along with these newer writers, Campbell was still publishing strong material by authors who had become established during the war. [...] Among the better-known <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> era are [...] "Vintage Season", by C.L. Moore (under the pseudonym Lawrence O'Donnell); Jack Williamson's story [...] "With Folded Hands"; The Players of Null-A, van Vogt's sequel to The World of Null-A; and the final book in E.E.

2500|$|Nineteenth century Gothic {{horror stories}} drew on {{previous}} folklore and legend {{to present the}} theme of the werewolf in a new fictional form. An early example is Hugues, the Wer-Wolf by Sutherland Menzies published in 1838. In another, Wagner the Wehr-Wolf (1847) by G. W. M. Reynolds, we find the classic subject of a man who, although a kind-hearted man himself, accepts a deal with the devil to become a werewolf for 18 months accompanying Dr. Faustus and killing humans, in exchange for youth and wealth. [...] "The Man-Wolf" [...] (1831) by Leitch Ritchie yields the werewolf in an 11th-century setting, while Catherine Crowe penned what {{is believed to be the}} first werewolf short story by a woman: [...] "A Story of a Weir-Wolf" [...] (1846). Other werewolf <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period include The Wolf Leader (1857) by Alexandre Dumas and Hugues-le-Loup (1869) by Erckmann-Chatrian.|$|E

The quantity of letters that poured into the Mansion House suggests that the stories were widespread in suburban London. One writer said several young women in Hammersmith had been frightened into [...] "dangerous fits" [...] and some [...] "severely wounded by a sort of claws the miscreant wore on his hands". Another correspondent claimed that in Stockwell, Brixton, Camberwell and Vauxhall several people had died of fright and others had had fits; meanwhile, another reported that the trickster had been repeatedly seen in Lewisham and Blackheath.|$|E
