5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the <b>shop</b> <b>floor.</b> After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
25|$|Following their purchase, Roach {{was given}} the task of {{promoting}} the business while his three partners attended to management of the <b>shop</b> <b>floor.</b> Roach began by touting for custom piecework, his first sale being for cast grate bars for a Brooklyn distillery.|$|E
25|$|Hills {{made enough}} funds {{available}} {{for the formation of}} the team, posting flyers and leaflet to the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> as well as the Ironworks Gazette, and saw a fine opportunity to take up the ground rent of the recently dissolved Old Castle Swifts at Hermit Road.|$|E

25|$|Bob White plays a {{major role}} in the 1985 {{documentary}} film Final Offer by Sturla Gunnarsson and Robert Collison. It shows the 1984 contract negotiations with General Motors that led to the CAW's birth and split from the UAW. It examines life on the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> of a car factory along with the art of collective bargaining.|$|E
25|$|Often grouped {{together}} with propaganda as agitprop, agitation {{is the use}} of agitators to stir up discontent both real and imagined with the regime and to propose a course of action to right these perceived wrongs. The traditional targets of agitators have been the <b>shop</b> <b>floor,</b> students' unions and the junior officer's mess halls of the military.|$|E
25|$|CAW President Bob White plays a {{major role}} in the 1985 {{documentary}} film: Final Offer by Sturla Gunnarsson & Robert Collision. It follows the 1984 contract negotiations with General Motors that saw the CAW's birth, and split with the UAW. It's an interesting look at life on the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> of a car factory, along with the art of business negotiation.|$|E
5000|$|... offers {{office space}} in three {{separate}} plazas built on {{an area of}} 180000 m2, each having 17 office floors. In addition, there are three <b>shopping</b> <b>floors.</b> Its parking lot is capable of 1,700 cars.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, the {{shopping}} mall had three floors with a food court occupying most of the lower floor. Later renovations converted that <b>shopping</b> <b>floor</b> into a second floor of parking garage.|$|R
50|$|Phil Katz {{graduated}} from the Computer Science Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. After his graduation, {{he was hired by}} the Allen-Bradley company as a programmer. He wrote code to run programmable logic controllers, which operated manufacturing equipment on <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> worldwide for Allen-Bradley's customers.|$|R
25|$|Larry Johns was the E.V.P. and CFO. As Chief Financial Officer Larry Johns was {{primarily}} responsible for managing the 250-employee company’s cash flow as well as communicating the team’s strategic direction for execution from the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> to the racetrack. Johns previously served as CFO of PPI Motorsports, LLC and prior to that owned his own business for almost a decade.|$|E
25|$|Finally, every Partner {{receives}} an annual bonus, {{which is a}} share of the profit. It is calculated as a percentage of salary, with the same percentage for everyone, from top management down to the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> and storage rooms. The bonus is dependent on the profitability of the Partnership each year, varying between 6% and 20% of the Partners' annual salaries since 2000.|$|E
25|$|A {{statute of}} worker’s rights that was drafted and pushed into {{enactment}} in 1970 by the Socialist labour minister Giacomo Brodolini, greatly strengthened {{the authority of}} the trade unions in the factories, outlawed dismissal without just cause, guaranteed freedom of assembly and speech on the <b>shop</b> <b>floor,</b> forbade employers to keep records of the union or political affiliations of their workers, and prohibited hiring except through the state employment office.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} at Aroor {{is capable of}} manufacturing yachts up to 25 meters. It has a fully air-conditioned fibre-reinforced plastic molding shop. It also has carpentry shop and machine <b>shop.</b> The <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> are designed for line production. In addition to its manufacturing operations, Bristol Boats also offer repair and retrofitting services.|$|R
50|$|WeldPrint for {{arc welding}} became {{available}} in mid-2001. About 70 units {{have been deployed}} since 2001, about 90% of them used on the <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> of automotive manufacturing companies and of their suppliers. Industrial users include Lear (UK), Unidrive, GM Holden, Air International and QTB Automotive (Australia). Units have been leased to Australian companies such as Rheem, Dux, and OneSteel for welding evaluation and process improvement.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} four main <b>shopping</b> <b>floors.</b> The top three levels have large openings (protected by decorative cast-iron railings) that allow natural light from the ceiling to illuminate the lower floors. Much of the tilework, especially under the central dome, is original, and the remainder {{is in keeping with}} the original style. Underground arcades lead south to Town Hall railway station and north to the Myer building.|$|R
25|$|This was {{generally}} well received {{by both the}} stock market and the media. Immediate plans included laying off headquarters staff over 750, and the recruitment of around <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> staff over 3,000, {{to improve the quality of}} service and the firm's main problem: stock availability. The aim would be to increase sales revenue by £2.5billion by the financial year ending March 2008. Another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality.|$|E
25|$|Once {{back from}} the military, Smirnov also {{continued}} the correspondence courses he had begun in the early 1960s, receiving a degree from the Zaporizhia Machine-Building Institute in 1974. Meanwhile, {{he worked his way}} up from the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> to be an assistant director of one of the shops of the Novaia Kakhovska Machine-Building Factory. With his college diploma, Smirnov continued to be promoted. He soon became the shop director, then assistant to the factory's chief industrial upgrades and new technologies engineer and finally an assistant director.|$|E
25|$|Where the IWW did win strikes, {{such as in}} Lawrence, {{they often}} {{found it hard to}} hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained {{collective}} bargaining agreements and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss on the <b>shop</b> <b>floor.</b> It proved difficult, however, to maintain that sort of revolutionary enthusiasm against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees' resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers, so long as they would not undermine any strike.|$|E
40|$|Cycle time {{reduction}} in manufacturing using a scientific data management system E-manufacturing enables immediate {{communication between the}} various islands of <b>shop</b> <b>floors,</b> corporate business systems and laboratory information management systems so that the entire enterprise can react together to solve problems. Going paperless in manufacturing can allow one to manage the master data across the enterprise’s physical boundaries. What is needed is an application-independent, non-invasive data management system for the lab, the plant and beyond...|$|R
50|$|The city draws {{large numbers}} of {{shopping}} tourists from countries within the region. When new planned retail developments are completed, Tallinn will have almost 2 square metres of <b>shopping</b> <b>floor</b> space per inhabitant. As Estonia is already ranked third in Europe in terms of shopping center space per inhabitant, ahead of Sweden and being surpassed only by Norway and Luxembourg, it will further improve {{the positions of the}} city as the major centre of shopping.|$|R
30|$|In SOCRADES framework, it uses DPWS [15] {{to provide}} the {{functionality}} of embedded devices as service. DPWS is a subset of Web service standards (such as WSDL and SOAP) that allow minimal interaction with Web services running on embedded devices. Moreover, SOCRADES provides service bus and business process middleware upon which sophisticated production processes can be modeled and support connecting SDs, i.e., intelligent production machines from manufacturing <b>shop</b> <b>floors,</b> to high-level back-end systems such as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, the {{business}} introduced a 'Mystery Shopper' programme to score its branches {{on the service}} they provide. The mystery shopper grades the branch on its presentation and on the service the branch provides at its service counters, checkouts, wine department and <b>shop</b> <b>floor.</b> In more recent times however, the unpopular mystery shopper programme is being phased out in favour of a customer feedback system called 'Measuring the Magic'. Customers are given a card which directs them to the Waitrose Experience website. In return for grading various areas of their shopping experience, customers are entered into a monthly £500 prize draw. The new system hopes to give feedback tailored to each instance of customer-partner contact, instead of being based on strict criteria.|$|E
25|$|SPD governments also {{introduced}} {{unemployment insurance benefits}} for all workers (in 1918), trade union recognition and an eight-hour workday, while municipalities that came under SPD control or influence expanded educational and job-training opportunities and set up health clinics. Off the <b>shop</b> <b>floor,</b> Social Democratic workers {{took advantage of the}} adult education halls, public libraries, swimming pools, schools, and low-income apartments built by municipalities during the Weimar years, while considerable wage increases won for the majority of workers by the Free Trade Unions between 1924 and 1928 helped to narrow the gap between unskilled and skilled workers. A number of reforms were also made in education, as characterised by the introduction of the four-year common primary school. Educational opportunities were further widened by the promotion of adult education and culture. The SPD also played an active and exemplary {{role in the development of}} local politics in thousands of towns and communities during this period. In 1923, the SPD Minister of Finance, Rudolf Hilferding, laid much of the groundwork for the stabilization of the German currency.|$|E
25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal Emission Control Law established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the Labour Management Act (1971) granted workers co-determination on the <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended co-determination at the factory level. This Act acknowledged {{for the first time}} the presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E

30|$|Several {{heuristics}} and hybrid {{methods are}} recommended {{in the literature}} (Jourdan et al. 2009). Ribas et al. (2010) have classified the approximate methods into constructive and improvement heuristics. However, the application of heuristic algorithms {{is believed to be}} more applicable for real <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> due to their lower computations, but they are still limited by the dimension of problems and uncertainties. Therefore, their implementation should be coupled with some decision support tools to aid the production planners (Ross and Bernardo 2011; Sotiris et al. 2008).|$|R

500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to {{understand}} the relationship between management control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers over their own labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] On the <b>shop</b> <b>floor,</b> workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had to find their own ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.|$|E

50|$|The {{factories}} of South Korea employ {{hundreds of}} thousands of young women on <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> and assembly lines making, among other things, textiles and clothes, shoes, and electronic components. South Koreas economic success was bought in large measure with the sweat of these generally overworked and poorly paid female laborers. In the offices of banks and other service enterprises, young women working as clerks and secretaries are indispensable. Unlike their sisters on Cheju Island, however, the majority of these women work only until marriage.|$|R
