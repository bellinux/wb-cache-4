40|$|In the {{publication}} prepared in 2006 with the above title (TWRI. TR- 287), we described ways to diagnose salt problems which affect irrigated production of pecans. We also discussed {{the concepts of}} minimizing soil salinization, and ways to lower soil salinity. However, the materials presented were general and introductory in nature. This article is to supplement the previous publication with technical details, and practices of <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> during the routine irrigation as well as <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> irrigation for restoration. The aim of <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> is to keep soil salinity of the root zone below the level that trees can tolerate. The threshold salinity of irrigated pecans is {{in the range of}} 2 to 3 dS m- 1 when measured in the soil saturation extract (Fig. 1), which is an official method of measuring soil salinity (Miyamoto et al., 1986). In the areas rich in gypsum, trees may tolerate higher levels of soil salinity, probably by 1 or 2 dS m- 1. Calcium and sulfate ions are less harmful to pecan trees than sodium and chloride ions (Miyamoto et al., 1985). There are basically two ways to approach the task of <b>salt</b> <b>leaching.</b> The first approach is to maintain leaching following each irrigation so as to keep soil salinity in check. The first half of this article is devoted for describing ways to minimize soil salinization through this approach. The second approach is to let salts accumulate in portions of the orchards, then to flush salts out during the dormant period. This approach takes the reality into account; soil salinity levels vary widely even in a small orchard, and that it is more convenient to carry out leaching during the dormant period. Once a part of the orchard begins to be salinized, (meaning that soil salinity exceeds the threshold salinity level), growers need to carry out <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> irrigation for restoration. When dealing with restoration, the causes of salinization have to be identified prior to deciding the methods of <b>salt</b> <b>leaching.</b> This Fig. 1 Trunk cross-section as affected by salinity or Na concentrations in the soil saturation extract (Miyamoto, 1986). subject is discussed {{in the second part of}} this article...|$|E
40|$|Many sports fields {{developed}} in the El Paso Valley and some in uplands became salinized when irrigated with water containing 800 to 1, 200 mg/L of dissolved salts. The soil types, which were salinized, include compacted soils, clayey Entisols, stony sediments along foothills, and some areas containing an indurated calcic horizon. Salinity of these soils was initially less than 3 dS m- 1 in the saturation extract, and has increased over {{a decade or two}} in excess of 10 dS m- 1, sufficient to deter growth of most turf grass species. The study reported here was preformed for evaluating various mechanical means of improving soil permeability for enhancing <b>salt</b> <b>leaching.</b> Observation included two municipal parks consisting of sandy alluvial soils, five sports fields consisting of clayey alluvial soils, sports fields consisting of topdressed stony alluvial soils or developed on an indurated calcic horizon through topsoiling. The equipment tested included a rotary tiller, a vibratory spike, aerifiers, a minimum-till surface chisel, a subsoiler, a backhoe, and a front-end loader. Field management practices were left to discretion of cooperators. Soil salinity and photo records of turf response were used as the primary means of the treatment impact. The most significant reduction in soil salinity was found when stratified silty clay was either inverted to the new profile sequence of loamy sand over the fractured silty clay clods or mixed with the loamy sand layer below. Replacement of clays with sandy soils in a corrugated surface to permit lateral drainage was also highly effective in <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> in deep clay. Subsoiling of Glendale and Saneli silty clay loam followed by topdressing with a thin layer of sand also resulted in good <b>salt</b> <b>leaching,</b> especially when flood-irrigated using the Rio Grande water. The subsoiling shanks penetrated 20 to 30 inches deep, or almost to {{the full extent of the}} clay layer. It is uncertain if <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> can be improved when used in deeper clay, such as Tigua silty clay. The use of minimum-till shallow chisels provided an excellent fracturing of the surface clay layer (6 to 8 inches deep), but <b>salt</b> <b>leaching</b> was limited due to internal drainage impairment. The use of aerifiers did not improve <b>salt</b> <b>leaching,</b> at least at our test sites. Nonetheless, surface implements, especially minimumtill shallow chisels can be used advantageously for renovation or for sustaining high use fields consisting of loam. These preliminary test results are consistent with an earlier finding that soil salinization problems are closely tied with clayey soil textures. Test results also indicate that drainage impairment caused by the clay layer is probably as common as the difficulties with water intake for leaching salts. Since soil improvement measures to be used depend upon soil type, the field should be surveyed for soil type and its distribution prior to planning soil improvement activities. Irrigation systems and scheduling should also be checked. The primary goal of soil improvement activities is to improve soil permeability, water movement and <b>salt</b> <b>leaching,</b> and must be complemented by prudent turf management practices to obtain turf response. There is a need to examine the existing codes or specifications for construction of new fields for improved <b>salt</b> <b>leaching.</b> The current construction codes for sports fields emphasize soil strength and stability, but not <b>salt</b> <b>leaching...</b>|$|E
