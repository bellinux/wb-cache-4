40|$|Fisheries {{science is}} {{a branch of}} marine science that deals with studies on the life history and state of fish stocks. The term ‘life history’ refers to the general biology of a fish stock (e. g. when/where do the fish spawn? How fast do they grow?). The term ‘state of a fish stock’ refers to the number and weight of fish <b>in</b> the <b>stock</b> (i. e. current <b>stock</b> biomass <b>in</b> <b>tonnes).</b> The overall aim of {{fisheries}} science is to provide information to managers on the state and life history of the stocks. This information feeds into the decision making process. Fisheries science, economic, social and political considerations all {{have an impact on}} the final management decision.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{hatchery}} and culture techniques of the sea cucumber, Holothuria scabra, from India. Larvae and juveniles were produced {{for the first time}} in 1988 at the Research Centre of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute of Tuticorin on the south eastern coast of India. Large, healthy and uninjured specimens were selected as broodstock. They were <b>stocked</b> <b>in</b> one <b>tonne</b> tanks <b>in</b> the hatchery. Mud from the natural habitat was collected and put at the bottom of the tanks for the sea cucumbers to bury. The seawater in the tank was changed daily and the bottom mud was changed every fortnight. Sea cucumbers were subjected to thermal stimulation during March-May, the major breeding peak, and also during November-December, the minor breeding peak...|$|R
40|$|India {{is a major}} emitter of mercury, a {{pollutant}} {{of global}} importance. However, quantitative information on mercury flows {{in the country is}} lacking. Here, we quantify major transfer pathways for anthropogenic mercury, its emissions to the environment (air, water, soil), and storage in consumer products and anthropogenic sinks (e. g., landfills) in India in the period 2001 – 2020, and evaluate the potential influence of six pollution control measures. Total mercury emissions in India were approximately 415 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2001, 310 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2010, and are projected to rise to 540 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2020. In 2010, 76 % of these emissions went to the atmosphere. The most important emission sources to atmosphere are coal power plants and zinc production. Pesticides were the most important source for emissions to soil in 2005 and dental amalgam in later years. Mercury <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> products rose from 700 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2001 to 1125 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2010, and in landfills and ash-made structures (e. g., embankments) from 920 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2001 to 1450 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 2010. These <b>stocks</b> are expected to rise further and may be regarded as stored toxicity, which may become a concern in the future. Total mercury emissions can be reduced by about 50 % by combining pollution control measures that target different mercury emission sources...|$|R
