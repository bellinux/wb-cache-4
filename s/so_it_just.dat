500|$|The double album has a disc of rock {{songs and}} another with {{acoustic}} ones, which Grohl said demonstrated his artistic freedom – [...] "It's not one specific genre of music, it's not one specific style. I'm just a musician. I can play {{all these different}} instruments, I can write a bossa nova, I can write a thrash tune." [...] He also stated {{that he tried to}} fit the Foo Fighters sound even with stylistic differences: [...] "It's still the same four guys playing it <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> is a Foo Fighters song, whether it sounds like Carcass or fucking Ry Cooder." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} his darker sound in 2002, Ice replied; [...] "Music is about {{reflection}} and I’m just reflecting my life and everything it’s been and there’s no way I’m {{going to be able}} to stress what I want and mean over a break beat, you know, it’s too emotional and it’s too intense, so you have to have the intensity of the band, it’s like a symphony, you know, you have to build on the intense parts, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> wasn’t going to happen, to come extreme over some hip hop record, so to exorcise my demons I had to have the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October, Raisman competed at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tokyo. She became {{team captain}} when Sacramone was injured before the competition. [...] "I'm {{the oldest of}} all my siblings, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of came naturally," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't really {{think of it as}} being the team leader; I just wanted to help the others out." [...] She contributed scores of 14.950 on vault, 14.866 on balance beam, and 14.666 on floor toward the American team's first-place finish. Individually, she placed fourth in the {{all-around}} with a score of 57.558. In event finals, she placed fourth on balance beam, scoring 15.066, and third on floor, scoring 15.000. Here Raisman became famous for her first tumbling pass (round off one and a half step out round off back handspring tucked Arabian double front to punch front layout (punch front tuck during 2011)) this pass was previously thought to be impossible.|$|E

2500|$|Sea Change {{is based}} around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that {{showcase}} Beck's singer-songwriter side. The term sea change {{is defined as}} a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck's previous effort Midnite Vultures and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck's desire to give each album an identity. Origins for the album's unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: [...] "There are threads of what I've done before. If you listen to my earlier B- sides, you'll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years," [...] he explained. [...] "I've been edging towards the idea, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> took a while." [...] Despite initial difficulty upon deciding on the name, the title originates from [...] "Little One", the eleventh track on the album: [...] "Drown, drown / Sailors run aground / In a sea change nothing is safe".|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} once {{she won the}} Critics Choice Award at the BRIT Awards {{she said she was}} more excited for her album to come out and that her {{confidence}} has grown, as her album wasn't out at time of the awards, but she said no matter how happy she was with the record there will always be doubts lurking somewhere. [...] "I'd spent so long behind the scenes writing for other people and featuring on other people's records <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> felt so good to get the acknowledgement for me as an artist in my own right." [...] She spoke on the relief she had once she had signed a record deal with Virgin Records in 2010 as she spoke it was a [...] "long journey to get signed" [...] as she said [...] "once you get established as a songwriter it's quite hard to get people to recognise you as an artist in your own right. It felt like a long battle to get people to see me and believe in my music. Lots of Record labels didn't want to sign me. So it was great to prove people wrong in that sense." ...|$|E

60|$|Did I say above, or seem to imply, {{that the}} judge {{sometimes}} spoke harshly to his wife? Or did you gather {{for a minute that}} her lot was one to lament over or feel sorry for? If <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> shows that you know nothing about such things, and that marriage, at least as it exists in Mariposa, is a sealed book to you. You are as ignorant as Miss Spiffkins, the biology teacher at the high school, who always says how sorry she is for Mrs. Pepperleigh. You get that impression simply because the judge howled like an Algonquin Indian when he saw the sprinkler running on the lawn. But are you sure you know the other side of it? Are you quite sure when you talk like Miss Spiffkins does about the rights of it, that you are taking all things into account? You might have thought differently perhaps of the Pepperleighs, anyway, if you had been there that evening when the judge came home to his wife with one hand pressed to his temple and in the other the cablegram that said that Neil had been killed in action in South Africa. That night they sat together with her hand in his, just as they had sat together thirty {{years ago when he was}} a law student in the city.|$|E
60|$|That we {{have shown}} {{this to be a}} {{remarkable}} book, we think no one will deny. That is a pernicious book to place {{in the hands of the}} confiding and uniformed, we think we have also shown. That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation of a diseased mind, is apparent upon every page. Having placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close with what charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is some good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his own country and lets Europe alone, he never fails to make himself interesting, and not only interesting but instructive. No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and paragraphs, about life in the gold and silver mines of California and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of vegetables in kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoons of guano; about the moving of small arms from place to place at night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows and mules in the Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys and disturb the people at night. These matters are not only new, but are well worth knowing. It is a pity the author did not put in more of the same kind. His book is well written and is exceedingly entertaining, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> barely escaped being quite valuable also.|$|E

5000|$|Singer M. Shadows has openly {{expressed}} disdain {{about the}} release of the greatest hits album without the band's knowledge, stating [...] "You’re gonna try to put this record out right before our new record just to undercut us and try to confuse the casual fan, like, 'Is this the new record?
