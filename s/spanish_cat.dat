60|$|This odious fowl was the Fairy of the Desert, the Dwarf's trusted ally {{in every}} sort of mischief. The vulture flew {{instantly}} {{out of the}} window; and ah! with what awful anxiety the king again turned {{his eyes on the}} crystal ball only a parent's heart can know. Should he see Ricardo bleeding {{at the feet of the}} abominable dwarf? The king scarcely dared to look; never before had he known the nature of fear. However, look he did, and saw the dwarf un-catted, and Pepper, the gallant Dandie Dinmont, with his teeth in the throat of the monstrous <b>Spanish</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{had hardly}} spoken these words when {{the lid of}} the box fell back on the floor with a terrible noise, and to their horror out sprang the Yellow Dwarf, mounted upon a great <b>Spanish</b> <b>cat.</b> [...] "Rash youth!" [...] he cried, rushing between the Fairy of the Desert and the King. [...] "Dare to lay a finger upon this illustrious Fairy! Your quarrel is with me only. I am your enemy and your rival. That faithless Princess who would have married you is promised to me. See if she has not upon her finger a ring made of one of my hairs. Just try to take it off, and you will soon find out that I am more {{powerful}} than you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cursed be he {{who taught}} you this!" [...] he cried, and then whistled in a shrill and vulgar manner on his very dirty fingers. At his call rushed up an {{enormous}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>cat,</b> ready saddled and bridled, and darting fire from its eyes. To leap on its back, while Ricardo sprang {{on his own}} steed, was to the active Dwarf {{the work of a}} moment. Then clapping spurs to its sides (his spurs grew naturally on his bare heels, horrible to relate, like a cock's spurs) and taking his cat by the head, the Dwarf forced it to leap on to Ricardo's saddle. The diamond sword which slew the king of the Golden Mines--that invincible sword which hews iron like a reed--was up and flashing in the air! ...|$|E
60|$|As he {{was riding}} along through a forest he {{suddenly}} heard the most awful miawing and shrieking of cats you can imagine. The noise drew nearer, and nearer, and at last they saw a hundred huge <b>Spanish</b> <b>cats</b> rush through the trees close to them. They were so closely packed together that you could easily have covered them with a large cloak, and all were following the same track. They were closely pursued by two enormous apes, dressed in purple suits, with the prettiest and best made boots you ever saw.|$|R
2500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Puss made his debut in [...] "Shrek 2," [...] then did {{time in the}} two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not a moment too soon." [...] Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "It would overstate matters to say Puss in Boots leaves its cat holding the bag (we had to get that in). But it also leaves its hero awaiting a richer fable, one befitting his charms and his portrayer's talents." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain <b>Spanish</b> <b>cats</b> in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain <b>Spanish</b> <b>cats</b> voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying [...] "Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals. But while the settings are impressively multidimensional, the characters are flatter than old-school cel drawings." ...|$|R
5000|$|The gato (<b>Spanish</b> for <b>cat)</b> is a {{style of}} Argentine music and the {{associated}} dance. It is a very popular folk dance in the country. Its rhythm is like the chacarera, but its structure is different. Usually, the lyrics of gatos are picaresque or humorous (and the dancers frequently stop the music to improvise any occurrence of double meaning). Is a betrer Dancé of Argentina ...|$|R
60|$|The Yellow Dwarf, deeply enraged {{at these}} words, set spurs to his cat, which yelled horribly, and leaped hither and thither--terrifying {{everybody}} except the brave King, who pursued the Dwarf closely, till he, drawing a great knife {{with which he}} was armed, challenged the King to meet him in single combat, and rushed down into {{the courtyard of the}} palace with a terrible clatter. The King, quite provoked, followed him hastily, but they had hardly taken their places facing one another, and the whole Court had only just had time to rush out upon the balconies to watch what was going on, when suddenly the sun became as red as blood, and it was so dark that they could scarcely see at all. The thunder crashed, and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything; the two basilisks appeared, one {{on each side of the}} bad Dwarf, like giants, mountains high, and fire flew from their mouths and ears, until they looked like flaming furnaces. None of these things could terrify the noble young King, and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured those who were looking on, and perhaps even embarrassed the Yellow Dwarf himself; but even his courage gave way when he saw what was happening to his beloved Princess. For the Fairy of the Desert, looking more terrible than before, mounted upon a winged griffin, and with long snakes coiled round her neck, had given her such a blow with the lance she carried that Bellissima fell into the Queen's arms bleeding and senseless. Her fond mother, feeling as much hurt by the blow as the Princess herself, uttered such piercing cries and lamentations that the King, hearing them, entirely lost his courage and presence of mind. Giving up the combat, he flew toward the Princess, to rescue or to die with her; but the Yellow Dwarf was too quick for him. Leaping with his <b>Spanish</b> <b>cat</b> upon the balcony, he snatched Bellissima from the Queen's arms, and before any of the ladies of the Court could stop him he had sprung upon the roof of the palace and disappeared with his prize.|$|E

50|$|The Stray <b>Cat</b> (<b>Spanish</b> title: La Gata) is a Mexican telenovela {{produced}} by Nathalie Lartilleux for Televisa. It is {{a remake of}} the Venezuelan telenovela La Gata, produced in 1968 and Mexican telenovela Rosa Salvaje produced in 1987.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{the voyage}} is too long. Someone would be certain {{to speak to}} you before you got across and, as you can't talk <b>Spanish,</b> the <b>cat</b> would be out of the bag, directly. If possible, we must manage to cross to Tarifa. It is only a few hours across to there, even if we go in an open boat and, now that the Spaniards are friends with the Moors, there ought to be no {{difficulty}} in getting a passage across there, or to Algeciras.|$|R

The Parra brothers met Mario Mutis and Eduardo [...] "Gato" [...] Alquinta (gato is the <b>Spanish</b> word for <b>cat)</b> in their childhood and joined to play music.

50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> tickler or <b>cat's</b> paw {{is a type}} {{of torture}} instrument, {{consisting}} of long, sharp iron spikes curved so as to resemble claws. It was often attached to a handle, or else used {{as an extension of the}} torturer's hand. In this way it was used to rip and tear flesh away from the bone, from any part of the body. It was also used as a weapon.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> tickler or <b>cat’s</b> paw is a torture device {{so sharp}} and cleverly {{designed}} that bones and flesh {{will not get}} in its way. The cat’s paw was a 3-pronged device that shredded through human flesh. The Spanish tickler was a 4-pronged device {{very similar to the}} cat's paw.Often the device was placed {{on the end of a}} long stick, and torn down the persons back (although it was not limited to the back) as they were hung up by the wrists.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{resource}} (photography and video) {{inclusion in}} digital journalism is obtaining {{importance in the}} multimedia area. The principal resources of digital press are multimedia, hypertext and interactivity. Multimedia is in an initial process of evolution. The objective {{of this research is}} to observe empirically the use of visual resources by the digital pure player press. These media try {{to take advantage of the}} new multimedia possibilities in the development and presentation of the contents. We have analyzed empirically video and photography inclusion in the multimedia framework (text, photography, video, audio, infograph and animation programs) in four digital newspapers (Libertad Digital and El Plural, in <b>Spanish,</b> and Vilaweb. <b>cat</b> and e-Noticies, in Catalan) analyzed according to journalistic genres...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a production experiment with 1600 potentially ambiguous utterances distinguished by word boundary location in Catalan and <b>Spanish</b> (e. g., <b>Cat.</b> mirà batalles ‘(s) {{he looked at}} battles’ vs. mirava talles ‘I/(s) he used to look at carvings’; Span. da balazos ‘(s) he fires shots’ vs. daba lazos ‘I/(s) he gave ribbons’; stressed syllables are underlined). Results revealed strong effects of within-word position on H location. Peaks tended to be timed earlier {{with respect to the}} end of the syllable when their associated syllables occurred later in the word than when they occurred earlier in the word. These results confirmed previous findings for other languages (Silverman & Pierrehumbert, 1990 for English; Arvaniti, Ladd, & Mennen, 1998 for Greek; and Ishihara, 2006 for Japanese; and Godjevac, 2000 for Serbo-Croatian) and for Spanish and Catalan (Prieto, van Santen, & Hirschberg, 1995 for Spanish; de la Mota, 2005; Simonet, 2006, Simonet & Torreira, 2005 for Catalan). A set of perception experiments suggested that tonal alignment patterns influence listeners’ judgments of word boundary location both in Catalan and in Spanish. Listeners were able to employ fine allophonic details of H tonal alignment due to within-word position to identify lexical items that are ambiguous for word-boundary position. The data is consistent with the view that prosodic structure plays an essential part in determining the temporal coordination of f 0 contours with segmental material. Parts of this study were presented at the ESF International Conference on Tone and Intonation (Santorini, September 2004), the 2 nd Phonetics and Phonology in Iberia (Bellaterra, June 2005), the Xth Conference on Laboratory Phonology (Paris, June 2006) and at talks at the Laboratoire Parole et Langage (Aix-en-Provence, April 2005) and Institut de la Communication Parlée (Grenoble, November 2005).
