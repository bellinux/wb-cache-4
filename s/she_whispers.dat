5|$|The {{perspective}} now hovers {{high above}} Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds {{a baby to}} whom <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> Oscar's name. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot {{from the perspective of}} a baby being born to Oscar's mother. (According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's own birth in the form of a false memory).|$|E

25|$|EastEnders has {{featured}} seven live broadcasts. For its 25th {{anniversary in}} February 2010, a live episode was broadcast in which Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) was revealed as Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) killer. Turner was told only 30minutes before the live episode {{and to maintain}} suspense, <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found {{out at the same}} time as the public, when the episode was broadcast. On 23 July 2012, a segment of that evening's episode was screened live as Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) carried the Olympic Flame around Walford in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In February 2015, for the soap's 30th anniversary, five episodes in a week featured live inserts throughout them. Episodes airing on Tuesday 17, Wednesday 18 and Thursday 19 (which featured an hour long episode and a second episode) all featured at least one live insert. The show revealed that the killer of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was her younger brother, Bobby (Eliot Carrington), during the second episode on Thursday, after a ten month mystery regarding who killed her. In a flashback episode which revisited the night of the murder, Bobby was revealed to have killed his sister. The aftermath episode, which aired on Friday 20, was completely live and explained in detail Lucy's death. Carrington was told he was Lucy's killer on Monday 16, while Laurie Brett (who plays Bobby's adoptive mother, Jane) was informed in November, due to the character playing a huge role in the cover-up of Lucy's murder. Bywater only discovered Bobby was responsible for Lucy's death on the morning of Thursday, 19 November, several hours before they filmed the scenes revealing Bobby as Lucy's killer.|$|E

500|$|... "Around the World" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Christina Aguilera from her seventh studio album, Lotus (2012). It was written by Aguilera and Ali Tamposi and was co-written and produced by Supa Dups and Jason Gilbert. The song is an uptempo pop track, with crashing drums and a thumping bassline. The song is about how Aguilera wants to make love in different {{countries around the world}} with her lover. It also refers to her 2001 single [...] "Lady Marmalade", where <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> the lyrics [...] "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, se soir?". [...] "Around the World" [...] received mixed reviews from music critics; some thought it was fun, while others felt it was faceless. Upon the release of Lotus, the song debuted and peaked at number 158 on the South Korean International singles chart.|$|E
500|$|Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote [...] "The Way We Were" [...] while Marty Paich handled its production. In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light {{the corners of}} my mind / Misty watercolor memories {{of the way we}} were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise". In the beginning of {{what seems to be a}} bridge, <b>she</b> <b>whispers,</b> [...] "If we had the chance to do it all again / Tell me would we? Could we?".|$|E
500|$|The next {{track and}} first single from Lotus is [...] "Your Body". It {{incorporates}} electropop and R genres {{and has a}} trace of dubstep in the middle eight. Lyrically, it discusses anonymous sex with a random man. [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] features dance-pop, electronic dance music and pop genres with elements from electronica and trance. The power ballad [...] "Sing for Me" [...] tells how Aguilera was born to sing. [...] "Blank Page" [...] is a piano-driven ballad about apologies, regrets, closure, and making peace. [...] "Cease Fire" [...] is a rock-tinged track that features electronic and dubstep infusion. Lyrically, it is a plea to her partner to stop the fighting {{for the greater good}} of their relationship. [...] "Around the World" [...] has a ragga influence and refers to Aguilera's 2001 hit [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] as <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> [...] "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?". The pop track [...] "Circles" [...] is an anti-haters song and is influenced by the alternative rock genre. [...] "Best of Me" [...] is a power ballad about a failed relationship and how to not let others knock you down. [...] "Just a Fool", the last track of Lotus and its second single, is a duet with Blake Shelton. The song is a country pop ballad about the pain of a break-up.|$|E

500|$|Jackson has a soprano vocal range. Over {{the course}} of her career, she has {{received}} frequent criticism for the limits of her vocal capabilities, especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In comparing her vocal technique to Houston and Aretha Franklin, vocal coach Roger Love states that [...] "hen Janet sings, she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through. She's obviously aiming for a sexy, sultry effect, and on one level that works nicely. But actually, it's fairly limited." [...] He adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording, it doesn't translate well to stage because despite having [...] "great songs, incredible dancing, and her star like presence, the live show is still magnificent. But the voice is not the star." [...] Biographer David Ritz commented, [...] "on Janet's albums—and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique [...] singing wasn't the point," [...] saying emphasis was placed on [...] "her slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant magazine claimed critics opposing her small voice [...] "somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over 'Nasty'... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'." [...] Classical composer Louis Andriessen has praised Jackson for her [...] "rubato, sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice." [...] Several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music's production. Music critic J. D. Considine noted [...] "on albums, Jackson's sound isn't defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush, propulsive production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis." [...] Wendy Robinson of PopMatters said [...] "the power of Janet Jackson's voice does not lie in her pipes. She doesn't blow, <b>she</b> <b>whispers...</b> Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to." [...] Matthew Perpetus of Fluxblog suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess [...] "a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks." [...] Perpetus added: [...] "Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a formed human being with contradictions and complexities." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics. The Times gave it 8 out of 10 and wrote: [...] "Siouxsie, {{has rarely been}} in better voice. The opening track, [...] "2nd Floor" [...] is a fantastically knowing melodrama, riding a techno pulse, while the ominous, epic Exterminating Angel pursues its prey in lamplit streets. It's entrancing, hypnotic and inventive". The Sunday Times also praised it in these glowing terms: [...] "Siouxsie's voice has lost none {{of its ability to}} seduce and unsettle. The sound is percussive, defined by Budgie's supple rhythm work. [...] "Exterminating Angel" [...] is exquisitely menacing, while the sinuous [...] "Another Planet" [...] grows to a shuddering climax." [...] Uncut reviewer Chris Roberts gave the album 4 out of 5, saying: [...] "Sioux's always been at her best as a harsh declaimer [...] but there are phases where <b>she</b> <b>whispers,</b> breathes, reaches for vulnerability", before concluding [...] "The Creatures have jettisoned comfort and are phoning home from a new end zone. Anima Animus crackles." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{is known}} for her often [...] "breathy soprano" [...] vocals. With the release of her debut single [...] "Goodies", Ciara was {{referred}} to as the Princess of Crunk. Allison Stewart of The Washington Post commented that she has a [...] "reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R singer needs. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times commented [...] "Ciara has been the most synthetic of the R divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark [...] 808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines." [...] In reviewing her second album , Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly writes [...] "Ciara's comfort with rave-inspired beats sets her apart from Cassie, Amerie, Rihanna, and other would-Beyoncés... singing is nimble throughout: <b>She</b> <b>whispers,</b> coos, wails, and reels off speedy syncopations worthy of Beyoncé herself." [...] Her third album, Fantasy Ride, saw the singer showcasing a new pop and dance direction. Ciara's music is generally contemporary R, but she also incorporates various styles of musical genres including, hip hop, crunk, rap, dance-pop, electropop and funk into her songs. Critics have described her singles [...] "Goodies", [...] "1, 2 Step", [...] "Get Up", and [...] "Go Girl" [...] as club bangers.|$|E

2500|$|River appears {{again in}} the fifth episode of the seventh series, titled [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] (2012), where she {{encounters}} the Doctor and her parents; Rory and Amy, in 1930s New York City. At this later point in her timeline, she {{is a professor of}} archaeology and a free woman, having been released from the Stormcage Prison after the Doctor erased all evidence of his existence. When her parents are sent permanently back in time by the Weeping Angels, to be forever parted from the Doctor, she arranges for Amy to leave the Doctor a message {{in the form of an}} epilogue in a book they have been reading written by her in the 1930s. Although she agrees to travel with the Doctor for the time being, she declines his offer of being a full-time companion. In [...] "The Name of the Doctor" [...] (2013), the deceased River's consciousness is summoned from the Library computer, where she has existed since [...] "Forest of the Dead", into a psychic 'conference call' by the Doctor's friend Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh). There, she and Clara (Jenna Coleman) learn that the Doctor's grave, [...] "his greatest secret", has been discovered. River maintains the psychic link with Clara after the call ends, and counsels her throughout the discovery of the Doctor's tomb, although she seems to be invisible to everyone else. When the Doctor and his companions are threatened by the Great Intelligence, <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> the Doctor's name in order to open his tomb which is inside the TARDIS. After Clara enters the Doctor's time stream to save him from the Great Intelligence, who entered it first so he could destroy the Doctor in all his regenerations, the Doctor reveals that he could see River all along, but had been avoiding confronting her continued existence because it was too painful for him to bear. After he kisses her, River feels closure and fades away. However, before disappearing River points out that her continued presence indicates that Clara has not been destroyed by entering his time stream; and therefore, he can save her.|$|E
