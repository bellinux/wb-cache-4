50|$|A <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> (also {{known as}} a skid or skiddie) is an unskilled hacker who breaks into {{computer}} systems by using automated tools written by others (usually by other black hat hackers), hence the term script (i.e. a prearranged plan or set of activities) kiddie (i.e. kid, child—an individual lacking knowledge and experience, immature), usually with little understanding of the underlying concept.|$|E

50|$|Eric S. Raymond, {{author of}} The New Hacker's Dictionary, advocates {{that members of}} the {{computer}} underground should be called crackers. Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in {{what they see as a}} wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as white hat, grey hat, black hat and <b>script</b> <b>kiddie.</b> In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term cracker for more malicious activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{programming}} and hacking culture, a <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> or skiddie is an unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites. It is generally assumed that script kiddies are juveniles who lack {{the ability to}} write sophisticated programs or exploits {{on their own and}} that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast communities. However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant. The term is generally considered to be pejorative.|$|E
50|$|Wordpress {{changed a}} bit how the {{pingback}} feature works to mitigate {{this kind of}} vulnerability: the IP address that originated the pingback (the attacker address) started being recorded, and thus shown in the log. Notwithstanding, in 2016, pingback attacks continued to exist, supposedly because the website owners don't check the user agent logs, that have the real IP addresses. It has to be noted that, if the attacker {{is more than a}} <b>script</b> <b>kiddie,</b> he will know how to prevent his IP address being recorded, by, for example, sending the request from another machine/site, so that this machine/site IP address is recorded instead, and the IP logging then, becomes less worthy. Thus, it's still recommended to disable the pingbacks, to prevent attacking other sites (although this does not prevent being target of attacks).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{emergence}} of widely available hardware and software tools for GSM hacking, the security of cellular networks is threatened even by script kiddies. In this paper we present four different attacks in GSM networks, using commodity hardware as well as open source and freely available software tools. All attacks are performed using a common DVB-T TV tuner, which {{is used as a}} sniffer for the GSM radio interface, as well as an Arduino combined with a GSM shield that is used as a software programmable mobile phone. The attacks target both mobile users and the network, ranging from sniffing the signaling traffic to tracking and performing denial of service to the subscribers. Despite the <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> style of the attacks, their consequences are critical and threaten the normal operation of the cellular networks...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) {{has been described}} as both easy and impossible, where is the truth? Post-Stuxnet works have included a plethora of ICS focused cyber secu- rity research activities, with topics covering device maturity, network protocols, and overall cyber security culture. We often hear the notion of ICSs being highly vulnerable {{due to a lack of}} inbuilt security mechanisms, considered a low hanging fruit to a variety of low skilled threat actors. While there is substantial evidence to support such a notion, when considering targeted attacks on ICS, it is hard to believe an attacker with limited resources, such as a <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> or hacktivist, using publicly accessible tools and exploits alone, would have adequate knowledge and resources to achieve targeted operational process manipulation, while simultaneously evade detection. Through use of a testbed environment, this paper provides two practical examples based on a Man-In-The-Middle scenario, demonstrating the types of information an attacker would need obtain, collate, and comprehend, in order to begin targeted process manipulation and detection avoidance. This allows for a clearer view of associated challenges, and illustrate why targeted ICS exploitation might not be possible for every malicious actor...|$|E
40|$|The word ‘hacker ’ {{originally}} {{was used to}} describe someone who made furniture with an axe but in the computer community it describes a proficient programmer or an exceptional computer intruder (Jargon File, 2005). The original hackers were creative computer enthusiasts who created their own methods and tools to accomplish said tasks. The term was first used in the early 1960 s at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory {{to refer to the}} labs students including Richard Matthew Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, the GNU project, and the Free Software Foundation. A ‘script kiddie ’ on the other hand is a derogatory term for a person who plagiarizes scripts and programs developed by others for the malicious purpose of compromising computers and launching attacks on computer networks (Wikipedia, 2005). Jargon File editor Eric S. Raymond, a figure head for the open source movement has been trying for a few years to remove the negative connotation to the word ‘hacker’. Many of the elite programmers and open source believers would agree that a <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> is only a wannabe hacker and they are hindering the open source movement. Script kiddies could be the downfall of the open source movement and are one of the leadin...|$|E
40|$|A good {{forensics}} examiner {{should be}} aware of the techniques that an attacker, intruder, malicious program, virus, or worm is capable of utilizing. Indeed, a significant body of knowledge will be required to track down the steps taken by an adversary, piece together the puzzle of events, and successfully defend conclusions in a court of law. While not every incident investigated will be found to have been carried out by someone with the skill of an expert, automated tools are becoming more sophisticated on a daily basis and can give even a <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> power and capabilities that previously did not exist. During the commission of a crime it is quite natural, and a common human trait, to attempt to cover up, disguise, or otherwise hide evidence of criminal activity. In some cases, hiding data is part of the master plan and helps ensure the success rate of the illicit activities. Deleting data from a hard disk can be used as a hiding technique as well as an attempt to conceal evidence. To be successful, forensics investigators must know and understand these methods. Additionally, they must possess the ability to recover as much case related data as possible; discovering and reclaiming hidden and deleted data. The focal points of this paper include: physical characteristics of a hard drive; distinguishing attributes for the FAT 32, NTFS, and Ext 2 fs file systems; techniques used to both hide and find digital data; software tools available for deleting and recovering data; true data deletion; applicable regulations regarding data destruction; and data recovery capabilities. The subject areas are intended to provide background to the neophyte forensics practitioner or those with an interest in the field. 1...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 76 - 79. A botnet is {{a network}} of compromised machines that are remotely controlled and commanded by an attacker, who is often called the botmaster. Such botnets are often abused as platforms to launch distributed denial of service attacks, send spam mails or perform identity theft. In recent years, the basic motivations for malicious activity have shifted from <b>script</b> <b>kiddie</b> vandalism in the hacker community, to more organized attacks and intrusions for financial gain. This shift explains {{the reason for the}} rise of botnets that have capabilities to perform more sophisticated malicious activities. Recently, researchers have tried to develop botnet detection mechanisms. The botnet detection mechanisms proposed to date have serious limitations, since they either can handle only certain types of botnets or focus on only specific botnet attributes, such as the spreading mechanism, the attack mechanism, etc., in order to constitute their detection models. We present a system that monitors network traffic to identify bot-infected hosts. Our goal is to develop a more general detection model that identifies single infected machines without relying on the bot propagation vector. To this end, we leverage the insight that all of the bots get a command and perform an action as a response, since the command and response behavior is the unique characteristic that distinguishes the bots from other malware. Thus, we examine the network traffic generated by bots to locate command and response behaviors. Afterwards, we generate signatures from the similar commands that are followed by similar bot responses without any explicit knowledge about the command and control protocol. The signatures are deployed to an IDS that monitors the network traffic of a university. Finally, the experiments showed that our system is capable of detecting bot-infected machines with a low false positive rate. Bilge, LeylaM. S...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of radio technology into the software defined era, has accelerated {{the availability of}} advanced radio receivers that can cover very large portions of the radio spectrum (70 MHz to 6 GHz) at low cost. Coupled with the democratisation of knowledge that has occurred through the internet, the threat environment for Electronic Warfare (EW) has changed markedly over the last 5 years. Previously EW threat would have arisen from a state actor that could fund the expensive equipment and antenna arrays {{that would be required}} for the intercept and disruption of military signals activities. Instead it is now possible to download freely available software to launch EW attacks on widely publicised radio link standards. The aim of this research is to explore the security of wireless communication systems when exposed to threats generated by Software Defined Radios (SDR). The research is aimed at exploring this vulnerability due to the rapidly decreasing cost and the lowering of skill barriers to launch advanced EW attacks on wireless communication systems. The first objective was to understand what current knowledge exists on the EW threat on the RF environment, allowing an understanding of this advanced threat against wireless infrastructure. The literature review has showed that the vulnerabilities of wireless networks are in existence and there are potential methods of protection that have been studied, although these protection schemes do not seem to have been implemented in production quality systems. The second objective is to validate this prognosis against a test bed, constructed as a threat source that could be typical of a hobbyist or <b>script</b> <b>kiddie,</b> allowing two threat scenarios to be demonstrated, validating the threat source. This research included the execution of two laboratory based attacks against wireless systems, namely a record and replay attack against the Personal Role Radio (PRR) and a Meaconing attack against GPS. These experiments showed that a flexible Vulnerability Analysis test bed can be assembled to conduct Vulnerability Investigation against wireless standards. Specifically, this also showed the Vulnerability of the PRR radio against record and replay attacks...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computer}} crime, law enforcement agencies and investigators have been required to break new ground. Traditional investigation methods did not provide a comprehensive solution for combating computer crime, with the problem posed by hacking proving particularly difficult. This thesis considers the potential of adapting the long-established technique of criminal profiling to the new context of computer crime. Such methods are primarily used against violent crime, and build upon the perpetrator's signature behaviour. As different sources provide a good overview of the possible techniques and methods used to hack computer systems, it seems that a diversity of methods exist from which profile categories may be derived. It can also be assumed that computer crime provides the possibility for establishing signature behaviour as well. Thus the thesis examines the existing methods of criminal profiling, and the additional possibilities of applying them for computer crime are closely examined. The development of a case study, focusing upon hacking incidents in Germany, is outlined {{in order to test}} the aforementioned assumptions. For the development of a Criminal Profile possible behavioural aspects of hackers and their motives are considered. For the verification cases of German hacking incidents have been studied to find commonalities and differences for motives, as well as the Modus Operandi (MO). As results the thesis indicates that hacking methods which have akeady been used years ago are still dominant amongst the preferred methods today. In ten out of twelve cases analysed, the observed characteristics fit within in the stereotype of a <b>Script</b> <b>Kiddie.</b> Only two hackers had motives that departed from this categorisation, but a significant difference regarding their methods - the MO - could not be noticed. From the twelve cases under investigation a basic principle could be identified: The hackers take the path of the least effort. This reveals a clue for the fact that a different motive does not necessarily lead to different methods. As a consequence of the research and case study analysis, a number of insights have been gained that provide material for ongoing studies within the field of computer criminal profiling.
