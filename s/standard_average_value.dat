Although tabular {{reinforcement}} learning (RL) {{methods have been}} proved to converge to an optimal policy, the combination of particular conventional {{reinforcement learning}} techniques with function approximators can lead to divergence.

The physicochemical parameters of water were investigated for 3 points in the Turag River through experimental methods. The river water was black in color and the odor was bad which indicate that the water is polluted and dangerous for aquatic ecosystem and human health. The temperature of water was within an <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of 28. 39 oC which indicates standard temperature (20 to 30 oC) for aquatic medium. The <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of pH was 6. 83, which indicates that the value was within the standard limits (6. 5 to 8. 0) for aquatic organisms. The values of DO water were {{within the range of}} 0. 6 to 3. 9 ppm with an <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of 2. 25 ppm indicating low DO value from standard level (4. 0 to 6. 0 ppm for domestic and 5. 0 ppm for fish culture). The values of BOD were within the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of 1. 15 ppm indicating lower condition compared to standard value of BOD (6. 0 ppm for fish culture and 10. 0 ppm for irrigation). The <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of TDS was 340. 86 ppm which indicates low TDS condition. The EC values were ranged from 35 to 150 µS/cm with an <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of 56. 30 µS/cm which indicates lower condition than the <b>standard</b> <b>value.</b> The <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of transparency was 28. 39 cm.

Since ANU is the only secondary standard measured in our lab that does not agree with the consensus values, and we have measured a larger number analyses compared to what went into the definition of the consensus value, we suggest that the consensus value of ANU sucrose might be too high by ~ 0. 0045 ± 0. 0011 Fm.

40|$|The Mott {{insulator}} {{is characterized}} by having small deviations around the (integer) average particle density n, with pairs with n − 1 and n þ 1 particles forming bound states. In one dimension, the effect is captured by a nonzero value of a nonlocal "string" of parities, which instead vanishes in the superfluid phase where density fluctuations are large. Here, we investigate the interaction induced transition from the superfluid to the Mott insulator, in the paradigmatic Bose Hubbard model at n= 1. By means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling analysis on L × M ladders, we explore the behavior of "brane" parity operators from one dimension (i. e., M= 1 and L → ∞) to two dimensions (i. e., M → ∞ and L → ∞). We confirm the conjecture that, adopting a <b>standard</b> definition, their <b>average</b> <b>value</b> decays to zero in two dimensions also in the insulating phase, evaluating the scaling factor of the "perimeter law" [S. P. Rath et al., Ann. Phys. (Berlin) 334, 256 (2013) ]. Upon introducing a further phase in the brane parity, we show that its expectation value becomes nonzero in the insulator, while still vanishing at {{the transition to the}} superfluid phase. These quantities are directly accessible to experimental measures, thus providing an insightful signature of the Mott insulator...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of support surface mattresses of different bedbackrestlifting angles on interface pressures around sacral regions. Ten healthy people (average age 21 ± 2. 4, 4 males) participated in this study. The interface pressure around sacral region was measured infour types of mattresses with 0, 30, 45 and 70 degrees of bed-backrest lifting angle respectively: astandard mattress, an iris urethane mattress, an air mattress, and a maxi float mattress. The averages ofinterface pressures, maximum interface pressures and area supporting surfaces were measured by theuse of a pressure-sensitive sheet. Those averages with the different bed-backrest lifting angles and thefour types of mattresses were statistically examined by ANOVA. The three types of support surfacemattresses were compared with the <b>standard</b> mattress. The <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of interface pressures ofsupporting surface were significantly lower than those of the standard mattress (p < 0. 05), and also thearea of supporting surface of support surface mattresses were significantly wider than those of thestandard mattress (p < 0. 05). Maximum interface pressures were approximate 100 mmHg in all of themattresses with bed-backrest 45 and 70 degrees up. The results show that the value of interfacepressure increases as the degree of head up rises in all of the mattresses. This suggests that interfacepressure should be considered while the bed-backrest is lifted up...|$|R
30|$|Free {{residual}} chlorine results in treated water ranged from 0.89 to 1.8  mg/L and from 1.3 to 1.7  mg/L for Plant 1 and Plant 2, respectively. For Plant 1, the maximum <b>average</b> <b>value</b> was 1.6  mg/L reported in winter, while the minimum <b>average</b> <b>value</b> was 1.2  mg/L reported in summer. For Plant 2, the maximum <b>average</b> <b>value</b> was 1.6  mg/L reported in autumn, while the minimum <b>average</b> <b>value</b> was 1.37 reported in summer.|$|R

For Plant 2, the maximum <b>average</b> <b>value</b> (12 NTU) was reported in autumn, while the minimum <b>average</b> <b>value</b> (7.4 NTU) was in spring.

30|$|Some of {{panoramic}} creation methods {{often use}} the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of RGB (or other color space value) on the overlapping {{region in the}} combination of source images. The <b>average</b> <b>value</b> is a fair-minded method, but, use of <b>average</b> <b>value</b> method may produce the ghost effect in panoramic image. The <b>average</b> <b>value</b> needs to rely on robust panoramic position method and accurate camera parameters, and there should not any moving or apparent object in source images. Therefore the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> method is not very reliable for our method of this step. Hence we use image stitching method in the proposed method as steps given below.|$|R
