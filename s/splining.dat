50|$|By 2008, {{the face}} of the Devil's Tower Child had been reconstructed (pictured below) at the University of Zurich by means of {{computer-assisted}} paleoanthropology (CAP). This involved using computed tomography (CT) to perform volume data acquisition of the five skull fragments unearthed by Garrod in 1926. The five cranial fragments were then transformed with the software FoRM-IT into virtual 3D images. With the five virtual images then suspended in anatomical space according to scientific criteria, the missing fragments were replaced with mirror images of the excavated fragments. By means of laser stereolithography, the virtual reconstruction of the face and skull of the Devil's Tower Child was converted to a physical model. The soft tissues were then approximated using 3D Thin Plate <b>Splining</b> (TPS) with data from a modern child. Plasticine modelling clay was accordingly applied on the physical model to simulate soft tissue. The final model of Gibraltar 2 was then cast; finishing touches included paint and human hair (link to final image below).|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{reasoning}} typically {{suffers from}} the explosive amount of information it must maintain. There {{are a variety of}} methods available for curbing this explosion. However, in doing so, it is important to avoid oversimplifying the given domain through injudicious use of assumptions such as independence. Multiple <b>splining</b> is an approach for compressing and approximating the probabilistic information. Instead of positing additional independence conditions, it attempts to identify patterns in the information. While the data explosion is multiplicative in nature, O(n 1 n 2 ΔΔ k), multiple splines reduces it to an additive one, O(n 1 + n 2 + ΔΔΔ + n k). We consider how these splines can be found and used. Since splines exploit patterns in the data, we can also use them to help in filling in missing data.
