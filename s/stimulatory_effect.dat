5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effect</b> on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effect</b> of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
25|$|Contrasting {{with the}} typical growth-inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3, {{stimulation}} of cell proliferation by IGFBP-3 {{has also been}} observed. This can occur either by enhancing IGF-stimulated proliferation or {{in the absence of}} IGF-1. In endothelial cells and mammary epithelial cells, the <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effect</b> of IGFBP-3 has been shown to involve activation of the enzyme sphingosine kinase, and generation of the bioactive lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate, which promotes growth by transactivating the EGFR receptor.|$|E
50|$|As a peptide hormone, CCK mediates satiety {{by acting}} on the CCK receptors {{distributed}} widely throughout the central nervous system. The mechanism for hunger suppression {{is thought to be}} a decrease in the rate of gastric emptying. CCK also has <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> on the vagus nerve, effects that can be inhibited by capsaicin. The <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> of CCK oppose those of ghrelin, which has been shown to inhibit the vagus nerve.|$|R

25|$|Regardless of the cause, {{sequestration}} {{of fluid}} within the abdomen leads to additional fluid retention by the kidneys due to <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effect</b> on blood pressure hormones, notably aldosterone. The {{sympathetic nervous system}} is also activated, and renin production is increased due to decreased perfusion of the kidney. Extreme disruption of the renal blood flow can lead to hepatorenal syndrome. Other complications of ascites include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), due to decreased antibacterial factors in the ascitic fluid such as complement.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effect</b> and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means that {{it takes a long time}} to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E

S. cereÕisiae can grow in milk without using lactose or galactose. In particular, the presence of peptides seems to be sufficient to ensure its growth. The growth of S. cereÕisiae with lactic acid bacteria is characterised by <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> that involve both yeast and bacteria.

2500|$|Pituitary {{prolactin}} secretion {{is regulated}} by endocrine neurons in the hypothalamus.

2500|$|Flutamide is an arylpropionamide analog {{with pure}} antiandrogenic properties, {{seen in figure}} 4. It is {{completely}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first pass metabolism to its active form, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and hydrolysis product, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitroaniline. Hydroxyflutamide is a more potent AR antagonist than flutamide in vivo, with higher binding affinity for the AR. Hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of about 8 hours in humans. Hydrolysis of the amide bond represents the major metabolic pathway for this active metabolite. By reversing the <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effect</b> of DHT on ventral prostate weight, flutamide is approximately 2-fold more potent than cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide has relatively low binding affinity to AR and is therefore generally used at [...] high doses {{in order to achieve}} complete AR blockage in therapy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn serum-starved NIH 3 T 3 {{fibroblast}} cultures, zinc (15 – 40 μM) enhanced {{both the}} individual and combined <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> of insulin and ethanol (EtOH) on DNA synthesis.

In the presence of zinc, insulin induced premature expression of cyclin E during early G 1 phase; EtOH partially restored the normal timing (late G 1 phase) of cyclin E expression. The results suggest that zinc and EtOH promote insulin-induced DNA synthesis by different mechanisms; while zinc acts by enhancing the effects of insulin on MAP kinase activation, EtOH may act by ensuring timely zinc-dependent insulin-induced expression of cyclin E...|$|R

Yet, these studies mainly employed one-generation exposure, {{and the effects of}} multigenerational challenges need further studies. Presently, Caenorhabditis elegans were exposed to cadmium, copper, lead and zinc for four consecutive generations (G 1 to G 4) at environmental concentrations. The feeding, growth, initial reproduction, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined. All data were represented in the percentage of that in control (POC), and POC in the control was normalized to 100 %. In G 1 and G 2, the POC values in feeding, growth and initial reproduction were generally within 10 % of the control (100 %), indicating non-significant effects. The POC values in SOD and CAT were significantly higher than 100 %, showing <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects.</b> In G 3 and G 4, the POC values in feeding, growth and initial reproduction were significantly lower than 100 %, showing inhibitory effects which were more severe in G 4 than in G 3.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of various beta-adrenoceptor (beta AR) antagonists and local anesthetics (LAs), i. e. {{substances}} possessing one basic and one lipophilic domain each, on activation of regulatory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). In membranes of differentiated HL- 60 cells, propranolol activated high-affinity GTP hydrolysis with a half-maximal effect at 0. 19 mM and a maximum at 1 mM. There was a close correlation between the log Q values (logarithm of the octanol: water partition coefficient) of beta AR antagonists and the logarithm of their effectiveness at activating GTPase (EC 3. 6. 1. -) in HL- 60 membranes. The lipophilic LA, tetracaine, was also an effective activator of GTPase in HL- 60 membranes, whereas more hydrophilic LAs were less stimulatory (bupivacaine and lidocaine) or even inhibitory (procaine). Propranolol and tetracaine also stimulated binding of guanosine 5 '-O-[3 -thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) to HL- 60 membranes, but their <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> on GTP[gamma S] binding were smaller than on GTP hydrolysis. The <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> of propranolol and tetracaine on GTPase and GTP[gamma S] binding were inhibited by pertussis toxin. Propranolol and tetracaine effectively activated GTP hydrolysis of a reconstituted mixture of bovine brain Gi/Go-proteins, but the concentrations of substances needed for GTPase activation were higher than in HL- 60 membranes. Procaine showed <b>stimulatory</b> <b>effects</b> on the GTPase of Gi/Go-proteins. Our data show that beta AR antagonists and LAs activate pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, presumably through interaction with the C-terminus of their alpha-subunits. Apparently, the lipophilic domain of beta AR antagonists and LAs is more important for G-protein activation than the basic domain.
