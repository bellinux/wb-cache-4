50|$|The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) {{provided}} {{a clear picture}} of this mechanism in their report The Laundering Machine. According to them, the biggest flaw in the Peruvian system for years has been the granting of logging permits: ‘Concessionaires <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> lists that do not exist in the real world, and complicit authorities approve the extraction of this non-existent wood’. These permits allow companies to transport almost all sorts of wood (both legal and illegal) out of the country. There are only two ways to stop illegal loggers: catching them in the act, or, in case of controlling a shipment, environmental prosecutors have to prove that the timber does not come from the place written on the permit (which is only possible by going to this place). With not more than a hundred environmental prosecutors in Peru, {{it is not surprising that}} both methods are far from effective.|$|E
