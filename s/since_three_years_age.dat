40|$|Abstract. Hydatidosis is a {{zoonosis}} {{of worldwide}} distribution {{caused by the}} parasite Echinococcus granulosus. Clinical manifestations include cyst formation, most commonly in the liver (67 – 89 %) and lungs (10 – 15 %). Renal localizations are rare. We report a case of renal hydatidosis in a five-year-old child treated in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Argentina. After the diagnosis was made, elective surgery was performed, {{which led to a}} rapid recovery. We report a five-year-old previously healthy boy who had an abdominal mass. The patient was born in rural Santiago del Estero in northwesternArgentina and had lived <b>since</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> of <b>age</b> in the greater Buenos Aires area. The patient was in close contact with dogs that were not given veterinary care and were regularly fed undercooked animal viscera (cattle, sheep). The child came to a pediatrician with a history of weight loss and a palpable mass in the abdominal right upper quad-rant that was present for two months. After multiple consul-tations, the child was referred to the Parasitology Service at Ricardo Gutierrez Childrens Hospital in Buenos Aires...|$|R

Um cavalo de 22 anos de idade desenvolveu quadro de colelitíase severa com atrofia do lobo lateral direito. O animal tinha histórico de cólica recorrente, desde os três anos de idade, sendo que um dos primeiros episódios de cólica foi acompanhado de icterícia. O lobo hepático lateral direito estava extremamente diminuído de volume. Havia um grande coledocólito localizado no ducto hepático comum e inúmeros hepatólitos e colélitos nos ductos biliares intra e extra-hepáticos. Microscopicamente, foi observada atrofia acentuada do lobo direito, com proliferação difusa de tecido conjuntivo fibroso e de ductos biliares. O lobo lateral esquerdo apresentava fibrose periportal difusa associada à proliferação acentuada de ductos biliares e estase biliar.
