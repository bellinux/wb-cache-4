40|$|Herbivores {{employ a}} variety of chemical, {{behavioural}} and morphological defences to reduce mortality from natural enemies. In some caterpillars the head capsules of successive instars are retained and stacked {{on top of each}} other and it has been suggested that this could serve as a defence against natural enemies. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the survival of groups of the gumleaf skeletoniser Uraba lugens Walker caterpillars, allocated to one of three treatments: “−HC,” where <b>stacked</b> <b>head</b> capsules were removed from all individuals, “+HC,” where the caterpillars retained their <b>stacked</b> <b>head</b> capsules, and “mixed,” where only half of the caterpillars in a group had their <b>stacked</b> <b>head</b> capsules removed. We found no difference in predation rate between the three treatments, but within the mixed treatment, caterpillars with head capsules were more than twice as likely to survive. During predator choice trials, conducted to observe how head capsule stacking acts as a defence, the predatory pentatomid bug attacked the −HC caterpillar in four out of six trials. The two attacks on +HC caterpillars took over 10 times longer because the bug would poke its rostrum through the head capsule stack, while the caterpillar used its head capsule stack to deflect the bug’s rostrum. Our results support the hypothesis that the retention of moulted head capsules by U. lugens provides some protection against their natural enemies and suggest that this is because <b>stacked</b> <b>head</b> capsules can function as a false target for natural enemies as well as a weapon to fend off attackers. This represents the first demonstration of a defensive function...|$|E

I discuss previous approaches to V 2, the bottleneck effect and <b>stacked</b> <b>head</b> theories, and argue that they are generally unable to account {{for a variety of}} “relaxed” V 2 systems that allow V 3 or V 4 in some contexts. I propose a new analysis of variation in the strictness of V 2 in terms of the feature scattering hypothesis (Giorgi & Pianesi 1996); languages can vary in the number of functional category features that are bundled on individual heads. This allows a straightforward account for the attested typology of relaxed V 2 systems, and a new explanation for cross-linguistic variation in the instantiation of functional projections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract * In {{magnetic}} recording systems, {{it has been}} reported that sufficient SNR was obtained with a narrow track width, using a spin-valve head and metal-evaporated tape. In order to apply this to a helical-scan tape system, techniques for writing narrow tracks and reading them exactly were required. However, the degree of mechanical accuracy demanded was too high to realize. With this in mind, we have developed multi-channel heads which can write and read certain tracks with a single scan, as well as a non-tracking technique removing the need for such precise mechanical accuracy. A prototype tape drive employing these techniques was developed, and a track density exceeding 15 ktpi was achieved. Also, we described here that improving the corrosion resistance of shielded spin valve (SV) head and ultra-thin metal-evaporated (ME) tape.

50|$|Force Feed loaders {{create a}} stack of paint balls leading into the marker. Most of these hoppers {{maintain}} a constant tension on the ball stack to ensure that once a paintball is fired, a new one immediately takes its place. A special feed tube is sometimes used to allow placement of a hopper below the chamber, giving the marker a much lower profile. Any hopper-based loading system still relies on gravity to get paint into the drive portion of the loader itself. The 'Warp' loader uses an electric motor to rotate two silicone discs with ball-shaped divots, which add each ball to a <b>stack</b> <b>headed</b> down the feed tube into the chamber.|$|R

Purpose to measure the total CoQ in the current process {{and use it as a}} tool to identify problems related to quality costs in order to find improvement plans. The total CoQ has been calculated in the percentage of the cost of quality per the cost of finished goods. Cost elements that impacted to the total CoQ have been prioritized and analyzed by using the Fish Bone diagram and the FMEA tool to find the potential causes of problems. The improvement plans have been implemented in order to reduce the chance of occurrences and improve detection ability. The result on two <b>head</b> <b>stack</b> models showed that the total CoQ could be reduced from 1. 45 % to 1. 36 % or 6. 21 % of improvement on the model A and reduced from 1. 11 % to 1. 08 % or 2. 70 % of improvement on the model B.
