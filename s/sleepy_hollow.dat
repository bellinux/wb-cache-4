500|$|Burton was {{impressed}} by the cinematography in Great Expectations, and hired Emmanuel Lubezki as <b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollows</b> director of photography. [...] Initially, Lubezki and Burton contemplated shooting the film in black and white and in old square Academy ratio. When that proved unfeasible, they opted for an almost monochromatic effect which would enhance the fantasy aspect. Burton and Lubezki intentionally planned the over-dependency of smoke and soft lighting to accompany the film's sole wide-angle lens strategy. Lubezki also used Hammer horror and Mexican lucha films from the 1960s, such as Santo Contra los Zombis and Santo vs. las Mujeres Vampiro. Lighting effects increased the dynamic energy of the Headless Horseman, while the contrast of the film stock was increased in post-production to add to the monochromatic feel.|$|R

Crane, a Yankee and an outsider, sees marriage to Katrina {{as a means of}} procuring Van Tassel's extravagant wealth. Bones, the local hero, vies with Ichabod for Katrina's hand, playing a series of pranks on the jittery schoolmaster, and the fate of <b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollow's</b> fortune weighs in the balance for some time. The tension between the three is soon brought to a head. On a placid autumn night, the ambitious Crane attends a harvest party at the Van Tassels' homestead. He dances, partakes in the feast, and listens to ghostly legends told by Brom and the locals, but his true aim is to propose to Katrina after the guests leave. His intentions, however, are ill-fated.|$|R

5|$|Several {{properties}} {{within the}} district exemplify Mid-19th Century Revival architectures, including Greek, Gothic, Renaissance, and Neoclassical styles; their formal landscaping exemplifies estate landscaping {{at the turn}} of the 19th century. Most of the properties were established by wealthy landowners, ranging from the late 18th century to the early 20th century.

500|$|<b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollow's</b> clubhouse {{was once}} a private {{residence}} named Woodlea. The mansion retained {{the name of a}} former house of J. Butler Wright, who lived there and called it Woodlea; it dates to around 1806. Wright's Victorian house, of painted brick with porches and a high tower on one end, was later renamed the Villa. The current property was originally made up of various farms. Colonel Elliott Fitch Shepard came to the Briarcliff area in the early 1890s, and having purchased the house and its [...] property, ordered construction of the existing house and improvements to the grounds. Construction on the mansion began in 1892, and it was completed in 1895. In 1892 Shepard ordered the construction of Scarborough's first dock (at the present Scarborough Park) to allow construction materials to be shipped to his property. Shepard died in 1893, leaving his wife Margaret to oversee the completion of Woodlea. After his death, Margaret lived there only during spring and autumn, with less frequent trips as time went on. In November 1896, Maria Louisa Kissam (Margaret's mother and widow of William Henry Vanderbilt) died in the house. Maria's sister and Margaret called for a Scarborough doctor who was unable to assist her.|$|R
40|$|In 1923, the General Assembly of Nod {{enacted the}} 2 ̆ 2 Statute of Paul 2 ̆ 2 (so {{designated}} {{because of the}} sponsoring legislator, Paul Perfect), which empowered municipalities of Nod (called 2 ̆ 2 <b>sleepy</b> <b>hollows</b> 2 ̆ 2) to issue licenses to individuals wishing to engage in legitimate private enterprises. One provision of the Paul Statute directed that applicants for such licenses 2 ̆ 2 must make application in the mode prescribed by Code Section 23 - 112, dealing with county licesning [sic] of pickle processors 2 ̆ 2 (popularly known as the 2 ̆ 2 Peter Pickle Statute 2 ̆ 2). In 1923, Code Section 23 - 112 required that an applicant for a pickle processing license submit his application to county licensing authorities in 25 copies. In 1974, however, the Nod legislature amended this code section so as to reduce from 25 to 3 the required number of application copies. In 1975, Mary Marvel applied to the municipality of Dull, in the State of Nod, for a license to operate a commercial establishment {{to be known as}} Mary Marvel 2 ̆ 7 s Museum. Dull refused to issue the license on the ground that Mary had applied only in triplicate and (under the Statute of Paul) was thus 22 copies short in her application.

5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of the <b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollow</b> Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E
5|$|Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman {{continued}} to create television series. These included <b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollow,</b> which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series {{to a number}} of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it.|$|E
5|$|Frank A. Vanderlip was {{president}} of the National City Bank of New York, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and a founder of the Federal Reserve System.

Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in Tarrytown, New York, was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. Metro-North Railroad suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks.

A 10-foot (3m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of Pocantico Hills was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a tornado warning was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2003, the {{original}} {{wing of the}} Briarcliff Lodge caught fire. The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the 100-year-old building and construct a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department {{was the first to}} arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, <b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollow,</b> Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and <b>Sleepy</b> <b>Hollow</b> Country Club.

After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson.
