5|$|Advertising {{alcohol on}} {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh <b>shandy,</b> which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.|$|E
5|$|There {{was only}} one public {{pre-season}} friendly on 13 August, which saw the club's first team take on the reserves; it ended with a surprise 4–2 victory for the reserves, Roland Lewis scoring a hat-trick. Pre-season training consisted primarily of assistant manager Ken Fish leading a marathon running session from Burslem to Hanley and back to Burslem following a stop at a pub for a half-pint of <b>shandy.</b> After returning to the ground Fish would organise a practise game. The fitness work was actually crucial to the team's success, as Steele was {{ahead of his time}} in that he insisted that wide players should defend when the opposition were on the ball, in order to support the defence. Superstition was of great importance to Steele, who ensured that the team rigidly stuck their pre-match rituals such as the intricacies of kit layout and the order in which players entered the pitch.|$|E

25|$|Ireland {{has made}} a {{significant}} contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages. Modern Irish fiction began with the publishing of the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include Laurence Sterne with the publication of The Life and Opinions of Tristram <b>Shandy,</b> Gentleman and Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield. Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including Maria Edgeworth, John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham, William Carleton, George Moore, and Somerville and Ross. Bram Stoker is best known as the author of the 1897 novel Dracula.|$|E

5000|$|In {{northern}} Germany, a half-and-half made of Pilsner {{beer and}} lemonade {{is known as}} an Alster (short for Alsterwasser, German for [...] "Water from the Alster", a river around which the city of Hamburg is situated).

500|$|This [...] "new way" [...] {{of telling}} a story in Finnegans Wake {{takes the form of}} a {{discontinuous}} dream-narrative, with abrupt changes to characters, character names, locations and plot details resulting in the absence of a discernible linear narrative, causing Herring to argue that the plot of Finnegans Wake [...] "is unstable in that there is no one plot from beginning to end, but rather many recognizable stories and plot types with familiar and unfamiliar twists, told from varying perspectives." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy expands on this idea of a non-linear, digressive narrative with the contention that [...] "throughout much of Finnegans Wake, what appears to be an attempt to tell a story is often diverted, interrupted, or reshaped into something else, for example a commentary on a narrative with conflicting or unverifiable details." [...] In other words, while crucial plot points – such as HCE's crime or ALP's letter – are endlessly discussed, the reader never encounters or experiences them first hand, and as the details are constantly changing, they remain unknown and perhaps unknowable. Suzette Henke has accordingly described Finnegans Wake as an aporia. Joyce himself tacitly acknowledged this radically different approach to language and plot in a 1926 letter to Harriet Weaver, outlining his intentions for the book: [...] "One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot." [...] Critics have seen a precedent for the book's plot presentation in Laurence Sterne's famously digressive The Life and Opinions of Tristram <b>Shandy,</b> Gentleman, with Thomas Keymer stating that [...] "Tristram <b>Shandy</b> was a natural touchstone for James Joyce as he explained his attempt [...] "to build many planes of narrative with a single esthetic purpose" [...] in Finnegans Wake".|$|E
500|$|Three Horses Beer (better {{known locally}} as THB) is a pale lager that has been brewed by Star Breweries of Madagascar since 1958. It is the highest selling beer in Madagascar and has been {{described}} as emblematic of the country. THB is sold nationwide and since 2005 has been exported to such markets as France, Reunion Island, Comoros and Mayotte. The Malagasy beer is produced at two breweries in Madagascar, the first centrally located in Antsirabe and the other in the northern city of Antsiranana. [...] THB Pilsener, the most common variant of THB, has a light taste and is produced from mostly local barley, corn and hops. Star Breweries also produces THB Fresh (a <b>shandy</b> with less than 1% alcohol), THB Special (6.2% alcohol), and THB Lite (1% alcohol). Recent investments in Star Brewery infrastructure have allowed a 20% increase in production since 2011.|$|E

40|$|In William Kentridge’s {{tapestries}} entitled Streets of the City, {{a series}} of maps {{of the city of}} Naples and its Kingdom serves as background for the eccentric wanderings of an equestrian Nose inspired by a line of writers of the absurd, from Cervantes to Sterne and Gogol, which had attracted the artist’s attention from the time of his preliminary work for the production of Shostakovich’s opera The Nose. 	My paper aims to discuss the central role played by Sterne along this line of estranging noses by focusing on the brief but significant section the South-African artist devotes to Tristram <b>Shandy’s</b> author in his notable lecture/performance on the absurd, which comes to do full justice both to Sterne’s consummate art of interpolation and to his crafty authorial investment in all sorts of mistranslation...|$|R
50|$|The doctor's {{involvement}} in the birth of Tristram and the resulting facial mutilation {{is in keeping with}} the obstetrical blunders of the time. His presence reflects a general level of concern on behalf of husbands for the safety of their wives, given the dogmatic and often harmful notions put forth in treatises intended to instruct midwives on the topic, to which doctors were not necessarily beholden. The usage of forceps on the part of doctors is one such instance where the two parties diverged. However, it must not be forgotten that Dr. Slop's inclusion in the delivery drama was a result of Walter <b>Shandy's</b> insistence on the podalic version of Tristram's fetus. The traumatic outcome of the birth is ultimately indicative of the hazardous nature of childbirth at the time as well as the inadequacy (sloppiness) of those {{at the cutting edge of}} the medical profession.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} common features in Swift, Pope and Sterne’s responses to Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy {{and the wider}} humoral tradition. It documents the willingness of Swift and Pope simultaneously to take the latter discourse seriously—even to value humoral delusion—and yet to satirize its explanatory pretensions and the behavioural states it postulates; their tendency, also, to take a Janus-faced view of associated kinds of madness, affirming and deriding these concurrently. Sterne then recapitulates that stance in assuming a double perspective on hobby-horsical tendencies, and he combines this with {{a feel for the}} pathos and yet also delight which accompany the inevitable failure of Tristram <b>Shandy’s</b> encyclopaedic pretensions. Swift and Sterne especially derive these dual perspectives from qualities incipient in the Anatomy, qualities which Burton had kept in check. In that respect, they (with Pope) transform humoral thinking into a sceptical resource, finding in it material supportive of an ironizing mind-set that willingly entertains multiple contradictory ideas at once. Such sceptical perspectivism is, I argue, characteristic of all three eighteenth-century authors discussed here and highlights their anticipation of Romantic irony...|$|R
