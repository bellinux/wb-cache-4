40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} sending states’ {{concerns for}} the well-being of citizens abroad. Using the concept of transnationalism, I will first discuss the historical evolution of sending’s states involvement in emigration decisions and their relations with citizens residing abroad members of the diaspora. Second, focusing on a trend of the literature on “diaspora policies”, I will demonstrate that —while <b>sending</b> <b>states</b> most frequently develop economic and political programmes towards citizens— diaspora policies now increasingly include welfare. This, I argue in the third part of the chapter, contributes to transnationalization of welfare. Developing the concept of transnational social protection from below and from above, I show that immigrants’ access to social protection goes beyond welfare policies adopted by receiving states but also include numerous <b>sending</b> <b>states</b> policies as well as informal strategies developed by immigrants together with market, community and family actors. Finally, this chapter concludes with a discussion on the implications of <b>sending</b> <b>states</b> involvements in expatriates’ welfare for future research on migration. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Migration policy {{research}} is biased towards receiving countries. Furthermore, even emigration policies are generally evaluated against {{their ability to}} control migration. This article asserts that 'filling the sending-country gap' should go beyond the role of policies in shaping (or reducing) migration. It should instead reflect the broader development goals of emigration policies, taking into consideration the capabilities of <b>sending</b> <b>states.</b> In this 'age of migration', it is striking how little we know about how policies can best be used by <b>sending</b> <b>states</b> {{as a tool for}} poverty alleviation, human capital development and labor market integration - {{even in the face of}} restrictive immigration policies on the other side of the border. One should also consider the aspirations of <b>sending</b> <b>states</b> in leveraging migration for development.
