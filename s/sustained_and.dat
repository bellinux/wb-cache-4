5|$|Napier {{assisted}} in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful Axis invasion. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to Alexandria, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later Napier was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve German dive-bombers. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the stern, the engine room and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were <b>sustained</b> <b>and</b> the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in Port Said under repair.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} typhoon intensity, Kirogi began to undergo rapid intensification. Roughly 18hours later, the JTWC {{reported that the}} storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 215km/h (135mph 1-minute sustained), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. By this time, the typhoon was situated roughly 870km (540mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm featured a 59km (37mi) wide symmetrical eye. Early on July5, the JMA reported that Kirogi attained its peak intensity with winds of 155km/h (100mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 940mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). The storm was a relatively large typhoon, with a gale diameter of 520km (325mi).|$|E
5|$|On October18, another {{period of}} {{intensification}} took {{place as the}} storm neared the northern Philippines. Early in the day, Elsie was upgraded to a super typhoon, a storm with winds of at least 240km/h (150mph). Hours before making landfall in Luzon, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 898hPa (mbar). The peak intensity of Elsie was assessed by the JMA at the same time. They reported that the typhoon attained winds of 175km/h (115mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar). The center of Elsie crossed the Philippine coastline at around 0300UTC on October19.|$|E
5|$|The system {{remained}} nearly stationary {{over the}} northwestern Coral Sea. Early on 23 February, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 985hPa (mbar). However, the JTWC assessed {{the system to}} have been slightly weaker, attaining peak winds of 85km/h (50mph 1-minute sustained). Further intensification was anticipated as Kate slowly tracked towards Queensland, Australia. However, Kate stalled shortly thereafter and began to weaken due to increasing wind shear. Rapid weakening took place throughout the day, and JTWC declared the system dissipated early on 24 February. The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Kate to a tropical low around the same time, although they continued to monitor the storm for several more hours before reporting that it had dissipated over open waters.|$|E

5|$|Throughout September16, Wipha {{underwent}} {{a brief period}} of rapid intensification, with the JTWC upgrading it to a Category1 hurricane, on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, within 12hours. The intensifying system maintained a northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge over the northwest Pacific. Early on September17, Wipha was upgraded to a typhoon as 10-minute sustained winds reached 120km/h (75mph). A second round of rapid intensification took place through most of the day, leading to the typhoon attaining its peak intensity late on September17 with winds of 185km/h (115mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 925mbar (hPa; 27.31inHg). At the same time, the JTWC assessed Wipha to have nearly attained Category5 status, peaking as a high-end Category4 super typhoon with winds of 250km/h (155mph 1-minute sustained). Upon reaching this intensity, Wipha became the second strongest storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Herbie {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure on 17May 1988 northwest of the Cocos Islands. Later that day, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring the system as a tropical low. Several hours after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 21S, having attained winds of 45km/h (30mph 1-minute sustained). Following slight development, the system intensified into a Category1 cyclone and was given the name Herbie by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology early on 18May. Several hours after being named, the storm attained its initial peak intensity with winds of 75km/h (45mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 990hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Kate was a {{short-lived}} Category 2 cyclone that remained nearly stationary for its entire {{existence in the}} northwestern Coral Sea in February 2006. Forming out of a monsoonal trough on 22 February, Kate rapidly intensified throughout the day. By 23 February, the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 985hPa (mbar). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear caused the storm to quickly weaken. By 24 February, the system dissipated over open waters near Queensland, Australia. Although Kate did not directly affect land, large swells produced by the storm impaced beaches in Papua New Guinea and Queensland. The waves injured six people in Australia, although no property damage was reported.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Etau was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004. Forming on August8, 2009 {{from an area}} of low pressure, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking in a curved path {{around the edge of}} a subtropical ridge, Etau continued to intensify as it neared Japan. By August10, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75km/h (45mph 10-minute <b>sustained)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 992hPa (mbar). Shortly after, Etau began to weaken. Increasing wind shear led to the center becoming devoid of convection and the system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August13. The remnants of Etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on August16.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it <b>sustained</b> <b>and</b> requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 13 May, the 10th Panzer Division slipped into {{position}} upstream to the north-east of Sedan, ready to strike at its designated crossing point near the town of Wadelincourt. Downstream, the 2nd Panzer Division moved into position to cross at Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division prepared to strike at the Gaulier bridgehead, in the centre of Sedan's tactical front. It was on the northern bend of the Sedan Meuse loop that the Luftwaffe was to make its maximum effort, between Gaulier and Wadelincourt. To supplement his air support, Guderian stripped most of his Panzer Divisions of their artillery, which he then positioned directly opposite Gaulier. However, the artillery regiments lacked ammunition. <b>Sustained</b> <b>and</b> damaging bombardment through shelling was impossible. The Luftwaffe {{was going to have to}} do most of the work. Guderian reported that his Corps had only 141 artillery pieces against the French 174. To the north and south of Sedan, the French X Corps and French XXXXI Corps (at the artillery fortress at Charleville-Mézières) could also add their artillery and shell Guderian's Panzer units as they crossed the bridgeheads. The slow advance of artillery units to the front added to the German numerical inferiority, which was now 1:3 against. Only in the afternoon did the German artillery make an appearance, but with little effect. The 2nd Panzer Division was forced to attack without artillery support. For these reasons, Guderian had decided the outcome depended on the quality of air support, acting as flying artillery.|$|E
