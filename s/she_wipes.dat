5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E
500|$|... "The Dreamscape", the season's ninth episode, was co-written {{by staff}} writer Zack Whedon and playwright Julia Cho. It was Whedon's first {{contribution}} to the series, and Cho's second. In an interview fifteen days before the broadcast of [...] "The Dreamscape", showrunner and executive producer Jeff Pinkner stated that it and several surrounding episodes would be [...] "stand-alone in quality, {{but at the same}} time we [...] start to peel back another layer of the onion" [...] to transition the second half of the season into a [...] "new chapter." [...] Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to [...] "lighten up" [...] during the first season, [...] "but every time she did, something would happen." [...] The writers inputted small scenes to shine more light on her character, which included Olivia dressing up for a night out but then [...] "the phone rings. It’s Broyles, and <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> the lipstick off, puts on a coat, and goes out. That’s it. You’re on call. She breaks my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E

He closed his eyes, and <b>she</b> <b>wiped</b> his cheeks and his mouth. Still {{he did not}} look at her. She bent very close to him, feeling her heart crushed with grief for him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Though the Indian women breed fowl {{and other}} {{domestic}} animals in their cottages, they never eat them: and even conceive such {{a fondness for}} them, {{that they will not}} sell them, much less kill them with their own hands. So that if a stranger who is obliged to pass the night in one of their cottages, offers ever so much money for a fowl, they refuse to part with it, and he finds himself under the necessity of killing the fowl himself. At this his landlady shrieks, dissolves into tears, and wrings her hands, {{as if it had been}} an only son, till seeing the mischief past mending, <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> her eyes and quietly takes what the traveller offers her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Margaret {{looks at}} {{documents}} lying on open cover of dispatch box and glancing quickly about room, takes a sudden resolution. She seizes documents, makes {{as if to}} run wildly from the room, stops abruptly to reconsider, and changes her mind. She looks about room for a hiding place, and her eyes rest on portrait of Lincoln. Moving swiftly, picking up a light chair on the way, she goes to corner of bookcase nearest to portrait, steps on chair, and from chair to ledge of bookcase where, clinging, she reaches out and up and drops documents behind portrait. Stepping quickly down, with handkerchief <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> ledge on which she has stood, also {{the seat of the}} chair.

6000|$|Corinna, {{pride of}} Drury-Lane, For whom no {{shepherd}} sighs in vain; Never did Covent-Garden boast So bright a batter'd strolling toast! No drunken rake {{to pick her}} up, No cellar where on tick to sup; Returning at the midnight hour, Four stories climbing to her bower; Then, seated on a three-legg'd chair, Takes off her artificial hair; Now picking out a crystal eye, <b>She</b> <b>wipes</b> it clean, and lays it by. Her eyebrows from a mouse's hide Stuck on with art on either side, Pulls off with care, and first displays 'em, Then in a play-book smoothly lays 'em. Now dext'rously her plumpers draws, That serve to fill her hollow jaws, Untwists a wire, and from her gums A set of teeth completely comes; Pulls out the rags contrived to prop Her flabby dugs, and down they drop. Proceeding on, the lovely goddess Unlaces next her steel-ribb'd bodice, Which, by the operator's skill, Press down the lumps, the hollows fill. Up goes her hand, and off she slips The bolsters that supply her hips; With gentlest touch she next explores Her chancres, issues, running sores; Effects of many a sad disaster, And then to each applies a plaster: But must, before she goes to bed, Rub off the daubs of white and red, And smooth the furrows in her front With greasy paper stuck upon't. She takes a bolus ere she sleeps; And then between two blankets creeps. With pains of love tormented lies; Or, if she chance to close her eyes, Of Bridewell[1] and the Compter[1] dreams, And feels the lash, and faintly screams; Or, by a faithless bully drawn, At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn; Or to Jamaica[2] seems transported Alone, and by no planter courted; Or, near Fleet-ditch's[3] oozy brinks, Surrounded with a hundred stinks, Belated, seems on watch to lie, And snap some cully passing by; Or, struck with fear, her fancy runs On watchmen, constables, and duns, From whom she meets with frequent rubs; But never from religious clubs; Whose favour she is sure to find, Because she pays them all in kind. [...] Corinna wakes. A dreadful sight! Behold {{the ruins of the}} night! A wicked rat her plaster stole, Half eat, and dragg'd it to his hole. The crystal eye, alas! was miss'd; And puss had on her plumpers p--st, A pigeon pick'd her issue-pease: And Shock her tresses fill'd with fleas. [...] The nymph, though in this mangled plight Must ev'ry morn her limbs unite. But how shall I describe her arts To re-collect the scatter'd parts? Or show the anguish, toil, and pain, Of gath'ring up herself again? The bashful Muse will never bear In such a scene to interfere. Corinna, in the morning dizen'd, Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison'd.|$|E

50|$|In Layers (2011), she {{presents}} her self-portrait in two large-scale simultaneous projections which move in coordinated timing. In {{the first}} projection she applies clay {{to her face}} and covers {{the surface of the}} face while in the second projection <b>she</b> <b>wipes</b> her face with her hand and, in doing so, cleans its surface to reveal her face underneath. In this symmetrical composition, which can be aggressively confrontational, she employs clay as a metaphorical tool for articulating transformation of internal and external selves. By exploring the notion of masking identity, Haleh focuses on alienation and transformation of one's self. Masking alludes to one of the iconic characteristics of identity perceived in a different cultural context as means of transforming, disguising or displaying identity.|$|E

Instead of teamwork, the team is infused into one previously passive being, a mecha-human designed to defeat the dream monster. Alice {{is one of the}} few true and ongoing Final Girls; she survives two films, saves her child from demonic possession, and disappears from the Nightmare on Elm Street world without ever succumbing to the inevitability of death in a future installment.|$|E
