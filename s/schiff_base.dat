5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E

These <b>Schiff</b> <b>bases</b> were obtained as colored crystalline solids. The proton NMR spectra of these compounds showed a doublet for the NH protons indicating a keto tautomer for these <b>Schiff</b> <b>bases.</b> The pyridyl-substituted <b>Schiff</b> <b>bases</b> containing hydroxyl moiety {{were found to}} show the most downfield shift for the NH protons in DMSO solvent, and this was rationalized due {{to the formation of}} a six- and five-membered ring using hydrogen bonds for these two compounds. Correspondingly, the olefinic proton of the <b>Schiff</b> <b>bases</b> is also found to be a doublet due to coupling to the amine proton.

25|$|In {{this first}} usage the oxazoline ligand {{performed}} poorly, giving an ee of 4.9% compared to 65.6% {{from one of}} the <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> ligands. However Brunner reinvestigated oxazoline ligands during research into the monophenylation of diols, leading to the development of chiral pyridine oxazoline ligands, which achieved ee's of 30.2% in 1986 and 45% in 1989. In the same year Pfaltz et al. reported the use of C2‑symmetric semicorrin ligands for enantioselective carbenoid cyclopropanations, achieving impressive results with ee's of between 92-97%. Reference was made to both Brunner's and Aratani's work, however the design of the ligands was also largely based on his earlier work with various macrocycles. A disadvantage of these ligands however, was that they required a multi-step synthesis with a low overall yield of approximately 30%.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E

For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with [...] to form a diastereoisomeric salt which is fractionally crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine. Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale. In addition, several enantioselective syntheses of amphetamine {{have been developed}}. In one example, optically pure [...] is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral <b>Schiff</b> <b>base.</b> [...] In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group.

2500|$|The human enzyme cystathionine β-synthase is a tetramer and {{comprises}} 551 {{amino acids}} with a subunit molecular weight of 61 kDa. It displays a modular organization of three modules with the N-terminal heme domain {{followed by a}} core that contains the PLP cofactor. The cofactor is deep in the heme domain and is linked by a <b>Schiff</b> <b>base.</b> A <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> is a functional group containing a C=N bond with the nitrogen atom connected to an aryl or alkyl group. The heme domain is composed of 70 amino acids {{and it appears that}} the heme only exists in mammalian CBS and is absent in yeast and protozoan CBS. [...] At the C-terminus, the regulatory domain of CBS contains a tandem repeat of two CBS domains of β-α-β-β-α, a secondary structure motif found in other proteins. [...] CBS has a C-terminal inhibitory domain. The C-terminal domain of cystathionine β-synthase regulates its activity via both intrasteric and allosteric effects and is important for maintaining the tetrameric state of the protein. This inhibition is alleviated by binding of the allosteric effector, adoMet, or by deletion of the regulatory domain; however, the magnitude of the effects differ. Mutations in this domain are correlated with hereditary diseases.|$|E
2500|$|The heme domain {{contains}} an N-terminal loop that binds heme {{and provides the}} axial ligands C52 and H65. [...] The distance of heme from the PLP binding site suggests its non-role in catalysis, however deletion of the heme domain causes loss of redox sensitivity, therefore it is hypothesized that heme is a redox sensor. The presence of protoporphyrin IX in CBS is a unique PLP-dependent enzyme and is only found in the mammalian CBS. [...] D. melanogaster and D. discoides have truncated N-terminal extensions and therefore prevent the conserved histidine and cysteine heme ligand residues. [...] However, the Anopheles gambiae sequence has a longer N-terminal extension than the human enzyme and contains the conserved histidine and cysteine heme ligand residues like the human heme. [...] Therefore, {{it is possible that}} CBS in slime molds and insects are hemeproteins that suggest that the heme domain is an early evolutionary innovation that arose before the separation of animals and the slime molds. The PLP is an internal aldimine and forms a <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> with K119 in the active site. [...] Between the catalytic and regulatory domains exists a hypersensitive site that causes proteolytic cleavage and produces a truncated dimeric enzyme that is more active than the original enzyme. [...] Both truncated enzyme and the enzyme found in yeast are not regulated by adoMet. The yeast enzyme is also activated by the deletion of the C-terminal to produce the dimeric enzyme.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of threonine ammonia-lyase {{is analogous to}} other deaminating PLP enzymes in its use of <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> intermediates.

After deprotonation of the amino acid alpha carbon and subsequent dehydration (hence the common name threonine dehydratase), a new <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> is formed.
