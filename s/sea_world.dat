5|$|In January 2008, the Gold Coast City Council {{released}} {{plans for}} a Mack Rides Water Coaster at <b>Sea</b> <b>World.</b> The ride would have been located {{at the front of}} the park, with the ride's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the main track extending out and over the car park. These plans were shelved. In December 2008, <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> opened Jet Rescue, an Intamin JetSki Coaster.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
5|$|Original {{plans for}} a Water Coaster at <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> were {{released}} by the local council in 2008; however, they were put on hold. In 2010, the Bermuda Triangle ride closed, sitting dormant until mid-2012 when construction for the Storm Coaster began. After demolition works were completed, track for the Storm Coaster arrived at <b>Sea</b> <b>World,</b> taking five months to erect. Storm Coaster officially {{opened to the public}} on 6 December 2013.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting Killer Whales in Washington in 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the hunting of Killer Whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa <b>Sea</b> <b>World,</b> Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E

5|$|Edwin's renown comes {{largely from}} his {{treatment}} {{at some length}} by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith's sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be something less than {{a key figure in}} Britain {{during the first half of}} the 7th century. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin's reign lay in his failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish <b>sea</b> <b>world</b> for generations.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, {{have been}} kept in captivity in various marine parks, arguably {{starting}} the late 1940s. Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity. Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan {{have been kept}} in aquariums and oceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii were taken into captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s, two of which were placed at SeaWorld in San Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. There {{have been a few}} exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female short-finned pilot whale, who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.|$|E

25|$|Jet Rescue is a steel {{launched}} jet ski {{roller coaster}} made by Intamin that opened on 26 December 2008 at <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> on the Gold Coast, Australia. The ride {{has a very}} twisted and banked layout with several fast directional changes. Unlike other family launch roller coasters, Jet Rescue features two launches. The ride features a unique jet ski style of seating with lap bar restraints. The ride is based upon Sea World's Research and Rescue Foundation performing the rescue of a sea lion.|$|E
25|$|The ride's queue begins {{alongside}} the unload station and continues in one long stretch towards the load station. When {{in line with}} the load station, the queue performs several switchbacks before allowing riders to line up alongside air gates to let them on the ride. On {{the far side of the}} load station several television monitors loop through a video explaining how to get on the ride. The video also details that the riders' mission is to rescue a trapped sea lion for the <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> Research and Rescue Foundation.|$|E

25|$|An animal {{theme park}} is a {{combination}} of an amusement park and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. Marine mammal parks such as <b>Sea</b> <b>World</b> and Marineland are more elaborate dolphinariums keeping whales, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as a stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, Disney's Animal Kingdom and Gatorland in Orlando, Florida, Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire, England, and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May, Saga Rose {{reached the}} harbour of Shanghai, China.

In 2003, the same yard scrapped <b>Sea</b> <b>World,</b> the former King Alexander, and Nanny, a 245,000 ton oil tanker that ranked as the fourth largest ship ever built.
