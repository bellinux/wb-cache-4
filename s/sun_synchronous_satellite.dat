The question was asked how many times per year (on the average) do the sub-satellite points of two satellites simultaneously come within D kilometers of each other? For the Space Station (altitude: 500 km, inclination: 28 deg) and a <b>Sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> (altitude 705 km, inclination 98. 21 deg) the answers are 16, 41 and 82 times per year for encounter distances D of 20, 50, and 100 km respectively. The relationship between encounters per year and distance D is linear. The answers were obtained in two ways: (1) a closed form statistical approach which led to a simple algebraic expression, and (2) a Monte Carlo type computer solution.

40|$|The {{visibility}} {{times and}} communication link dynamics for the Earth Observations Satellite (EOS) -McMurdo Sound direct downlinks have been studied. The 16 day EOS periodicity may be shown with the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) {{and the entire}} 16 day period should be simulated for representative link statistics. We desire many attributes of the downlink, however, and a faster orbital determination method is desirable. We use the method of osculating elements for speed and accuracy in simulating the EOS orbit. The accuracy of the method of osculating elements is demonstrated by closely reproducing the observed 16 day Landsat periodicity. An autocorrelation function method is used to show the correlation spike at 16 days. The entire 16 day record of passes over McMurdo Sound is then used to generate statistics for innage time, outage time, elevation angle, antenna angle rates, and propagation loss. The levation angle probability density function is compared with 1967 analytic approximation which {{has been used for}} medium to high altitude satellites. One practical result of this comparison is seen to be the rare occurrence of zenith passes. The new result is functionally different than the earlier result, with a heavy emphasis on low elevation angles. EOS is one of a large class of <b>sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellites</b> which may be downlinked to McMurdo Sound.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{estimate}} sampling errors of area-time averaged rain rate due to temporal samplings by satellites. In particular, the sampling errors of the proposed low inclination orbit satellite of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (35 deg inclination and 350 km altitude), one of the <b>sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> polar orbiting <b>satellites</b> of NOAA series (98. 89 deg inclination and 833 km altitude), and two simultaneous <b>sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> polar orbiting <b>satellites</b> [...] assumed to carry a perfect passive microwave sensor for direct rainfall measurements [...] will be estimated. This estimate is done by performing {{a study of the}} satellite orbits and the autocovariance function of the area-averaged rain rate time series. A model based on an exponential fit of the autocovariance function is used for actual calculations. Varying visiting intervals and total coverage of averaging area on each visit by the satellites are taken into account in the model. The data are generated by a General Circulation Model (GCM).

Techniques are presented for calibrating geostationary satellite data with <b>Sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> radiances and for converting narrowband radiances to top-of-theatmosphere fluxes and albedos. A methodology is documented for combining geostationary visible and infrared radiances with surface-based temperature observations to derive cloud amount, optical depth, height, thickness, temperature, and albedo.

This paper proposes the conceptual {{design of the}} satellite constellation and the satellite to realize the GNSS-RO/R mission based on the cubesat platform, with the goal to achieve cost effectiveness and minimum deployed schedule. The cubesat considered in the study is 6 U and within 10 kilogram. The proposed innovative constellation consists of 12 (minimum required) plus 6 (backup) satellites on three 500 km altitude <b>sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> planes, 6 <b>satellites</b> even phasing on each plane. It {{is expected to have}} 3000 profile measurements per day at minimum (3600 profiles as a goal). The payload instrument will be able to collect RO/R measurements via GPS and GLONASS. The mission lifetime is 3 years. The on-orbit redundancy, instead of redundant satellite components, is adapted to increase system reliability. The satellite design of this study faces very tough challenging to meet the 10 -kg mass constraint. The proposed solutions to lower down mass include the creative payload design, the plasma thruster based reaction control subsystem and attitude control subsystem, the use of special non-space grade made-in-Taiwan components, and the creative mission scheduling among satellites to optimize daily global coverage with limited duty cycle of each satellite (the duty cycle can not be 100 % because of mass saving on solar array and battery). The study demonstrates the feasibility to achieve the system design. The lessons learned of the system design study have also been introduced.

40|$|The space-based surveillance, {{which would}} mainly use the space-based visible, has great value for civil and {{military}} applications currently {{and for a}} fairly long future period. In space-based surveillance, the visible and near-infrared radiation characteristics of the space target are influenced by its attitude variation. This influence is especially prominent in space-based imaging. In some ways, solar radiation cannot arrive at {{the surface of the}} space target, or the arriving radiation is not uniformly distributed because of the space target&# 39;s strong reflection at a particular position. In order to solve these problems, the visible and near-infrared illumination characteristics of the space target surface are analyzed. Moreover, a notion that earth&# 39;s reflective radiation can be used as illumination for space target imaging is given, and an accurate modeling method is proposed. Firstly, based on diffuse reflectance model, a method of mathematically calculating the illumination at space target&# 39;s position from earth&# 39;s reflective radiation is established. And a formula for calculating illumination is derived. Secondly, the coordinates of sun and space target at any time can be obtained by the Satellite tool kit software, in which the complicated multiplying matrix and coordinate transformation algorithm introduced in some references are avoided. Thirdly, the method of estimating earth&# 39;s reflective radiation region at arbitrary moment is introduced. The grid division method is generated and the uniform sampling is used in each small area. Fourthly, the position of a surface cell is transformed from the sphere reference frame into the J 2000. 0 inertial frame. The earth&# 39;s reflective radiation can be calculated through numerical integration. Finally, the illumination from earth&# 39;s reflective radiation to a <b>sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> orbit <b>satellite</b> in an imaging mission based on space is calculated by the given parameters. The results show that the earth&# 39;s reflective radiation is luminous enough for space target imaging when the satellite passes through arctic. When the satellite moves on the orbit, we can obtain more detailed information about target satellites&# 39; bottom then the ground simulation imaging. The on-orbit imaging results demonstrate the validity of the modeling method, which could support the foundation of our space-based surveillance system theoretically and technically and {{could be used as a}} reference of space-based orbit measurement and determination in deep space exploration...|$|R

The linear error analysis computer program used includes the effects of ground tracking station location uncertainties, measurement noise and biases, and station timing bias.

40|$|XSAT, {{launched}} on 20 April 2011, {{is the first}} micro-satellite designed and built in Singapore. It orbits the Earth at altitude of 822 km in a <b>sun</b> <b>synchronous</b> orbit. The <b>satellite</b> carries a multispectral camera IRIS with three spectral bands – 0. 52 ~ 0. 60 mm for Green, 0. 63 ~ 0. 69 mm for Red and 0. 76 ~ 0. 89 mm for NIR at 12 m resolution. In the design of IRIS camera, the three bands were acquired by three lines of CCDs (NIR, Red and Green). These CCDs were physically separated in the focal plane and their first pixels not absolutely aligned. The micro-satellite platform was also not stable enough to allow for co-registration of the 3 bands with simple linear transformation. In the camera model developed, this platform stability was compensated with 3 rd to 4 th order polynomials for the satellite's roll, pitch and yaw attitude angles. With the camera model, the camera parameters such as the band to band separations, the alignment of the CCDs relative to each other, {{as well as the}} focal length of the camera can be validated or calibrated. The results of calibration with more than 20 images showed that the band to band along-track separation agreed well with the pre-flight values provided by the vendor (0. 093 ° and 0. 046 ° for the NIR vs red and for green vs red CCDs respectively). The cross-track alignments were 0. 05 pixel and 5. 9 pixel for the NIR vs red and green vs red CCDs respectively. The focal length was found to be shorter by about 0. 8 %. This was attributed to the lower operating temperature which XSAT is currently operating.
