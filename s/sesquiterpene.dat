40|$|Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) of Borneo {{appear to}} be unique in having species-specific {{compositions}} of terpenoid compounds in their chemical profi les, which are likely derived from plant resins 1. Whole groups of terpenes (e. g. <b>sesquiterpenes)</b> {{can be found in}} the chemical profi le of some species, but are missing in the profi le of others. We investigated the role of <b>sesquiterpenes</b> in inter- and intraspecifi c aggression. <b>Sesquiterpenes,</b> abundant in the chemical profi le of several bees, were added to the chemical profi le of Tetragonula melanocephala, a species that does not express <b>sesquiterpenes</b> in its own profi le. Such modifi ed profi les signifi cantly reduced aggression in T. melanocephala in intercolonial encounters, suggesting that cuticular <b>sesquiterpenes</b> confuse T. melanocephala bees by “masking” their actual profi le. This mechanism may explain why bee species without <b>sesquiterpenes</b> in their chemical profi le barely show aggression towards species with <b>sesquiterpenes.</b> <b>Sesquiterpenes</b> may promote aggregated nesting in Bornean stingless bees, particularly between species with and without <b>sesquiterpenes.</b> Moreover, terpenes and their infl uence on aggression may provide a potential explanation for the widespread occurrence of aggregated nesting in paleotropical stingless bees, which seems to be absent among their highly aggressive neotropical relatives...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and {{have the potential to}} be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various <b>sesquiterpene</b> compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|Artemisinin is a <b>sesquiterpene</b> lactone {{containing}} a peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis is not edible. Although reputedly mild tasting, {{eating it}} {{will result in}} {{vomiting}} which generally occurs 30 minutes to two hours after consumption and lasts for several hours. There is no diarrhea and patients recover without lasting ill-effects. Its toxicity was first mentioned by Anthony M. Young in his 1982 guidebook Common Australian Fungi. The toxic ingredient of many species of Omphalotus is a <b>sesquiterpene</b> compound known as illudin S. This, along with illudin M and a co-metabolite illudosin, {{have been identified in}} O.nidiformis.

40|$|Social insects aggressively {{defend their}} nest and {{surrounding}} against non-nestmates, which they recognize by an unfamiliar profile of aliphatic hydrocarbons on the cuticle. Prominent exceptions are communal nest aggregations of stingless bees. Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are also unique in possessing cuticular terpenes which {{are derived from}} tree resins and {{have not yet been}} reported for any other insect. We showed experimentally that <b>sesquiterpenes</b> from the body surface of the communal nesting bee Tetragonilla collina reduced aggression in otherwise aggressive bees which did not have <b>sesquiterpenes</b> themselves. In the field, bee species nesting in aggregations with T. collina often lack <b>sesquiterpenes</b> in their own cuticular profiles. These species show little aggression towards T. collina, whereas it can be heavily attacked by non-aggregated species that also possess cuticular <b>sesquiterpenes.</b> We conclude that appeasement by <b>sesquiterpenes</b> represents a novel mechanism to achieve interspecific tolerance in social insects...|$|R
40|$|As {{important}} {{members of}} the terpenes family, <b>sesquiterpenes</b> represent a group of natural compounds with diverse skeletal types. Among them, the eremophilane-type <b>sesquiterpenes,</b> widely present in several genera (such as Ligularia, Senecio, Cacalia) of Asteraceae, account for {{a small number of}} natural compounds and form differently from other <b>sesquiterpenes</b> because they challenged the isoprene rule of biosynthesis.

5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including <b>sesquiterpene</b> lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the <b>sesquiterpene</b> panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, {{artemisinin}} is a <b>sesquiterpene</b> lactone containing {{an unusual}} peroxide bridge. This peroxide {{is believed to}} be responsible for the drug's mechanism of action. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sesquiterpenes,</b> 15 -carbon {{compounds}} {{formed from}} three isoprenoid units, {{are the main}} components of plant essential oils. <b>Sesquiterpenes</b> occur in human food, but they are principally taken as components of many folk medicines and dietary supplements. The aim of our study was to test and compare the potential inhibitory effect of acyclic <b>sesquiterpenes,</b> trans-nerolidol, cis-nerolidol and farnesol, on the activities of the main xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in rat and human liver in vitro. Rat and human subcellular fractions, relatively specific substrates, corresponding coenzymes and HPLC, spectrophotometric or spectrofluorometric analysis of product formation were used. The results showed significant inhibition of cytochromes P 450 (namely CYP 1 A, CYP 2 B and CYP 3 A subfamilies) activities by all tested <b>sesquiterpenes</b> in rat as well as in human hepatic microsomes. On the other hand, all tested <b>sesquiterpenes</b> did not significantly affect the activities of carbonyl-reducing enzymes and conjugation enzymes. The results indicate that acyclic <b>sesquiterpenes</b> might affect CYP 1 A, CYP 2 B and CYP 3 A mediated metabolism of concurrently administered drugs and other xenobiotics.

40|$|Abstract — The {{transfer}} of monoterpenes and <b>sesquiterpenes</b> from forages into milk fat was stud-ied {{in a group}} of cows fed successively with forages containing high and low amounts of these sub-stances. In a first 24 -d period the cows received 11 kg of a cocksfoot hay containing low quantities of monoterpenes and <b>sesquiterpenes.</b> In a second 36 -d period, 3 kg of the cocksfoot were replaced by 3 kg of yarrow, a plant rich in terpenoids. In a third 24 -d period the cows returned to the cocksfoot-based diet they were fed in the first period. The quantities of monoterpenes and <b>sesquiterpenes</b> des-orbed from the milk fat were measured by dynamic headspace – gas chromatography – mass spec-trometry. Results showed that the quantities of monoterpenes had increased by the first milking carried out 8 h after ingestion of yarrow, whereas the increase in the quantities of <b>sesquiterpenes</b> was observed only after the third milking, 32 h after the diet change. The maximal quantities of monoterpenes and <b>sesquiterpenes</b> were measured after 4 d of the yarrow-enriched diet, after which the total quantities decreased, despite the constant supply of yarrow. Four days after discontinuing yarrow the amounts of monoterpenes and <b>sesquiterpenes</b> desorbed from the milk fat reverted to those measured during the first period...|$|R
25|$|A {{range of}} polysaccharides {{have been found}} in the {{extracellular}} and intracellular compartments of M. plumbeus including fucose, glucose, galactose and mannose. Glucuronic acid, a carbohydrate with a similar structure to glucose, is located specifically in the extracellular region of M. plumbeus. The monosaccharide glucosamine was found only in the intracellular regions of M. plumbeus. Mucor plumbeus has the ability to detoxify pentachlorophenol and has been used in the biotransformation of other products. Incubation of M. plumbeus with the natural product maalioxide produces three metabolites (1,7 and 9 β-hydroxymaalioxide). Mucor plumbeus activity towards camphorquinone is stereoselective. Extracts of Mucor plumbeus have shown acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition activity. Mucor plumbeus is able to biocatalyze the hydroxylation of terpenes and steroids by cytochrome p450 enzymes in the presence of O and cofactor NADPH. Mucor plumbeus also transforms <b>sesquiterpene</b> into a series of 12 degradation products of 10,15-epoxidation. As well, squamulosone (aromadendr-1(10)-en-9-one) is biotransformed by M. plumbeus to yield an array of terpenes.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a <b>sesquiterpene</b> originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E

About 85% of the yellow-coloured dihydroazulene are esterified with stearic acid and about 15% with {{linoleic}} acid. If the fruit body is injured, the free <b>sesquiterpene</b> [...] – a dihydroazulene alcohol – is released enzymatically. Several products are produced from it through oxidation: the yellow-coloured aldehyde delicial (1-formyl-6, 7-dihydro-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene), the purple-coloured aldehyde lactarovioline (1-formyl-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene), and the blue-coloured alcohol deterrol (1-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene).

500|$|Cyathus striatus {{has proven}} to be a rich source of {{bioactive}} chemical compounds. It was first reported in 1971 to produce [...] "indolic" [...] substances (compounds with an indole ring structure) as well as a complex of diterpenoid antibiotic compounds collectively known as cyathins. Several years later, research revealed the indolic substances to be compounds now known as striatins. Striatins (A, B and C) have antibiotic activity against fungi imperfecti, and various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. C.striatus also produces <b>sesquiterpene</b> compounds called schizandronols. It also contains the triterpene compounds glochidone, glochidonol, glochidiol and glochidiol diacetate, cyathic acid, striatic acid, cyathadonic acid and epistriatic acid.

500|$|The {{compound}} {{thought to}} be responsible for the toxicity of raw L.torminosus is the pungent-tasting [...] velleral present at a concentration of 0.16mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a breakdown product of stearyl-velutinal. Broken lactifers—specialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex—leak the precursor chemicals whose breakdown products act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type <b>sesquiterpene</b> lactone 15-hydroxyblenninA is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various Lactarius species, such as blenninA in L.deliciosus and L.blennius, and lactarorufinN in Lactarius rufus. Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to defend against predation, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in medicinal chemistry.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible leafy vegetable, lettuce has {{had a number of}} uses in ancient (and even some more modern) times as a medicinal herb and religious symbol. For example, ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess and a promoter of love and childbearing in women. The Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency. In contrast, the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency, and served it during funerals (probably due to its role in the myth of Adonis' death), and British women in the 19th century believed it would cause infertility and sterility.
