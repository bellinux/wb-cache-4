5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> and driven in parallel {{so as to}} effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
25|$|Both MWDs {{and their}} {{civilian}} counterparts provide service in drug detection, sniffing out {{a broad range}} of psychoactive substances despite efforts at concealment. Provided they have been trained to detect it, MWDs can smell small traces of nearly any substance, even if it is in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container.</b> Dogs trained in drug detection are normally used at ports of embarkation such as airports, checkpoints, and other places where there is high security and a need for anti-contraband measures.|$|E
25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} steam supply. The first, a displacement lubricator, mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> of oil. Water from the condensed steam displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with sight-glasses to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked {{from one of the}} crossheads. In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.|$|E

25|$|Naphthalene {{has been}} used as a {{household}} fumigant. It was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, although its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths that attack textiles. Other fumigant uses of naphthalene include use in soil as a fumigant pesticide, in attic spaces to repel animals and insects, and in museum storage-drawers and cupboards to protect the contents from attack by insect pests.|$|E
25|$|A liquid, like a gas, {{displays}} {{the properties of}} a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume {{the shape of a}} container, and, if placed in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container,</b> will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. If liquid is placed in a bag, it can be squeezed into any shape. Unlike a gas, a liquid is nearly incompressible, it occupies nearly a constant volume over a wide range of pressures; it does not generally expand to fill available space in a container but forms its own surface, and it may not always mix readily with another liquid. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as hydraulics.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to repelling or killing insects such as moths and silverfish, mothballs {{can be used}} as a repellent to keep bats from establishing themselves in attics. Mothballs may repel snakes or mice. Mothballs have the potential to be a hazard to pets, livestock or children that may come into contact with them. Recent issues with imported and unregulated mothballs from China have also become a huge concern as there is no way to know what chemicals were used during the process. However, mothball labels instruct proper use in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container.</b> Older-formula mothballs have also been used by drag racers to enhance the octane rating of fuel, by dissolving the mothballs in some of the fuel and filtering out the remains with a filter paper.|$|E
40|$|The {{safe storage}} of pure and impure {{plutonium}} oxide materials in <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> is a current Department of Energy (DOE) concern. Plutonium oxides sorb {{moisture from the}} atmosphere, and the subsequent radiolytic and/or chemical decomposition of the water has been thought to generate excessive hydrogen pressures inside <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> Eleven <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> with ten grams each of plutonium oxide materials have been studied for up to four years. The sealed materials were representative materials from the DOE complex and contain less than 0. 5 weight percent water. The samples were kept at ambient conditions. We report the final gas analysis of the headspace gas of these containers using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy. The results show {{that none of the}} containers have pressurized significantly, and that hydrogen was not generated in significant quantities...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion and pitting {{have been}} {{observed}} in headspace regions of stainless steel containers enclosing plutonium oxide/salt mixtures.

On {{the same day the}} KGB decided to imprison Sayed Gulabzoy as well as Muhammad Watanjar and Asadullah Sarwari but while in captivity and under an investigation all three denied the allegation that the current Minister of Defense was an American secret agent. The denial of claims was passed on to Yuri Andropov and Leonid Brezhnev, who as the main chiefs of the KGB proposed operation Raduga {{to save the life of}} Gulabzoy and Watanjar and send them to Tashkent from Bagram airbase by giving them fake passports. With that and a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> in which an almost breathless Sarwari was laying, they came to Tashkent on 19 September.|$|E
25|$|However, Mannerheim and {{his guests}} {{chose to go}} to a car that did not have a {{microphone}} in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows to a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's SS bodyguards spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be immediately destroyed; but YLE was allowed to keep the reel, after promising to keep it in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container.</b> It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to YLE. It was made available to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.|$|E

2500|$|... }} The {{team did}} not expect to produce {{metallic}} hydrogen, as it was not using solid hydrogen, thought to be necessary, and was working at temperatures above those specified by metallization theory. Previous studies in which solid hydrogen was compressed inside diamond anvils to pressures of up to , did not confirm detectable metallization. The team had sought simply to measure the less extreme electrical conductivity changes they expected. The researchers used a 1960s-era light-gas gun, originally employed in guided missile studies, to shoot an impactor plate into a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> containing a half-millimeter thick sample of liquid hydrogen. The liquid hydrogen was in contact with wires leading to a device measuring electrical resistance. The scientists found that, as pressure rose to , the electronic energy band gap, a measure of electrical resistance, fell to almost zero. The band-gap of hydrogen in its uncompressed state is about , making it an insulator but, as the pressure increases significantly, the band-gap gradually fell to [...] Because the thermal energy of the fluid (the temperature became about [...] due to compression of the sample) was above , the hydrogen might be considered metallic.|$|E

2500|$|This {{process was}} used from Lydian to post medieval times. It {{is a solid}} state process relying on common salt as the active {{ingredient}} {{but it is possible}} to use a mixture of saltpetre (KNO3) and green vitriol (FeSO4). The basic process involved the mixing of argentiferous gold foil (in later periods granules were used), common salt and brick dust or burnt clay in a closed and <b>sealed</b> <b>container.</b> Theophilus mentions the addition of urine to the mix. With heating, the silver reacts with the salt to form silver chloride which is removed leaving a purified gold behind. Conditions needed for this process are below 1000°C as the gold should not melt. Silver can be recovered by smelting the debris. Heating can take 24 hours. Hoover and Hoover explains the process thus: under heating salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) decomposes in the presence of silica and alumina (from the brick dust or clay) to produce hydrochloric acid and also some chlorine. This reacts with the silver to produce silver chloride (AgCl). The urine is acidic and aids decomposition. Silver chloride is volatile and would be removed from the metal. And the container is sealed to stop the escape of the silver which can be recovered later. Notton in experiments found that with one heating the gold content could be taken from 37.5% to 93% ...|$|E
