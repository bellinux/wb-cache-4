However, there is little direct evidence on whether these {{programs are}} effective in increasing enrolments of credit constrained students. In this paper, I use differences in the timing of policy changes between Quebec {{and the rest of}} Canada to examine the effect of increasing limits on student borrowing through a <b>subsidised</b> <b>loan</b> program. I find that raising student loan limits did indeed lead to an increase in student loan debt and that there were important effects on enrolments. This effect was most marked among the groups which have the highest rates of student loan usage, and appears to be larger than can be accounted for by the price subsidy effect. This suggests student loans {{play an important role in}} mitigating the effects of credit constraints on enrolments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the roles of}} loans and grants as forms of student financial aid. It begins with a simple choice model where individuals decide to pursue post-secondary studies if i) the net benefits of doing so are positive and ii) no financing or liquidity constraints stand in their way. The effects of loans and grants on these two elements of the schooling decision are then discussed. It is argued that based on equity, efficiency, and fiscal considerations, loans are generally best suited for helping {{those who want to}} go but face financing constraints, whereas grants are more appropriate for increasing the incentives for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to further their studies. Loan subsidies, which make loans part-loan and part-grant, are also discussed, including how they might be used to address “debt aversion”. Given that <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans</b> have a grant (subsidy) element, while grants help overcome the credit constraints upon which loans are targeted, the paper then attempts to establish some general rules for providing <b>loans,</b> for <b>subsidising</b> the <b>loans</b> awarded, and for giving “pure ” grants. It concludes with an application of these principles as embodied in a recent proposal for reforming the student financial system in Canada...|$|R

The more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation. The surge (3.8% {{in the first half of}} 2014), however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors, such as the stepped-up absorption of EU-funds and the central bank’s Funding for Growth Scheme, which <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans</b> for small-and medium-sized enterprises. The fundaments of growth didn't considerably change in 2015 as well - the government supported EU-fund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization - fueled the fair GDP growth. However, from the beginning of 2016, the significantly shrunk base of available EU-funds had an immediate impact on the country's performance.

For this, an investment accelerator model augmented with a cash flow variable was used on panel data for individual farms during 1996 - 2000. The cash flow coefficient was found to be significant and positive, indicating a poorly functioning rural credit market, in the sense that for some farms internal funds were the only source of funds (for farms facing credit rationing) or a less expensive source (for farms facing high borrowing costs) than debt. Farms facing more severe credit constraints were then identified by splitting the sample into two groups according to a single criterion but also by creating classes with a multiple component analysis. Farms less collateralisable were found to have experienced the most severe constraints. This finding is in line with other existing studies on Polish farms and is in contradiction with Polish government intervention that favoured <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans</b> rather than guaranteed credit during the period studied. ...|$|R

The success of these programmes lies largely in the provision of subsidised access rather than of <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans.</b> Many charge the same rates of interest as the formal banking sector and have been able to use the funds raised to build their financial sustainability and institutional outreach. Through a strategy of direct lending or financial intermediation combined with reliance on group liability for loans in place of conventional collateral requirements which poor people can rarely fulfill, these programmes have ensured a supply of credit to those normally marginalised from the formal banking sector. They have consequently been credited with compensating for financial ‘market failure’, with reducing the reliance of the poor on usurious moneylenders and with enhancing the productivity of their livelihood efforts [...] What has led to even greater interest in these programs is the documentation of the positive impacts associated with lending to poor women: both economic impacts in terms of poverty alleviation and higher repayment rates as well as more social ones to do with improvements in women’s position within family and society...|$|R

Members of the Socialist Party group called for the transition features of the Mehaignerie Law (introduced under the previous Chirac Government) to be made permanent. Under these features, most rents would not be free, but would instead “be set by negotiation between landlord and tenant and subject to arbitration by conciliation committees, with rent increases being based on comparable rents in the area.” In partial response to this call, a law was passed in January 1989 which called for “spreading out rent increases exceeding 10 percent over six years and required that all proposals from landlords to increase rents had to include proof that there were comparable rents in the neighbourhood.” A Ministry for Cities was set up in 1990 to work against ‘exclusion’ of all kinds, by developing a strategy to target physical, social, economic and educational issues in an integrated way. That same year, the Grands Projets Urbains (GPU) were launched, largely physical projects targeting 14 particularly deprived urban neighbourhoods which aimed for a thorough restructuring of the estates.

40|$|After {{the recent}} deluge of micro-finance, the hard lessons are pouring in. The {{original}} idea - to lend small sums to {{poor people who}} are regarded as unbankable by commercial banks has not led to the expected massive creation of new jobs, enterprises or productivity. What went wrong, why expectations were falsely high and how micro-finance can become sustainable were the key topics of a CTA study visit to South Africa in October and November 2000. The participants came from finance institutions, formal and informal, from 13 countries of eastern, southern and West Africa. During visits with their South African peers, they studied the often confused transition of community organisations into caring local banks, lending where commercial banks did not dare tread.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{view about}} Italian Industrial Districts (IDs) suggests that firms within IDs finance themselves through internal sources alone. This view, based on Northeastern IDs - {{on which the}} mainstream literature concentrates - implicitly denies any potential role played by state subsidies available to small firms {{within the framework of}} national and regional industrial policies from the 1950 s onwards. This thesis, focusing on a Southern ID, tests whether IDs can also emerge within the context of state intervention, and whether Southern IDs relied heavily on state funding in contrast with North-eastern IDs, which drew on public funds to a much smaller extent. The thesis employs a two-pronged approach, analysing the issue from the perspective of both the lending institutions and the recipient firms. It discusses the development of the 'Extraordinary intervention for the South' - designed to overcome Southern backwardness - and compares it with the national industrial policies. It moves on to provide a detailed breakdown {{of the extent to which}} firms in Southern Italy benefited from <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans</b> and grants more than firms in the North-east, where far fewer firms sought subsidies. The importance of subsidies for the recipient companies is studied using two samples of small manufacturing firms, within the Southern ID of Barletta and the North-eastern ID of San Mauro Pascoli. The analysis of the capital structure of the two samples confirms the greater reliance of Southern companies on subsidies, whereas private finance was more important for the North-eastern counterparts. However, subsidies to companies in the North-eastern ID appear to be more effective. The thesis concludes that the received interpretative framework regarding the types of finance used by companies within IDs is severely limited, in that the role of state subsidies cannot be neglected, particularly for Southern IDs, but also for the more prosperous North-eastern IDs...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} sector of Pakistan has at times {{played the role}} of the leading sector of the economy. The successful experience of planned growth in the 1960 s owes much to the special attention paid to the growth of {{manufacturing sector}}. Policies like the export bonus scheme, tax-holidays, subsidised import of capital, easy and <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans</b> and over-valued exchange rate, resulted in a substantial growth in the sector. However, with over-protection of the sector, nationalisation of some of the major industries in the 1970 s and, later-on, over-employment in the nationalised industries, the performance of the sector started to deteriorate gradually. It is now widely believed that many of the manufacturing industries in Pakistan have become inefficient because they have not been exposed to competitive environment due to protective and distortionary policies. It is to be expected that distortions like those mentioned would have not only eroded the performance but also affected the behaviour of the manufacturing sector. It is therefore important to determine how productivity growth in the manufacturing sector has been retarded over time and what type of changes in technology have taken place in terms of their effects on factor intensities and on the firms, reaction to such changes in factor prices. An analysis of the changes over time in production technology of the manufacturing sector may provide an answer to these questions. The present study aims at analysing changes in the cost structure of Pakistan’s manufacturing sector {{over the past two decades}} in order to study the nature and speed of productivity growth; determine whether there exists any factor bias in the technological changes; and to analyse how technology has adjusted to absorb changes in the relative factor prices. ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{attempts}} to apply William Niskanen's (1971) theory of budget maximising bureaucrats {{to the business}} subsidies policy implemented in Finland, {{by one of the}} major distributor of subsidies to firms, the ministry of Trade and Industry (KTM). The empirical analysis is based on records of 15 300 firms applying for aid through the KTM regional offices during 1995 - 1999 and on the budgeted appropriations given to the KTM between 1989 and 2000. In testing Niskanen's theory we examine whether its four assumptions are relevant and applicable {{within the context of the}} KTM?s business subsidies policy. First, information asymmetry is found to exist between the KTM and its sponsor (the ministry of Finance VM). Second, bilateral monopoly is also evident between the two parties. Third, the VM does not seem to play a passive role during the budget negotiations with the KTM, as Niskanen assumed. The fourth assumption - the budget maximising bureaucrat - is tested by examining (a) the strategies of the KTM bureaucrats in attempting to maximise their bureau's budget and (b) the success in their budget maximisation efforts. Looking at the budget maximisation strategies, our analysis shows that the bureaucrats? request for funds is not based on the previous year's appropriations, as initially hypothesised. However, we find strong evidence suggesting that bureaucrats attempt to get rid of unallocated funds before year's end in order to avoid receiving less the following years. Finally, our logistic regression analysis indicates that bureaucrats pursue a "creaming" policy where only firms that have better chances of success, receive more subsidies. That way, they can reduce the chances of the policy not achieving its goals, thus avoid the risk of having later deductions in the program's budget. In testing the success of the bureaucrats? budget maximisation efforts, we note that, despite that subsidy appropriations have fluctuated during the examined period, administrative expenses (including salaries) have stayed flat or grown to some degree. Although this is not a causal finding, it suggests that bureaucrats have succeeded in - at least - safeguarding the appropriations which are of major importance to them. Among others, the study recommends that direct subsidies to firms should be reduced further, and be substituted by advanced advisory services, <b>subsidised</b> <b>loans</b> and forgivable loans.
