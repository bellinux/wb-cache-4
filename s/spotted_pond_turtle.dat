5000|$|The black {{pond turtle}} (Geoclemys hamiltonii [...] ), {{also known as the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> or the Indian spotted turtle, is a species of turtle endemic to South Asia. It belongs to the {{monotypic}} genus Geoclemys.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 3528 {{specimens}} of freshwater turtles belonging to two families viz., Geoemydidae (brown river turtle, Kachuga smithi; Indian saw-backed turtle, K. tecta; Brahminy river turtle, Hardella thurgi; <b>spotted</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> Geoclemys hamiltonii) and Trionychidae (Indian soft-shell turtle, Aspederates gangeticus; peacock soft-shell turtle, A. hurum; narrow-headed soft-shell turtle, Chitra indica; Indian flap-shell turtle, Lissemys punciata) were identified. Kachuga smithi (43. 62 %) and K. tecta (42. 06 %) had abundant population status, whereas, Hardella thurgi (0. 88 %) and Chitra indica (0. 54 %) were rare. Capturing of turtles for supply to foreigners and export {{is a major}} threat to these animals. Fishermen also kill them during fishing. Canal closure and de-silting is also harmful to turtles. It is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} provide immediate legal protection/coverage to all turtle species under the Punjab Wildlife Act, 1974, Pakistan; otherwise turtle species will become extinct...|$|E
2500|$|The bank is {{planning}} to procure green anacondas under an international exchange programme. Four adult green anacondas, with an average length of , are being brought {{for the first time}} from the Danish Crocodile Exhibition in Denmark in exchange for marsh crocodiles, critically endangered gharials and African slender snouted crocodiles. The anacondas have since been procured and are housed in enclosures. As part of the efforts to give due importance to its exhibition potential, along with education and research, the bank was also engaged in talks with some conservation and breeding centres to procure Komodo dragons. Four Komodo dragons - three males, one female - have since been acquired from Bronx Zoo in New York. The bank also plans to get as many as 21 <b>spotted</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> from Hong Kong.

50|$|Until recently, {{the genus}} Clemmys {{consisted}} of four species (bog <b>turtle,</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> western <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{and the wood}} turtle). Recent genetic analyses have revealed that the spotted turtle is distinct from the other three species. The bog turtle and the wood turtle were moved to the genus Glyptemys, while the western <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> has been renamed Actinemys. This makes the spotted turtle the sole member of the genus Clemmys.|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the vulnerability of}} the native Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> to encroachment by the invasive red-eared slider in southern Spain. We first obtained an ecogeographical favourability model for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> We then modelled the presence/absence of the red-eared slider in the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> range and obtained an encroachment favourability model. We also obtained a favourability model for the red-eared slider using the ecogeographical favourability for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> as a predictor. When favourability for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> was high, favourability for the red-eared slider was low, suggesting that in these areas the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> may resist encroachment by the red-eared slider. We also calculated favourability overlap between the two species, which is their simultaneous favourability. Grids with low overlap had higher favourability values for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> and, consequently, were of lesser conservation concern. A few grids had high values for both species, being potentially suitable for coexistence. Grids with intermediate overlap had similar intermediate favourability values for both species and were therefore areas where the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> was more vulnerable to encroachment by the red-eared slider. We mapped the favourability overlap to provide a map of vulnerability of the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> to encroachment by the red-eared slider.

50|$|The Fujian <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{described}} as Mauremys iversoni, is a farm-bred hybrid, between yellow <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (usually females) {{and the golden}} coin turtle or Cuora cyclornata (usually males). Similarly, the turtles {{described as}} Mauremys pritchardi are farm-bred and wild-occurring hybrids between the Chinese <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> and the yellow <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> While {{it is not unusual}} for valid species of geoemydid turtles to arise from hybrids, this is yet to be discussed with M. pritchardi; M. iversoni is probably not, since they only seem to be produced in farms and most males are sterile.|$|R

50|$|One subspecies, Mauremys mutica kami, is {{currently}} {{recognized in the}} Ryukyu Islands. Research has shown unexpected genetic diversity in M. mutica, raising the possibility that additional subspecies might exist. Evidence of widespread hybridization further complicates efforts to understand the genetics of this and related species. Several hybrid Asian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> that were described as new species {{have been found to}} be hybrids. Fujian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (Mauremys iversoni) are hybrid specimens mainly produced in Chinese turtle farms, usually from matings between female yellow <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> and golden coin turtles (Cuora trifasciata) males. The supposed Mauremys pritchardi turtles are wild and captive-bred hybrids between the present species and the Chinese <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chinemys reevesi).|$|R
