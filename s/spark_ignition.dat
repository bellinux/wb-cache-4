25|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) {{involves the use}} of a pre-mixed lean air-fuel mixture being compressed to the point of auto-ignition, so electronic <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> is eliminated. Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine stratified charge (SC) with {{compression ignition}} (CI), abbreviated as SCCI. HCCI engines achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with compression ignition engine-like efficiency, and low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x) without a catalytic converter. However, unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions still require treatment to conform with automotive emission regulations.|$|E

50|$|A {{single engine}} with <b>spark</b> or {{compression}} <b>ignition</b> (i.e. no jets).|$|R
25|$|The {{design was}} {{conceived}} by German engineer Felix Wankel. Wankel received his first patent for the engine in 1929. He began {{development in the}} early 1950s at NSU, and completed a working prototype in 1957. NSU subsequently licensed the design to companies around the world, who have continually added improvements. The engines produced are of <b>spark</b> <b>ignition,</b> with compression ignition engines only in research projects.|$|E
25|$|Diesel engines can be {{operated}} on dual fuel mode using producer gas. Diesel substitution of over 80% at high loads and 70–80% under normal load variations {{can easily be}} achieved. <b>Spark</b> <b>ignition</b> engines and solid oxide fuel cells can operate on 100% gasification gas. Mechanical energy from the engines {{may be used for}} e.g. driving water pumps for irrigation or for coupling with an alternator for electrical power generation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>ignition</b> {{engines are}} {{designed}} to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E
5000|$|... 1884: British {{engineer}} Edward Butler {{constructed the}} first petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine. Butler invented the <b>spark</b> plug, <b>ignition</b> magneto, coil ignition and spray jet carburetor, {{and was the}} first to use the word petrol.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>ignition</b> <b>sparks</b> {{was determined by}} measuring the volume (or mass) of hydrogen and of oxygen which combines at low pressures. The sparks were generated by a magneto and an <b>ignition</b> <b>spark</b> coil. It was found that with constant energy the amount of reaction increases as the capacitance component of the spark increases. The use of a series spark gap may decrease or {{increase the amount of}} reaction, the effect depending upon the amount and distribution of capacitance in the circuit. So far as the work has progressed, it has been found that sparks reported by other investigations as being most efficient for igniting lean mixtures cause the largest amount of reaction. Differences between the amount of reaction with a magneto <b>spark</b> and an <b>ignition</b> <b>spark</b> coil were noted. The method appears to offer a means of determining the most efficient spark generator for internal-combustion engines as well as determining a relation between the character of spark, energy, and effectiveness in igniting inflammable mixtures...|$|R
50|$|The {{designers}} {{then decided}} to simplify the EFI332 design, and focus on managing the fuel injectors (the EFI332 was also designed to control the <b>spark</b> plug <b>ignition</b> system if so desired). This {{was the basis for}} the first MegaSquirt (MS-I).|$|R
25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug <b>spark</b> <b>ignition.</b> Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscosity}} {{requirement of}} diesel fuel is usually specified at 40°C. A disadvantage of diesel {{as a vehicle}} fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel (see Compression Ignition – Gelling) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures, but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties. Another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol/gasoline engines {{is the possibility of}} diesel engine runaway failure. Since diesel engines do not need <b>spark</b> <b>ignition,</b> they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied. Fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump. If the pump breaks down in an open position, the supply of fuel will be unrestricted, and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure.|$|E
25|$|The British company Rotron, which specialises in {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{applications of}} Wankel engines, has designed and built a unit to operate on heavy fuel for NATO purposes. The engines uses <b>spark</b> <b>ignition.</b> The prime innovation is flame propagation, ensuring the flame burns smoothly across the whole combustion chamber. The fuel is pre-heated to 98 degrees Celsius before it is injected into the combustion chamber. Four spark plugs are utilised, aligned in two pairs. Two spark plugs ignite the fuel charge {{at the front of}} the rotor as it moves into the combustion section of the housing. As the rotor moves the fuel charge, the second two fire a fraction of second behind the first pair of plugs, igniting near the rear of the rotor at the back of the fuel charge. The drive shaft is water cooled which also has a cooling effect on the internals of the rotor. Cooling water also flows around the external of the engine through a gap in the housing, thus reducing the heat of the engine from outside and inside eliminating hot spots.|$|E

25|$|The Bullitt uses {{a version}} of the Mustang GT's {{aluminum}} 4.6L SOHC V8. It has a cold air intake, improved engine calibration, and a revised exhaust system designed to mimic the sound of the Mustang used in the Bullitt movie. Total output is 315hp (235kW) @ 6000rpm and 325lb·ft (440N·m) of torque @ 4250rpm and the engine's redline has been raised to 6500rpm (from the standard Mustang GT's 6250rpm). Premium grade, 91-octane or better gasoline is recommended, although an adaptive <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> system allows the engine to accept regular grade gasoline. Total output is the same with either fuel, but the engine delivers a flatter torque curve when using premium. The Tremec TR3650 5-speed manual transmission from the Mustang GT is used, but the Bullitt featured a heavier duty rear axle (also used in GT500KR) with 3.73:1 ratio, versus the Mustang GT's 3.31:1 or optional 3:55:1 ratios. The suspension is improved over the standard GT utilizing stiffer springs, struts, and a decorative front strut tower brace while also lowering the car's ride height by six millimeters. Most of the Mustang Bullitt's components are available in the aftermarket for retrofitting earlier S197 Mustang GT vehicles, but some parts used in Bullitt Mustangs are marked to show authenticity.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a weather-proof box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for outdoor use. Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E
500|$|The September 2009 MY10 {{update to}} the VE Commodore {{platform}} introduces {{a new standard}} engine–a 3.0-litre <b>Spark</b> <b>Ignition</b> Direct Injection (SIDI) V6 on the Omega and Berlina, with a 3.6-litre {{version of the same}} reserved for all other V6 variants. The standard transmission is now a six-speed GM 6L50 automatic, replacing the four-speed in Omega and Berlina models and the five-speed in higher luxury levels. A six-speed manual is still available in sport models. Holden claims the new powertrains will provide better fuel economy than some smaller four-cylinder cars; the 3.0-litre version is rated at [...] The 3.0L produces 190kW- more than the earlier 3.6L and more than the old 5.0L Holden V8.

500|$|MY10: {{versions}} of the VE were released in September 2009. New 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6s have been introduced, featuring <b>Spark</b> <b>Ignition</b> Direct Injection (SIDI) and coupled to a new six-speed automatic transmission (see above). These revised powertrains are marketed as part of Holden's EcoLine range. Visually, all SIDI versions are distinguished by relocated and additional EcoLine badging. 3.0-litre versions now utilise twin exhaust outlets. Updated cars also gain a recalibrated suspension setup and an extra ball-joint in the rear suspension (previously introduced on the Sportwagon); the result is increased tautness and improved handling in models fitted with 18 and 19-inch diameter wheels. These cars are also equipped with a larger [...] rear stabiliser bar. Additional engine bay sound deadening and a new muffler have resulted in reduced noise, vibration, and harshness. Elsewhere, the fitment of lighter low rolling-resistance tyres aids fuel consumption by minimising friction.|$|E
500|$|The prototypes of the AMX-30 weighed , {{and were}} compact, with a width of , {{comparable}} {{only to the}} Swiss Panzer 61, and a height of , comparable only to the Soviet T-55. In contrast to the AMX 50, the AMX-30 was issued a conventional turret, because {{it was found that}} it was more difficult to seal oscillating turrets from radioactive dust and against water when the tank was submerged. Oscillating turrets also had a large ballistic weakness {{in the area of the}} skirt and turret ring. Originally, the first two prototypes were powered by a [...] <b>spark</b> <b>ignition</b> engine, named the SOFAM 12 GSds. Later, a multi-fuel diesel engine was adopted, developed by Hispano-Suiza. The seven 1963 prototypes of the AMX-30 were later rebuilt with the new diesel engine. Two further prototypes, meant to be direct preproduction vehicles, were delivered in November 1965. Besides the diesel engines, they had changed hull and turret casts and different gun mantlets; the latter would again be changed in the production vehicles.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August 2009, Holden {{announced}} the MY10 {{revisions to the}} VE and WM range {{to be released in}} September. For the VE Omega and Berlina, the 3.6-litre Alloytec V6 has been downsized to 3.0-litres, the lowest engine displacement of a Commodore since the straight-six engine fitted to the 1986 VL series. This smaller capacity engine features <b>Spark</b> <b>Ignition</b> Direct Injection (SIDI) technology, and is officially claimed to reduce fuel consumption by up to 12percent depending on the variant. Power increases to , although torque is reduced to [...] Along with the 3.0-litre engine, a 3.6-litre version of the same, producing [...] and , was also unveiled. Other than the manual transmission version of the SV6, all SIDI V6 models are coupled to GM's 6L50 automatic and fall under Holden's EcoLine banner. Benefits to fuel economy for the 3.6-litre SIDI can also be attributed to an improved [...] "deceleration fuel cut" [...] system, which terminates the fuel supply during engine coasting; a higher efficiency alternator and voltage regulator; a 50rpm lower idle speed (to 550rpm); and a new [...] "turbine damper" [...] for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpms, thus enabling earlier upshifts. Omega versions of the Ute and all bi-fuel versions retain the existing 3.6-litre and four-speed automatic combination, although the LPG engine has been tweaked for further efficiency gains.|$|E
50|$|The Antoinette 8V was {{an early}} French eight-cylinder, liquid-cooled, V engine, the first gasoline-fueled, <b>spark</b> plug <b>ignition</b> engine of any kind {{produced}} with fuel injection in quantity.

50|$|Actuators {{are used}} in {{applications}} where potentially explosive atmospheres may occur. This includes among others refineries, pipelines, {{oil and gas exploration}} or even mining. When a potentially explosive gas-air-mixture or gas-dust-mixture occurs, the actuator must not act as ignition source. Hot surfaces on the actuator as well as <b>ignition</b> <b>sparks</b> created by the actuator have to be avoided. This can be achieved by a flameproof enclosure, where the housing is designed to prevent <b>ignition</b> <b>sparks</b> from leaving the housing even if there is an explosion inside.|$|R
