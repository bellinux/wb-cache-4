The use of randomized QMC methods, where randomness {{can be brought to}} bear on quasirandom sequences through <b>scrambling</b> and other related randomization techniques, brings more wide applications for QMC. However, the integration variance can depend strongly on the <b>scrambling</b> methods. Much of the work dealing with <b>scrambling</b> methods has been aimed at ways of linear <b>scrambling</b> methods. In this paper, we {{take a close look at}} the quadratic <b>scrambling</b> method for Faure sequences and compare with other linear <b>scrambling</b> methods.

The <b>scrambling</b> methods will focus on quadratic and inversive <b>scrambling.</b> We will compare those nonlinear <b>scrambling</b> methods with linear <b>scrambling</b> methods by a set of test-integral functions. Pseudorandom number generation by nonlinear methods will be expensive when their moduli are large. In our case, the modulus is relatively small.

In this study, I argue that Russian does not have semantically vacuous <b>scrambling</b> and give arguments that long distance <b>scrambling</b> in Russian involves focus movement. I show that <b>scrambling</b> in Russian is sensitive to relativized minimality and to other locality constraints.

5|$|No.1 Wing fought {{its last}} major engagements during September and November 1943. On 7September, the Japanese {{dispatched}} a twin-engined reconnaissance aircraft escorted by 20 fighters to the Darwin area. The 48 Spitfires <b>scrambled</b> {{in response to}} this force were led by Flight Lieutenant Bob Foster. This was Foster's first experience in leading the wing, and he misdeployed No.54 and 452squadrons' aircraft, leading to them being 'bounced' by Japanese fighters. In the subsequent combat three Spitfires were shot down while the wing claimed one fighter destroyed and two 'probables'. No.457 Squadron was able to gain a height advantage on the Japanese and shot down four fighters without loss. A further two night raids were made against Fenton on 15 and 27September but the Spitfires <b>scrambled</b> in response were unable to find the bombers on either occasion. No.1 Wing experienced a major turnover of personnel during September as pilots completed their nine-month tours of duty. This led to a loss of experienced airmen, but the new pilots were often better trained than the men they replaced. No attacks took place during October, and the wing did not make contact with the Japanese until 6November when a flight of six Spitfires which been deployed to Drysdale River Mission, Western Australia on the 3rd of the month failed in an attempt to intercept a reconnaissance aircraft near the settlement. In the early hours of 12November nine Spitfires were <b>scrambled</b> to intercept nine Japanese aircraft which were bound for Darwin and Fenton. Two Betty bombers were shot down over Darwin Harbour by Flying Officer John Smithson and no Allied aircraft were lost. Both these aircraft were commanded by senior officers, and their deaths led to the cancellation of further Betty bomber operations in the Darwin area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} work is on Physical layer (PHY) of the WiMAX. <b>Scrambling</b> and Jamming are two security threats which can occur at physical layer of the WiMAX network. In WiMAX environment jamming and <b>scrambling</b> threats can be destroyed the Communication. <b>Scrambling</b> {{is a type of}} jamming and it is a risk to WiMAX security and has great impact as it affects burst of data effecting one or more frames for short period, therefore it cannot be detected easily. As <b>scrambling</b> effect on specific frames so if it affects control and information frames then there should be a great problem in WiMAX Network. <b>Scrambling</b> can also be generated naturally that is why this threat is also important in the WiMAX network. Due to all these <b>scrambling</b> issues, before implementing the WiMAX architecture, we will introduce our <b>scrambling</b> in the WiMAX system then using MATLAB simulation check out its effect on this WiMAX system. In the end we add our descrambler module at the receiver side that is used to discard the <b>scrambling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{contend that}} the main {{motivation}} for <b>scrambling</b> is heaviness. In particular, Yamashita (2002) maintains that <b>scrambling</b> {{has nothing to do}} with givenness and that heaviness is the primary factor for <b>scrambling.</b> However, her conclusions count on only 19 examples and she does not distinguish VP-internal <b>scrambling</b> from VP-external <b>scrambling.</b> Thus, it is conceivable that some types of <b>scrambling</b> rely on givenness. In order to see if this hypothesis is on the right track, I conducted a corpus analysis of OSV order in Japanese, largely based on the quantitative approach. Consequently, it has been revealed that both givenness and heaviness have a high explanatory power for the usage of OSV order. Furthermore, there was no correlation between givenness and heaviness, showing their independent influence on OSV order. Therefore, I conclude that both givenness and heaviness are sufficient to trigger OSV order and the phenomenon cannot be fully accounted for except with reference to both. Furthemore, based on the mapping between information structure and syntactic structure, I propose that VP-external <b>scrambling</b> is discourse-driven while VP-internal <b>scrambling</b> is not. 1...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipid <b>scrambling,</b> the {{disruption}} of normal plasma-membrane asymmetry, occurs during apoptotic and necrotic cell death and during the activation of platelets and neutrophils. It is currently believed that phospholipid <b>scrambling</b> is triggered simply by increases in bulk cytosolic [Ca(2 +) ]. We have presented evidence previously that the styryl dye FM 1 - 43 is sensitive to phospholipid <b>scrambling</b> in Jurkat human leukaemic T-lymphocytes. Here we have used FM 1 - 43, in combination with fura 2 and the Ca(2 +) -elevating agents ionomycin and thapsigargin, in imaging experiments to test the idea that increases in bulk cytosolic [Ca(2 +) ] stimulate <b>scrambling.</b> Intracellular Ca(2 +) increases of approximately 2 microM accompanied ionomycin-stimulated <b>scrambling</b> in approximately 50 % of cells, and <b>scrambling</b> occurred in > 99 % of cells in which intracellular Ca(2 +) rose to 4 microM. Chelating intracellular Ca(2 +) with bis-(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid or EGTA suppressed both ionomycin-stimulated intra cellular Ca(2 +) increases and <b>scrambling,</b> demonstrating that intracellular Ca(2 +) increases are necessary for ionomycin-stimulated <b>scrambling.</b> However, elevating intracellular Ca(2 +) to 2 - 4 microM with thapsigargin, a drug that depletes intracellular Ca(2 +) stores and triggers Ca(2 +) entry via Ca(2 +) -release-activated Ca(2 +) channels, did not trigger <b>scrambling,</b> as assessed with either FM 1 - 43 or FITC-labelled annexin V. These results suggest that increases in intracellular [Ca(2 +) ] are necessary but not sufficient to stimulate <b>scrambling</b> in lymphoyctes, and indicate that ionomycin has an additional effect that is required to stimulate <b>scrambling...</b>|$|R
