30|$|Metaphors of {{modality}} realize non-congruent ways of <b>speech</b> <b>function</b> (Halliday 1985 a). Modality {{refers to}} the area between positive and negative polarity, i.e. to the cline between “yes” and “no”. Modality is congruently realized by modal finite, e.g. can, may, could, should, and mood adjuncts, e.g. possibly, probably. These instances are implicit ways of realizing <b>speech</b> <b>function</b> in grammar and considered congruent, as they do not create stratal tension. Alternatively, <b>speech</b> <b>function</b> might be projected in a clause complex explicitly, creating stratal tension, e.g. I believe …, I think …, {{it is possible to}} argue that …, it is obvious that ….. The first two of these examples are referred to as explicit subjective, whereas the other two are considered explicit objective (Halliday 1985 a). The congruent realization of <b>speech</b> <b>function</b> takes place within clause through modal verbs such as can, may, could and might (implicit modal) or through modal adjuncts, e.g. possibly or probably (implicit mood adjunct). Alternatively, <b>speech</b> <b>function</b> can be realized within the modality system through projecting clause complexes consisting of mental and idea clauses, e.g. “I think…”, “I believe” (explicit subjective) or objectively such as “It is possible to argue that…” (explicit objective).|$|R

The result of the study was totally found 77 Idioms as phrasal verb which the highest quantity of idiom as phrasal verb in the Real Steel movie’s script is a phrase “come on”, and it belongs to intransitive phrasal verb.

From 77 idioms found, there are several idioms which have different <b>speech</b> <b>function</b> of one idiom so that the totally of all idioms become 86 idioms. The meanings of idioms as phrasal verbs mostly belong to “concrete meaning” and the meanings of idioms semantically mostly desribe “action” because the most idioms describe action done without direction from somebody.

Our first aim is to outline a descriptive framework with the relevant semantic-pragmatic and formal features to capture all the <b>speech</b> <b>functions</b> fulfilled by TQs. Critical features to the classification of TQs into <b>speech</b> <b>functions</b> are: the commodity being exchanged (information or desired action), whether the TQ realizes an A-event, B-event or AB-event, and adjacency. Features that have typical correlations with the different speech function types are: intonation, polarity, clause type of the anchor, the presence of modals, the position of TQs in adjacency pairs and turns, and responses to TQs. Our second aim is to identify and typify the wide range of <b>speech</b> <b>functions</b> that TQs can realize.

Therefore, it is in order for the participants to offer additional or contrasting information to the previous move or qualify it by giving details of time, place, condition, etc. Moreover, in case of interruption by the other chatter, the participants mostly tend to clarify, exemplify or reiterate the previous move. Furthermore, the participants produced irony, as a humorous element, in a great volume which is indicative of their tendency toward being indirect during conversation.
