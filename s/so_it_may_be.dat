5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") {{are attached}} to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E
5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the francolin are dying, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{found in other}} habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, {{one of which is}} largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as overgrazing, is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E

25|$|Especially {{in terms}} of the European tradition, the term {{federation}} is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least, not without qualification.

25|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information.

Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line {{of sight of the}} reader, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> embedded in the tracked object.

25|$|Several graph drawing {{researchers}} have investigated algorithms for drawing graphs {{in such a}} way that the automorphisms of the graph become visible as symmetries of the drawing. This may be done either by using a method that is not designed around symmetries, but that automatically generates symmetric drawings when possible, or by explicitly identifying symmetries and using them to guide vertex placement in the drawing. It is not always possible to display all symmetries of the graph simultaneously, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> necessary to choose which symmetries to display and which to leave unvisualized.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young woman}} and {{university}} student, DuPlessis began a lifelong correspondence with Oppen and was deeply influenced by Oppen's integrity, sincerity, and courage. Though establishing herself as a poet with tendencies and obsessions at some remove from an Objectivist ethos (or <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> argued at a first reading) DuPlessis has {{played a crucial role}} in the dissemination and survival of Objectivist poetry and poetics well into the 21st century. The life of a man such as Oppen made a lasting impression on DuPlessis. DuPlessis gained Oppen's trust as well and she was given the opportunity of editing Oppen's Selected Letters, which were published posthumously.|$|E
25|$|Dhutanga (meaning austere {{practice}} Thai: Tudong) {{is a word}} generally used in the commentaries {{to refer}} to the thirteen ascetic practices. In Thai Buddhism it has been adapted to refer to extended periods of wandering in the countryside, where monks will take {{one or more of these}} ascetic practices. During these periods monks will live off of whatever is given to them by laypersons they encounter during the trip, and sleep wherever they can. Sometimes monks will bring a large umbrella-tent with attached mosquito netting known as a crot (also spelled krot, clot, or klod). The crot will usually have a hook on the top <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> hung on a line tied between two trees.|$|E
