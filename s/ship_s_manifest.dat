Acquiescence response set did not affect the CMAS scores of normal children although there was a negative relationship between their CMAS scores and social desirability. The higher anxiety scores obtained by normal girls was felt to reflect their lower use of social desirability as compared to boys. Normal boys obtained higher social desirability scores which seemed to account for their lower anxiety scores...|$|R
