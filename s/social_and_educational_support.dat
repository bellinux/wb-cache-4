The article shows the direction in the development of the social teacher's support in orphanages: the emergence of new forms of work (family arrangements, the reunion of the foster-child with the blood relatives, guidance after graduating from the boarding school); optimization in training the students for their independent life; individualization of social and pedagogical support through the introduction of case management, changing life style in the institution to family- oriented...|$|E

This part of the study aimed to explore health professionals’ opinions of rheumatology outreach service. Methods Using a qualitative design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs, practice nurses, hospital doctors and RPs, from one hospital and seven PC practices in Norfolk, to elicit their opinions of the service. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results All participants agreed the service was supportive and valuable providing high quality personalised care, disease management, <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> <b>educational</b> <b>support.</b> Advantages identified included convenience, continuity of care and proximity of services to home. RPs helped bridge the communication gap between PC and SC. Some participants suggested having a doctor alongside RPs.

Through an oral history approach, ten participants ranging in age from 70 to 100 years old provided narrative which revealed major influencers on their style and what they have worn throughout their life span. The study explored the women’s experiences within the African American church and the importance it played in the lives of the community providing <b>social,</b> political, <b>and</b> <b>educational</b> <b>support.</b> Oral narratives were analyzed using open and axial coding by the researcher. Symbolic interactionist theory helped in understanding the meanings behind the women’s methods of assembly of garments and accessories. The participants disclosed how garments were acquired and the attachment of status to the methods of acquisition. Evaluation of the data revealed that church denomination did not play as important a role for the participants in this study, however, their mode of dress was used as an outward manifestation of their inner beliefs to present their best to God. Their stories further revealed strong opinions about post-modern church dress and how society influences what is considered proper dress for church. The stories told by these women of their lives through dress explained how their clothing was symbolic of strong religious beliefs as well as a way of life for proper women and disclosed meanings about their self-concept related to dress.

However, Japan is lagging behind European countries and North America as {{this concept of}} healthcare transition was introduced only 10 years ago. In Japan, before the introduction of this concept, APCCD were referred to as carryover patients, who were often considered a burden in pediatric practice. In the late 1990 s, groups composed of pediatric nephrologists, developmental and behavioral pediatricians, pediatric nurses, and special education teachers researching {{the quality of life}} of adult patients with chronic kidney disease began to discuss the physical and psychosocial problems of APCCD. In 2006, a group of pediatricians first introduced the term transition in a Japanese journal.

This research explored the nature and usefulness of support for parents of {{gifted children}} in the western region of Melbourne. First, by means of interviews with parents and second, through the development of a self-help/mutual aid support group. Twenty three parents (16 mothers and seven fathers) were interviewed. The data gathered from the interviews and the observational notes from the group were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The findings indicated that parents’ well-being was adversely affected by different stressors from those usually experienced by other parents. Stressors such as the additional needs of their gifted children, the difficulties encountered with schools, educational policies, and the negative attitudes of giftedness in the wider community. The stress experienced was exacerbated by a lack of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>educational</b> <b>support</b> together with the social stigma of being a parent of a gifted child. Parents reported major frustrations from their unmet social and emotional needs, which often resulted in them being isolated from others. To address this need, an informal support group was established. The support group is considered successful by its longevity and the formation of a sub-group and further proposed sub-groups. It is recommended more support groups be established to address support shortcomings in the western region of Melbourne.

40|$|The 108 year {{history of}} the Mount Morgan mine has been told and retold but little {{attention}} has been paid to the sixty-one year history of Mount Morgan Limited. It is now over twenty-three years since production ceased, so fewer people remain who were associated with this period of the mine history. Most are unaware of the reasons for its success or failure, and of the management decisions that ultimately affected the lives and prosperity of the Mount Morgan community. Consequently, there have been areas of narration, especially in this latter period, which have drawn either praise or criticism, often without sufficient and accurate historical detail by way of comparison. The thesis addresses these shortcomings across the relevant areas, drawing principally on primary material contained in company archives lodged with CQUniversity, Rockhampton and supported by pertinent secondary literature. By examining areas of ‘praise or criticism’ in the operation of Mount Morgan Limited, and placing these within the context of the broader mining community, the thesis offers a new analysis of the {{history of the}} mine. The thesis establishes that, while returning significant dividends to its shareholders, and providing a guaranteed income, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>educational</b> <b>support</b> to generations of Mount Morgan people, the Company failed to expand its activities and initially disregarded the surrounding environment. In evaluating these commercial, social, operational and environmental areas of its operations, the thesis addresses not just the perceptions of the triumphs and disappointments of Mount Morgan Limited, but also examines its relationship with the broader mining community, both national and international. It addresses the extent to which the Company followed or departed from industry practices elsewhere, including the extent of influence exerted by directors and senior staff, the introduction of a welfare scheme and social initiatives, as well as its persistent, but ill-fated attempts to diversify its operations...|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY POLICY QUESTIONS What is a Promise Neighborhood {{and what}} are the {{different}} forms a Promise Neighborhood can take? How do Promise Neighborhood administrators engage community members and how do parents and caregivers respond to the Promise Neighborhood family engagement strategies? BACKGROUND Inspired by the Harlem Children’s Zone, a Promise Neighborhood is a community centered on providing all children high-quality, coordinated health, <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> <b>educational</b> <b>support</b> from birth to college to career. The Obama administration currently funds Promise Neighborhoods in 20 states and in the District of Columbia. Three foundational principles of the Promise Neighborhood Initiative are (1) the Promise Neighborhood is not a one-size-fits-all model, but rather takes shape to the community it serves using community needs assessments; (2) Children and parents need wrap-around supports to foster a safe and healthy learning environment; and (3) community participation and buy-in are essential for improving the community. Martez Hill, the Executive Director of the North Carolina State Board of Education, is interested in learning about the Promise Neighborhood model. He wants to know the various forms Promise Neighborhoods can take (e. g. their governance structure, the number of nonprofits involved, the number served, etc.). Because community engagement is such an essential component, he also wants to understand the strategies Promise Neighborhoods use to recruit families to participate. DATA AND METHODS In this project, I studied three different examples of Promise Neighborhood models including the East Durham Children’s Initiative, the Kinston Promise Neighborhood, and the D. C. Promise Neighborhood Initiative. First, I conducted in-depth interviews with administrators to learn how they recruit children, parents, and caregivers to participate. Second, I conducted in-depth interviews with parents and caregivers to learn why they participate in the Promise Neighborhood programs. This expands the current research by incorporating administrators’ perspectives to learn their strategies and by interviewing parents and caregivers specifically on family engagement; this has not been done before. I also developed profiles on the three neighborhoods to illustrate the different forms Promise Neighborhoods can take. FINDINGS 	Each administrator stressed the importance of involving community members in the Promise Neighborhood planning process. Each program also emphasized their collaborative efforts with local schools to share information with parents or caregivers. While the DC Promise Neighborhood Initiative utilizes a grassroots approach to community engagement, the East Durham Children’s Initiative and Kinston Promise Neighborhood have fewer resources. Instead, they rely on alternative recruitment strategies such as providing a parent advocate program and a parent and community advisory committee. 	Parents, caregivers, and administrators explained that the main challenges to program participation are time constraints, transportation, and competing priorities. Many parents or caregivers expressed their concern that many parents are not taking advantage of the Promise Neighborhood programming. They contribute their lack of participation to the aforementioned challenges, but also to the notion that many parents do not understand what being involved means. RECOMMENDATIONS When determining community engagement strategies for the Promise Neighborhood model, I recommend taking the following measures: 1. 	Engage families in the planning process 2. 	Partner with the local school 3. 	Develop a parent advocate program 4. 	Employ grassroots strategies 5. 	Determine how to best utilize parents and caregivers to communicate participation benefits to other community member...|$|E
40|$|E fofo e le alamea le alamea [Translation: “The starfish heals itself”; This {{traditional}} Samoan proverb {{alludes to}} self-help or finding solutions within your own community. ] This report presents the Pacific-specific findings from Youth’ 12, the third national health and wellbeing survey {{of secondary school}} students in New Zealand. This is New Zealand’s largest and most comprehensive survey of the health and wellbeing of Pacific students in New Zealand. Included in the survey are a range of factors that impact on the healthy development of Pacific young people, including family, community, education and social environments. The information in this report was provided by 1445 students who identified as any Pacific Island ethnicity in 2012 (17. 1 % of the entire national sample). Also reported is Pacific data from the surveys conducted in 2001 and 2007 to identify trends over time. We present some intra-Pacific differences for Samoan, Tongan and Cook Island students. Finally, {{we looked at the}} differences between Pacific and New Zealand European students to explore health, education and social disparities. Findings 	Pacific youth live in environments that can be challenging to their healthy development 	Pacific youth health and wellbeing has made some big improvements 	Pacific youth health and wellbeing still remains a concern in some important areas 	Little difference between Pacific ethnicities ​There remain significant and persistent inequities for Pacific youth.  Pacific youth are significantly more likely than New Zealand European students to: 	Experience significant socio-economic deprivation and housing deprivation 	Be overweight or obese and eat / drink unhealthily 	Be less likely to access health and dental care when required 	Have poorer mental health including self-harm and suicide attempts 	Engage in risky health behaviors including smoking, inconsistent contraceptive use and not using seat belts while in a car 	Experience family violence, sexual abuse or coercion and be in a serious physical fight.   Concusions There have been some significant and important improvements in the health and wellbeing for Pacific youth, demonstrating that change is possible – both at the individual and societal level given sufficient investment. These improvements must be maintained and continue to be resourced to ensure that we do not see a reverse in these trends. There are significant issues that have not improved or have worsened over the 11 year period for Pacific youth including healthy lifestyles, mental health, sexual health and family violence. The persistent health, social and educational disparities exposed in this report for Pacific youth, require urgent attention. The Adolescent Health Research Group and the associated Pacific Advisory Group hope this report will be used to advocate for appropriate and accessible health, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>educational</b> <b>support</b> for Pacific youth. There is increasing evidence that health outcomes for Pacific youth can be improved. Our young people’s behaviour is influenced by their environment – family, school, churches, communities and wider political environments. Interventions, programmes and services that address these broader contexts as well as building individual skills within a cultural framework {{are likely to be more}} successful. It is also our belief that the Pacific community has the knowledge and skills to create their own solutions - to ensure that all Pacific youth can be proud of who they are, can actively participate and contribute their many skills to society...|$|E
