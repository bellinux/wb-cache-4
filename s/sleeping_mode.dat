40|$|In-network sensor query {{processing}} is a cross-layer design {{paradigm in}} which networked sensor nodes process data acquisitional queries {{in collaboration with}} one another. As power efficiency {{is still one of}} the most severe constraints in this paradigm, we propose a distributed, cross-layer scheduling scheme for it. In this scheme, each node employs its MAC, routing, and query layers to negotiate with its parent its timing for transmission and constructs a schedule for its query processing. It then follows the schedule to compute, communicate, and sleep in each query processing cycle. This scheduling reduces wasted listening and receiving as well as the switching between active and <b>sleeping</b> <b>modes.</b> Consequently, it results in 50 - 60 % of power saving on real sensor nodes in our experiments.

Some essential issues still remain not completely resolved, and the scalability of control plane is the most intractable one with the explosive increase of network traffic. To address this issue, many researchers have proposed multiple controllers to realize logically centralized control layer. Our previous research has proposed multi-controller load balancing approach called HybridFlow. In this paper, taking advantage of HybridFlow, we propose an M-N policy multiple-controller <b>sleeping</b> <b>mode</b> by switching off redundant controllers when the system is in the light traffic condition. We use queuing theory to model the operation procedure of controllers and formulate the energy consumption management issue as a 0 - 1 integer linear programming model. Through turning off the redundant controllers when the system is in the scenario of light traffic, the total energy consumption of the whole system can be cut down. Simulation results reveal that the proposed M-N policy multiple-controller <b>sleeping</b> <b>mode</b> achieves superior energy efficiency compared to no <b>sleeping</b> <b>mode</b> and N policy <b>sleeping</b> <b>mode.</b> However, it introduces tolerable time delay.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{based on}} {{previously}} proposed multi-controller load balancing approach called HybridFlow, we propose an M-N policy multiple-controller <b>sleeping</b> <b>mode</b> by switching off redundant controllers when {{system is in}} the light traffic condition. We use queuing theory to model the operation procedure of controllers and formulate the energy consumption management problem as an 0 - 1 integer linear programming model.

Selected controllers transfer their loads to other controllers according to the principle of load balancing and minimum transmission overhead and time delay and go to <b>sleeping</b> <b>mode.</b> Then, the sleeping controllers return to work when N packets have been accumulated during the sleeping period.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} IRIS, {{an integrated}} interest dissemination and convergecasting solution for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). The interest dissemination protocol is used to build and maintain the network topology and for task/instruction assignment, while convergecasting implements data gathering at the network sink. Convergecasting heavily exploits cross-layering in that MAC and routing operation are performed jointly and relay selection is based on flexible cost functions that take into account information from different layers. The definition of the IRIS cost function enables tradeoff between key end-to-end performance metrics. In addition, it provides mechanisms for supporting efficient network behavior such as in-network data aggregation or processing. Energy usage is minimized by exploiting density estimation, <b>sleeping</b> <b>modes</b> and duty cycle control in a distributed and autonomous manner and {{as a function of}} the traffic intensity. Finally, IRIS is self adaptive, highly localized and imposes limited control overhead. IRIS performance is evaluated through ns 2 simulations as well as through experiments on a WSN testbed. Comparative performance results show that IRIS outperforms previous cross-layer solutions. The flexibility introduced by the IRIS cross-layer approach results in higher robustness than that of well-known approaches such as BoX-MAC and CTP. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{existing}} {{routing protocol}} for sensor networking {{can be divided}} into proactive routing protocol, reactive routing protocol and hybrid routing protocol. Each routing protocol has its merits and shortcomings. The lifetime will end when the working routing protocol can no longer support the whole wireless sensor network. An adaptive method based on redundancy node and dual routing protocol was proposed in the study. Redundancy node, when wireless sensor network is being deployed, can divide the wireless sensor network into operating and <b>sleeping</b> <b>modes,</b> and can use the different routing protocol. Dual routing protocol individually designs two kinds of different routing protocols in the sensor node, using the merits of these two different kinds of routing protocols to accomplish the mission of sending the data. The scenario set up is when the wireless sensor network has been used for a long time; the power kept in these sensor nodes is different. It is possible that some sensor nodes contain lower power because the heavy load of work, and some with more power because of less work load. After we send a query to the source node and unfortunately find out {{there is more than one}} wireless sensor in the routing path, and if there is power shortage, we can only query a message to send the sink to the source node. At the meantime, the source node will judge the storing condition of the power in all the sensor node...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Energy {{conservation}} {{is a global}} concern nowadays and it is widely expected that energy cost will continuously increase in the near future. The design of the Internet, unfortunately, has not taken energy issues into consideration at the very beginning. There are emerging studies on reducing Internet energy footprint. These studies aim at turning network components such as line cards or routers into <b>sleeping</b> <b>modes.</b> We make an observation that different traffic volumes on links result in different energy consumption, even without turning-off network devices. As such, we {{for the first time}} design a green Internet traffic routing scheme; and it is orthogonal to those turning-off network components schemes. There can be many design choices for our green routing schemes. As an example, an optimization problem can be formulated where we centralized compute routing paths to minimize the overall energy consumption. Such approach, however, requires to deploy additional protocols for the Internet. In this paper, we propose a hop-by-hop routing scheme. Such scheme can be easily incorporated into current OSPF protocol. We solve many challenges. First, we present a power model to quantify link rate and power consumption. We validate our model using real world experiments. Second, unlike centralized computing, a key challenge for hop-by-hop computing is to avoid routing loops. We thus design green routing algorithms that are isotonic and guarantee that no loop will be formulated. Third, hop-by-hop routing without loops does not naturally lead to minimized energy consumption. Therefore, we develop a set of enhanced algorithms that substantially improve the performance. Fourth, a “green” path may degrade QoS performance such as end-to-end delay. We study this problem and develop an algorithm that co-considers energy conservation and path stretch. We comprehensively evaluate our algorithms through simulations on synthetic and real topologies and traffic traces. We show that with green routing, we can save the power that is consumed by line cards for as much as 50 %. I...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{benefits}} of using autonomous sensors in spacecraft. Avoidance of wired connections reduces cost, mass, {{and increases the}} flexibility and reliability of the system. The impact of wire reduction can be significant, especially for small satellites with many sensors, like temperature and sun sensors. Previous research has already focused on wireless intra- spacecraft communications. This research tests the self-powering capabilities of a system based on a COTS thermoelectric generator connected to a Bluetooth Low energy communication system, with a built-in controller and temperature sensor, and a power management interface. The system will {{be considered as a}} candidate for an autonomous temperature sensor in a future PocketQube mission of the university. Controlled temperature differences can be achieved in a test environment, allowing the measurement of the generator power capabilities. It is tested that the system requires, for operation, a minimum temperature difference of 2. 31 degrees between the extremes of the thermoelectric generator. It generates a peak power of 234 μW for that difference. In addition, the voltage difference obtained of 35. 5 mV exceeds the minimum voltage required by the power management subsystem to be used. The power management sub-system consists of an ultra-low power converter that provides an output voltage of 4. 1 V and a measured power efficiency of 32 % Moreover, thanks to the management of the Bluetooth <b>sleeping</b> <b>modes,</b> with the built-in controller and several operational amplifier comparators, an average power consumption of 5 μW is required during operation.

Its implementation may provide substantial advantages for remote or/and locations where wiring is difficult to integrate.
