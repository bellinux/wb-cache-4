5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken <b>storage</b> <b>vessels,</b> in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E

The effects of cold {{inlet air temperature}} and flow rate, {{and the amount of}} heat energy storage particles on the outlet air temperature from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> and the completion time of the heat energy release process were investigated. As a result, the non-dimensional correlations for the outlet air temperature from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> and the completion time of the heat energy release process were expressed in terms of non-dimensional pumping power, Stefan number and ratio of the packed particle layer height to the diameter of the cylindrical heat <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> 一般に、固液相変化潜熱蓄熱システムにおいては、熱媒体と蓄熱材とはカプセル壁により隔離されており、その熱抵抗が大きな熱損失と迅速な熱授受を阻害する要因となることから、著者らは潜熱体が融解しても蓄熱材が固相状態の形状を保つカプセル型の形状安定化平板状パラフィン蓄熱体の開発とその蓄熱槽内での蓄放熱特性に関する研究を行ってきた。また、前報においては、潜熱蓄熱槽内に充填した球状の形状安定化パラフィン蓄熱材を温空気流入により流動層化し、熱媒体である温空気の搬送動力の軽減と蓄熱材の均一な蓄熱効果の検討結果を報告した。本報告は、前報に述べた潜熱蓄熱操作により得られた形状安定化パラフィン系球状潜熱粒子充填層に低温空気を流入させ、流動層化した場合の、球状潜熱粒子群の放熱特性に関する実験結果を述べたものである。具体的には、この種の流動層型潜熱蓄熱槽の放熱特性を評価する上で重要な要素となる蓄熱槽出口空気温度および潜熱放熱完了時間に関して、送風動力、蓄熱槽入口空気温度および蓄熱材粒子層高さを実験因子として検討するものである。さらに、蓄熱槽出口空気温度および潜熱放熱完了時間を予測する無次元整理式の提案を試みるものである...|$|R

Exposure of humans to the gas first affects the eyes and respiratory tracts causing irritation, loss of vision, cough, and excessive formation of saliva and sputum.

25|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{generate electricity}} {{by using the}} heat of the fission reaction to produce steam, which is used to drive turbines in order to generate electricity. When the reactor stops operating, the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat (decay heat) for a time, and so require continued cooling. Initially this decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission, decreasing over several days before reaching shutdown levels. Afterwards, spent fuel rods typically require several years in a spent fuel pool before they can be safely transferred to dry cask <b>storage</b> <b>vessels.</b> The decay heat in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had the capacity to boil about 70 metric tons of water per day.|$|E

25|$|In {{countries}} with nuclear power, radioactive wastes comprise less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, {{much of which}} remains hazardous for long periods. Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants. Coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal. A 2008 report from Oak Ridge National Laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population effective dose equivalent, or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 {{times as much as}} from the operation of nuclear plants. Indeed, coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis, but coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated, and this is released directly into the environment as fly ash, whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials, for example, in dry cask <b>storage</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{the colonies}} {{of a few}} ant species, there are {{physical}} castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called [...] "soldier" [...] ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their [...] "duties" [...] typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation {{in the size of}} workers. The smallest and largest workers in Pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500-fold difference in their dry-weights. Workers cannot mate; however, because of the haplodiploid sex-determination system in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as honeypot ants, young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food <b>storage</b> <b>vessels.</b> These food storage workers are called repletes. For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus. Usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes, demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism. This polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths; however, genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in Acromyrmex sp. These polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes; differences in a single gene of Solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens. The Australian jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) has only a single pair of chromosomes (with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid), the lowest number known for any animal, making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects.|$|E
