Beliefnet called the song [...] "stirring", while Hal Hinson of The Washington Post considers it {{to be among the}} film's best. Roger Moore of the Chicago Tribune referred to [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as a [...] "brilliant" [...] song that [...] "can move you to tears," [...] while James Berardinelli of ReelViews cited it among the film's most [...] "memorable" [...] songs. Anthony Quinn of The Independent highlighted [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as the film's best song, going on to praise Lansbury's [...] "magnificent" [...] performance, while the Deseret News Chris Hicks called it [...] "beautiful."

Christley wrote that Lansbury [...] "delivers the film's title tune, gooey treacle that it is, like nobody's business."

[...] Aylin Zara of BuzzFeed opined that Lansbury's version is superior to the <b>single,</b> <b>penning,</b> [...] "Though the commercial pop version of 'Beauty and the Beast,' sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson, is great, the film version — performed by Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts — is even better. Tender and warm ... it tugs at all the right heartstrings to get your eyes a little misty." [...] Rachael Monaco of AXS cited [...] "Tale as old as time. Tune as old as song. Bittersweet and strange. Finding you can change. Learning you were wrong. Certain as the sun rising in the East. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast" [...] as the film's best lyric. Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich, however, admitted to preferring [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] and [...] "Belle" [...] over [...] "Beauty and the Beast".|$|E
