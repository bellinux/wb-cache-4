500|$|In {{an effort}} to adhere to Wikipedia policy, Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee decided on May 28, 2009, to {{restrict}} editing from Scientology organization IP addresses {{in order to prevent}} self-serving edits by editors within Church of Scientology-administered networks. The decision accorded Scientology-controlled IP addresses the same blockable status as open proxies on the site. Ten members of the Arbitration Committee voted in favor of the ruling, thus preventing such users from editing existing articles or creating new articles on the <b>site.</b> <b>Wikipedia</b> previously frequently had banned individual users from the site, but not entire organizations. The Arbitration decision came as the culmination of a [...] "longstanding struggle" [...] involving promoters of the organization and critics of its practices. ABC News noted the conflict was [...] "one of the longest-running disputes in Wikipedia's history". The conflict involved over 400 articles within the topic of Scientology. It was the fourth such Arbitration Case before Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee on the topic of Scientology in the prior four years. The case was drawn out for six months, prior to the decision of the Arbitration Committee.|$|E
500|$|On July 24, 2006, Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt {{started a}} thread titled [...] "Who is Essjay?"

Jordan claimed that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law {{and worked as a}} tenured professor at a private university. Five days later, The New Yorker published an interview with Essjay which repeated some of the claims. Wikipedia Review found definitive proof that Jordan made false claims about his qualifications and experience, including that he was a [...] "tenured professor", a claim that was used to describe Essjay in the interview for The New Yorker. In January 2007, Daniel Brandt contacted the author of the article in The New Yorker about the discrepancies in Jordan's biography and the exploitation of his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over Wikipedia content.|$|E

50|$|The Internet uses both a {{broadcast}} and a narrowcast model.

However, sites that require one to log-in before viewing content are based more on the narrowcast model. Push technologies which send information to subscribers are another form for narrowcasting.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of many-to-many online participatory journalism, {{by focusing on the}} case of Wikipedia, a multilingual, online encyclopedia created collaboratively by thousands of ordinary Internet users. By allowing anyone to edit any page within the web <b>site,</b> <b>Wikipedia</b> has flourished by presenting a low barrier to participation, maintaining a human-centered working environment and making contributors stakeholders in the journalistic effort. In just three years, it has gained a large following and is available in over 50 different languages. This paper analyzes its fundamental links to the open source movement, emergence as a unique online community and role in the modern media ecology. It concludes with an interpretation of participatory journalism as an ecosystem of technology, community and content...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{society has}} become {{increasingly}} balkanized, or ideologically polarized and socially fragmented. Political parties {{interact with each other}} over divisive issues by using polarizing rhetoric. Internet users create small, opinionated communities like dKosapedia and Conservapedia, Wikipedia-like websites written from positions of left-leaning and right-leaning bias. Even Wikipedia may not be immune to balkanization. As a free encyclopedia written by users from an unbiased point of view, it {{is in the interest of}} the general public to keep Wikipedia as free of balkanization and polarization as possible. If Wikipedia authors are free to express their conflicting points of view, the quality of information may degrade and the community could become divided. This might lead to less time being invested in improving articles, and more time spent resolving conflict. Moreover, balkanization could also lead to users developing discipline-specific editing norms, creating less cohesiveness in the overall <b>site</b> <b>Wikipedia</b> offers a chance to investigate balkanization on a large scale, but is also difficult to study for exactly this reason. Wikipedia represents terabytes of text. The restrictive size of the dataset and the lack of available software libraries for parsing make working with Wikipedia difficult. This thesis presents a software library capable of handling Wikipedia 2 ̆ 7 s large dataset by using parallel processing techniques. The software library parses Wikipedia revision histories into a graph model so that we can investigate balkanization on Wikipedia using established graph theory metrics. I contribute both the java software library for parsing revision histories and implementations and analysis of three possible balkanization metrics: density, degree centrality, and conditional probability...|$|E
40|$|When {{dealing with}} the search of a topic over Internet, Wikipedia is often {{at the top of}} the list of sites which can provide the {{required}} information. As known, Wikipedia is a free, web-based, collaborative, multilingual encyclopedia supported by a non profit project. Its 15 million articles (over 3. 3 million in English) have been written collaboratively by volunteers around the world, and almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the <b>site.</b> <b>Wikipedia</b> was launched in 2001 and is currently the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet. Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Unfortunately, the times for editing and correcting the articles were too long and Nupedia only published 24 articles before being abandoned. There are several advantages and disadvantages in a project like Wikipedia. Among the first, one should mention the rapidity in publication, the chance to enlarge a primitive article in further steps, the availability to many more people than printed documents, the free character. On the other hand, the many disadvantages are also evident. One over all: the philosophy of publishing an article without review and in successive steps may be the source of misunderstanding and mistakes. The errors contained in an article are in fact removed time after time, however the original form is available to the public for several days, which often coincide with the period of major accesses in the search for information. Moreover, the compilation and review made by non-experts may be not completely correct and exhaustive, but the user (which is not familiar with the topic) has no clue to distinguish a good from a fair article. In this presentation a few examples will be given to show failures and merits of Wikipedia together with some suggestions on how to correctly approach the information contained within. The results are then used for a critical analysis on the relationships between seismologists and the web...|$|E
