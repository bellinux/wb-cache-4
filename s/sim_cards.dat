5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several months {{ahead of time}} and knew some areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the <b>SIM</b> <b>cards,</b> one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Speier {{introduced}} the Closing the Pre-Paid Mobile Device Security Gap Act (H.R. 4886) to force purchasers of prepaid mobile devices or <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> to provide identification.|$|E
25|$|Since Iridium {{will not}} sell prepaid cards or even its {{subscription}} call service directly, {{it is hard}} to obtain the exact price of making a call. There are numerous distributors that will activate Iridium phones and sell pre-paid vouchers and <b>SIM</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is {{designed}} {{not to allow}} the Ki to be obtained using the smart-card interface. Instead, the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> provides a function, Run GSM Algorithm, that allows the phone to pass data to the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> to be signed with the Ki. This, by design, makes usage of the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> mandatory unless the Ki can be extracted from the <b>SIM</b> <b>card,</b> or the carrier is willing to reveal the Ki. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing SRES_2 (see step 4, below) from the Ki has certain vulnerabilities that can allow the extraction of the Ki from a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> {{and the making of}} a duplicate <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> slot {{is visible}} once {{the back cover}} is removed and can be {{accessed}} by removing the battery pack. The second <b>SIM</b> <b>Card</b> slot is located right below the main <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> slot. The battery possesses a capacity of Li-Ion 2000mAh.|$|R
50|$|On some {{networks}} a GSM phone {{without a}} <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> {{may be used}} to make emergency calls and most GSM phones accept a larger list of emergency numbers without <b>SIM</b> <b>card,</b> such as 112, 911, 118, 119, 000, 110, 08, and 999. However, some GSM networks will not accept emergency calls from phones without a <b>SIM</b> <b>card,</b> or even require a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> that has credit. For example, Latin American networks typically do not allow emergency calls without a SIM. Also, GSM phones sold in some countries like USA do not accept 112 as an emergency number even if they have a <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> inserted.|$|R
25|$|Sainsbury's {{operated}} a virtual mobile network from 2001 until 2003 which closed due to being commercially unsustainable. In 2013 Sainsbury's re-entered the UK telecommunications industry when it launched a {{mobile phone network}} called Mobile by Sainsbury's. The virtual network was operated in partnership with Vodafone. The network was promoted heavily in store and most supermarkets started retailing <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> and handsets for the network. However, in 2015 Sainsbury's announced that the service would be closing in January 2016 after a breakdown in the relationship with its provider Vodafone.|$|E
25|$|Prepaid <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> are {{available}} {{from a variety of}} different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as eBay. Their values range from 50 to 5,000 minutes; the 50 minute cards have no validity and the 75 minute vouchers are valid for only a month, but the 5,000 minute cards stay valid for two years. Since Iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around US$45. It is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new SIM card.|$|E
25|$|Later, American {{scientists}} {{outlined a}} theoretical attack against <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> used for GSM mobile phones. Together with hackers from the Chaos Computer Club, Floricic successfully created a working clone {{of such a}} SIM card, thus showing the practicability of the attack. He also engaged in cloning the German phonecard and succeeded. While Floricic only wanted to demonstrate the insecurity of the system, the proven insecurity was also abused by criminals {{which led to the}} attention of law enforcement agencies and the German national phone operator Deutsche Telekom. After Deutsche Telekom changed the system, Floricic tried to remove a complete public card phone from a booth by force (using a sledgehammer) on 3 March 1995 in order to, as he told, adapt his phonecard simulators to the latest changes. He and a friend were, however, caught by the police upon this attempt. Floricic was later sentenced to a prison term of 15 months which was suspended to probation.|$|E

500|$|Chan and Sukumaran {{handed out}} <b>SIM</b> <b>cards,</b> {{to stay in}} contact. During their stay, police noted the group would spend {{a large amount of}} time indoors in their hotel rooms, {{although}} Rush and Czugaj did make the most of their time in Bali and went shopping, eating, drinking and playing water sports. The group met again on 16 April for what police allege was a final briefing, before meeting for their final time at the airport before their 17 April arrest. After receiving information from the AFP about the group, including the names, passport numbers and information relating to their links to possible illegal drug trade, Indonesian police placed the group under constant surveillance for a week before their arrest.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007 (four {{months after}} the iPhone was introduced), Paul Holman and Lucy Rivello filed a class action lawsuit (numbered C07-05152) in the Northern District of California. [...] The lawsuit {{referenced}} Apple's SIM lock on the iPhone and Apple's (at the time) complete ban on third-party apps, and alleged that the 1.1.1 software update was [...] "expressly designed" [...] to disable unapproved <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> and apps. [...] The lawsuit {{said that this was}} an unfair, unlawful, and fraudulent business practice (see False advertising) under California's Unfair Competition Law; that the combination of AT&T Mobility and Apple was to reduce competition and cause a monopoly in violation of California's antitrust law and the Sherman Antitrust Act; and that this disabling was a violation of the Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the finals, the Lithuanian {{media outlet}} 15 min {{released}} an undercover video suggesting that representatives from Azerbaijan {{were trying to}} bribe Lithuanians for votes in the tele/smsvoting. The video detailed the plan, which involved recruiting groups of 10 people each, and supplying them with <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> so they could vote multiple times during the voting window in the tele/smsvoting. It was also suggested that similar activity was taking place {{in a total of}} 15 countries including Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Croatia and Switzerland. In response to the allegations, Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand reaffirmed the contest's commitment to a [...] "fair and transparent result." [...] He stated that while Eurovision organisers were looking into the case, they [...] " [...] that the intention of these individuals have not yet been clarified, and nor has a link been established between the individuals in the video and the Azeri delegation, the Azeri act or the Azeri EBU member Ictimai TV." [...] He added that, since 1998, when he was first involved with the contest, [...] "every year there are rumors about irregularities in the voting".|$|E
5000|$|A {{mobile phone}} may be PIN protected. If enabled, the PIN (also called a passcode) for GSM mobile phones can be between four and eight digits [...] and is {{recorded}} in the <b>SIM</b> <b>card.</b> If such a PIN is entered incorrectly three times, the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is blocked until a personal unblocking code (PUC or PUK), provided by the service operator, is entered. If the PUC is entered incorrectly ten times, the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is permanently blocked, requiring a new <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> from the mobile carrier service.|$|R

5000|$|GSM feature phones {{require a}} small {{microchip}} called a Subscriber Identity Module or <b>SIM</b> <b>card,</b> {{in order to}} function. The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is approximately {{the size of a}} small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the service-subscriber key (IMSI) and the Ki used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone. The <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> allows users to change phones by simply removing the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device, provided that this is not prevented by a SIM lock. The first <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient for the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja.|$|R
5000|$|Turbo <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> (also {{known as}} TurboSIM) is {{considered}} to be the forerunner of a large family of [...] "Dual SIM" [...] devices (HyperCard, HyperSIM, China3GPP, StealthSim, MagicSIMetc.) that piggyback on a mobile telephone <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> to alter its normal operation. It was introduced on December 1, 2004 by BLADOX, located in Prague, Czech Republic. It is a very thin device with a 9mm by 9mm microprocessor mounted in the top right corner, with maker's name BLADOX in gold letters on its black PCB. It is pressed on top of a normal <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> (with some plastic cut off) {{in such a way that}} it is still small enough to be inserted into the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> slot of any GSM phone. Without the TurboSIM, the original <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is usable as before.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{requirement}} to have a SIM card to access the service, users would therefore need an additional mobile phone or Dual SIM phone. Equity Bank overcame this challenge by adopting the use of 0.1 millimetres thick ultra-slim <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> from Taisys Solutions, using technology originally developed in China. The ultra-slim <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> are placed {{at the back of}} normal <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> therefore tackling this challenge effectively. This ultra-slim <b>SIM</b> <b>cards</b> would also come with Near Field Communication (NFC) capability that enables them to be swiped on the point of sale devices or ATM thus converting a mobile phone into a credit or debit card.|$|E

50|$|The GSM {{variants}} of the Galaxy Tab have an externally accessible <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> slot. If the <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> is removed while {{the system is}} on, the system automatically reboots. The AT&T and T-Mobile {{variants of}} the Galaxy Tab ship with a micro SIM in a micro SIM adapter. For non-US Galaxy Tabs, with phone function, this slot can also accommodate a 3G data-only <b>SIM</b> <b>card</b> if the user does not need telephone functionality.|$|R
