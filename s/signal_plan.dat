He treated honours on fixed considerations. Especially in the altitudes of the peerage, he tried hard to find solid political ground to go upon. He noted the remarkable fact that though a very large majority of the peerages granted since 1835 had been made {{on the advice of}} liberal ministers, yet such is the influence of wealth and privileged station that the liberal minority in the Lords had decreased. In 1869 the conservative majority was between sixty and seventy, without counting bishops or nominal liberals. Yet household suffrage at this very time had immensely increased the moral strength of the House of Commons. The crisis upon the Irish church had been borne with impatience, and Mr. Gladstone discerned a combustible temper at the action of the Lords that might easily have burst into flame. Still he saw no <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> for improving the upper House. The appointment of life peers might be desirable, he said, but it was not easy to arrange, nor could its effect be great. The means of action therefore for bringing the Lords into more conformity or better proportions to the Commons, were very moderate. But that made it all the more important that they should not be overlooked. The governing idea in respect of both classes of hereditary honours was in his judgment the maintenance of a due relation between the members in those elevated ranks, and the number of persons offering the proper conditions for promotion of this kind, in a country so rapidly growing in wealth and population.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a method for traffic signal control {{including}} simultaneously <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> design and signal timing optimization with real-time information on the network dynamics. The problem is formulated so as to find the <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> design, the green and inter-green time for each signal group in response to recurrent traffic flow demand at an intersection. The approach used was the group-based Akçelik method for determining critical path, cycle length and green time split for each possible <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> design. The <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> design selection was formulated to minimize the total delay. The resulting algorithm was coded in Java and used TraSMAPI to dynamically link it to Aimsun's API, which allows an automatic change of the signal settings at an isolated signal control intersection. A theoretical three arms intersection with a time varying origin-destination demand example is tested to demonstrate the proposed method. The paper contributes {{to the development of}} an integrated design of <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> design and signal timings.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prototype for centralised urban traffic control utilising techniques {{from the field}} of Artificial Intelligence. The focus of this presentation is on the prototype as a novel architecture for knowledge based traffic control. The prototype is called the Intelligent Urban Traffic Control System (IUTCS), and was developed under DRIVE 1. The IUTCS is now receiving further development and a subsequent testing as part of a DRIVE 2 project. The tests will be performed in four European cities; Trondheim, Cologne, Madrid and Genova. 1. INTRODUCTION In a developed prototype for urban traffic control, the IUTCS, we have researched the possibilities for supporting real time traffic control more efficiently by applying techniques {{from the field of}} Artificial Intelligence. The prototype attack the traffic control problem of urban areas, and more specifically, dynamically controlled traffic flow by means of controlling traffic lights. The prototype {{has been described as a}} whole on several other occasions ([Irgens 90 - 1], [Ambrosino 91], [Irgens 90 - 2]).

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} implementation of Superstreets on congested arterials, reliable methodologies for such designs remain unavailable. The {{purpose of this}} research is to fill the information gap by offering reliable tools to assist traffic professionals in the design of Superstreets with and without signal control. The entire tool developed in this thesis consists of three models. The first model is used to determine the minimum U-turn offset length for an Un-signalized Superstreet, given the arterial headway distribution of the traffic flows and the distribution of critical gaps among drivers. The second model is designed to estimate the queue size and its variation on each critical link in a signalized Superstreet, based on the given <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> and the range of observed volumes.

40|$|Modern trams are {{developing}} fast {{because of their}} characteristics like medium capability and energy saving. Exclusive way is always set in practice to avoid interruption from general vehicles, while trams have to stop at intersections frequently due to signal rules in the road network. Therefore, signal optimization has great effects on operational efficiency of trams system. In this paper, an arterial signal coordination optimization model is proposed for trams progression based on the Asymmetrical Multi-BAND (AM-BAND) method. The AM-BAND is modified from the following aspects. Firstly, BAM-BAND is developed by supplementing active bandwidth constraints to AM-BAND. Assisted by the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio, two arterial signals plans with eight intersections are achieved from AM-BAND and BAM-BAND for comparison. Secondly, based on the modified BAM-BAND, a BAM-TRAMBAND model is presented, which incorporates three constraints regarding tram operations, including dwell time at stations, active signal priority, and minimum bandwidth value. The case study and VISSIM simulation results show that travel times of trams decrease with <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> from BAM-TRAMBAND comparing with the original <b>signal</b> <b>plan.</b> Moreover, traffic performance indicators such as stops and delay are improved significantly...|$|E

The controller aims for three operational objectives: dynamic allocation of green time, automatic adjustment to control parameters, and fast revision of <b>signal</b> <b>plans.</b> The control algorithm is built on approximate dynamic programming (ADP). This approach substantially reduces computational burden by using an approximation to the value function of the dynamic programming and reinforcement learning to update the approximation. We investigate temporal-difference learning and perturbation learning as specific learning techniques for the ADP approach. We find in computer simulation that the ADP controllers achieve substantial reduction in vehicle delays in comparison with optimised fixed-time plans. Our results show that substantial benefits can be gained by increasing the frequency at which the <b>signal</b> <b>plans</b> are revised, which can be achieved conveniently using the ADP approach...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{objectives}} for this research. One {{is to develop}} an effective procedure to optimize intersection signal timing by minimizing total delay for both vehicles and pedestrians. The second objective is to establish guidance for pedestrian crossing phase selection (two-way or scramble) {{and the length of}} WALK phase when scramble crossing is used. An optimization procedure for <b>signal</b> <b>plans</b> in an isolated intersection is developed. The procedure yields up to four phases for vehicles with either the two-way or scramble pedestrian crossing phase. A simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in finding suitable <b>signal</b> <b>plans</b> because of the existence of a very large solution space. The GA fitness function is the total users delay (or cost). Compared with Highway Capacity Software (HCS) GA function, the proposed procedure has the same accuracy and more capabilities. When there is no pedestrian at the intersection, with the same input, the total delay from HCS and the proposed GA procedure has no significant difference (< 0. 2 %) before optimization. After optimization, the <b>signal</b> <b>plans</b> recommended by the proposed procedure can result in delay values that are slightly less than or {{at least as much as}} the delay values from the HCS GA optimized <b>signal</b> <b>plans.</b> However, when pedestrian delay is considered in signal timing, such a comparison could not be made because the HCS does not compute a delay for pedestrians, while the proposed GA procedure does. Contour diagrams and look-up tables are generated to guide the decision between two-way and scramble phases. The guidance considers different combinations of vehicular volume, pedestrian volume, relative value of time, initial queue, and geometric layout of the intersection. Not only pedestrian volumes and right-turn vehicle volumes need to be taken into account, but also through (and left-turn) vehicle volumes. Scramble crossing is beneficial when pedestrian and right-turn vehicle volumes in an approach are high but through vehicle volumes are relatively lower...|$|R

40|$|A {{protected}} {{left turn}} phase {{is often used}} at intersections with heavy left turns. This may induce a capacity gap be-tween adjacent intersections along the arterial road among which only parts of intersection are with protected left turn phase. A model for integrated optimization of protected left turn phases for adjacent intersections along the arterial road is developed to solve this problem. Two objectives are considered: capacity gap minimization and capacity maxi-mization. The problems are formulated as Binary-Integer-Linear-Programs, which are solvable by standard branch-and-bound routine. A set of constraints {{have been set up}} to ensure the feasibility of the resulting optimal left turn phase type and signal settings. A field intersections group of the Wei-er Road of Ji’nan city is used to test the proposed model.

40|$|The basic {{principle}} of optimal traffic control {{is the appropriate}} real-time response to dynamic traffic flow changes. <b>Signal</b> <b>plan</b> efficiency depends on {{a large number of}} input parameters.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of traffic signal control strategy on vehicle emissions, vehicle journey time and total throughput flow within a single isolated four-armed junction. Two pre-timed signal plans are considered, one with two-stages involving permissive-only opposing turns {{and the other with}} four-stages which has no conflicting traffic. Additionally, the increase in efficiency by utilising actuated signal timing where green time is re-optimised as flow values vary is investigated. A microscopic traffic simulation model is used to model flows and AIRE (Analysis of Instantaneous Road Emissions) microscopic emissions model is utilised to out- put emission levels from the flow data. A simple junction model shows that the two-stage <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> is more efficient in both emis- sions and journey time. However, as the level of opposed turning vehicles and conflicting movement increases, the two-stage model moves to being the inferior <b>signal</b> <b>plan</b> choice and the four-stage plan outputs fewer emissions than the two-stage plan. A real-world example of a four-armed junction has been used in this study and from the traffic survey data and existing junction layout; it is rec- ommended that a two-stage plan is used as it produces lower amounts of emissions and shorter journey times compared to a four-stage plan.
