25|$|In 1996 ScotRail had {{initiated}} {{the creation of}} a rail <b>safety</b> <b>group</b> (later to become CIRAS) by a team from Strathclyde University. Other rail lines expressed interest in the project and several rail lines in Scotland voluntarily joined the system. Following the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott mandated that all mainline rail in the UK come under the Confidential Incident Reporting & Analysis System (CIRAS) to involve every rail employee in the rail safety process. CIRAS now provides services to all rail workers and operating sectors throughout England, Scotland and Wales.|$|E

40|$|Safety climate can be {{conceptualized}} at {{both the}} individual and group levels, {{and there is no}} consensus as to its operationalization. In the construction safety research, rare efforts have been made to investigate the effects of both individual differences and contextual factors on safety outcomes. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper takes <b>group</b> <b>safety</b> climate (safety climate at the group level) as a contextual factor and examines its impact on construction personnel&# 039;s safety behavior, along with construction personnel&# 039;s individual attributes. Data were collected from 157 construction personnel nested in 33 work crews in an ongoing railway project, and then analyzed with the ordinary least squares regression technique. The findings show that members within the same <b>group</b> develop shared <b>safety</b> climate perceptions and members of different groups have significantly different <b>safety</b> climate perceptions. <b>Group</b> <b>safety</b> climate level predicts individual safety behavior, controlling for individual attributes. <b>Group</b> <b>safety</b> climate level also predicts <b>group</b> <b>safety</b> behavior...|$|R
