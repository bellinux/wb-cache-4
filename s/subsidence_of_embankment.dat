50|$|In 1979 Potts {{joined the}} {{academic}} {{staff at the}} Department of Civil Engineering at Imperial College and was responsible for research and teaching {{in the field of}} numerical and analytical methods in geomechanics. At Imperial College, Potts worked with and was influenced by Professors Peter Rolfe Vaughan and John Burland. Since 1998, he holds the position of Professor of Analytical Soil Mechanics and of Head of Geotechnics. Professor Potts has worked extensively on the development of computer methods of analysis and, more particularly, on the application of elasto-plastic finite element programs to the analysis of real geotechnical structures. His consulting work has been concerned with the design of piles, including tension piles for offshore anchored structures, the response of offshore gravity platform foundations to cyclic loading, retaining structures of various types, cut-and-cover tunnels, bored tunnels, culverts subject to mining <b>subsidence,</b> the stability <b>of</b> <b>embankments</b> on soft ground, the stability and deformation of earth dams, the behaviour of reinforced earth structures, the prediction of ground movements around deep excavations and the role of progressive failure in embankment and cut slope problems.|$|R

40|$|Buckling of rails, {{which often}} accompanies a strong earthquake, is usually due to <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> {{the ground or}} to {{destruction}} <b>of</b> the <b>embankments</b> on which the rails lie. Buckling due to these causes is usually gentle, i. e., of large radius of curvature, and occur both in horizontal and vertical directions. There is however another sort of bucklings in which no change of any kind can be discerned in the ground, although the rails are bent sharply into more or less complicated sinuous form. 昭和 10 年台湾中部地震に関する論文及報告　第 1 編　論...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} method, the character <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> reinforced with geotextile on sloping weak foundation has been studied. It is {{shown that the}} lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> has been distinctly effected by the sloping of foundation, the value of lateral displacement on sloping foundation is greatly bigger than that of horizontal foundation. The peak value of lateral displacement can be effectively reduced by geotextile. With the same condition, geotextile in sloping foundation acts a more important effect than that of horizontal foundation. The development of plastic zone <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> has been impeded and separated by geotextile, which enhanced the stability <b>of</b> <b>embankment.</b> The results also indicated that, if necessary, reinforcement such as anti-slide pile should be layout at lower toe <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> on sloping weak foundation...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> over {{soft soil}} {{is influenced by}} several factors such as subsoil and filling material properties, embankment geometry, ground water level and working load. This paper will present the analysis of influencing of soft soil thickness and embankment geometry to the stability <b>of</b> <b>embankment.</b> The analysis will be conducted using Slope/W by varying the thickness of soft soil and embankment geometry with certain embankment height and soft soil and fill material properties. The thickness of soft soil is varies in range of 2 m to 15 m, whereas the slope <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> is varies in 4 condition i. e. 1 : 1 (vertical : horizontal), 1 : 1. 5, 1 : 2, and 1 : 2. 5, {{as well as the}} top width <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> from 10 m to 40 m, with the output is factor <b>of</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>embankment.</b> The analysis result show the factor of safety is decreased when the top side <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> is wider as well as when the slope <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> is gentler. The analysis also show the influence of soft soil thickness to the embankment stability is limited to certain depth only that is in range of 7 m to 10 m, then the factor of safety remains constant. </p...|$|R

50|$|In many cases, {{protection}} against flooding is not only determined by the height <b>of</b> the <b>embankments,</b> but merely by the strength <b>of</b> the <b>embankments.</b> Most <b>of</b> the weak spots in the <b>embankments</b> collapse because <b>of</b> a lack of strength with regard to stability or internal erosion rather than be flooded. The key to a better utilization <b>of</b> the existing <b>embankments</b> and thereby reduction of the flood risks is {{to find ways to}} determine the very processes which undermine the strength <b>of</b> <b>embankments</b> {{with a high degree of}} certainty.

30|$|Ground {{subsidence}} {{has occurred}} in several plains in Iran. Iran is geographically located in an arid region with limited surface water where annual precipitation hardly reaches 250  mm. Groundwater is a substantial source of providing drinking and agricultural water in Iran which has resulted in excessive groundwater withdrawal and ground subsidence. In Rafsanjan Plain, subsidence rate is 10 percent of water-level decrease rate [18]. <b>Subsidence</b> <b>of</b> 900  mm {{as a result of}} a 15  m drop in Mashhad Plain [16], and <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> 200  m in Hashtgerd are some of the examples in Iran [6]. Southern Tehran has been experiencing subsidence with an increasing rate. Shemshaki et al. [26] reported that during 1995 – 2003, maximum <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> 1710  mm occurred in Tehran. They also noted that from January 2004 to May 2005 subsidence was also taking place rapidly in Karaj and Jajrood. Blourchi [1] introduced the results of a recent study, introducing a maximum annual <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> 360  mm/year in Tehran. All the performed studies suggest excessive groundwater withdrawal as the cause <b>of</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Mahmoudpour et al.

It is {{found that there}} is no influence on maximal vertical settlement and distribution of vertical settlement in the scope <b>of</b> original <b>embankment</b> by back berm, only the vertical settlement of foundation under back berm enlarged by back berm. The lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> could be reduced by back berm, which reduced further by width of back berm enlarged. The stability <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> increased rapidly with the width of back berm enlarged. But when the width of back berm reach a critical value, the stability <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> is no more increased with the width of back berm enlarged. In order to utilize land effectively, the width of back berm should not be bigger than the critical value. The critical value of width of back berm could be calculated with the corresponding parameters of road engineering. There is almost no influence on stability <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> by gravity <b>of</b> back berm. It is suggested to fill the back berm by the soil with big cohesive strength and big internal friction angle...|$|R
