This <b>service</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>reports</b> a system-wide implementation of a patient-initiated review appointment system called Direct Access (DA) for people with RA. The aim was to establish the impact on patient satisfaction of the new system versus usual care as well as evaluate the implementation processes. Methods: As all patients could not start on the new system at once, in order to manage the implementation, patients were randomly allocated to DA or to usual care. Instead of regular follow-up appointments, DA comprised an education session and access to a nurse-led telephone advice line where appointments could be accessed within two weeks. Usual care comprised routine follow-ups with the specialist. Data were collected on patient satisfaction, service use and outcomes of any contact to the advice line. Results: Three hundred and eleven patients with RA were assessed as being suitable for DA. In terms of patient satisfaction, between-group differences were found in favour of DA for accessibility and convenience, ease of contacting the nurse and overall satisfaction with the service.

40|$|Objectives: There is {{increasing}} {{evidence to support}} the effectiveness of eTherapies for mental health, although limited data have been reported from community-based services. Therefore, this <b>service</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>reports</b> on feasibility and outcomes from an eTherapy mental health service. Setting: ‘Self Help Services’, an Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) eTherapy service in Greater Manchester. Participants: 1068 service users referred to the service for secondary care for their mental health difficulties. Interventions: Participants were triaged into one of three eTherapy programmes: ‘Living Life to the Full Interactive’ for low mood, stress and anxiety; ‘Sleepio’ for insomnia; and ‘Breaking Free Online’ for substance misuse, depending on clinical need. Primary outcomes measures: Standardised psychometric assessments of depression, anxiety and social functioning, collected as part of the IAPT Minimum Data Set, were conducted at baseline and post-treatment. Results: Data indicated baseline differences, with the Breaking Free Online group having higher scores for depression and anxiety than the Living Life to the Full Interactive (depression CI 1. 27 to 3. 21, p< 0. 0001; anxiety CI 077 to 1. 72, p< 0. 0001) and Sleepio (depression CI 1. 19 to 4. 52, p< 0. 0001; anxiety CI 2. 16 to 5. 23, p< 0. 0001) groups. Promising improvements in mental health scores were found within all three groups (all p< 0. 0001), as were significant reductions in numbers of service users reaching clinical threshold scores for mental health difficulties (p< 0. 0001). Number of days of engagement was not related to change from baseline for the Living Life to the Full or Sleepio programmes but was associated with degree of change for Breaking Free Online. Conclusion: Data presented provide evidence for feasibility of this eTherapy delivery model in supporting service users with a range of mental health difficulties and suggest that eTherapies may be a useful addition to treatment offering in community-based services...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} and operation of a needle exchange service in one former health board area. It identifies the issues and barriers {{that are associated with}} these processes from the service providers perspective. This research shows why this provision is guided by the principles of the harm reduction philosophy and describes how harm reduction national policies have been translated into practice. A single case holistic design was the methodology employed to complete the study. This design facilitated the collection of data from policy documents and <b>service</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>reports,</b> qualitative interviews and observation of the service in operation. This research found that the case exists within a social and political context. Anecdotal evidence suggested that despite having a mandate from the government, the social context hindered the first attempt to establish the service because the organization was concerned about the controversial identity of injecting drug users. However, a few years later the service was developed because there was support from senior management. A number of practical issues were involved with the service's development, including the implementation of policies and procedures that promoted service user-friendliness. The issues associated with the operation of the service included the importance of trust and confidentiality between service providers and service users; the adequacy/inadequacy of the current staffing levels and resources; facilitating the accessibility of the service in urban and rural communities. It was apparent that the service is designed to facilitate a client's engagement with the programme but responsibility for this engagement lies with the client. This study finds that the effectiveness of the service provision can be assessed by reference to its ability to achieve its short-term objectives of changing risk taking behaviours and reducing the prevalence of blood-borne viruses and its long-term objective, of moving clients into drug treatment programmes. It is apparent that the service is effective in changing risk taking behaviours. However, at present the service cannot assess its efficacy in achieving the other two objectives. Therefore, systems should be implemented which facilitate their measurement...|$|R

Whilst such metrics are important to operational procedures, <b>service</b> <b>evaluation</b> and <b>reporting,</b> they fail to fully capture and convey the ways in which passengers experience crowded situations. This paper reports findings from a two year study of rail passenger crowding in five Australian capital cities which involved a novel mixed-methodology including ethnography, focus groups and an online stated preference choice experiment. The resulting data address the following four fundamental research questions: 1) to what extent are Australian rail passengers concerned by crowding, 2) what conditions exacerbate feelings of crowdedness, 3) what conditions mitigate feelings of crowdedness, and 4) how can we usefully understand passengers’ experiences of crowdedness? It concludes with some observations on the significance and implications of these findings for customer service provision. The findings outlined in this paper demonstrate that the experience of crowdedness (including its tolerance) cannot be understood in isolation from other customer services issues such as interior design, quality of environment, safety and public health concerns. It is hypothesised that tolerance of crowding will increase alongside improvements to overall customer service. This was the first comprehensive study of crowding in the Australian rail industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional software, component-structured systems are developed by combining independently designed and sold software components. This technology promises an easier reuse of software building blocks and, in consequence, {{a significant reduction}} of the efforts and costs to produce software applications. On the other side, component-structured software is subject to {{a new class of}} security threats. In particular, a maliciously acting component may easily spoil the application incorporating it. In this paper we introduce an approach addressing this particular threat. A so-called security wrapper monitors the events passing the interface of a component and checks them for compliance with formally specified security policies guaranteeing a benevolent behavior of the checked component. We introduce the layout and functionality of the wrappers and outline the formal security specifications which can be easily derived from a set of specification patterns. Unfortunately, the security wrappers cause runtime overhead which, however, can be significantly reduced by relaxing the degree of monitoring trustworthy components. In order to support the decision, whether a component can be trusted, we developed a special trust information service. This <b>service</b> collects <b>evaluation</b> <b>reports</b> of a particular component running in various applications which are provided by the different security wrappers.

Companies are increasingly realising the importance of customer loyalty and at such prioritising customer retention. Their attention is now focused on retaining satisfied customers, as the costs of acquiring new customers largely outweigh that of retaining existing ones. Developing and maintaining a loyal customer base is viewed as {{the single most important}} driver of long-term financial performance (Reichheld and Sasser, 1990). As a result relationship building also sometimes referred to as relationship marketing has become a new area of research for authors. The building of strong customer relationships has been recognised as a means for gaining a competitive advantage (Reichheld 1993). For service businesses, strong customer relationship is particularly important because of the high level of interpersonal contact which constitutes the main source of evaluating service quality as there is relatively a lack of objective measures for <b>service</b> <b>evaluation.</b> This <b>report</b> critically reviews the relevance of relationship marketing in a service organization with particular emphasis on agency-client relationships which ties in with Jupiter's nature of business.

In this undertaking, they need assistance and appropriate procedures and tools. Unfortunately, today's Quality of Service frameworks and Quality of Service management {{products on the}} market do not help. This thesis fills the gap. It argues {{that it is possible to}} find a common simple Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> procedure for end users and that a corresponding evaluation process can be automated. This thesis proposes a new Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> framework that is suited to end user interests and needs, that is application-oriented and networkindependent, that is open and extensible, and that has the potential to complement today's Quality of Service frameworks. It encompasses: 1. A new 5 -step Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> procedure Its purpose is to identify those few quality characteristics that are decision-relevant and that have a major influence on service quality as perceived by an end user. In a first step, all quality characteristics are identified from related international standards or specifications ("identification"). Those that are essential and decision-relevant for end user perception are chosen next ("rating"). They have to be selected for evaluation ('selection') and quantified ("quantification") before simple, objective, and cost-effective evaluation methods can be used ("evaluation") in the last step. 2. A Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> architecture Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> has to be automated to be successful and to provide usable results. An appropriate architecture involving end users, evaluation meth-ods, and the applications and services under test is designed. The usage of intelligent agents is proposed to do automated Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> for applications and services. The architecture introduced includes single agent building blocks and communication and coordination models for Quality of <b>Service</b> <b>evaluation</b> agents. 3.

40|$|Evaluation is {{nowadays}} {{a general}} {{trend in the}} European Universities. At the University of Liège, the evaluation process is threefold: fist there is {{the evaluation of the}} bachelor and master degrees, then the second evaluation concerns the internal administrations and finally Research activities are being evaluated. This quality policy at the different levels of the Institution is organized by the Vice-Rector for Quality, Pr. Freddy Coignoul and the SMAQ service (Service de Management et d’Accompagnement à la Qualité), which aims to promote, coordinate and disseminate within the University of Liège a culture of the Quality, founded on the values of the Institution. The Research assessment is a procedure undertaken by the University in order to promote the quality of the research in the Departments or research centres. Within the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the evaluation of the Bachelor and Master degrees in Engineering was carried out in 2013 by the AEQES (Agence pour l’Evaluation de la Qualité de l’Enseignement) and CTI (Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur - France). The present report is dedicated to the evaluation of research led in the Education and Research Department (DER) ArGEnCo. The present <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> proposes a global presentation of all our research activities. At the Department level, one of the elected members of the Executive Bureau {{is in charge of the}} Research, covering both evaluation and quality policy. In October 2013, the Executive bureau appointed a research steering committee, whose fist task was to coordinate the present <b>evaluation</b> <b>report,</b> following the guidelines of the SMAQ service. The draft of such a document arises from the work of the steering committee but also from the contributions of all Department members, who were asked to contribute to the report or to complete databases. The progress of this <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> was presented by the Steering committee to the Department Council and during the General Assembly of the Department. Moreover, two Focus groups were organized by the SMAQ service, in order to get the feedback of technician and administrative members on one hand and scientific members on the other hand, on the general organization of the research in the ArGEnCo Department. The reports of these two Focus groups (Appendix 4 in French) underpinned our thinking about our research management. This report is therefore the fist evaluation of the research led in the Department, the present effort should be pursued, and deepened, within the coming years. Some of the databases necessary for the evaluation have been developed in the frame of this procedure. This has resulted in a huge amount of work for every Department members to collect all the data. New procedures in the management of the Department will help establishing the next research <b>evaluation</b> <b>reports</b> systematically, in particular for the collection of the complete dataset. Following the guidelines of the SMAQ <b>service,</b> this <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> is divided into two main parts: the fist one focuses on a self-evaluation report of the research activities and the second part presents the Action Plan of the Department for the next five years to come. The self-evaluation report is composed of four Sections: Section one presents the Research organization and topics of the Department, Section two focuses on the Research activities, Section three gives an overview of the mobility (in and out), the attractiveness and the scientific recognition of the Department and finally Section four is dedicated to the resources available in ArGEnCo Department. Each Section ends up with a SWOT analysis. The Action Plan proposed by the Steering Committee results from the analysis of the self-evaluation report, insofar as it synthesizes and prioritizes the actions of the Department for the next fie years. These priorities are formulated as proposals following a contractual approach between research entities and Institution authorities, to whom the report will be presented...|$|R

I must pause and pay tribute to the Heads of Department who ensured that we received very good co-operation and brought their entire management team on board. This support has raised the bar and resulted in better reports. The Heads of Department were present at most of the pre-evaluation briefing sessions and also the important sessions when the PSC presented its interim reports. The latter resulted in robust debate and what was encouraging was the maturity with which findings were accepted. The commitment to deal with the findings is in contrast to the relative defensiveness that we previously experienced. This approach marks a milestone in that it suggests that departments now accept that Monitoring and Evaluation is an important part of public management.
