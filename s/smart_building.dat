40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the route coordination problem in emergency evacuation of large <b>smart</b> <b>buildings.</b> The building evacuation time is crucial in saving lives in emergency situations caused by imminent natural or man-made threats and disasters. Conventional approaches to evacuation route coordination are static and predefined. They rely on evacuation plans present only at {{a limited number of}} building locations and possibly a trained evacuation personnel to resolve unexpected contingencies. <b>Smart</b> <b>buildings</b> today are equipped with sensory infrastructure {{that can be used for}} an autonomous situation-aware evacuation guidance optimized in real time. A system providing such a guidance can help in avoiding additional evacuation casualties due to the flaws of the conventional evacuation approaches. Such a system should be robust and scalable to dynamically adapt to the number of evacuees and the size and safety conditions of a building. In this respect, we propose a distributed route recommender architecture for situation-aware evacuation guidance in <b>smart</b> <b>buildings</b> and describe its key modules in detail. We give an example of its functioning dynamics on a use case...|$|R
