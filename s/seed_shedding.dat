50|$|Like {{all other}} {{species in the}} genus Gerbillus, the Anderson's gerbil is a {{burrowing}} rodent. The evidence for this mammal tends {{to suggest that it}} has a nomadic lifestyle considering that the warrens that it builds it not as complex as other genera of gerbils. However, the species sometimes live in groups when they are in a favorable habitat that is suitable for the living conditions of a group. This particular species of gerbil have been found to occupy a small home range typically from 32 to 34 square meters. This species of gerbil has been documented to be nocturnal. These gerbil are seed-eating gerbils and feed on the particular seeds of the common evergreen Thymelea hirsuta. The breeding season for the Anderson's gerbil has been recorded to occur during late winter and early spring. Their breeding season coincides with the <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> of the Thymela hirsuta. Both genders of the species are active for reproductive purposes only once per year. The gestation period for the females is from 20 to 22 days. The females usually give birth to a liter of three to seven offspring. Anderson's gerbil has been said to be able to reproduce the breeding the year after it is born.|$|E

In this study, a series of field experiments is presented focussing more specifically on the influence of prevention of weed <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> and of different cultivation tactics in the system on intra-row weed emergence in the bands in year II. As the system excludes inverting soil tillage between year I and year II, the prevention of weed <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> in year I {{turned out to be a}} key factor for achieving the desired effect of the system. This was seen with spring barley grown in year I but not with winter wheat, where the system actually resulted in an increase of intra-row weed numbers in spite of the measures taken in year I. Cultivating the crop-free bands in spring barley in year I with conventional goose-foot shares in order to further enhance seed germination and mortality had no significant effects regardless of time and intensity. Results from two other experiments, where freshly shed weed seeds were incorporated into the soil, supported the finding that cultivating the bands was of no advantage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBidens pilosa L. is a weedy {{species in}} the Asteraceae {{producing}} dimorphic one-seeded fruits, with longer black seeds centrally situated in the capitulum, and shorter dormant brown peripheral seeds. While the outer seeds germinate readily after <b>seed</b> <b>shedding,</b> the shorter seeds possess various dormancy mechanisms, including requirements for after-ripening and red light. Here we show that applications of reactive oxygen species (ROS) -generating reagents can remove dormancy in the short seeds. In B. pilosa, reagents that generate hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide (O 2 ¯) partially replaced the requirement for after-ripening, while O 2 ¯ generation replaced the requirement for red light. Hence, ROS appear to be implicated in the alleviation of dormancy in the seeds of B. pilosa...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of traditional management practices {{is essential for}} the conservation of the biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands including species-rich hay meadows. In the canton Valais (Switzerland), hay meadows are traditionally irrigated using open water channels. However, since the 1980 s, this labour intensive irrigation technique has been increasingly replaced by sprinkler irrigation. This study examined whether the different irrigation techniques (traditional vs. sprinkler) influence the local biodiversity of species-rich hay meadows. In particular, the diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species of eight traditionally irrigated meadows were compared with those of eight sprinkler-irrigated meadows. It was also assessed whether the species of either meadow type differed in functional traits. A high plant species richness was found in the meadows investigated. The study showed that the diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species of hay meadows were not affected by the change in irrigation technique 8 – 18 years ago. However, a lower grass/forb-ratio was observed in traditionally than in sprinkler-irrigated meadows. Furthermore, irrigation technique affected the leaf distribution and the onset of <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> in plants. Thus, the change in the irrigation technique altered only some aspects of biodiversity.

40|$|Milk thistle [Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. ] is an {{important}} medicinal-industrial plant. The medicinal compounds of milk thistle are derived from its seeds. The plant is commercially cultivated {{for the production of}} silymarin. Cultivation offers the opportunity to optimise achene yield and silymarin content. Furthermore, efforts should be made to develop new cultivars. The main objective of milk thistle breeding is to develop high yielding cultivars with elevated silymarin content. There are few developed cultivars of milk thistle (e. g. Argintiu, Budakalaszi, Szibilla, Khoreslo, Babak Castle, Mirel, Silma and Silyb). Different genotypes of milk thistle have variable amount of silymarin e. g. a ‘Royston ’ genotype is rich in silymarin (6 - 10 %). Further progress can be made by using the genetic diversity available in abundance in different genotypes. The main concern of the breeder should be to increase the yield and silymarin contents of the seeds. Asynchronous flowering and <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> are also major problems in milk thistle cultivation. At the time of harvest, the plants have flower heads at all stages of development resulting non-uniform maturation of seeds.

Phenological observations were conducted in the years 2000 - 2002 at 10 -day intervals, starting from the day of crop sowing on alluvial soil made of light loam.

White goosefoot had the most favourable conditions of growth in the fodder beet crop. The herbicides in the fodder beet and faba bean crops delayed the emergence and the time of occurrence of successive white goosefoot growth stages.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms is conditioned by the {{spatial and temporal}} co-occurrence of animals and plants. In the present study we explore the timing of seed release of a myrmecochorous plant (Helleborus foetidus) and ant activity in two populations in southern Spain during 2 consecutive years. The results indicate that fruit dehiscence and <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> occur mostly {{in the morning and}} correspond to the period of maximum foraging activity of the most effective ant dispersers. By contrast, ant species that do not transport seeds and/or that do not abound near the plants are active either before or after H. foetidus diaspores are released. Experimental analysis of diet preference for three kinds of food shows that effective ant dispersers are mostly scavengers that readily feed on insect corpses and sugars. Artificial seed depots suggest that seeds deposited on the ground out of the natural daily time window of diaspore releasing are not removed by ants and suffer strong predation by nocturnal rodents Apodemus sylvaticus. Nevertheless, important inter-annual variations in rodent populations cast doubts on their real importance as selection agents.

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{persistence}} of viable {{seeds in the}} soil is an important way to assure plant propagation, especially for species which produce seeds with short lifespan. Poincianella pluviosa is a tree species which seeds have short to medium storability at room temperature. The comprehension of the maturation process is crucial to understand its strategy for propagation and it could provide tools to improve seed viability in ex situ conditions. Flowers were tagged in two consecutive cycles of maturation and pods were periodically harvested until dispersion. Seeds were classified based on their morpho-physiological features, capability to germinate and develop seedlings. The complete maturation process was attained 315 - 330 days after anthesis, a period longer than reported for seed viability at room temperature. The maximum dry mass and seed vigor were reached {{at the end of}} maturation, although elevated seedling production was obtained before physiological maturity. We suggest that the precocious ability to produce seedlings in a long maturation could be a strategy to overcome environmental constraints, as the species is distributed {{in a wide range of}} phytogeographic domains in Brazil.

The hypotheses tested here are {{that the incidence of}} seed predation by bud-infesting insect larvae in capitula of Asteraceae is positively related to (1) capitulum size among species, (2) capitulum size within species, (3) capitulum lifespan, and (4) the degree of flowering asynchrony on individual plants. Three populations of each of 20 common herbaceous species of Asteraceae from disturbed ground and grassland habitats were monitored for the presence of pre-dispersal, seed-eating insect larvae. Mean capitulum size (receptacle width) of each species was measured. In a sub-set of eight species, individual capitula were tagged to determine their flowering phenology and lifespan (from anthesis to <b>seed</b> <b>shedding).</b> From these data an index of flowering synchrony on individual plants was derived. Among species, the incidence of larval infestation increased with capitulum size. Small-flowered species such as Achillea millefolium were largely free of bud-infesting larvae, whilst large-flowered species such as Arctium minus were heavily infested. In three cases investigated in greater detail, bud infestation was found to increase with capitulum size within species, suggesting a potential for natural selection to favour smaller capitula. No relationship was found between infestation levels and either capitulum lifespan or degree of flowering synchrony, and {{there was no evidence that}} the relationship between capitulum size and infestation was confounded by correlations with these other features. The results support hypotheses I and 2, but not 3 and 4.

Heterologous expression of BnLATE under the double enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter (D 35 S) in wild-type Arabidopsis plants resulted in a marked decrease in lignification in the replum, valve layer (carpel) and dehiscence zone. pBnLATE::GUS activity was strong in the yellowing silique walls of transgenic lines. Furthermore, the expression pattern of BnLATE and the lignin content gradient in the silique walls at 48 days after pollination (DAP) of 73290, a B. napus silique shattering-resistant line, are similar to those in transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing BnLATE. Transcriptome sequencing of the silique walls revealed that genes encoding peroxidases, which polymerize monolignols and lignin in the phenylpropanoid pathway, were down-regulated at least two-fold change in the D 35 S::BnLATE transgenic lines. pBnLATE::BnLATE transgenic lines were further used to identify the function of BnLATE, and the results showed that lignification in the carpel and dehiscence zone of yellowing silique also remarkably decreased compared with the wild-type control, the silique shattering-resistance and expression pattern of peroxidase genes are very similar to results with D 35 S::BnLATE.

The ZT system resulted in a higher proportion of weed seeds in 0 - 2 cm of the soil layer at the time of crop sowing, with 48 - 52 % of broadleaved and 45 - 55 % of grassy weed seeds; whereas, CONT had weed seeds buried in deeper layers, with 47 - 48 % of broadleaved and 50 - 55 % of grassy weed seeds in the lowermost layer (5 - 10 cm). At crop harvest, both tillage systems showed higher proportions of weed seeds in the upper 2 cm of the soil layer; however, this was due to <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> of mature weeds on the soil surface.

However, some large-seeded species also have the potential to establish short-term persistence bank. A literature survey reveals 88 % of the alpine seeds have a mass < 3 mg. Seed size has only a weak relationship with mean germination timing (MGT) indicating that reduced persistence in large-seeded species cannot be counteracted by quicker germination, but combined effects of other factors stimulating germination remain an open area to be studied. It is proposed that long distance dispersal (LDD) is limited in most-but not all-species, primarily due to the absence of specialized dispersal structures. However, among numerous dispersal modes, most species tend to be dispersed by wind. Thus, spermatophytes of alpine environments have a greater tendency to establish seed banks and spread the risk of germination to many years, rather than being dispersed to other micro-climates...|$|E
40|$|Scots pine (Pin us sylvestris) {{growing at}} Wybunbury Moss, Cheshire {{on a small}} {{floating}} bog (Schwingmoor) some 400 km south of its current native limit was studied. Seed production of trees that have been growing on the site for several centuries, and the. susceptibility of seed and seedlings to waterlogging were investigated. Cones matured between September and March and <b>seed</b> <b>shedding</b> began in early April. A strong relationship was found between tree size and seed production which allowed the prediction,,"A "'~'J'. A- of annual seed production. One hectare of woodland surrounding the central bog produced approximately 1 350 000 seeds annually with a germination percentage of 64 %. The estimated number of seeds reaching the central bog every year was c. 16 000 seeds. Vegetation type, topography and water table depth {{were the most important}} factors dictating germination and seedling success. Three weeks of dry conditions was likely sufficient for Scots pine seedlings to establish whatever the water table level afterwards. Scots pine seeds from Wybunbury had the capability to germinate and survive a water table of up to 4 cm below the surface and often less. Six hummocky microhabitats of Sphagnum, Sphagnum-Ericaceae, Sphagnum-Cyperaceae, Ericaceae, Cyperaceae and Pure peat formed 8, 15, 33, 17, 26 and 1 %, respectively, of the central bog area. Seedling survival in each microhabitat was 2. 1, 1. 5, 1. 6, 1. 8, 1. 9 and 0. 5 %, respectively. Adding all these factors together led to the prediction that on the central bog at Wybunbury there should be 200 new juveniles every year. Since a management aim is for this to be < 100, suggestions on specific woodland thinning/clearance are made to achieve this target. iiiEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Emergence and {{persistence}} characteristics of Phalaris paradoxa seeds in no- and minimum-till situations and at different burial depths were studied in a sub-tropical environment. Three experiments {{were carried out}} using naturally <b>shed</b> <b>seeds.</b> In the first experiment, seedlings emerged from May through to September each year, {{although the majority of}} seedlings emerged in July. In the second experiment with greater seed density, cultivation in March of each year stimulated seedling emergence, altered the periodicity of emergence and accelerated the decline of seeds in the seedbank compared with plots that received no cultivation. The majority of seedlings in the cultivated plots emerged in May whereas the majority of seedlings in the undisturbed plots emerged in July. Emergence accounted for only 4 - 19 % of the seedbank in both experiments over 2 years. Seed persistence was short in both field experiments, with less than 1 % remaining 2 years after <b>seed</b> <b>shed.</b> In the third experiment, burial depth and soil disturbance significantly influenced seedling emergence {{and persistence}} of seed. Seedlings emerged most from seed mixed in the top 10 cm when subjected to annual soil disturbance, and from seed buried at 2. 5 and 5. 0 cm depths in undisturbed soil. Emergence was least from seed on the soil surface, and buried at 10 and 15 cm depths in undisturbed soil. Seeds persisted longest when shed onto the soil surface and persisted least when the soil was tilled. These results suggest that strategic cultivation may be a useful management tool, as it will alter the periodicity of emergence allowing use of more effective control options and will deplete the soil seedbank more rapidly...|$|R
