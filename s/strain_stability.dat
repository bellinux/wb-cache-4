Stability is normally assessed by {{methods such as}} selective colony forming units or by simply measuring the recombinant product.

In the current work, long-term stability of a plasmid-containing strain of Escherichia coli (W 3110. shik 1) capable of shikimic acid overproduction was studied by means of a 2 D-fluorescence sensor (BioView) able to emit and detect light in ranges of 260 - 560 nm and 300600 nm, respectively. Long-term carbon-limited chemostat experiments were made under both selective (tetracycline-containing medium) and nonselective conditions.

However, biotechnological applications of mating in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris have been hampered {{because of concerns}} about <b>strain</b> <b>stability</b> of P. pastoris diploids. The aim of the study reported here is to investigate heterologous protein expression in diploid P. pastoris strains and to evaluate diploid <b>strain</b> <b>stability</b> using high cell density fermentation processes. Results By using a monoclonal antibody as a target protein, we demonstrate that recombinant protein production in both wild-type and glycoengineered P. pastoris diploids is stable and efficient during a nutrient rich shake flask cultivation. When diploid strains were cultivated under bioreactor conditions, sporulation was observed. Nevertheless, both wild-type and glycoengineered P. pastoris diploids showed robust productivity and secreted recombinant antibody of high quality. Specifically, the yeast culture maintained a diploid state for 240 [*]h post-induction phase while protein titer and N-linked glycosylation profiles were comparable to that of a haploid strain expressing the same antibody. As an application of mating, we also constructed an antibody display library and used mating to generate novel full-length antibody sequences. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this study reports {{for the first time a}} comprehensive characterization of recombinant protein expression and fermentation using diploid P. pastoris strains.

The quantitative parameters (extent of reversible <b>strains,</b> <b>stability,</b> temperature interval and stresses produced during heating and recovery of 'hot shape') crucially depend on the training route performed. The well trained specimens can do work even if the reversible shape memory effect is widely accepted as an unstable one.

The formation of trained martensite variants is thermodynamically favoured with respect to other crystallographically equivalent variants.

The present study describes the improvement of previously identified fungal strain Aspergillus carbonarius for enhancement of pectinase production by inducing mutations using physical and chemical mutagens. Aiming to increase the potentiality in pectinase production, the parental strain was treated for three times with four mutagens- UV irradiation, Colchicine, Hydrogen peroxide and Ethidium bromide to obtain mutants. Mutants were selected based on higher enzyme activity, improved growth rates and varied morphology with increased pectinase production. All the surviving mutants were assessed quantitatively after first mutagenic treatment. The stability of the best mutants was tested by repeating the exposures for two times to obtain 3 rd generation mutants. These mutants were tested quantitatively to assess the pectinase production. Of all the best mutants E 8 showed maximum activity producing 65 U/ml pectinase enzyme compared to wild and sister mutants.

However, they often {{are not able to}} meet the mechanical properties necessary for many biological applications, losing mechanical properties at low strains. We synthesized hybrid hydrogels consisting of a poly(γ-glutamic acid) polymer network physically cross-linked via grafted self-assembling β-sheet peptides to provide non-covalent cross-linking through β-sheet assembly, reinforced with a polymer backbone to improve <b>strain</b> <b>stability.</b> By altering the β-sheet peptide graft density and concentration, we can tailor the mechanical properties of the hydrogels over an order of magnitude range of 10 – 200 kPa, which is in the region of many soft tissues. Also, due to the ability of the non-covalent β-sheet cross-links to reassemble, the hydrogels can self-heal after being strained to failure, in most cases recovering all of their original storage moduli. Using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, we were able to probe the secondary structure of the materials and verify the presence of β-sheets within the hybrid hydrogels. Since the polymer backbone requires less than a 15 % functionalization of its repeating units with β-sheet peptides to form a hydrogel, it can easily be modified further to incorporate specific biological epitopes. This self-healing polymer−β-sheet peptide hybrid hydrogel with tailorable mechanical properties is a promising platform for future tissue-engineering scaffolds and biomedical applications...|$|E

A detailed metabolic analysis of a shikimic acid producing E. coli strain {{was made in the}} current work in order to increase the understanding of shikimic acid production and identify means of improving the process. The strain used (called W 3110. shik 1) was modified for shikimate production by deletion of aroL, and by overexpression of aroFFBR (on a plasmid). Physiological characterizations were made using techniques such as metabolite analysis, stoichiometric network analysis, transcriptome analysis, and in situ 2 D-fluorometry at different modes of cultivation, and compered to a wild-type strain (W 3110). A high yield of shikimic acid requires both a high flux into the pathway and minimum by-product formation. In carbon-limited chemostat cultivation the total flux into the pathway was almost 2 times higher than the one obtained in phosphorus-limited chemostat cultivation (yields on glucose: ~ 0. 2 vs. 0. 1 c-mole/c-mole), but at the expense of increased formation of DHS, DHQ and quinic acid. Typical yields carbon- vs. phosphorus-limitation: shikimate: 0. 02 vs. 0. 06, DHS 0. 03 - 0. 12 (increased with increased growth rate) vs. 0. 03, DHQ: 0. 02 vs. 0. 01, quinic acid: 0. 02 vs. 0. 01. The batch and fed-batch conditions studied showed similar characteristics as their chemostat dittos. A theory to explain the mechanisms of by-product formation, based on intracellular equilibration, is discussed and compared to the hydroaromatic equilibration theory. Gene expression patterns of the two growth conditions showed differences in agreement with observed changes in total flux and by-product formation. Under carbon-limitation an upregulation of aroF, aroG, talA and talB agreed with the larger total flux into the pathway, and an upregulation of the genes ydiB, ydiN and aroD may explain the increased by-product formation. A slight starvation of the aromatic amino acids (identified by an induction of the trp and tyr-operons) under carbon-limitation, which was relieved under phosphorus limitation, was observed. The relief could possibly be explained by a simultaneous increased expression of aroK and aroA, thus enabling a higher flux downstream of shikimate. Metabolic flux analysis showed that the flux into the pathway was mostly dependent on the relationship between consumption and production of erythrose- 4 -phosphate. In addition, a higher flux connected to overflow metabolism was observed in the central metabolism under phosphorus-limitation. These fluxes were generally lower under carbon-limitation. 2 D-fluorometry was used to monitor <b>strain</b> <b>stability</b> in chemostat cultivation. It was shown that <b>strain</b> <b>stability</b> was not maintained for more than about 25 generations, even in selective medium.

Maximum biosurfactant production reached to about 1. 6 g/l and liquid surface tension decreased from 72 to 25 mN/m using B. subtilis. All screened bacteria exhibited a good ability to emulsify the crude oil. Biosurfactant of B. subtilis attained an emulsion index of 75 % for crude oil which was {{significantly greater than}} other <b>strains.</b> <b>Stability</b> {{studies were carried out}} under the extreme environmental conditions as find normally in the oil reservoir such as high temperature, pH and salinity. Results showed an excellent resistance of all produced biosurfactants to retain their surface-active properties at extreme conditions. It was found that the biosurfactants show a good stability around pH of 4 but at lower pH, they will harmfully be affected. Lesser precipitation has been observed at low pH for biosurfactant produced by B. subtilis. It has also been observed that biosurfactants from three isolated bacteria were able to support the condition up to 25 g/l salinity. B. cereus biosurfactant was even stable at the higher salinity. Regarding temperature, all produced biosurfactants demonstrated a good stability in the temperature up to 120 °C. Oil displacement experiments in micromodel with kerosene showed around 25 % recovery of residual oil after water flooding when the biosurfactant of B. subtilis was added. These results suggest that biosurfactants of these indigenous isolated strains are appropriate candidates for enhanced oil recovery with a preference to biosurfactant of B. subtilis.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of a {{hard rock}} horizontally stratified roof, within a low primary lateral stress field, is investigated. The lowest roof stratum is modelled as a voussoir beam with three cracks, one at the midspan and one at each abutment. Its response in bending is computed, {{with the help of}} a distinct element computer code, for an ordered series of configurations. Two states of failure, ie buckling and crushing, are examined. The parameters of indeterminacy of the structure are investigated numerically and improved relations are derived for their evaluation. From the solution of the determined structure, deflection, <b>strains</b> and <b>stability</b> limits are evaluated analytically and validated numerically. Finally, in order to check against crushing, a chart is provided for the prediction of the lateral non-linearly distributed axial strain at the extreme fibre of the abutment.
