5|$|After the {{foremost}} Turkish troops crossed the fortifications {{and dealt with}} the Bulgarian defenders, they began plundering the vicinity. However, {{to the surprise of}} Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey, the majority of Momchil's men were <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes. As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot {{and for the most part}} did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funeral pyre {{of his wife}} Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's {{pregnancy}} with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E

5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E
5|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower, {{the hero}} and party {{learn that they}} cannot climb it to paradise without first unsealing its base door. In the base world, three kings named Armor, Sword, and Shield fight for {{dominance}} using a piece of legendary equipment corresponding to their names. Visiting King Armor, the party learns {{that he is in}} love with a girl who returns his feelings, but cannot marry him, as a bandit holds her village hostage in return for her love. They defeat the bandit, and the king gives them his armor in gratitude. King Sword attacks the heroes, who vanquish him and take the sword. Lastly, King Shield is murdered by his own steward, and after a short fight, the party recovers his shield. Restoring the items to a statue of a great hero, they receive the Black Sphere, but are attacked by Gen-bu, the first of four fiends controlled by Ashura. They defeat him and use the power of the Sphere to enter the tower.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

25|$|Excavations of {{the site}} by the Nara Research Institute for Cultural Properties from 1976 have {{revealed}} the plan of the complex.

25|$|On February 23, 1883, William Kinsman {{had been}} living with May Woodman. Apparently as a joke, someone had run a notice in the Epitaph {{newspaper}} that Kinsman intended to marry Woodman.
