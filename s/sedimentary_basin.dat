25|$|The geology of Saskatchewan can {{be divided}} into two main {{geological}} regions, the Pre-Cambrian or Canadian shield and the Phanerozoic or Western Canada <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Basin.</b> Within the Canadian shield exists the Athabasca <b>sedimentary</b> <b>basin.</b> Meteorite impacts have altered the natural geological formation processes. The Quaternary period is the most recent geological process when the prairies were affected by glacial events. There are six notable meteorite or comet impact craters in Saskatchewan. Carswell, Deep Bay and Gow Lake have affected the Canadian Shield area of the north. In the southern Phanerozoic crater are the Viewfield, Elbow and Maple Creek structures.|$|E

Elements identified include distributive fluvial systems (DFS), tributive fluvial systems that occur between large DFS or in an axial position in the basin, lacustrine/playa, and eolian environments. The DFS elements include large DFS (&# 62; 30 km in length), small DFS (&# 60; 30 km in length), coalesced DFS in bajada or piedmont plains, and incised DFS. Our results indicate that over 88...|$|R

25|$|Fossil fuels are a more {{recently}} developed resource in Canada, {{with oil and}} gas being extracted from deposits in the Western Canadian <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Basin</b> since the mid 1900s. While Canada's crude oil deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's Oil Sands {{to the point where}} Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world.

25|$|Away {{from the}} coast, {{the climate is}} oceanic {{throughout}} but its characteristics change somewhat. The Paris <b>sedimentary</b> <b>basin</b> and, more so, the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter. Therefore, most of the territory has a semi-oceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and the Semi-continental climate of the north and centre-east (Alsace, plains of the Saône, the middle part of the Rhône, Dauphiné, Auvergne and Savoy).|$|E

The search for large oil reservoirs in Alberta had been ongoing for decades because the Western Canadian <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Basin</b> that lies beneath the majority of the Canadian Prairies was known to be prime ground for the formation of petroleum and natural gas, and it was unlikely that such a prime setting would have produced only the two oil fields that were known to exist in 1946.|$|E

25|$|One is shallow, {{biogenic}}ally derived gas {{in mixed}} sand and shale sequences. Shallow biogenic gas {{is considered to}} be an unconventional gas resource since it is not generated in the same temperature and pressure systems found in conventional hydrocarbon generation. The Milk River and Medicine Hat sands of southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan are classic examples of this type of unconventional gas. This is the area where gas was first produced in western Canada, and it is still a major producing region. This continuously gas-producing area is the largest in the Western Canadian <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Basin.</b>|$|E

The Karoo Basin is large, extending across {{nearly two-thirds of the}} country, with the southern portion of the basin potentially favorable for shale gas. However, the basin contains significant areas of igneous sill intrusions that may impact the quality of the shale gas resources, limit the use of seismic imaging, and increase the risks of shale gas exploration. The Karoo is estimated to have technically recoverable resource of 485 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the {{archipelago}} {{is characterized by}} the effects of the Andean orogeny and the repeated Pleistocene glaciations. The geology of the island can be divided into large east–west-oriented units.

The Magallanes fold and thrust belt extends north of Almirantazgo Fjord and Fagnano Lake, and north of this lies the Magallanes foreland; an old <b>sedimentary</b> <b>basin</b> that hosts hydrocarbon reserves.

25|$|The St. Mary River Formation has not {{undergone}} a definitive radiometric dating, however, the available stratigraphic correlation {{has shown that}} this formation was laid down between 74 and 66 million years ago during the final regression of the mid-continental Bearpaw Seaway.

The St. Mary River Formation is part of the Western Canadian <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Basin</b> in southwestern Alberta, which extends from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Canadian Shield in the east.

25|$|Between 250 and 300 {{million years}} ago, {{freshwater}} streams flowing from ancient mountains brought silt, {{sand and gravel}} into {{what is now the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence. These sediments accumulated to form a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>basin,</b> and make up the island's bedrock. When the Pleistocene glaciers receded about 15,000 years ago, glacial debris such as till were left behind to cover most of the area that would become the island. This area was connected to the mainland by a strip of land, but when ocean levels rose as the glaciers melted this land strip was flooded, forming the island. As the land rebounded from the weight of the ice, the island rose up to elevate it further from the surrounding water.|$|E

25|$|The {{oil sands}} of the Western Canadian <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Basin</b> (WCSB) were {{formed as a}} result of the {{formation}} of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting over the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies over the plains, forming the Canadian Rockies. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta very deep, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.|$|E
25|$|The Alpine orogeny was {{the main}} cause of {{extensive}} tectonic activities and it was responsible for the formation of the hydrothermal field within the region. The Chaves graben was formed by the relative motion of the block with different types of sediments being settled. The most recent formations are a sedimentary series (lacustrine, alluvial, colluvial, detritic, etc.) with variable thickness that had their origin during the Miocene. Two main faults cross and influence the tectonic activities: the north-northeast by south-southeast Chaves-Verin Fault and a fault system crossing near Faiões and Santo Estêvão. The first fault developed from late Hercynian tectonic episode occurring between 280 and 300 million years ago, that developed into an almost north-south direction into the lithosphere. Intense neotectonic activity reactivated these old fractures, originating in a complex pattern of faults in the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E
