5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the <b>stomach</b> <b>pump</b> had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E

25|$|Gastric lavage, {{commonly}} known as a <b>stomach</b> <b>pump,</b> is the insertion of a tube into the stomach, followed by administration of water or saline down the tube. The liquid is then removed along with {{the contents of the}} stomach. Lavage has been used for many years as a common treatment for poisoned patients. However, a recent review of the procedure in poisonings suggests no benefit. It is still sometimes used if it can be performed within 1 hour of ingestion and the exposure is potentially life-threatening.|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two key rulings {{clarifying}} {{the constitutionality of}} physical intrusions into the human body by police and other government agents. In Rochin v. California, police officers broke into the home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth. Officers were unable to force his mouth open, so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will. A unanimous Supreme Court held the involuntary <b>stomach</b> <b>pump</b> was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it [...] "shocked the conscience", and was so [...] "brutal" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] {{that it did not}} comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency. In 1957, the Court held in Breithaupt v. Abram that involuntary blood samples [...] "taken by a skilled technician" [...] neither [...] "shocked the conscience" [...] nor violated substantive due process. In Breithaupt, police took a blood sample from a patient suspected of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} while he lay unconscious in a hospital. The Court held that the blood samples were justified, in part, because [...] "modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection." [...] Additionally, the Court mentioned in dicta that involuntary blood samples may violate the constitution if officers do not provide [...] "every proper medical precaution" [...] to the accused.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{treatment}} of an acute overdose includes gastric decontamination. This {{is achieved by}} giving activated charcoal which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract either by mouth or via a nasogastric tube. Activated charcoal is most useful if given within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion. Other decontamination methods such as <b>stomach</b> <b>pumps,</b> ipecac induced emesis, or whole bowel irrigation are generally not recommended in TCA poisoning. <b>Stomach</b> <b>pumps</b> may be considered {{within an hour of}} ingestion but evidence to support the practice is poor.|$|R

50|$|He was hospitalised {{again in}} March 1935 {{when he was}} {{poisoned}} after drinking a veronal bottle.

25|$|Initially, gastric {{decontamination}} of {{the patient}} is achieved by administering, either orally or via a nasogastric tube, activated charcoal pre-mixed with water, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion).

25|$|Toxic {{symptoms}} generally resolve themselves after 24 to 48 hours. Supportive {{treatment for}} the symptoms is usually administered. Because extreme vomiting occurs, decontamination (e.g., <b>stomach</b> <b>pumping</b> or the ingestion of activated charcoal) is usually not implemented unless ingestion has occurred within one hour. Atropine is usually administered to counteract the low heart rate, and sympathomimetic drugs and liquids administered to raise the blood pressure.|$|R

[...] In that role, Dalton created a [...] "Rapid Response" [...] program to transport people suffering from cholera to hospital.

5000|$|In 1947, {{while working}} for Lewiston over July 4 weekend, sword {{swallower}} Tony Marino [...] "gulped a two-foot length of lighted neon tube, glowed at his appreciative audience, bowed, thereupon went out like a light, and was hustled to a hospital for removal of the shattered tube." [...] After two weeks of recuperation, including treatment with a <b>stomach</b> <b>pump,</b> milk of magnesia, and oatmeal, Marino continued performing with Lewiston's Museum.

50|$|In September 1909, the Home Office became {{unwilling to}} release hunger-striking suffragettes before their {{sentence}} was served. Suffragettes became a liability {{because if they}} were to die in custody, the prison would be responsible for their death. Prisons began the practice of force-feeding the hunger strikers through a tube, most commonly via a nostril or stomach tube or a <b>stomach</b> <b>pump.</b> Force-feeding had previously been practised in Britain but its use had been exclusively for patients in hospitals who were too unwell to eat or swallow food. Despite the practice being deemed safe by medical practitioners for sick patients, it posed health issues for the healthy suffragettes.The process of tube-feeding was strenuous without the consent of the hunger strikers, who were typically strapped down and force-fed via stomach or nostril tube, often with a considerable amount of force. The process was painful and after the practice was observed and studied by several physicians, it was deemed to cause both short-term damage to the circulatory system, digestive system and nervous system and long-term damage to the physical and mental health of the suffragettes. Some suffragettes who were force-fed developed pleurisy or pneumonia {{as a result of a}} misplaced tube.|$|E
5000|$|Siddal overdosed on {{laudanum}} in {{the early}} months of 1862. Rossetti discovered her unconscious and dying in bed after having had dinner with her and his friend Algernon Charles Swinburne. After taking Siddal home, Rossetti attended his usual teaching job at the Working Men's College. Once Rossetti returned home and found Siddal he was already unable to revive her and he called for a doctor, who claimed to be unable to save her, upon which Rossetti sent for another three doctors. A <b>stomach</b> <b>pump</b> was used, but to no avail. She died at 7.20 AM on February 11, 1862 at their home at 14 Chatham Place, now demolished and covered by Blackfriars Station. Although her death was ruled accidental by the coroner, there are suggestions that Rossetti found a suicide note. Consumed with grief and guilt Rossetti went to see Ford Madox Brown who is supposed to have instructed him to burn the note [...] - [...] under the law at the time suicide was both illegal and immoral and would have brought a scandal on the family, and suicide would bar Siddal from a Christian burial.|$|E

50|$|Gastric lavage, also {{commonly}} called <b>stomach</b> <b>pumping</b> or gastric irrigation, {{is the process}} of cleaning out the contents of the stomach.
