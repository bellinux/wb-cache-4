5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than <b>state,</b> <b>funding.</b> Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker said in an {{interview}} with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 to examine the effects of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E

My work has two bigger parts. In the first part are generally <b>funds</b> and <b>state</b> <b>funds.</b> In the second part I'm focusing my work directly on The <b>State</b> <b>fund</b> of traffic infrastructure. I explain a meaning of word "fund" {{at the beginning of}} my diploma work and then a system of funds (I try to show the grade of <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> between other funds). Next I deal with state funds' problems.

In contrast, private insurers can turn away the worst risks and may also write comprehensive insurance packages covering general liability, natural disasters, and other forms of insurance coverage.

In the years that followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization.

5|$|Although the {{question}} of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan {{at the expense of}} East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of <b>state</b> <b>funding</b> and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E

40|$|Resumé <b>State</b> <b>funds</b> with a {{focus on}} the <b>State</b> Environmental <b>Fund</b> I have chosen the theme <b>State</b> <b>funds</b> for my thesis because of two reasons. First reason is {{the fact that there is}} not enough {{literature}} about the <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> in the Czech Republic and I think that recent affairs show us that there will be need of paying more attention to the public finanances area in the future, especially during possible system changes. The aim of the thesis is following. I want to describe the role of the <b>state</b> <b>funds</b> in the budgetary system in the Czech Republic. Out of all extra budgetary funds, my attention is fully focused on the <b>state</b> <b>funds,</b> on a description how they are created, who runs them and how financial sources are used, those which are mostly obtained out of the state budget. Finally, one of those funds is minutely described; it includes who runs this fund, where its finances come from and what is supported directly by a helpful hand of this fund. I have also shortly described a support which is possible to get out of this fund and under what conditions this can happen. The thesis is composed of three basic chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the <b>state</b> <b>funds.</b> Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis.
