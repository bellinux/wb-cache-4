Hidden in the chest is an orb, which glows brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit by a wave of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the <b>Stargazers</b> logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E

However, this strategy did not protect him: the appendix was an expanded version of the Cosmos Without Gravitation monograph, which he had already distributed to Shapley and others in the late 1940sand they had regarded the physics within it as absurd.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} series were mostly {{produced}} by Dennis Main Wilson; {{none of the}} episodes was given an individual title and these early shows were loosely structured and consisted {{of four or five}} unconnected sketches, separated by musical items. According to later producer Peter Eton, the musical segments took up around half the programme. In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and Michael Bentine as the nominal 'hero' of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart. Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player Max Geldray, singer Ray Ellington and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the <b>Stargazers,</b> but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number. Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by Stanley Black and the BBC Dance Orchestra.

Hevelius used the name Tigris (Tiger) in his catalogue as well, but kept the former name only in his atlas.

500|$|Astronomers and <b>stargazers</b> {{appreciate}} Cherry Springs State Park for {{the darkness}} and clarity of its skies, which make it [...] "perhaps the last best refuge of the natural night sky" [...] in {{the eastern half of}} the United States.

Such [...] "truly dark, starry skies are unavailable to two-thirds of the world's population, including 99percent of people in the continental U.S. and Western Europe". With optimum conditions, 10,000stars are visible with the naked eye at the park, clouds appear only as black holes in the starry sky, and the Milky Way is so bright that it casts a discernible shadow. In contrast, big city residents can see a few dozen stars at best, and even those in rural areas can typically only see 2,000–3,000stars. The Milky Way cannot be seen by most in the eastern US, even when there is no moonlight to obscure it.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Stargazers</b> {{are about}} 50 species of fishes, {{belonging}} to the family Uranoscopidae, and found worldwide in shallow waters. <b>Stargazers</b> are venomous; they have two large poison spines situated behind the opercle and above the pectoral fins. They can also deliver electric shocks. They are ambush predators with eyes {{on top of their}} heads (thus the name). <b>Stargazers</b> also have a large upward-facing mouth in a large head. They bury themselves in sand with only their eyes showing, and leap upwards to ambush fish and invertebrates overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which they wiggle to attract prey's attention. Lengths range from 18 cm up to 90cm, for the giant stargazer Kathetostoma giganteum. <b>Stargazers</b> are a delicacy in some cultures. The venom is destroyed when it is cooked, and <b>stargazers</b> are sold in some fish markets with their electric organ removed.

GABA(_A) receptor α(_ 6) subunit expression levels were significantly decreased in adult <b>stargazer</b> (stg/stg) cerebella when compared to control (+/+ and +/stg) cerebella. Interestingly, autoradiography using [(^ 3) H] Ro 15 - 4513 revealed an apparent upregulation in α(_ 4) γ-containing receptors in the adult <b>stargazer</b> dentate gyrus. No {{significant differences in the}} expression of NMDAR subunits were detected between adult control and <b>stargazer</b> brain membranes.
