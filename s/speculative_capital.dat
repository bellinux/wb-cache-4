5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to <b>speculative</b> <b>capital</b> flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the important question}} of how far a government will run down its stock of foreign reserves in a defense of a fixed exchange rate. An optimizing model of currency crisis is presented in which the decision {{of whether or not}} to borrow in a defense of a peg is explicitly analyzed. The threshold level of reserves is then determined endogenously and shown to be a function of fundamental economic variables. The analysis also demonstrates how an increase in the level of reserves, a credit-rating upgrade, or the imposition of capital controls can remove the multiplicity of equilibria.

50|$|Mexico's central bank, Banco de México, {{maintained}} the peso's value through an exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar, allowing the peso to appreciate or depreciate {{against the dollar}} within a narrow band. To accomplish this, the central bank would frequently intervene in the open markets and buy or sell pesos to maintain the peg. The central bank's intervention strategy partly involved issuing new short-term public debt instruments denominated in U.S. dollars, then using the borrowed dollar capital to purchase pesos in the foreign exchange market, thereby causing its value to appreciate. The bank's aim in mitigating the peso's depreciation was to protect against inflationary risks of having a markedly weaker domestic currency. With the peso stronger than it ought to have been, domestic businesses and consumers began purchasing increasingly more imports, and Mexico began running a large trade deficit.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the social effects of unprecedented growth in financial trades and speculation. The key claim is that <b>speculative</b> finance <b>capital</b> markets have caused widespread {{economic and social}} pressures. An argument is advanced that socio-economic inequalities are resultant of overleveraged, unregulated finance, and market integration {{over the last three}} decades. Pressures on civil society have arisen through governments transferring state-based funds to bail out private institutions, and stimulate economies. Socialisation of debt is used to strengthen the private sector. Central to this argument is the consideration that two economies have emerged in parallel throughout the developed world. The "real economy" of developed nation states has been depleted by protracted global economic crises. The second, "shadow economy", has re-emerged as a concentrated economic force with speculative daily global financial trades of over US 4 trillion, including AU 41 billion in trades, every day, in Australia. The majority of trades are enabled by sophisticated high frequency trading corridors between Wall Street and the City of London. The consequences are felt worldwide. Two key questions are addressed in this thesis. First, given the social consequences emanating from global financial markets, and the concomitant socialisation of debt in developed economies, is the introduction of a financial transaction tax a feasible, progressive economic and social reform to partially ameliorate the negative effects of <b>speculative</b> finance <b>capital</b> on nation states? Second, could a miniscule tax on trades, recalibrate the relationships between governments and markets and provide accountability, oversight and stability? This thesis concludes in the affirmative. Additionally, this thesis posits an argument that transaction tax revenues in Australia, the eighth largest derivatives transaction-trading nation in the world, should be used specifically to strengthen national social policy commitments to homelessness, and provide a targeted resource for sustainable social housing provision...|$|R

5000|$|Benedict {{warns of}} dangers arising from {{unbalanced}} growth and from those pursuing profit purely {{for its own}} sake, without seeing profit {{as a means to}} do good. He discusses increasing inequality, including new groups of poor emerging even in rich nations. The pope says globalisation has in part given rise to damaging cultural eclecticism and levelling. Addressing political leaders, Benedict says that [...] "The primary capital to be safeguarded is man" [...] and suggests that reducing prolonged unemployment should be a high priority as it causes [...] "great psychological and spiritual suffering". He goes on to discuss the suffering caused in the underdeveloped world by food shortages, saying that to feed the hungry is an ethical imperative. The Pope considers a number of trends harmful to development: the prevalence of corruption in both poor and rich countries, the existence of harmful <b>speculative</b> <b>capital</b> flows, the tendency for development aid to be [...] "diverted from it proper ends due to irresponsible actions", the [...] "unregulated exploitation of the earths resources", and [...] "on the part of rich countries there is excessive zeal for protecting knowledge through an unduly rigid assertion of the right to intellectual property, especially in the field of healthcare". While acknowledging that organised religion is not always an entirely positive influence, the Pope warns of the danger of state imposed atheism, which he says deprives citizens of the moral and spiritual strength needed for genuine development and to respond generously to divine love. He emphasises that successfully resolving the various global challenges will need Love as well as knowledge: [...] "the individual who is animated by true charity labours skilfully to discover the causes of misery, to find the means to combat it, to overcome it resolutely".|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{theoretical}} and empirical analysis {{of the effect of}} capital controls and alternative exchange rate regimes on the patterns of <b>speculative</b> <b>capital.</b> I argue that the exchange rate regime and its interaction with the monetary regime can explain the patterns of <b>speculative</b> <b>capital</b> around the world.
