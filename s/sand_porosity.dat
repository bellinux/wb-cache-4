40|$|Coastal erosion is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that is a growing problem. Over the last few decades, {{there has been a}} gradual change from hard to soft coastal defence techniques. In this sense, periodic artificial nourishment is widely regarded as an acceptable method of beach and dune protection and restoration. According to Dean (2003), after beach nourishment activities are performed, sand volumetric evolution, particularly the proportion of sand volume that remains within the region where the sand was placed, is of interest. This region can be described by features such as the pore size, density, porosity, permeability and water content. The bulk density is an indicator of soil compaction, which is related to its porosity and permeability. Beach nourishment features are based on several clues: native and borrow sand quality, dredging and dumping areas, method of transport, operating budget, sand volume needed and coastal groundwater dynamics. An important consideration in sediment motion is the relative volume occupied by sediment within a sediment bed. This is quantified using porosity or grain concentration. A standard assumption in coastal engineering is that the porosity of natural beach sand (non-cohesive) is 40 %. However, is this assumption correct for all beach sand? The purpose is to demonstrate that much of the volume loss after beach nourishment procedure can be due to porosity decrease. Our primary hypothesis is that any type of beach nourishment activity results in a significant increase in <b>sand</b> <b>porosity,</b> largely due to the massive and disorganised dumping of a mixture of sediment and water (in this case 20 and 80 %, respectively) on the backshore and foreshore by a trailing suction hopper dredge. The porosity subsequently decreases until it reaches its native value because of waves and tides cause spatial re-accommodation of the grains. This research proposes an accurate and simplified method to assess changes in <b>sand</b> <b>porosity</b> after beach nourishment by means of in-situ density surveys through a nuclear densimeter. This novel application has been applied to different beaches in the southwest of Spain according to the tidal range, grain size and beach morphology in several terms. Complete monitoring of the density, humidity, grain size analysis and modified Proctor compaction test was performed at all beaches over the very short, short, medium and long term (hours, days, months and years respectively). The goal of the monitoring was to study the effect of different phenomena on the internal beach <b>sand</b> <b>porosity.</b> General results show that sand porosities range from 25. 6 % to 43. 4 % after beach nourishment works, with maximum relative and cumulative differences in the order of ± 40 % over several terms. This research can be considered a support tool in coastal engineering to find shifting sand volumes as a result of <b>sand</b> <b>porosity</b> variability after beach nourishment and later marine influence...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} use the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) to trace hydrothermal flow directions. The Chaillac Basin {{is located at the}} contact between the Mesozoic Paris Basin and the Variscan Massif Central, (France). The basin has been formed along N-S normal fault that allowed the sedimentation of Hettangian sand (− 203 Ma) on a metamorphic basement. Stratiform F-Ba-Fe rich deposits occur as syn-sedimentary mineralization within silicoclastic Hettangian sediments. The mineralization sequence is formed by the succession of fluorite-baritegoethite. It cements the sand and presents surficial sinter structures. The tectonics shows that sinter crusts have been fed by vertical E-W and N-S veins emplaced during a general E-W extension. This later is coeval with the subsidence of the Paris Basin. The principal magnetic carrier is the goethite that has been precipitated by hydrothermal fluids. Magnetic fabrics measured in goethite-rich veins and in proximate sandstones are dominated by a strongly inclined magnetic lineation (maximum axis). In sinter and in sandstone located far from the vein (> 1 m) the magnetic fabric is dominated by horizontal lineation with an azimuth similar to the sedimentary direction. The textures indicate that goethite has a free crystallisation in an open media (vein or <b>sand</b> <b>porosity).</b> Thus no late deformation has affected this deposit and the magnetic fabric is primary. Image analyses, performed on goethite shape and spatial distribution, suggest that the magnetic fabric is the result of oriented goethite growth produced by hydrothermal fluid flow. This work proposes a new approach to constrain hydrodynamic model developed in geology by using the AMS method: textural study combined with efficient magnetic fabric measurements should be used for systematic investigation to trace flow direction in fissures and in <b>sand</b> <b>porosity...</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{rainfall}} {{variability of}} 2004 – 2010 {{and its influence}} on sand heat conductivity {{may play a role}} in the incubation period differences, especially at Farol beach. Sand characteristics are known to influence the sand temperature, and consequently the duration of egg incubation (Hawkes et al. 2009). Vamizi beaches are composed of biogenic sand, which is formed by in situ accumulation of short-distance transportation hermatypic coral reef and other marine organism debris (- 0.15 – 0.35 – mm). Compared with to quartz sands, coral sands show different mechanical properties: high grain density, high porosity (ranging from 0.54 to 2.97, which is much higher than quartz <b>sand</b> <b>porosity),</b> high fragmentation and low psephisity (Chengjie et al. 2013). Lin et al. (2008) show that the water content of soil is one important factor that affects its thermal resistance. Therefore in Vamizi the precipitation may be influencing changes in incubation conditions and affecting its duration, which may explain the statistical differences found between rainy and dry years (like 2005). However, these sands are able to maintain incubation properties that result in high hatching and emergence rates. These variations may be normal, since they are linked to the seasonality created by the monsoons.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Compilation of {{porosity}} {{data from}} 11 Ocean Drilling Program legs and 53 sites show that compaction in deep marine to upper-slope sediments is, {{at least in}} part, a function of both burial depth and lithology. Overall porosities range from 4 to 94 %. Despite {{the broad range of}} porosities, there is an exponential trend toward decreasing porosity with depth. Comparison among samples dominated (90 to 100 %) by each of six lithologies, based on grain size and composition, reveals the lithology dependence of compaction, except for biogenic silt-size sediments and clastic sands. In the former case, this may, in part, be due to mixing of calcareous and siliceous nannofossils. Clay-size clastic sediments show a clear change from rapid porosity reduction in the top 172 meters (porosity = 82. 7 e 2 depth/ 430) to less pronounced loss of porosity below (porosity = 61. 4 e 2 depth/ 1671). The remainder of the lithologies, silt (porosity = 75. 5 e 2 depth/ 1091), biogenic <b>sand</b> (<b>porosity</b> = 88. 5 e 2 depth/ 1338) and micrite (porosity = 69. 5 e 2 depth/ 1235) show a good to strong exponential reduction of porosity with depth. These relations compare well with literature studies, taking into account the less pure nature of the lithologies used in this work. The silt compaction curve is unique; no previous studies of porosity separated silt from other grain sizes. Most sediment samples are of mixed grain sizes and types. The lithology-based porosity-depth relations were used to test four approaches to decompaction in mixed-lithology sediment used in backstripping. All methods generated porosity estimates that correlated strongly to the observed values, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 629 to 0. 686.

40|$|Amongst {{the design}} {{parameters}} for a beach nourishment project, sand size must be highlighted. Sand size is critical {{not only to}} compare the suitability of a borrow sand to substitute the eroded native sand, but also to identify the new equilibrium beach profile and to calculate the sediment volume necessary to achieve the projected berm or beach width. Some researchers have already taken into account the phenomena that change the theoretical volume of sand needed for a beach nourishment project (CUR, 1987; CEM 2002) such as the methodology for the hopper measurements taken on board of the dredger (Muñoz-Perez et al., 2003) or the <b>sand</b> <b>porosity</b> variability (Roman-Sierra et al., 2014). Nevertheless, no investigation {{has been carried out}} about the variability of sand size inside the hopper of a trailing suction dredger till nowadays. There are several reasons to justify this possible heterogeneity of the granulometric parameters inside the hopper. Firstly, there is the intrinsic variability of the sediment characteristics at the sea bottom. On top of that, most of the vessels which dredge nowadays are of the Trailing Suction Hopper Dredgers (TSHD) type and this means that these vessels do not dredge in a stationary way, i. e. at a certain location and vicinity, but along a big stretch of the bottom. Moreover, the fall speed of sand depends directly on the grain diameter (for a given density); i. e. the larger the grain sizes the faster the grain deposits and so, probably, the coarser grains would be {{at the bottom of the}} hopper and the finer grains would be at the top. Finally, it is noteworthy a word about the fragments of shells or bioclasts: because of their flat shape, these pieces linger more than the silica grains to decant and, therefore, their percentage will most likely be larger at the surface of the hopper...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a possible use of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) {{to describe the}} mineralizing process in hydrothermal systems. Ba–F–Fe-rich deposits within the Chaillac Basin are on the southern border of the Paris Basin. In these deposits hydrothermal textures and tectonic structures have been described in veins, sinters, and sandstone cemented by hydrothermal goethite. 278 oriented cores from 24 sites have been collected in these formations. In addition, a lateritic duricrust superimposed on the hydrothermal formation has been sampled. Rock magnetic investigations show that the principal magnetic carrier is goethite for the hydrothermal mineralization and for the laterite level. The AMS measurements show distinguishable behaviors in the different mineralogical and geological contexts. The K 1 magnetic lineation (maximum axis) is strongly inclined for the vertical veins. For the horizontally mineralized sinters, the magnetic lineation is almost horizontal with an azimuth similar to the sedimentary flow direction. The AMS of goethite-rich sandstone close to the veins shows strongly inclined K 1 as they are probably influenced by the vertical veins; however, when {{the distance from the}} vein is larger than 1 m, the AMS presents rather horizontal K 1 directions, parallel to the sedimentary flow. The laterite has a foliation dominance of AMS with vertically well-grouped K 3 axes and scattered K 1 and K 2 axes. Field structural observations suggest that the ore deposit is mainly controlled by EW extension tectonics associated with NS trending normal faults. Combining the AMS results on the deposit with vein textures and field data a model is proposed in which AMS results are interpreted in terms of hydrothermal fluid flow.

40|$|This study {{developed}} {{new concepts}} and interpretative methods for mapping reservoir heterogeneity and connectivity of a fault controlled Wilcox clastic reservoir in Texas, USA. The application of high-resolution seismic enhancement {{in this study}} allows for better delineation of subsurface geologic features, detailed mapping of reservoir heterogeneities and more accurate identification of depositional, structural, and stratigraphic characteristics that control reservoir connectivity and fluid flow. Seismic enhancement in this study pertains to amplitude preserving neural network implementation of the Volterra integral equation of the first kind from a plane-wave solution of poro-viscoelasticity (Sun, et al., 2003). This enhancement amounts to an advanced spiked deconvolution of post-stack seismic data that broadened the dominant seismic frequency from 16 Hz for the conventional seismic to 65 Hz for the enhanced seismic. Bed resolution is improved from 175 ft to 45 ft and fault offset resolution is improved from 80 ft to 20 ft. High-resolution seismic interpretation was validated through synthetic seismograms, stratigraphic surface comparisons, and most importantly using a comprehensive model-based knowledge of regional tectonics and depositional environments. Stratigraphic features that were not resolvable in conventional seismic data can now be interpreted using the enhanced seismic data. An Upper Wilcox reservoir {{was identified as a}} transgressive sheet sand overlaying a progradational deltaic seismic facies.

40|$|With {{financial}} support from the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Layman Energy Associates, Inc. (LEA) has completed a program of geothermal exploration at the Truckhaven area in Imperial County, California. The exploratory work conducted by LEA included the following activities: compilation of public domain resource data (wells, seismic data, geologic maps); detailed field geologic mapping at the project site; acquisition and interpretation of remote sensing imagery such as aerial and satellite photographs; acquisition, quality control and interpretation of gravity data; and acquisition, quality control and interpretation of resistivity data using {{state of the art}} magnetotelluric (MT) methods. The results of this exploratory program have allowed LEA to develop a structural and hydrologic interpretation of the Truckhaven geothermal resource which can be used to guide subsequent exploratory drilling and resource development. Of primary significance, is the identification of an 8 kilometer-long, WNW-trending zone of low resistivity associated with geothermal activity in nearby wells. The long axis of this low resistivity zone is inferred to mark a zone of faulting which likely provides the primary control on the distribution of geothermal resources in the Truckhaven area. Abundant cross-faults cutting the main WNW-trending zone in its western half may indicate elevated fracture permeability in this region, possibly associated with thermal upwelling and higher resource temperatures. Regional groundwater flow is inferred to push thermal fluids from west to east along the trend of the main low resistivity zone, with resource temperatures likely declining from west to east away from the inferred upwelling zone. Resistivity mapping and well data have also shown that within the WNW-trending low resistivity zone, the thickness of the Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary section above granite basement ranges from 1, 900 – 2, 600 meters.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to improve our understanding of elastic wave velocities in uncemented sediments, such as sand, clay and mixtures of sand and clay. The focus here has been on experimental work, addressing the effects of stress and stress path on velocities, including anisotropic characteristics. Stresses have been fairly low, typically not more than 10 – 15 MPa above the pore pressure, {{which means that the}} focus has been on the relevance to shallow petroleum reservoirs, but also to deeper unconsolidated reservoirs that are over pressured. It is further relevant for characterization of shallow aquifers and possible subsurface storage sites for e. g. CO 2 or for waste disposal. Furthermore, the role of lithology has been addressed, i. e. how behaviors of sand and clay differ and how sand and clay can be distinguished with seismic techniques. It is common that researchers compare their experimental results with previous experimental data obtained with almost identical materials. Such comparisons require knowledge of procedure for sample preparation, test setup, methods for data acquisition and analysis, and test conditions, such as stress path and stress history, temperature etc. In this study, tests have been conducted in two setups: These are an oedometer 1 (only uniaxial strain conditions) and a triaxial test system (both uniaxial strain and hydrostatic stress conditions). An initial study was carried out to compare results from the two test systems with similarly prepared samples, focusing on both dynamic (derived from wave velocities) and static behavior of unconsolidated sand and clay. Gassmann's fluid substitution theories (1951) are extensively used in reservoir evaluation to quantify changes in fluid saturation from time-lapse (4 D) seismic data acquired during production or injection. The same model is also used in exploration to identify lithological or fluid boundaries in the Earth. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the basic assumptions of this theory and figure out the validity of those assumptions in the studied case. Knowledge of − relation for sand, clay and other rock forming minerals is important in reflection seismology and formation evaluation. The present dissertation presents the static and dynamic characteristic of unconsolidated, uncemented clean sands, clays (kaolinite and smectite), and mixtures of sand-clay (kaolinite) and kaolinite-smectite over a range of stress from 0. 7 - 15 MPa. It is observed that the static and dynamic behavior of the mixture depends on the amount of clay present in the mixtures. Generally, wave velocities increase and porosity decreases with increase in clay content until clay becomes the load bearing phase. However, pure clay always shows lower velocity than pure <b>sand.</b> <b>Porosity</b> is higher at low stress, but decrease strongly with increasing stress. The velocities decrease with decrease in effective grain size of clay for sandy clay or kaolinite-smectite mixtures. The effective stress coefficient decreases with increase in clay content. Stress sensitivity of the velocities follows the same trend as velocities as function of clay content. However, strain sensitivity decreases with increase in clay content. Fluid saturation effects on ultrasonic compressional and shear wave velocities and their corresponding moduli are extensively studied using unconsolidated, uncemented clean sands of different grain sizes and shapes under uniaxial strain and hydrostatic stress conditions. These studies also address the anisotropy parameters of the sands, where anisotropy is induced by the applied stress. It is observed that the shear modulus increases upon brine saturation. Biot dispersion is found to explain the observed shear wave hardening. The isotropic Gassmann's fluid substitution mostly underestimates the compressional wave modulus upon saturation, but the prediction can be improved by adding Biot's dispersion effect. The study reveals that anisotropy parameters are sensitive to fluid saturation. It is surprising that shear wave anisotropy (Thomsen’s γ) is found to be sensitive to fluid. However, the effect of brine saturation on the observed P-wave anisotropy (ɛ) and the anisotropic δ parameter is well described by anisotropic fluid substitution theory. For the relatively weak stress-induced anisotropy that is seen in the presented experiments, the effect of anisotropy is less significant compared to the effect of dispersion to predict the plane wave modulus upon saturation. Effects of saturating fluid, stress paths, and the state of consolidation on the ratio between P- and S-wave velocities (/), as well as effects of grain size and shape of sands are presented in this dissertation. The − relationship can be useful to discriminate between different lithologies. / ratio is almost insensitive to stress in dry conditions, but shows increase with decrease in net stress upon saturation. Fluid saturation increases the / ratio at any stress level above the / ratio of dry samples. At low stresses / ratio is higher for sand than clay, but shows comparable values at high stresses. The / ratio shows significant hysteresis upon loading and unloading, and the hysteresis is higher for higher amount of clay. It is found that once all the stresses (vertical and confining pressure) are known then one might not observe any difference in / plotted vs. net mean stress due to stress paths differences. But if / ratio is plotted as function of net vertical stress (without knowledge of confining pressure at uniaxial strain condition), then significant difference between the stress paths can be visible. A set of trends are suggested for the − relation of sand-clay mixtures and clay. Two trends are suggested for sand with different grain shapes, that can be applied to both reservoir seismics and sonic or laboratory measurements. All those are valid for unconsolidated, uncemented sediments up to 10 MPa net stres...|$|E

Laboratory test using the ultra-sonic pulsemethod is carried out to measure the elastic wave velocity in specimens of the three kindsof sand. The elastic constants of specimens are proportional to approximately the 1 / 2 power ofthe confining pressure and they decrease for increasing porosity under the given confiningpressure. The wave velocity of sand is expressed {{as a function of}} the maximum porosity,the density of particles, the bulk modulus of water and the elastic constants of <b>sand</b> forthe minimum <b>porosity...</b>|$|R

The net-to-gross ratio is commonly greater than 70 % in the better quality zones, the better developed braided channels and aeolian dune <b>sand</b> bodies achieve <b>porosity</b> between 12 % and 28 %, and the typical porosity values of North Sea oil-bearing sandstones at this depth is around 16 % (Selley 1978).

30|$|The {{porosity}} {{model was}} conditioned to the lithology {{distribution of the}} facies model; thus, the predicted porosities follow the patterns seen in that model. The porosity was used to directly calculate volumes for the reservoir. As seen in Table  3, the volume calculations indicate {{that there may be}} two million or more barrels of recoverable oil in the Dudley Pool, even considering the uncharacteristic thickness in the southern upper Dudley. As expected, the north-central region where Petrel distributed thicker <b>sand</b> and higher <b>porosities</b> resulted in more recoverable oil, and the areas with shale show significantly less oil present.|$|R

As a consequence, design engineers often use overly large safety factors in many designs due to insufficient understanding of quantitative effects of shrinkage cavity defects. Now a day casting simulation has become a powerful tool to understand mould filling, solidification and cooling to predict the location of internal defects such as shrinkage <b>porosity,</b> <b>sand</b> inclusions and cold shuts.

40|$|Casting is a {{manufacturing}} process to make complex shapes of metal materials; during mass production, we may experience many defects, such as gas porosity, pin holes, blow holes, shrinkages and incomplete filling {{that may occur}} in <b>sand</b> casting. <b>Porosity</b> {{is one of the}} defects most frequently encountered in ductile iron casting. Porosity impacts cost by scrap loss and limits the use of cast parts in critical high strength applications. The amount of porosity is closely related to the parameter of sand casting process. The gating/riser system design plays a very important role for improving casting quality. Many researchers reported that 90 % of the defects in casting are obtained only because of improper design of gating and feeding system. The main objectives were to study the existing design of gating and feeding system, to optimize the gating and feeding system using Auto-CAST X 1 casting simulation software, to prepare the sand mold and cast the part, to compare the simulated result and experimental results, to reduce rejection rate and to enable the company to again start the production...|$|R
40|$|Underground gas storages from Romania {{are located}} in south Romania (in the Moesian Platform) and in Transylvanian Basin. They are {{converted}} from depleted gas reservoirs. Those from south have bigger capacity because the reservoirs are thick and stratiform, consisting of unconsolidated <b>sand,</b> with high <b>porosity</b> and permeability. The Transylvanian storages have smaller capacity because the layers are thinner, consisting of interbedded sandstones, silts and marls, with many lithological and facies variations, lower porosities and permeabilities. Geology of the reservoir has to be well known before constructing a deposit. Most important parameters are: depth of the reservoir, thickness, porosity, permeability, pore volume, structural model, tectonics, stratigraphic and lithological variations, type of aquifer, etc. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{distribution}} of mineral cements in oil fields is critical tothe spatial variation of porosity and permeability. The {{distribution of}} dolomite cement within fluvial Triassic Chaunoy sandstones in the Paris Basin was studied using core description, pe r graphy, core analysis (porosity and permeability), wireline data interpreted to give mineralogy, porosity and permeability data and geochemical data. Petrographic {{analysis revealed that}} dolomite and quartz cements are the main diagenetic minerals. Using sonic transit ime, density and neutron porosity log, the overall proportions of quartz, dolomite and shale as well as porosity for each depth interval could be resolved. Petrographic and core analysis data showed that permeability could be calculated from wireline-derived porosity and mineralogy data. There is excellent correlation between core analysis porosity and permeability and their wireline-derived equivalents. There is also excellent correlation between wireline-derived mineralogy data and quantitative petrographic mineralogy data. The wireline-derived mineralogy data show that dolomite is preferentially concentrated at the tops of most <b>sand</b> bodies. <b>Porosity</b> and permeability are consequently lowest at the tops of individual sand bodies due to the localized dolomite cement. There are a number o...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Knowledge of the {{hydraulic}} {{properties of the}} soil is of crucial importance {{to an understanding of}} the interactions between vegetation, soil and water. There is little information available about {{the hydraulic}} properties of Podzol soils found in tropical regions. The aim of this study was to present the soil morphology and hydraulic properties of a toposequence situated in a permanent plot at the Ilha do Cardoso State Park (Cananéia, SP, Brazil). Ultradetailed soil maps were used to define a toposequence inside the permanent plot. Five profiles, representing the main types of soil, were opened along the toposequence, in which Podzols are dominant. The levels of bulk density, <b>sand</b> content, <b>porosity</b> and permeability in these soils were all high. Consequently, these soils have a high level of hydraulic conductivity with low water retention. This behavior undergoes an alteration in the Bh and Bs horizons due to the accumulation of organic and metallic compounds and a changing structure that modifies the pore distribution. Furthermore, the characterization of the hydro-physical functioning of soils in natural environments is an important source of encouragement to further investigative study of soil water dynamics and its relationship to the native vegetation...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} presence of amulti species biofilm on the mobility of two types of zero-valent iron NP (nZVI; NANOFER 25 S and optimizedNANOFER STAR, NanoIron s. r. o. (Czech Republic)) was tested in laboratory experiments with columns mimickingaquifer conditions. Biofilmswere grown in columns filledwith sand in nitrate reducing conditions using groundwaterfrom an industrial site as inoculum. After two months growth, they were composed of several bacterialspecies, dominated by Pseudomonas stutzeri. Biofilm strongly affected the physical characteristics of the <b>sand,</b> decreasingtotal <b>porosity</b> from~ 30 % to ~ 15 %, and creating preferential pathwayswith high flowvelocities. nZVI suspensionswere injected into the columns at a seepage velocity of 10 m day− 1. Presence of biofilm did not impactthe concentrations of Fe at the column outlet nor the amount of total Fe retained in the sand, as attested by themeasurement of magnetic susceptibility. However, it {{had a significant impact on}} NP size sorting as well as ontotal Fe distribution along the column. This suggests nZVI-biofilm interactions that were confirmed by microscopicobservations using SEM/STEM coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Our study showsthat biofilm modifies the water flow velocity in the porous media, favoring the transport of large aggregatesand decreased NP mobility due to physical and chemical interactions...|$|R
