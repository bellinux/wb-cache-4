25|$|Coal {{can also}} be {{converted}} into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion). In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process, the SRC-I and SRC-II (<b>Solvent</b> <b>Refined</b> <b>Coal)</b> processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature carbonization, coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.|$|E
5000|$|The SRC-I and SRC-II (<b>Solvent</b> <b>Refined</b> <b>Coal)</b> {{processes}} {{were developed}} by Gulf Oil and implemented as pilot plants in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. [...] The Nuclear Utility Services Corporation developed hydrogenation process which was patented by Wilburn C. Schroeder in 1976. The process involved dried, pulverized coal mixed with roughly 1wt% molybdenum catalysts. [...] Hydrogenation occurred by use of high temperature and pressure syngas produced in a separate gasifier. The process ultimately yielded a synthetic crude product, Naphtha, {{a limited amount of}} C3/C4 gas, light-medium weight liquids (C5-C10) suitable for use as fuels, small amounts of NH3 and significant amounts of CO2. [...] Other single-stage hydrogenation processes are the Exxon Donor Solvent Process, the Imhausen High-pressure Process, and the Conoco Zinc Chloride Process.|$|E

The four major concepts for converting coal into liquid fuels (solvent extraction, catalytic liquefaction, pyrolysis, and indirect liquefaction), {{and the most important}} concepts for coal gasification (fixed bed, fluidized bed, entrained flow, and underground gasification) are described. Upgrading processes for coal derived liquid fuels are also described. Data presented for liquid fuels derived from various processes, including H-coal, synthoil, <b>solvent</b> <b>refined</b> <b>coal,</b> COED, donor solvent, zinc chloride hydrocracking, co-steam, and flash pyrolysis.

The response of four superalloys (IN- 100, U 700, IN 792 and M- 509) to exposure to the combustion gases from the SRC- 2 naphtha and resultant deposits was also determined. The SRC- 2 fuel analysis and insights obtained during the combustion experience are discussed. Particular problems encountered were fuel instability and reactions of the fuel with hardware components. The major metallic elements which contributed to the deposits were copper, iron, chromium, calcium, aluminum, nickel, silicon, titanium, zinc, and sodium. The deposits were found to be mainly metal oxides. An equilibrium thermodynamic analysis was employed to predict the chemical composition of the deposits. The agreement between the predicted and observed compounds was excellent. No hot corrosion was observed. This was expected because the deposits contained very little sodium or potassium and consisted mainly of the unreactive oxides. However, the amounts of deposits formed indicated that fouling is a potential problem with the use of these fuels...|$|R
30|$|Coal {{consists}} of two components—organic matter (carbonaceous matrix) and inorganic matter (mineral matter). Organic matter can be extracted using solvent extraction which leaves behind <b>solvent</b> <b>refined</b> clean <b>coal</b> product which has negligible ash contents (Kihong et al. 2016). The role of the solvent is to break the coal–coal interactions {{and replace it with}} the coal solvent interactions. Coal being a heterogeneous polymer shows a tendency to swell in organic solvents (Takanohashi and Iino 1995; Hernández et al. 2012; Hu et al. 1998; Mathews et al. 2015). Some solvents that have the characteristic property of donating a pair of electrons show good swelling. Mostly N and O donors are considered to be good solvents for coal extraction. Swelling gives a good idea of the extent of coal interaction with the solvent that may not necessarily always account for good extraction e.g. ethylenediammine (EDA) (Krevelen 1993). Early studies on coal extraction include the use of some basic solvents such as benzene, CHCl 3, alcohol, ether, carbon disulphide as reported by Van Krevalan (1993). Coal derived solvents are also used for extraction. Coal tar and coal tar pitch were used by Honda et al. Higher boiling fractions like anthracene oils gave better extraction yields (Mishra and Sharma 1990; Elliott 1981). About 95 % extraction yield has been reported by Orchin et al. with the use of boiling phenanthrene as a solvent (Krevelen 1993).|$|R

40|$|Synthetic {{graphite}} is {{an important}} industrial material, used in nuclear reactors, electrodes and many other applications. Graphitisation of coke is the solid-state transformation of the disordered carbon atoms into a well-ordered hexagonal graphite structure, requiring temperatures as high as 2 600 ºC. Catalytic graphitisation using metals or metal compounds allows the rearrangement of atoms to occur at lower temperatures. The extent of catalytic graphitisation is markedly dependent on the structural ordering of the parent coke, the catalyst concentration and the reaction conditions. Solvent extraction of coal using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a <b>solvent</b> yields a <b>refined</b> <b>coal</b> solution referred to as Refcoal solution. Cokes of solvent-refined Tshikondeni coal derivatives {{have been found to}} be graphitisable. The activity of acetylacetonate and hydroxyquinolinate complexes of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe and Zr for catalysing the graphitisation of Refcoal cokes at 1 600 and 2 000 ºC was investigated. The effect of residence time on the catalytic graphitisation of Refcoal cokes was investigated by heat-treating cokes for two and six hours at 1 600 °C. For iron(III) acetylacetonate, the effect of metal concentrations was studied. Samples were analysed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and optical microscope techniques. The results show that calcium(II) acetylacetonate catalyses the graphitisation of Refcoal cokes. The degree of graphitisation increases with an increase in the iron concentration. However, iron promotes localised graphitisation, probably in the vicinity of the catalyst particles. Dissertation (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|New {{electron}} acceptor (EA) stationary bonded phases (BP) for liquid chromatography were synthesized and compared with existing EA BP. The following EA BP were compared: Dinitrophenylmercaptopropylsilica (DNPMP); dinitrodibenzoylmercaptopropylsilica (DNBMP); dinitroanilinopropylsilica (DNAP); dinitrobenzamidopropylsilica (DNBAP); tetranitrofluoreniminopropylsilica (TNFP); tetranitrodibenzosuberiminopropylsilica (TNDBSP); trinitrophenylmercaptopropylsilica (TNPMP); pentafluorophenylsilica (PFPh); aminopropylsilica (NH 2) and Nucleosil TM 5 -NO 2 (5 -NO 2). Entropy-enthalpy compensation {{data indicated that}} the mechanism of retention (first 6 BP) was the same for planar and nonplanar aromatic solutes, but it was less informative than the vector-analysis techniques of linear correlation coefficient and Euclidian distance calculations. The latter provided a quantitative comparison of the BP. All EA BP had close similarity except for TNFP. NH 2 and 5 -NO 2 were somewhat similar to the EA BP. PFPh was not similar to the other EA BP. The EA BP were also examined {{for their ability to}} group aromatic solutes of similar ring size regardless of alkyl substitution. A new performance parameter RΓ (group resolution) was proposed and applied to these data. Using the calculated values for RΓ, the group-resolution effectiveness of the various BP followed the sequence: DNAP ≫ DNPMP, TNPMP, 5 -NO 2 3 ̆e TNDBSP, DNBMP, DNBAP 3 ̆e NH 2 3 ̆e TNFP ≫ PFPh. Retention of aromatic solutes as a function of planarity was also investigated. DNPMP was found to be slightly better than DNAP at separating bridged biphenyls. DNPMP was packed into a 0. 32 -mm x 300 -mm microcapillary liquid chromatographic (μLC) column. The μLC system was interfaced with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) by a ten-port switching valve with 50 and 7. 6 -μL loops.
