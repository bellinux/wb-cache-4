40|$|This book {{deals with}} the design and {{analysis}} of fractal apertures in waveguides, conducting <b>screens</b> and <b>cavities</b> using numerical electromagnetics and field-solvers. The aim is to obtain design solutions with improved accuracy {{for a wide range}} of applications. To achieve this goal, a few diverse problems are considered. The book is organized with adequate space dedicated for the design and analysis of fractal apertures in waveguides, conducting <b>screens,</b> and <b>cavities,</b> microwave/millimeter wave applications followed by detailed case-study problems to infuse better insight and understanding of the subject. Finally, summaries and suggestions are given for future work. Fractal geometries were widely used in electromagnetics, specifically for antennas and frequency selective surfaces (FSS). The self-similarity of fractal geometry gives rise to a multiband response, whereas the  space-filling nature of the fractal geometries makes it an efficient element in antenna and FSS unit cell miniaturization. Until now, no efforts were made to study the behavior of these fractal geometries for aperture coupling problems. The aperture coupling problem is an important boundary value problem in electromagnetics and used in waveguide filters and power dividers, slotted ground planes, frequency selective surfaces and metamaterials. The present book is intended to initiate a study of the characteristics of fractal apertures in waveguides, conducting <b>screens</b> and <b>cavities.</b> To perform a unified analysis of these entirely dissimilar problems, the “generalized network formulation of the aperture problems” by Mautz and Harrington was extended to multiple-aperture geometry. The authors consider the problem of coupling between two arbitrary regions coupled together via multiple apertures of arbitrary shape. MATLAB codes were developed for the problems and validated with the results available in the literature as well as through simulations on ANSOFT's HFSS...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of screen-covered cavities exposed to airflow tangent to the screen is described. The term screen refers to a thin metal plate perforated with a repetitive pattern of round holes. The purpose was to find the detailed aerodynamic and acoustic mechanisms responsible for screen-covered cavity resonance and {{to find ways to}} control the pressure oscillations. Results indicate that strong cavity acoustic resonances are created by screen orifices that shed vortices which couple resonance by choosing hole spacings such that shed vortices do not arrive at a downstream orifice in synchronization with cavity pressure oscillations. The proper hole pattern is effective at all airspeeds. It was also discovered that a reduction of orifice size tended to weaken the screen/cavity interaction regardless of hole pattern, probably because of viscous flow losses at the orifices. The <b>screened</b> <b>cavities</b> that resonated did so at much higher frequencies than the equivalent open cavity. The classical large eddy phenomenon occurs at the relatively small scale of the orifices (the excitation is typically of high frequency). The wind tunnel study was made at airspeeds from 0 to 100 m/sec. The 457 -mm-long by 1. 09 -m-high rectangular cavities had length-to-depth ratios greater than one, which is indicative of shallow <b>cavities.</b> The <b>cavity</b> <b>screens</b> were perforated in straight rows and columns with hole diameters ranging from 1. 59 to 6. 35 mm and with porosities from 2. 6 to 19. 6 percent...|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} noise {{level in the}} 9 x 15 foot wind tunnel at NASA Glenn has been documented, and the results compare favorably with historical measurements. A study of recessed microphone mounting techniques was also conducted, and a recessed cavity with a micronic wire mesh screen reduces hydrodynamic noise by around 10 dB. A three-microphone signal processing technique can provide additional benefit, rejecting up to 15 dB of noise contamination at some frequencies. The <b>screen</b> and <b>cavity</b> system offers considerable benefit to test efficiency, although there are additional calibration requirements...|$|R

40|$|One source {{contributing}} to wind tunnel background noise is microphone self-noise. An experiment {{was conducted to}} investigate the flow-induced acoustic oscillations of Bruel & Kjaer (B&K) in-flow microphones. The results strongly suggest the B&K microphone cavity behaves more like an open cavity. Their cavity acoustic oscillations are likely caused by strong interactions between the cavity shear layer and the cavity trailing edge. But the results also suggest that cavity shear layer oscillations could be coupled with cavity acoustic resonance to generate tones. Detailed flow velocity measurements over the <b>cavity</b> <b>screen</b> have shown inflection points in the mean velocity profiles and high disturbance and spectral intensities {{in the vicinity of}} the cavity trailing edge. These results are the evidence for strong interactions between cavity shear layer oscillations and the cavity trailing edge. They also suggest that beside acoustic signals, the microphone inside the cavity has likely recorded hydrodynamic pressure oscillations, too. The results also suggest that the forebody shape does not have a direct effect on cavity oscillations. For the FITE (Flow Induced Tone Eliminator) microphone, it is probably the forebody length and the resulting boundary layer turbulence that have made it work. Turbulence might have thickened the boundary layer at the separation point, weakened the shear layer vortices, or lifted them to miss impinging on the cavity trailing edge. In addition, the study shows that the <b>cavity</b> <b>screen</b> can modulate the oscillation frequency but not the cavity acoustic oscillation mechanisms...|$|R

By solving the sine-Gordon equation, we calculated the threshold magnetic field for penetration of fluxons {{as a function of}} frequency, and the power dissipated by oscillating fluxons as functions of the ac field amplitude and frequency. We considered the effects of superimposed ac and dc fields, and a bi-harmonic magnetic field resulting in a vortex ratchet dynamics.

40|$|A {{previous}} research on multivariate approach to the calculation of reverberation chamber correlation matrices {{is used to calculate}} the number of independent positions in a mode-stirred reverberation chamber. Anomalies and counterintuitive behavior are observed in terms of number of correlated matrix elements with respect to increasing frequency. This is ascribed to the regular geometry forming the baseline <b>cavity</b> (<b>screened</b> room) of a reverberation chamber, responsible for localizing energy and preserving regular modes (bouncing ball modes). Smooth wall deformations are introduced in order to create underlying Lyapunov instability of rays and then destroy survived regular modes. Numerical full-wave simulations are performed for a reverberation chamber with corner hemispheres and (off-) center wall spherical caps. Field sampling is performed by moving a mechanical carousel stirrer. It is found that wave-chaos inspired baseline geometries improve chamber performances in terms of lowest usable frequencies and number of independent cavity realizations of mechanical stirrers.

40|$|Protein {{conformational}} change {{is an important}} consideration in ligand-docking screens, {{but it is difficult}} to predict. A simple way to account for protein flexibility is to soften the criterion for steric fit between ligand and receptor. A more comprehensive but more expensive method would be to sample multiple receptor conformations explicitly. Here, these two approaches are compared. A “soft ” scoring function was created by attenuating the repulsive term in the Lennard-Jones potential, allowing for a closer approach between ligand and protein. The standard, “hard ” Lennard-Jones potential was used for docking to multiple receptor conforma-tions. The Available Chemicals Directory (ACD) was <b>screened</b> against two <b>cavity</b> sites in the T 4 lysozyme. These sites undergo small but significant {{conformational change}}s on ligand binding, making them good systems for soft docking. The ACD was also screened against the drug target aldose reductase, which can undergo large conformational changes on ligand binding. We evaluated the ability of the scoring functions to identify known ligands from among the over 200 000 decoy molecules in the database. The soft potential was always better at identifying known ligands than the hard scoring function when only a single receptor conformation was used. Conversely, the soft function was worse at identifying known lead...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Molecular {{recognition}} {{processes are}} ubiquitous in nature: substrate binding by enzymes, antigen recognition by antibodies, and hormone activation of receptors provide three classic examples. To better understand these large systems it is valuable to study smaller, well defined host molecules. Previously we found sequence-selective peptide binding with {{a class of}} C 3 symmetric synthetic receptors. In this work we rationally altered that host structure {{in order to produce}} a corresponding change in binding selectivity. Results: A novel C 3 symmetric receptor was designed and synthesized such that, unlike previous host molecules, it contained hydrogen-bond accepting functionality within the binding <b>cavity.</b> <b>Screening</b> of this host against a combinatorial tripeptide library revealed an exquisite selectivity for sequences with d-Pro-d-Asn carboxyl termini. Computer simulations and NMR studies indicate that hydrogen bonding of the d-Asn side-chain amide to the amine functionality within the cavity is responsible for this selectivity. Conclusions: Computer-aided design and combinatorial library screening methods combine to provide a powerful approach to induce and evaluate the results of rational changes in the molecular recognition properties of molecules. Using this approach, we modified the binding properties of a class of molecules to select for hydrogen-bonding residues instead of hydrophobic residues and concomitantly increased the overall sequence selectivity. Structural studies indicate that these changes indeed result from the type of binding mode proposed as part of the initial design. This approach can increase our understanding of molecular recognition processes, and should allow the rational design of larger, more selective systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Experimental {{results from}} studies with inbred mice and their syngeneic tumors {{indicated}} that the inoculation of semi-allogeneic cell hybrids (derived from the fusion between syngeneic tumor cells and an allogeneic cell line) protects the animal host from a subsequent lethal challenge with unmodified syngeneic tumor cells. Methods Semi-allogeneic somatic cell hybrids were generated by the fusion of EL- 4 T lymphoma cells (H- 2 b) and BALB/c-derived renal adenocarcinoma RAG cells (H- 2 d). Cell hybrids were injected intra-peritoneally (i. p.) in C 57 BL/ 6 mice (H- 2 b) before challenging the mice with a tumorigenic dose of EL- 4 cells. Results Semi-allogeneic tumor cell hybrids could not form a tumor in the animal host because they expressed allogeneic determinants (H- 2 d) and were rejected as a transplant. However, they conferred protection against a tumorigenic challenge of EL- 4 cells compared to control mice that were mock-vaccinated with i. p. -injected phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in which EL- 4 lymphomas grew rapidly to a large size in the peritoneal <b>cavity.</b> <b>Screening</b> of spleen-derived RNA by means of focused microarray technology revealed up-regulation of genes involved in the Th- 1 -type immune response and in the activation of dendritic antigen-presenting cells (APC).

40|$|Introduction: India lacks data on {{national}} level adaptation of oral cancer screening measures and burden of oral diseases. We intend {{to address the}} issue through a secondary data analysis of existing data and reports. Materials and Methods: Data were acquired from the National Family Health Survey- 4 (2015 - 2016). Of the 699, 686 responses, representing 99 % of India's women population living in all of India, the following data from the age group of 15 – 49 years were mined – any tobacco use, desire to quit tobacco use, and oral <b>cavity</b> <b>screening</b> for cancers. Data from Central Health Intelligence Bureau 2016 was used to identify population served by dentists in each state. The state-level data of the District Level Household and Facility Survey- 4 (2012 – 2013) were mined for household population having symptoms of chronic illness including mouth/dental illness persisting for more than 1 month and had sought treatment. Statistical Analysis Used: SPSS version 20; Descriptive statistics for values in proportions; Pearson's correlation test assessed between the various factors. Results: Tobacco use in any form was highly prevalent among the North Eastern states, and there was also a lack of willingness to quit the habit. There was unequal distribution of dentists in different states. No significant statistical correlation was found between the proportions. Conclusion: There is disparity existing in treating seeking behavior of the general population as well as the need for dental treatment. The skewedness in dentists' distribution among the nation as compared with oral burden of diseases needs to be correlated before oral health policies are planned...|$|R

40|$|A water {{desaturation}} zone develops {{around a}} tunnel in water-saturated rock when the evaporative water loss {{at the rock}} surface {{is larger than the}} water flow from the surrounding saturated region of restricted permeability. We describe the methods with which such water desaturation processes in rock materials can be quantified. The water retention characteristic theta(psi) of crystalline rock samples was determined with a pressure membrane apparatus. The negative water potential, identical to the capillary pressure, psi, below the tensiometric range (psi < - 0. 1 MPa) can be measured with thermocouple psychrometers (TP), and the volumetric water contents, theta, by means of time domain reflectometry (TDR). These standard methods were adapted for measuring the water status in a macroscopically unfissured granodiorite with a total porosity of approximately 0. 01. The measured water retention curve of granodiorite samples from the Grimsel test site (central Switzerland) exhibits a shape which is typical for bimodal pore size distributions. The measured bimodality is probably an artifact of a large surface ratio of solid/voids. The thermocouples were installed without a metallic <b>screen</b> using the <b>cavity</b> drilled into the granodiorite as a measuring chamber. The water potentials observed in a cylindrical granodiorite monolith ranged between - 0. 1 and - 3. 0 MPa; those near the wall in a ventilated tunnel between - 0. 1 and - 2. 2 MPa. Two types of three-rod TDR Probes were used, one as a depth probe inserted into the rock, the other as a surface probe using three copper stripes attached to the surface for detecting water content changes in the rock-to-air boundary. The TDR signal was smoothed with a low-pass filter, and the signal length determined based on the first derivative of the trace. Despite the low porosity of crystalline rock these standard methods are applicable to describe the unsaturated zone in solid rock and may also be used in other consolidated materials such as concrete...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{systems of}} {{commercial}} and naval ships are typically large and expensive. They must be kept well-aligned and free of corrosion to efficiently and reliably transfer torque to a ship's propeller. Early identification of misalignment or surface corrosion is therefore crucial, making an easily deployable, reliable, lightweight system that visually indicates potential alignment and structural integrity issues desirable. This thesis demonstrates {{the design of a}} system for visual deformation and orientation indication based on naturally occurring micro-scale surface geometries that show a strong variation in their optical appearance as a function of illumination and observation directions. Specifically, the fabrication of a micro-structured surface covered with appropriately modified mimics of the spherical cavities on Papilio blumei butterfly wings {{is the first step in}} developing a low-cost, easy-to-install detection and indication system. For a specific illumination and observation geometry, the cavities' material and structural characteristics define the surface's reflection characteristics and the resulting visual signature for a far-field observer. Here we present an evolution and <b>screening</b> of the <b>cavity</b> design space, including cavity wall height and the combination of conformal and flat Bragg reflectors in order to identify suitable cavity designs. A MATLAB-based simulation environment was created to estimate the surfaces' intensity profile in monochromatic light and color chromaticity under any illumination source and incidence angle as a function of observation angle. The theoretical results are validated through characterization of a succession of physical prototypes a macro-scale cavity before and after addition of a planar Bragg reflector cover as well as a conformally-clad microcavity array. The resulting data provides a basis for identifying the most suitable cavity designs for determination of misalignments, bends, and localized surface pitting in marine propulsion system components. The future development of specific in situ prototypes for the demonstration of the described visual sensing paradigm is facilitated through the results reported in this thesis. by Christopher Wing.

40|$|OBJETIVO: estudar a regeneração esplênica dos fragmentos de baço autólogos e heterotópicos implantados na cavidade peritoneal e na tela subcutânea em ratos e comparar os seus aspectos histológicos e citológicos com baço normal. MÉTODOS: 44 ratos Wistar foram submetidos a esplenectomia e receberam fragmentos de auto-implante: GA = na tela subcutânea (n= 22) e GB na cavidade peritoneal (n= 22). GAI (n= 11) e GAII (n= 11) receberam implante de fragmento único. GBIII (n= 11) e GBIV (n= 11) receberam implantes de quatro fragmentos. O baço remanescente foi usado como controle. Após 5 semanas de foram submetidos à eutanásia e foram investigados os aspectos macroscópicos e microscópicos (histológicos e citológicos) dos fragmentos nos seus locais de implante. Os resultados foram submetidos a testes estatísticos não paramétricos(p> 0, 05). RESULTADOS: Não houve diferença estatística significante entre o grupo que recebeu implante na tela subcutânea (n= 22) e o grupo da cavidade peritoneal (n= 22). Quanto à presença ou ausência de tecidos esplênicos regenerados (p= 0, 182), também não apresentou diferença com significância estatística. Os estudos histológicos e citológicos do tecido regenerado não evidenciaram diferenças em relação ao grupo controle. CONCLUSÃO: A regeneração do tecido esplênico autólogo e heterotópico em ratos ocorre nas mesmas proporções tanto na tela subcutânea como na cavidade peritoneal. Os aspectos histológicos e citológicos são semelhantes aos do baço normal. PURPOSE: {{verify the}} cytological and {{histological}} {{aspects of the}} regeneration of fragments of autologous and heterotopic spleen implanted in peritoneal <b>cavity</b> and subcutaneous <b>screen</b> in Wistar albino rats. METHODS: forty four Wistar rats were {{assigned to one of}} two groups A(n= 22) and B(n= 22), which received their implants in subcutaneous <b>screen</b> and peritoneal <b>cavity,</b> respectively, under anesthesia. Those groups were redistributed in two other subgroups A 1 (n= 11) and B 1 (n= 11), which received one and four splenic fragments in the areas of study. The remaining spleen was guided for cytological and histological processing, and was used as a control group. After five weeks, they were submitted to euthanasia, and peritoneal cavity opening took place as well as subcutaneous screen was taken off in order to search for regenerated splenic tissue. Cytological and histological assessment in the regenerated splenic tissue was performed, and the results were compared to the control group. Statistical analysis no parametric tests (p=> 0, 05) were used for. RESULTS: there were no statistically significant differences in relation to regenerated splenic tissue in subcutaneous screen (n= 22) and the peritoneal cavity (n= 22). In relation between presence and absence of regeneration, they're no statistically significant differences (p= 0, 182). Cytological and histological assessment did not show any statistically significant difference in relation to the control group.
