5|$|As travel became easier, faster, {{and less}} expensive, Germans {{started to see}} unity in factors other than their language. The Brothers Grimm, who {{compiled}} a massive dictionary known as The Grimm, also assembled a compendium of folk tales and fables, which highlighted the story-telling parallels between different regions. Karl Baedeker wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe, indicating places to stay, <b>sites</b> <b>to</b> visit, and giving a short history of castles, battlefields, famous buildings, and famous people. His guides also included distances, roads to avoid, and hiking paths to follow.|$|E

5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan. The radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways {{as though it were}} Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such <b>sites</b> <b>to</b> be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E

This nomination, to the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport would have included York on a list of tentative <b>sites</b> <b>to</b> be reviewed by UNESCO itself. York's bid failed, leading to 'disappointment' from the team involved. This indirectly led to the city making a successful bid {{to be part of the}} UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a city of Media Arts. It is the fourth of these cities, following Lyon, France; Enghien-les-Bains, France; and Sapporo, Japan.|$|E

The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum.

The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats.
