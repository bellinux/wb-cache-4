5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes.

5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than <b>substituting</b> <b>for</b> them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity.
