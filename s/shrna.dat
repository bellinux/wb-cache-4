25|$|Gene {{knockdown}} by transfection of exogenous siRNA {{is often}} unsatisfactory because {{the effect is}} only transient, especially in rapidly dividing cells. This may be overcome by creating an expression vector for the siRNA. The siRNA sequence is modified to introduce a short loop between the two strands. The resulting transcript is a short hairpin RNA (<b>shRNA),</b> which can be processed into a functional siRNA by Dicer in its usual fashion.. Typical transcription cassettes use an RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g., U6 or H1) to direct the transcription of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (U6 is involved in gene splicing; H1 is the RNase component of human RNase P). It is theorized that the resulting siRNA transcript is then processed by Dicer.|$|E
25|$|The gene {{silencing}} effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty {{can be overcome}} through an RNAi approach. Delivering this siRNA from DNA templates can be done through several recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, and lentivirus. The latter is the most efficient virus that stably delivers siRNA to target cells as it can transduce nondividing cells as well as directly target the nucleus. These specific viral vectors have been synthesized to effectively facilitate siRNA that is not viable for transfection into cells. Another aspect is {{that in some cases}} synthetic viral vectors can integrate <b>shRNA</b> into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown. This technique is advantageous because it is in vivo and effective for difficult to transfect cell. However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and immunogenic effects.|$|E

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{provides a}} promising therapeutic approach to human diseases. However, data from recent reports demonstrate that short-hairpin RNAs (<b>shRNAs)</b> may cause cellular toxicity, and this warrants further {{investigation of the}} safety of using RNAi vectors. Earlier, in comparing hairpin-based RNAi vectors, we noted that <b>shRNAs</b> are highly expressed and yield an abundance of unprocessed precursors, whereas artificial microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed at lower levels and are processed efficiently. We hypothesized that unprocessed <b>shRNAs</b> arise from the saturation of endogenous RNAi machinery, which poses likely a burden to cells. In this study, we tested that hypothesis by assessing the relative effects of <b>shRNAs</b> and artificial miRNAs on the processing and function of miRNAs. In competition assays, <b>shRNAs</b> disrupted miRNA biogenesis and function, whereas artificial miRNAs avoided this interference even when dosed to silence as effectively as <b>shRNAs.</b> We next compared the safety of these vectors in mouse cerebella, and found that <b>shRNAs</b> cause Purkinje cell neurotoxicity.

40|$|Abstract Background Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disorder that shows as erythematous and scaly lesions. The pathogenesis of psoriasis {{is driven by}} a dysregulation {{of the immune system}} which leads to an altered cytokine production. Proinflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated in psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), interleukin- 12 (IL- 12), and IL- 23 for which monoclonal antibodies have already been approved for clinical use. We have previously documented the therapeutic applicability of targeting TNFÎ± mRNA for RNA interference-mediated down-regulation by anti-TNFÎ± small hairpin RNAs (<b>shRNAs)</b> delivered by lentiviral vectors to xenografted psoriatic skin. The present report aims at targeting mRNA encoding the shared p 40 subunit (IL- 12 B) of IL- 12 and IL- 23 by cellular transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding anti-IL 12 B <b>shRNAs.</b> Methods Effective anti-IL 12 B <b>shRNAs</b> are identified among a panel of <b>shRNAs</b> by potency measurements in cultured cells. The efficiency and persistency of lentiviral gene delivery to xenografted human skin are investigated by bioluminescence analysis of skin treated with lentiviral vectors encoding the luciferase gene. shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors are intradermally injected in xenografted psoriatic skin and the effects of the treatment evaluated by clinical psoriasis scoring, by measurements of epidermal thickness, and IL- 12 B mRNA levels. Results Potent and persistent transgene expression following a single intradermal injection of lentiviral vectors in xenografted human skin is reported. Stable IL- 12 B mRNA knockdown and reduced epidermal thickness are achieved three weeks after treatment of xenografted psoriatic skin with lentivirus-encoded anti-IL 12 B <b>shRNAs.</b> These findings mimick the results obtained with anti-TNFÎ± <b>shRNAs</b> but, in contrast to anti-TNFÎ± treatment, anti-IL 12 B <b>shRNAs</b> do not ameliorate the psoriatic phenotype as evaluated by semi-quantitative clinical scoring and by immunohistological examination. Conclusions Our studies consolidate the properties of lentiviral vectors as a tool for potent gene delivery and for evaluation of mRNA targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. However, in contrast to local anti-TNFÎ± treatment, the therapeutic potential of targeting IL- 12 B at the RNA level in psoriasis is questioned. </p...|$|R

One of the major challenges of using RNAi is selecting effective <b>shRNAs</b> or siRNAs that sufficiently down-regulate the expression of the target gene. Here, we describe a system to select functional <b>shRNAs</b> or siRNAs that makes use of the leukemia cell line Ba/F 3 that is dependent on the expression of a mutant form of the PDGFRÎ± kinase for its proliferation and survival. The basis of this system is the generation of an expression construct, where part of the open reading frame of the gene of interest is linked to the mutant PDGFRÎ±. Thus, <b>shRNAs</b> or siRNAs that effectively target the gene of interest also result in a reduction of the expression of the mutant PDGFRÎ± protein, which can be detected by a reduction of the proliferation of the cells.
