The most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride, while upon heating to between 350 and 600°C, it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride.|$|E
50|$|The Catalan <b>solids</b> are all convex. They are face-transitive but not vertex-transitive. This {{is because}} the dual Archimedean <b>solids</b> are vertex-transitive and not face-transitive. Note that unlike Platonic <b>solids</b> and Archimedean <b>solids,</b> the faces of Catalan <b>solids</b> are not regular polygons. However, the vertex figures of Catalan <b>solids</b> are regular, and they have {{constant}} dihedral angles. Being face-transitive, Catalan <b>solids</b> are isohedra.|$|R

5|$|Fluorine has two <b>solid</b> forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized <b>solid</b> oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other <b>solid</b> halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a <b>solid</b> support {{material and}} remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The <b>solid</b> support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the <b>solid</b> support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the <b>solid</b> support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of <b>solid</b> surfaces. Traditionally, <b>solid</b> surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} <b>solid</b> {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the <b>solid</b> itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solids</b> can be {{transformed}} into liquids by melting, and liquids can {{be transformed}} into <b>solids</b> by freezing. <b>Solids</b> can also change directly into gases {{through the process of}} sublimation, and gases can likewise change directly into <b>solids</b> through deposition.|$|R
25|$|The feed to a {{belt press}} filter {{depends on the}} type of <b>solids,</b> desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry <b>solids</b> {{concentration}} is typically in the range of 1-10%. The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry <b>solids</b> concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%. Dilute feed <b>solids</b> concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed <b>solids</b> concentration yields an improved <b>solids</b> filtration rate and drier end product.|$|R

5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from <b>solid</b> reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the <b>solid</b> reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a <b>solid</b> precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on <b>solid</b> surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or <b>solid</b> media.|$|E
5|$|Nucleosidic <b>solid</b> supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} <b>solid</b> support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic <b>solid</b> supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal <b>solid</b> supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic <b>solid</b> support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to characterise the <b>solids</b> in an {{anaerobic}} sewage treatment process. Hindered settling velocity, particle size distributions (PSD), influent and effluent CODp/SS and discrete settling velocity distributions were all measured. The anaerobic migrating bed reactor (AMBR) <b>solids</b> were mainly flocculent and had a settling rate equivalent to a good settling activated sludge (similar to SSVI = 60 mL/g). The PSD of the anaerobic <b>solids</b> were very different to PSD for activated sludge flocs, with the anaerobic <b>solids</b> having a modal size {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than activated sludge, but a range of particle sizes being two orders of magnitude larger. There was a far greater range in size and structure in the anaerobic <b>solids.</b> The anaerobic process <b>solids</b> were primarily feed <b>solids</b> undergoing VSS destruction (hydrolysis). The biological mass was small. The <b>solids</b> seemed to retain their size as the volatiles were degraded and the density decreased (2 ̆ 7 skeletons 2 ̆ 7 of the influent particulates). The small fraction of slowly settling <b>solids,</b> which have been identified to have a similar modal size but lower density than the mixed <b>solids</b> in the reactor, pose a <b>solids</b> retention time (SRT) control problem when relying on settling alone for <b>solids</b> retention.

40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} densification of aggregates within a suspension on thickener dewatering performance. The comparisons of the maximum permitted underflow <b>solids</b> flux calculated from both an initial undensified thickener and a densified thickener were achieved. Large underflow <b>solids</b> fluxes were attained in densified thickeners. The effects of densification on the bed heights and on the <b>solids</b> residence times required to achieve a given underflow <b>solids</b> flux and a given underflow <b>solids</b> volume fraction were also computed and compared. Substantial reductions in the bed heights and the <b>solids</b> residence times are possible in densified cases. Previous studies have assumed the functional form of the compressive yield stress in the suspension so as to give an exceedingly weak gel in the neighbourhood of the <b>solids</b> volume fraction {{at the top of}} the bed. The implications of considering a different gel rheology with a rather stronger gel were considered. The effects of this new rheology lead to a slightly less sharp spatial gradient in the <b>solids</b> volume fraction near the top of the bed. In addition, the effect of varying the underflow <b>solids</b> volume fraction was considered. The observations of substantial increases in underflow <b>solids</b> fluxes and substantial reductions in bed heights and <b>solids</b> residence times were only achieved when the underflow <b>solids</b> volume fraction was less than or comparable with the <b>solids</b> volume fraction within the aggregates. However, if the underflow <b>solids</b> volume fraction was considerably larger, aggregates were considered to be overlapping and interpenetrating. As a result, the improvements in thickener performance due to densification were insignificant...|$|R
