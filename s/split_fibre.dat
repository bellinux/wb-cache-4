Since {{there is a}} growing interest to evaluate these fibres for application in the textile field, special attention is paid to some techniques of stretching and fibrillating. The different methods of transport and healing, as well as their influence on film properties, are briefly reviewed. As, of all fibrillation methods, controlled fibrillation appears to be the most important, the mechanism of this special type of splitting has been studied.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{technique}} of block surface-staining and serial cinematography was modified to review serial sections of normal and dystrophic muscle from the Bar Harbor 129 Re strain of mice as a preliminary study of <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> in dystrophic muscle. Using this technique, muscle fibres were reconstructed {{for up to}} 1 - 5 mm of their length without difficulty. <b>Split</b> <b>fibres</b> were identified only when the actual separation of <b>fibres</b> was observed. <b>Splitting</b> was seen {{to be a significant}} cause of the variations in fibre diameter and was at times responsible for the formation of groups of small atrophic fibres which resembled those seen in denervation atrophy. Complex multiple splitting and recombination of daughter and parent fibres was also observed and reconstructed to scale. These results may have considerable significance for the interpretation of physiological data on both human and murine dystrophic muscle. The longitudinal <b>splitting</b> of muscle <b>fibres</b> is one of the degenerative changes which may be identi-fied in transverse sections of muscle tissue.

40|$|Pilot scale {{refining}} of White spruce using {{a modified}} TMP refining process (ATMP - Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp) was studied. ATMP combines selective wood disintegration by mechanical pretreatment and refining at elevated intensity with chemical treatment after defibration (in this study hydrogen peroxide, alone and {{in combination with}} alkali). The electrical energy efficiency and pulp quality using ATMP were evaluated and compared to a conventional TMP process. One goal was to retain the combination of optical properties and strength of typical TMP. Fibre properties (structural dimensions, external and internal fibre development) {{as well as the}} amount of <b>split</b> <b>fibres</b> resulting from TMP and ATMP processes were compared. The results indicate an electrical energy efficiency improvement potential of 0. 65 MWh/odt (34 %) at tensile index 30 N. m/g of ATMP compared to reference TMP. All ATMP pulps retained their TMP character, i. e. the relationships between light scattering coefficient, density, elongation properties and strength that are important for printing paper. ATMP had a significantly lower content of shives and higher external and internal fibre development compared to TMP at equal energy application. The long fibre fraction of ATMP also contained significantly higher amount of <b>split</b> <b>fibres.</b> The brightness of ATMP produced with addition of hydrogen peroxide (28 kg/odt) and magnesium hydroxide (14 kg/odt) was 14 ISO % higher compared to TMP...|$|R

This work may appear strenuous, but is far less effort than rip sawing by hand. It is first done radially, to split the log into wedged segments.

Segments are halved symmetrically at each step, as this encourages them to split more evenly than attempting to cleave off thin sheets repeatedly from one end.|$|R

30|$|Nanofibrillated {{cellulose}} is {{isolated from}} cellulosic fibres {{by using a}} mechanical or chemo-enzymatic-mechanical treatment (top-down-methods). That means structures are extracted from a fibre network by defibrillation [17]. The aim is to <b>split</b> <b>fibres</b> into micro- and nanofibrils without changing the high aspect ratio. Chemical pulp (like kraft or sulfite pulp), vegetable fibres of agricultural or waste products, or fast-growing plants like eucalyptus, sisal, or ramie [18, 19] provide the source of raw materials. Furthermore, unbleached pulp can be fibrillated [20], which is a particularly interesting aspect with reference to (ancient) paper shades. Consequently, {{it might be possible}} with respect to NFC to influence the outcome through various parameters during or after the production process. Important key data of NFC are size and size distribution of the fibrils. NFC has also a very good water retention capacity [10, 18] and distinct mechanical strength properties [18].|$|R

The acoustic emission (AE) method was applied to detect various micro-scale energy release phenomena during tensile deformation not only of Manila hemp fibre, but also of three kinds of composites with three different fibre orientation angles, namely 0, 45 and 90. In the case of Manila hemp fibre testing, low amplitude AE events (40 – 60 dB) were measured at an intermediate strain range and high amplitude events were also measured at a final fracture stage. In the case of 0 composite, AE signals having {{a wide range of}} amplitude distribution were measured from the beginning of deformation and the AE activity was found to become significant with further tensile deformation. On the other hand, a few AE data with low amplitude were measured in 45 and 90 composites. In conclusion, low and high amplitude AE events observed during tensile deformation of natural fibre composites originated from <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> and <b>fibre</b> fracture, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three parts: Existing {{methods for}} characterisation of fibre crosssections have been improved, and new {{methods have been}} developed. These methods have then been applied to {{study the effects of}} wood characteristics and the pulping process on mechanical pulp fibres. Links have been established between fibre structure and paper properties such as surface smoothness and light scattering coefficient. New methods, based on SEM-images and image analysis, are described for providing cross-sectional fibre dimensions for large fibre populations, for wood tracheids (app. 60 000 tracheids in a wood trunk) and for processed pulp fibres (app. 1000 fibres per sample). The methods are suited e. g. for evaluation of changes in the fibre cross-sections from wood to the finished paper, or for mapping of fibre parameters within and between growth rings in a wood trunk. The treatment of data is discussed, showing how one may examine the changes in different groups of fibres (earlywood <b>fibres,</b> latewood <b>fibres,</b> <b>split</b> <b>fibres)</b> throughout a process. It is known from the literature that groundwood-based paper is superior to TMP-based paper with respect to printability. Fibres from SGW and PGW-pulp were found to be much more split in the longitudinal direction than TMP-fibres at comparable freeness. Intact groundwood fibres had thicker walls than intact TMP-fibres, but nevertheless super calendered hand sheets made from groundwood fibres were less roughened by moistening than were TMP-based sheets. Both for groundwood pulps and for TMPpulps, it was shown that reduced fibre wall thickness and increased <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> was beneficial for improved surface smoothness and opacity. Latewood defibrate easier than earlywood during refining. In the case of grinding, there was no particular preference for earlywood or latewood to be defibrated. Reject refining of groundwood reject was, however, found to be very important for defibration of latewood-containing shives. Pulps made from a raw material with more compact fibres (high wall area to lumen area ratio) were found to defibrate easier, and contain less shives. It was found that refining tends to reduce wall thickness most on thickwalled parts of the fibre, thus causing a reduction of the wall thickness variation around the perimeter. Earlywood fibres were found to be preferentially split during refining. Most <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> occurs during the primary stage, while the fibres are firmly attached to chips or fibre bundles. Latewood fibre wall thickness decreases considerably more than earlywood fibre wall thickness during refining. It seems that choosing an appropriate raw material is more effective than using excessive energy on reducing the wall thickness of thickwalled fibres. Earlywood fibres became more flattened during refining compared to latewood fibres, possibly due to repeated compressions and relaxations in the refiner. The energy consumption to a given freeness was found to be considerably larger for Scots Pine than for Norway Spruce. However, the fibre transverse dimensions did not differ much between Norway Spruce and Scots Pine. Pine pulps were far less developed than spruce pulps at similar energy level. A possible explanation for the large energy consumption may be that redistribution of extractives at the fibre surface could reduce friction in the refiner. This hypothesis should be further explored. The results in this study improve the knowledge of which fibre parameters that matter for surface smoothness and opacity of wood-containing publication paper. Further, this study elucidates how important fibre parameters such as wall thickness and <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> are altered during a refining process. The results may be utilized to identify possible ways of modifying the TMP-process in order to produce paper with improved surface smoothness and opacity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

Low-intensity TMP and high-intensity TMP with mechanical pre-treatment of chips {{were compared to}} ATMP (Mg+P), where development of fibres was enhanced using hydrogen peroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The main goal of the trial was to evaluate the potential of using ATMP process for production of SC (supercalendered) magazine paper. SC paper is especially demanding {{when it comes to}} the paper surface structure which is strongly influenced by the development of fibre properties. Improvement in individual fibre properties such as flexibility, <b>fibre</b> <b>split</b> index and <b>fibre</b> surface area index achieved using ATMP process was found to translate into decreased surface roughness and air permeability of calendered laboratory sheets. Both the refining process configuration and the addition of process chemicals were found to have significant impacts though the process configuration had major role. The influence of process chemicals on PPS was mainly pronounced after second stage refining. The magnitude of surface roughening (fibre rising) was found to be influenced mainly by the process configuration...|$|R

The impact of sodium chloride and sodium silicate (sodium metasilicate salt) -cured hides along with green hides were investigated in terms of removal of hyaluronic acid. Throughout beamhouse operations, the opening up of fibre structure was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The residual hyaluronic acid in hide and pelt samples taken after each beamhouse operation was analysed through bio-chemical analysis assisted by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The interaction of residual hyaluronic acid with chromium (III) was investigated in terms of deposition of chromium(III) in cross-sectional layers of chrome-tanned leather through scanning electon microscope – energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The hydrothermal stability of chrome tanned leather was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that sodium chloride can remove hyaluronic acid completely in the soaking operation and facilitate good opening and <b>splitting</b> up of <b>fibre</b> structure, which enables good penetration and fixation of chromium(III) species with the purified collagen. In contrast, in the absence of a neutral salt, residual hyaluronic acid existed throughout the beamhouse operations which resulted in poor opening and <b>splitting</b> up of <b>fibre</b> bundles and later inhibited the penetration of chromium(III) species in cross-sectional layers. As a result, comparatively lower hydrothermal stability was observed. Sodium silicate-cured hides did not provide satisfactory results in terms of removing the hyaluronic acid present in the hide, poor opening and <b>splitting</b> up of <b>fibre</b> structure were observed and residual hyaluronic acid was identified even at pickle stage.

This thesis {{deals with}} carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (CFRP) composites, an advanced material which {{is widely used}} in manufacturing aircrafts because of their unique mechanical and physical properties.

40|$|Pilot plant coating trials {{compared}} a coating basesheet {{made from}} P. radiata (radiata pine) TMP with several European basesheets. The pine basesheet compared favourably when coated using a metered film press coater though more fibre rising occurred with it during coating. The coated sheet also required more severe calendering conditions {{to meet the}} gloss target. It was suggested that the P. radiata TMP used in the trial basesheet would benefit from additional processing that would promote stripping of material from the long fibre wall {{in order to make}} it more collapsible and promote improved strength and surface roughness. The TMP would also benefit from processes that would generate more <b>split</b> <b>fibres.</b> The properties of TMP originating from the Australasian mills of Norske Skog were examined and compared to TMP from spruce. Some additional measurements of %split fibres and bendability were made on the pulps at PFI. A Fiberlab fibre analyser was used extensively to measure fibre dimensions. Factor analysis of pressing experiments aided in identifying the P. radiata pulps that approached the quality of spruce pulp used for coating and SC grades of paper. Pulps were fractionated and the dimensions of the fibres, the specific surface area determined from sedimentation measurements and the physical and optical properties of each of the fractions were measured. Specific surface area, tensile index, roughness and sheet density were all significantly correlated and could be used as measures of fibre development. The long fibre fraction was identified as being the poorest quality fibre and most in need of development. Mill screening operations were examined to look at their selectivity in removing the long fibre fraction from the rest of the pulp so that it could be further processed to promote fibre collapse and flexibility. High consistency screening was compared with low consistency screening and it was concluded that a multistage low consistency screening system was more selective than a single high consistency screen. When refined in a low consistency refiner the properties of the whole pulp improved but the long fibre component showed no detectable improvement in density, tensile or wall thickness. High consistency refining of screen rejects improved the whole pulp properties and the properties of the long fibre with significant improvements in specific surface area and reduction in the fibre wall thickness. Improved long fibre screen selectivity followed by high consistency refining of the long fibre is a strategy for improving the quality of the fibre for a coating basesheet...|$|R

Since the original description in 1956 by Shy and Magee of central core disease as a nonprogressive myopathy, several ideas have been suggested {{on the nature of}} the disease. The histochemical simi-larity between target fibres and central cores led Engel (1967) to postulate a neurogenic factor in the genesis of central core disease. The finding of an increased terminal innervation ratio in this myo-pathy could also be considered to indicate a neural aetiology (Telerman-Toppet et al., 1973; Isaacs et al., 1975). Longitudinal <b>splitting</b> of muscle <b>fibres</b> in this disease, mainly in type 2 fibres (Telerman-Toppet et al., 1973) with slow replacement with type 1 suggests that the disease is not progressive.

BMC Medical Imaging, 14, [38]Background The correct {{segmentation}} of myofibres in histological {{muscle biopsy}} images {{is a critical}} step in the automatic analysis process. Errors occurring {{as a result of}} incorrect segmentations have a compounding effect on latter morphometric analysis and as such it is vital that the fibres are correctly segmented. This paper presents a new automatic approach to myofibre segmentation in H&E stained adult skeletal muscle images that is based on Coherence-Enhancing Diffusion filtering. Methods The procedure can be broadly divided into four steps: 1) pre-processing of the images to extract only the eosinophilic structures, 2) performing of Coherence-Enhancing Diffusion filtering to enhance the myofibre boundaries whilst smoothing the interior regions, 3) morphological filtering to connect unconnected boundary regions and remove noise, and 4) marker controlled watershed transform to <b>split</b> touching <b>fibres.</b> Results The method has been tested on a set of adult cases with a total of 2, 832 fibres.

40|$|The translaminar {{fracture}} toughness of fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) {{is important for}} characterising the failure resistance of composite structures. Measuring the translaminar {{fracture toughness}} for any possible layup is not feasible. Therefore, it is of interest to relate the translaminar toughness of a laminate to that of its plies. Numerous studies have measured the translaminar fracture toughness of composite laminates and of individual plies. However, any attempts to relate the two have so far been very limited, and restricted to initiation values. This work presents experimental and analytical research on Compact Tension (CT) tests on several T 800 s/M 21 carbon-epoxy laminates with different combinations of 0 °, ± 45 and 90 ° plies, and with various ply thicknesses. Post-mortem techniques, such as X-ray, optical and scanning electron microscopy, {{were used to determine}} the damage extent in each specimen. Acoustic emission (AE) was also used to sequence the occurrence of the failure mechanisms. Failure mechanisms found in the multidirectional laminates included a combination of the failure mechanisms found on bidirectional laminates (/ 90 °) made of its constituent plies. Ply <b>splitting,</b> <b>fibre</b> bridging and fibre pull-out were the main features characterizing the fracture surfaces. Assuming that the damage can be represented as a single crack, the resistance curve (R-curve) for each layup was extracted from these tests. From each laminate R-curve, three distinct fracture toughness values were obtained for each layup: non-linearity onset, initiation and propagation. The R-curves were used to define a trilinear cohesive law for each layup, and the specimens were then successfully simulated using a cohesive approach in a Finite Element (FE) model. On the one hand, there was good agreement supporting the representation of translaminar damage as a cohesive crack. On the other hand, damage was considerably diffuse when the laminate included substantial ply-blocking, thus suggesting that a single equivalent crack may, in some cases, neglect some important aspects of translaminar damage (as well as delamination). Four analytical predictive models were used to predict the translaminar toughness of the laminates from that of the constituent plies. The assumption of translaminar fracture toughness additivity by means of a rule of mixtures correlated best with the experimental results. The experimental results for a mode I crack propagation in a 45 ° ply were shown to corroborate a simple analytical model which relates the critical energy release rate of a 45 ° ply to those of 0 and 90 plies. Thickness size effects were investigated by using different 0 ply thicknesses, by means of 0 ° ply-blocks and using two grades of the same material system. Since it was found that excessive ply-blocking can lead to significantly diffuse damage, a second study with thin-ply TR 50 s/K 51 carbon-epoxy system was conducted, leading to the first translaminar fracture characterisation of a 0 ° CFRP ply for a range of thicknesses from 0. 03 mm to 0. 12 mm. The toughness of the 0 ° plies was confirmed to be significantly dependent on the thickness, even for ranges of thicknesses where delamination does not play a significant role. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibres are {{fabricated}} in bundles. A single roving {{contains a}} minimum of 1000 filaments. Certain applications demand thinner bundles or even single fibres. Single fibres {{can be used as}} tool electrodes in electrochemical machining processes. Thinner rovings are needed in sensor applications to raise the electrical resistance of the carbon fibre bundle used as strain sensor. Rovings with a lower filament count cannot be delivered by carbon <b>fibre</b> producers. A <b>splitting</b> technology is therefore needed. A continuous bundle splitting technique was developed. It uses mechanical means, liquid flow and variations in winding force and speed to separate the filaments. The impact of winding parameters and of the liquid flow on the splitting result was quantified in experiments with the developed splitting system. An automatic and continuous <b>splitting</b> of carbon <b>fibre</b> rovings was realised. Smaller bundles of carbon fibre filaments can be provided. There is a solution to satisfy the demand on finer carbon fibre rovings...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} Brauer-Manin {{obstruction}} to the Hasse principle and to weak approximation for 0 -cycles on algebraic varieties that possess a fibration structure. The exactness of the local-to-global sequence (E) of Chow groups of 0 -cycles was known {{only for a}} fibration whose base is either a curve or the projective space. In the present paper, we prove the exactness of (E) for fibrations whose bases are Châtelet surfaces or projective models of homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups with connected stabilizers. We require that either all <b>fibres</b> are <b>split</b> and most <b>fibres</b> satisfy weak approximation for 0 -cycles, or the generic fibre has a 0 -cycle of degree 1 and (E) is exact for most fibres.

40|$|This present {{paper is}} the second in a series which {{together}} detail the static behaviour, fractographic observations, fatigue behaviour and finite element predictions of composite I-beams subjected to mechanical loads. Fractographic observations associated with the mechanical behaviour under static load of both unnotched and web- and flange-notched continuously reinforced carbon-fibre/epoxy and E-glass-fibre/epoxy I-beams are discussed. Ultrasonic scanning, X-radiography and both optical and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used to}} elucidate the presence of different damage mechanisms and the directions of delamination growth in different regions of the beams. The principal damage mechanisms which have been identified as causing failure are delamination, matrix cracking, <b>splitting</b> and <b>fibre</b> fracture. As discussed in detail in the previous paper, a four-point flexural configuration was used. A mode of buckling that was antisymmetric across the width of the compressive flange was observed prior to failure in all cases. Failure of the unnotched I-beams initiated from a buckle on the compressive flange and the subsequent damage was predominantly in the form of delamination. The main delaminations were along the interfaces between the separate sub-components which comprise the I-beams: namely, the flange caps and C-sections and the backs of the two C-sections. These are all interfaces i. e. the relative fibre angle between the adjacent plies is 90 °. Failure of the notched I-beams initiated from a shear-loaded circular cutout within the web. The critical damage mechanism was matrix cracking in local plies which were subject to local tensile stresses. Fibre fracture and component failure resulted from this matrix cracking...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} grow, {{crustaceans}} must shed their exoskeleton {{in a process}} known as 2 ̆ 2 moulting 2 ̆ 7. Although this process is short and intermittent, it remains dominant over the life of a crustacean. Physiological changes in the period between moults (intermoult) are comparatively quiescent as opposed to the periods directly before and after the actual moult, known as premoult, and postmoult respectively (West, 1997). Moulting is associated with distinct physiological changes including the breakdown of muscle (Musgrove and Geddes, 1985). This muscle breakdown, known as atrophy is the diminution in size of the actual muscle mass and is very specific, occurring to facilitate the withdrawal of the large pinnate claw muscle mass from the narrow basiischial joint (Mykles and Skinner, 1985). It is likely that atrophy does not occur in the abdomen as it is withdrawn through an opening similar in size to the actual muscle mass. This study aimed to determine and compare the effects of moulting on the characteristics of atrophic claw and non-atrophic abdominal muscles in the yabby, Cherax albidus. Although the moult cycle is a continuum, it may be sub-divided into several stages and sub-stages by reference to morphological changes in the integument state, and in development of the uropod setae using light microscopy. Three individuals of the yabby species Cherax albidus, were sacrificed at each of the following four stages, including intermoult (C 1 - C 2) early premoult (D 1 to D 1. 3), late premoult (D 2 – D 4) and postmoult A. Claw and abdominal muscle were sectioned in a croystat at - 20 ° C, and stained using three histochemical techniques; mATPase indicative of contractile speed; NADH-TR indicative of fatigue resistance and H 2 ̆ 6 E, which visualizes structural characteristics. In this study, the mATPase and NADH-TR stains were developed for the yabby, Cherax albidus. Subsequently, several important cellular characteristics were determined for both claw and abdominal muscle over the moult cycle, including gross morphology, cellular morphology, fibre diameter, and fibre type distribution, at the four aforementioned strategic stages. In terms of these characteristics, the results suggest that abdominal muscles of the yabby Cherax albidus do not undergo moult-induced atrophy as opposed to the claw, consistent with the hypothesis, however both do exhibit characteristics of growth at postmoult. The main mechanisms of atrophy appeared be associated with mitochondrial aggregates, the proliferation of phagocytcs in fibres, and enlarged intermyofibrillar spaces. These indicators and mechanisms of atrophy were most evident at late premoult. Further studies are required to establish the exact association between these characteristics in claw muscle atrophy, and the underlying mechanisms. At postmoult, the muscle was restored firstly in the proximal region as it resembled the intermoult condition, whilst the distal region remained moderately affected by atrophy, and/or growth. In contrast to claw muscle, the abdominal muscle mass did not exhibit reductions in fibre diameter, or fibre type distributions, however did exhibit slight changes in cellular morphology. The extent of these changes suggest they were associated with growth rather than atrophy. Growth was exhibited as <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> and was observed in both claw and abdominal muscle predominantly at the late premoult and postmoult stages. Five types of <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> were observed, most of which were common to both muscles. The differing extents of particular types of <b>fibre</b> <b>splitting</b> between the claw and abdominal muscles may be related to recovery from atrophy. Hence, great changes associated with moulting were observed in the claw muscle of the yabby, Cherax albidus, whilst abdominal muscle remained relatively unaffected...|$|R
