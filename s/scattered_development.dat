40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the evolution {{process of the}} air transport network of China (ATNC) since 1930. Based on the network analysis results, the ATNC has significantly improved in connectivity based on (1) rising alpha, beta and gamma indices, (2) declining diameter and centre index and (3) decreasing average path length and increasing clustering coefficient. The network centralization index reveals a fluctuation phase before 1952, a pre- 1980 centralization phase before the economic reform era, a centralization phase after the mid- 1990 s deregulation, and a decentralization phase between. The k-core decomposition method helps identify the evolution of core network and hierarchy of the ATNC over time. The spatial development model characterizes its structure change in six stages: (1) <b>scattered</b> <b>development,</b> (2) trunk line connection, (3) circular linkage, (4) hub formation, (5) a complex network structure, and (6) emerging multi-airport systems.

40|$|We {{present and}} {{evaluate}} a foundational agent-based model {{of land use}} change at the rural-urban fringe {{within the context of}} a larger project that will link to surveys of the environmental and community preferences of residents with historical data on patterns of development. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics arising from a model of residential location resulting from preferences for services, density, and aesthetics focusing on the relationship between micro level preferences and policy relevant macro phenomena such as <b>scattered</b> <b>development,</b> largest city size, and the number of residential clusters. We consider two representations of agents' utility functions [...] one additively separable and one multiplicative [...] to see if functional form has any impact on the dynamics of the system, and find that they produce similar results. Our analysis includes both representative agent runs, in which all agents have identical preferences, as well as runs in which the agents have diverse preferences. We find that diversity can increase sprawl through feedbacks associated with the spatial locations of services and agents. In addition, we examine cases in which the agents' location decisions affect the aesthetic quality of neighboring sites and find that these feedbacks further exacerbate the sprawl effect...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{urbanization}} in Asia {{since the}} 1970 s has caused many serious urban environmental problems, among which {{the degradation of}} the transport-related environment is most prominent. Overall assessment of the physical, socio-economic, and institutional factors affecting urban transport {{is a key to}} transport improvement in Asian metropolises. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the current situation of these factors in some selected metropolises, namely Bangkok and Metro Manila. This paper comprises a) GIS-based land use analysis on the relationship between urbanization and transport infrastructure development, b) GPS-based travel behavior survey, and c) interview survey on residents' satisfaction with transport infrastructures and services. It was shown that the current land use patterns largely differ depending on the existence of agricultural infrastructure development in the pre-urbanized stage. It was also confirmed by a GPS-based travel survey that travel behavior patterns in <b>scattered</b> <b>development</b> areas are significantly different from those in orderly development areas. The former areas lack not only road space but also a structured hierarchy of networks, resulting in inefficient travel behaviors with low speed and detours. The GPS survey gave clearer pictures to grasp the relationship between travel patterns of residents and their demand for the improvement of local transport services. It was indicated that local governments who are responsible for these demands often fail to meet them due to financial and institutional limitations of the current system...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} induced by urban form {{as well as}} by global and {{regional}} changes. Scattered housing and sparse nuclei increase the impact of very heavy rains, high temperatures and drought. This article has three aims: (i) ascertain the recent changes of urban form in three cities of the Sahel; (ii) understand the consequences of scattered housing and sparse nuclei on the vulnerability to climate change; (iii) identify the measures to contrast the discontinuity of the urban form. The cases of Kébémer (estimated 27, 200 inhabitants/ 2013) and Louga (est. 96, 000 inhabitants/ 2013) in Senegal and Niamey (1 million inhabitants/ 2012) in Niger are analysed. The changes of urban form are observed by comparing two high spatial resolution satellite images taken in correspondence of the 2002 and 2012 / 13 censuses of the population. The nature of change is ascertained by overlapping the built-up area with the mosaic of the subdivision plans and infrastructural networks. Vulnerability is analysed in its three components: exposure, sensitivity, coping capacity. All three cities lose compactness in the densest part due to the persistence of vacant land. In Niamey, <b>scattered</b> <b>development</b> in the suburban wards is the visible result of an incessant production of formal subdivision plans that are much higher than the need for the entire next decade.

40|$|Concerning {{about the}} rapid urban growth in recent China, this study takes Beijing {{as a case}} and puts forward that urban sprawl can be {{measured}} from spatial configuration, urban growth efficiency and external impacts, and then develops a geo-spatial indices system for measuring sprawl, a total of 13 indicators. In order to calculate these indices, different sources data are selected, including land use maps, former land use planning, land price and floor-area-ratio samples, digitized map of the highways and city centers, population and GDP statistical data, etc. Various GIS spatial analysis methods are used to spatialize these indices into 100 m X 100 m cells. Besides, an integrated urban sprawl index is calculated by weight sum of these 13 indices. The application result indicates that geo-spatial indices system can capture most of the typical features and interior differentia of urban sprawl. Construction land in Beijing has kept fast growing with large amount, low efficiency and disordered spatial configuration, indicating a typical sprawling tendency. The following specific sprawl features are identified by each indicator: (1) typical spatial configuration of sprawling: obvious fragmentation and irregularity of landscape due to unsuccessful enforcement of land use planning, unadvisable pattern of typical discontinuous development, strip development and leapfrog development; (2) low efficiency of sprawl: low development density, low population density and economic output in newly developed area; and (3) negative impacts on agriculture, environment and city life. According to the integrated sprawl index, the sprawling amount {{in the northern part}} is larger than that in the southern, but the sprawling extent is in converse case; most sprawling area include the marginal area of the near suburbs and the area between highways, etc. Four sprawling patterns are identified: randomly expansion at urban fringe, strip development along or between highways, <b>scattered</b> <b>development</b> of industrial land, leapfrog development of urban residence and industrial area...|$|E
40|$|In {{the quest}} to reduce American {{automobile}} usage, critics have pointed to abundant and free parking as the root of a self-reinforcing pattern of <b>scattered</b> <b>development</b> {{that has led to}} a narcotic-like automobile dependency. Progressive planners maintain that the presence of parking is detrimental to creating efficient, compact communities. But history shows that's not necessarily so. In the 1940 s, Sears, Roebuck located some of its stores on streetcar lines and also provided parking on the roof, making the store accessible to both pedestrians and drivers. At the time, rooftop parking signaled a transition from density to sprawl, and from a transit-based transportation system to the auto. This thesis investigates whether this building typology can be used in reverse-to usher in another transition, this time revitalizing suburban settings toward compact development patterns that can support walkability and transit. Three contemporary urban examples, in Los Angeles, Cambridge, and Boston, illustrate the suburban center redevelopment potential of "upside-down" buildings, the top-heavy stacked construction that puts parking above retail. Initial findings suggest, first, that strategically designed parking can encourage people to park once and walk to multiple destinations. (cont.) This newly generated foot traffic contributes to a street vibrancy that is often lacking in car-de-pendent communities. Second, rooftop parking's strongest trait is also its weakest. Parking that is hidden above ground level gives pedestrians a primacy they lack in traditionally suburban streetscapes. But it can create a perception that there is a parking shortage, and can hinder the adoption of the transitional form to accommodate both cars and pedestrians. Third, parking above retail captures rising land values in a way that surface parking does not. The typology physically accommodates the added retail space that only becomes possible with vertical parking. In addition to making the streetscape more urbane, it pushes the real-estate value even higher. Unconventional urban design and land use can prepare the built environment for a time when there will be many viable transportation options. At the same time, it can aid planners and "Complete Streets" advocates who want to break the chicken-and-egg cycle of automobile dependence. by Stephanie Groll. Thesis (M. C. P.)
