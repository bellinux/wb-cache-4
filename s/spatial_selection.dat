40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} developing advanced selectivity and cost estimation techniques for query optimization in database systems. It addresses {{the following three}} issues related to cur-rent trends in database research: estimating the cost of <b>spatial</b> <b>selections,</b> building histograms without looking at data, and estimating the selectivity of XML path expressions. The {{first part of this}} dissertation deals with estimating the cost of <b>spatial</b> <b>selections,</b> or window queries, where the query windows and the data objects are general polygons. Previously proposed cost estimation techniques only handle rectangular query windows over rectangular data objects, thus ignoring the significant cost of exact geometry comparison (the refinement step in a “filter and refine” query processing strategy). The cost of the exact geometry comparison depends on the selectivity of the filtering step and the average number of vertices in the candidate objects identified by this step. We develop a cost model for <b>spatial</b> <b>selections</b> that takes these parameters into account. We also introduce a new type of histogram for spatial data that captures the size, location, and number of vertices of the spatial objects. Capturing these attributes makes this type of histogram useful for accurate cost estimation using our cost model...|$|R

In this paper, we focus on the efficient processing and optimization of complex spatial queries that involve combinations of <b>spatial</b> <b>selections</b> and joins. Our contribution is manifold; we first provide formulae that accurately estimate the selectivity of such queries. These formulae, paired with cost models for selections and joins can be used to combine spatial operators in an optimal way. Second, we propose algorithms that process <b>spatial</b> joins and <b>selections</b> simultaneously and are typically more efficient than combinations of simple operators. Finally we study the problem of optimizing complex spatial queries using these operators, by providing (i) cost models, and (ii) rules that reduce the optimization space significantly. The accuracy of the selectivity models and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms are evaluated through experimentation. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>selections</b> are a {{ubiquitous}} {{concept in}} visualization. By localizing particular features, {{they can be}} analysed and compared in different views. However, the semantics of such selections often depend on specific parameter settings {{and it can be}} difficult to reconstruct them without additional information. In this paper, we present the concept of contextual snapshots as an effective means for managing <b>spatial</b> <b>selections</b> in visualized data. The selections are automatically associated with the context in which they have been created. Contextual snapshots can also be used as the basis for interactive integrated and linked views, which enable in-place investigation and comparison of multiple visual representations of data. Our approach is implemented as a flexible toolkit with well-defined interfaces for integration into existing systems. We demonstrate the power and generality of our techniques by applying them to several distinct scenarios such as the visualization of simulation data, the analysis of historical documents and the display of anatomical data...|$|R
5000|$|Object-based attentional {{effects are}} {{attributed}} to the improved sensory representation of the object that results from attentional spread (an object-guided <b>spatial</b> <b>selection).</b> [...] When attention is directed to a location within an object, other locations within that object also acquire an attentional advantage (via enhanced sensory processing). Two or more features belonging to a single object are identified more quickly and more accurately than are features belonging to different objects. Attention to a single visual feature of an object, such as its speed of motion, results in an automatic transfer of attention to other task-relevant features, such as, colour. Studies measuring neuron response in animals provided evidence supporting the theory that attention spreads within an object.|$|E
50|$|A Top-down {{process is}} {{characterized}} by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition; Top-down processing is based on pre-existing knowledge when interpreting sensory information.Top-down guidance of attention refers to when the properties of an object (i.e. color, shape) are activated and held in working memory to facilitate the visual search for that object. This controls visual search by guiding attention only to objects that could be the target and avoiding attention on irrelevant objects. Top-down processes are not a complete representation of the object but are coarse, which is why objects similar in color, shape or meaning are often attended to in the process of discriminating irrelevant objects. There is evidence that observers have Top-down control over the locations that will benefit from biased competition in <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> visual tasks. Evidence supports that observers can make voluntary decision about which locations are selected. or features that capture the attention in a stimulus-driven manner.Neurophysiology studies have showed that the neural mechanisms in Top-down processing are also seen in attention and working memory, suggesting Top-down processes {{play an important role in}} those functions as well. Additionally, Top-down processes can modulate Bottom-up processes by suppressing the “pop-out” features of Bottom-up processing from distracting from the visual search.fMRI studies have investigated the Top-down and Bottom-up processes involved in biased competition theory. Results of fMRI suggest that both Bottom-up and Top-down processes work in parallel to bias competition. Multiple studies have shown that stimuli in the visual field suppress each other when presented together, but not when each stimulus is presented alone. Kastner and colleagues also found that directing attention to the specific location of a stimulus reduces the suppressive effect. Increased activity in the visual cortex was also observed; this was the result of Top-down biasing due to the favoring of the attended location.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of climate change and species invasions, range shifts {{increasingly}} gain attention because the rates at which they occur in the Anthropocene induce rapid changes in biological assemblages. During range shifts, species experience multiple selection pressures. For poleward expansions in particular, {{it is difficult to}} interpret observed evolutionary dynamics because of the joint action of evolutionary processes related to <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> and to adaptation toward local climatic conditions. To disentangle the effects of these two processes, we integrated stochastic modeling and data from a common garden experiment, using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. By linking the empirical data with those derived form a highly parameterized individual-based model, we infer that both <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> and local adaptation contributed to the observed latitudinal life-history divergence. <b>Spatial</b> <b>selection</b> best described variation in dispersal behavior, while variation in development was best explained by adaptation to the local climate.

The data set includes 60 studies, consisting of 3937 estimates of selection across an average of five populations. We performed meta-analyses to explore features characterising spatial variation in directional selection.

40|$|Selectivity {{estimation}} {{is crucial}} to query optimizers in choosing an optimal execution plan in a given spatial query, {{and there has been}} a great deal of focus on how to achieve good selectivity estimation for finer <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> operators. Equally crucial to this is understanding how to produce an updated spatial histogram. With this in mind, we used a cumulative annular bucket histogram (AB histogram), which not only accurately estimates the selectivity of a <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> or a spatial join operation with finer operators but also provides an updated spatial histogram to estimate the selectivity of subsequent spatial operations in a multi-level spatial query plan. A basic unit of AB histogram stores the number of minimum bounding rectangles whose lower left points and upper right points are located in specific rectangular regions. According to the basic units of a cumulative AB histogram, we can find out the selectivity of a <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> with a number of different finer operators. When it comes to spatial join operations, a relationship between two cumulative AB histograms can be translated into a relationship between one histogram and numerous query windows from the other histogram. Furthermore, an updated cumulative AB histogram can be simultaneously built into the process of selectivity calculation, making it possible to achieve both selectivity and an updated histogram of spatial join; its implementation made in the optimizer facility (OPF) of INGRES 9. 2. To highlight the performance of a cumulative AB histogram, several experiments have been conducted, with results showing that the cumulative AB histogram not only supports the selectivity estimation of <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> and spatial join with Disjoint', Intersect', Within', Contains', Crosses' and Overlap' operators but also supports the generation of an updated histogram.

We describe a simple yet efficient method to obtain reliable absorption spectra at sub micrometer spatial resolution for both non-fluorescent and fluorescent samples using a combination of a slit, TG and CCD detector coupled to an optical microscope. In this spectrally resolved optical microscopy (SROM) setup, the adjustable slit located before the TG enabled us to demonstrate that <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> greater than similar to 1 mu m is associated with a loss of spectral features, line broadening, and in certain situations, a shift in peak positions. We show that the use of near diffraction-limited slit-width is imperative for determination of reliable absorption profiles when a TG-CCD based spectrograph is used for spatially resolved spectroscopy measurements. The importance of high <b>spatial</b> <b>selection</b> in SROM becomes more apparent for heterogeneous samples with multiple absorbing species present in microscopically phase-separated regions, allowing for the identification of spectral signatures of individual components which cannot be resolved using ensemble measurements.

However, the bias was absent for the same displays when {{the identity of the}} odd-man-out target was known in advance. The authors propose that (a) top-down knowledge of a target feature supports grouping on this feature and (b) grouping links a peripheral target to central distractors expressing the same feature, increasing the attentional weighting afforded to the target and, consequently, facilitating its detection. The effects are independent of bottom-up priming effects occurring across trials.

As a result, the interest of users is not limited to simple <b>spatial</b> <b>selections</b> and joins, but complex query types that implicate numerous spatial inputs become more common.

In this article, we review pairwise spatial join algorithms and show how they can be combined for multiple inputs. In addition, we explore the application of synchronous traversal (ST), a methodology that processes synchronously all inputs without producing intermediate results. Then, we integrate the two approaches in an engine that includes ST and pairwise algorithms, using dynamic programming to determine the optimal execution plan. The results show that, in most cases, multiway spatial joins are best processed by combining ST with pairwise methods.

In this paper we present a new clustering-based method for similarity search called SSSTree.

SSS is able to adapt the set of selected points (pivots or cluster centers) to the intrinsic dimensionality of the space. Using SSS, the number of clusters in each node of the tree depends on {{the complexity of the}} subspace it represents. The space partition in each node will be made depending on that complexity, improving thus the performance of the search operation.
