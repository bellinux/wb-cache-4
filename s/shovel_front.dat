40|$|Abstract—The hourly {{production}} of machinery is generally {{one of the}} key factors in construction projects. In a construction plan, one should significantly concentrate on the type, number and schedule of presence of the machinery at the project site. This paper presents the hourly {{production of}} a model of a crawler-type <b>front</b> <b>shovel</b> at the site of several earth-fill dams in Iran. The data obtained from Caterpillar, Komatsu, and Hitachi manufacturers derive the nominal hourly production of the machine. The actual hourly production was calculated according to the statistical data from various earth-fill dams around Iran. The derived results showed that the crawler-type <b>front</b> <b>shovel</b> has a considerable difference in actual and nominal hourly production.

50|$|Outside {{the shovel}} {{a crew of}} four took up and laid the track along which its flanged wheels moved. They also set up the jackscrews {{necessary}} to stabilize the <b>shovel</b> in <b>front</b> of the rock face it was digging and dismantled them {{when it was time}} to move. This aspect of the excavation process proved to be time-consuming and labor-intensive, as well as dangerous, for such a large piece of machinery. In 1916 Marion began selling conversion kits to allow the shovel to be placed on caterpillar treads; seven years later the General Crushed Stone shovels were so modified.|$|R

He wore tightly-fitting leg coverings, a garment somewhat resembling a blouse of blue cloth girded in by a belt at the waist, and falling in folds to the knee. Over his shoulders hung a short mantle of orange colour with a hood. On his head was a cap with a wide brim that was turned up closely behind, and projected in a pointed <b>shovel</b> shape in <b>front.</b> In his belt was a small dagger. He wore shoes of light yellow leather fastened by bands over the insteps. As he ran down {{the steps of the}} palace he came into sharp contact with another page who had just turned the corner of the street.|$|R
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of open pit deposits usually takes place {{through a series}} of mining phases, commonly known as pushbacks. In open pit metalliferous mining, each pushback considers the extraction of one or more benches simultaneously in a process where the core operational tasks include: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In large open pit mines, <b>shovels</b> and <b>front</b> end loaders may be used to carry out loading activities. The type and number of shovels are selected during the planning process and their productivity determines the mining rate of the benches, pushbacks and the mine. The space available for loading is part of the pushback design. This defines the shape and size of the benches where the equipment will be placed. A relevant stage in mine design is the definition of the location and sequence that loading equipment must follow to deplete the benches of each pushback. The deployment of loading equipment in the mine is commonly referred to the scheme of exploitation. This term is widely used in the mining industry but not frequently referenced in the literature. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the concept of the scheme of exploitation in open pit mining within the context of the strategic mine planning activity. In the first part, the concept is presented through examples where the pushback size is fixed and the number of shovel is changed. The second part includes a discussion of the motivations and constraints that the mine planner may consider in the design. Configurations with several shovels and benches in a same pushback represent a challenge for the scheme design mainly due to the limitation of space for loading. Mathematical and optimisation tools can be useful in these cases; however, the models have to be able to represent the real constraints that will affect the productivity of the shovels in the different levels. In general, aggressive and costly schemes are rarely used by mining companies that seek high performance levels and lower operating costs. However, the selection of an appropriate scheme of exploitation needs to be aligned with the principal objective of the mine planning activity, which is to: create value through the {{exploitation of}} a mineral resource...|$|R
40|$|A {{manufacturing}} plant and process for production of oxygen {{on the moon}} uses lunar minerals as feed and a minimum of earth-imported, process materials. Lunar feed stocks are hydrogen-reducible minerals, ilmenite and lunar agglutinates occurring in numerous, explored locations mixed with other minerals in the pulverized surface layer of lunar soil known as regolith. Ilmenite (FeTiO. sub. 3) and agglutinates contain ferrous (Fe. sup. + 2) iron reducible by hydrogen to yield H. sub. 2 O and metallic Fe at about 700. degree. - 1, 200. degree. C. The H. sub. 2 O is electrolyzed in gas phase to yield H. sub. 2 for recycle and O. sub. 2 for storage and use. Hydrogen losses to lunar vacuum are minimized, with no net hydrogen (or any other earth-derived reagent) consumption except for small leaks. Feed minerals are surface-mined by <b>front</b> <b>shovels</b> and transported in trucks to the processing area. The machines are manned or robotic. Ilmenite and agglutinates occur mixed with silicate minerals which are not hydrogen-reducible at 700. degree. - 1, 200. degree. C. and consequently are separated and concentrated before feeding to the oxygen generation process. Solids rejected from the separation step and reduced solids from the oxygen process are returned to the mine area. The plant is powered by nuclear or solar power generators. Vapor-phase water electrolysis, a staged, countercurrent, fluidized bed reduction reactor and a radio-frequency-driven ceramic gas heater are used to improve thermal efficiency...|$|R
50|$|According {{to neighbors}} at around 2:00 AM {{on the morning}} of April 26, Marines {{allegedly}} pounded on the door of one of the village houses demanding a search. They asked the occupant, an alleged cousin of the victim, if he had any weapons. He had an AK-47 (each family in Iraq is allowed one rifle). They took the rifle and also a <b>shovel</b> resting in <b>front</b> of the house, so he says. At the Iraqi's house in question, the Marines broke into the home while the victim was sleeping and took him from the house, not searching his house afterward. The Marines then bound the man's hands using plastic restraints and forced him to walk a distance back to the ambush site. Once they arrived at the ambush site, the Marines bound (the autopsy was inconclusive and could not verify this) the man's feet and placed him into a hole from an old IED blast. The Marines then ran back to the area where the other members of their squad were standing and fired upon the man in the IED hole. While some Marines were shooting him with their rifles, other members of the squad were shooting the stolen AK-47 rifle into the air to make it sound like a firefight was occurring. After the Iraqi man was dead, the Marines scattered the expended AK-47 brass next to the body, removed the plastic restraints, and placed the AK-47 rifle next to the body.|$|R
40|$|Earthmoving is {{a common}} {{activity}} at mines, construction sites, hazardous waste cleanup locations, and road works. Expensive and sophisticated machines such as front-end-loaders (FEL), backhoe loaders, LHD loaders and <b>front</b> <b>shovels</b> are used for these excavation tasks. Autonomous excavation control for these machines has gained considerable attention in order to remove human operators from hazardous environments, improve productivity and utilization, reduce machine abuse, as well as decrease machine operating costs. However, automatic control of excavation tasks for many sites that require digging in rock cannot be implemented using existing factory-based automation techniques. For example, control of bucket motions by simply partitioning the terrain into a set of volumes where each equals the bucket capacity often does not work. Planning {{in this way is}} possible only when digging in the materials such as loose soils where bucket motion resistance through the media can be predicted. Resistance predictions are impossible and/or infeasible to generate for excavation in the environments which consists mainly of irregular rigid objects such as rock piles with oversized particles, since no means exists to predetermine subsurface bucket/material interactions that are required to preplan the bucket trajectory. As a result, bucket actions must be determined through on-line decision making based on sensory feedback of the current excavation status in the unpredictable, unstructured and dynamic rock excavation environment. This research proposes a control method for autonomous rock excavation. The control architecture is designed following the behavior-based control concept. That is, the rock excavation control problem is solved by decomposition of the complicated task into a variety of simple elements that can be implemented by excavation behaviors. However, this control approach presents a new structure and operational paradigm that is developed based on, but different from the traditional behavior control method. Here, the behaviors are chosen using fuzzy excavation situation assessment with guidance of excavation task planning which embodies excavation heuristics and human strategies. Task plans are formulated using finite state machines which integrate neural networks for decision making. This organizational structure has the capability to include more excavation goals and to adapt to different environments via learning. Excavation behaviors are performed by primitive and machine executable actions or action sequences structured using finite state machines and simple action arbitration rules. The actions of human FEL operators were observed and analyzed to extract basic bucket actions and define rules of arbitration for different actions or action sequences under particular excavation environments. Fuzzy logic is applied to implement each excavation action where fuzzy rules represent the human experience and heuristics that are intrinsically linguistic, and bucket excavation motions are evaluated based on insufficient and inaccurate input sensory data. A variety of experiments were performed to test the ability of the proposed control algorithm. The laboratory-based experimental autonomous excavation system consists of a robotic arm, an excavation testbed, a force/torque sensor mounted between the robot arm wrist and the excavation bucket, and a control computer. Various rock piles to simulate realistic excavation environments and conditions were generated in the testbed. With these experiments, the control algorithm has demonstrated the ability to execute real-time automated loading cycles effectively and efficiently in complex excavation environments and under difficult digging conditions, through the use of the flexible excavation behaviors...|$|R
