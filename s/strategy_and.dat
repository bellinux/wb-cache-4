40|$|The present {{research}} explored the metacognitive reading strategies used by university {{students and the}} correlation between metacognitive reading <b>strategies</b> (Global, Problem-Solving, <b>and</b> Support reading <b>strategies)</b> <b>and</b> reading comprehension. Specifically, the objectives of this research are four-folds, namely to identify metacognitive reading strategies used by the students during reading, to find the correlation between Global Reading <b>Strategies</b> (GLOB) <b>and</b> reading comprehension, to find the correlation between Problem-Solving Reading <b>Strategies</b> (PROB) <b>and</b> reading comprehension, and to find the correlation between Support Reading <b>Strategies</b> (SUPP) <b>and</b> reading comprehension. A survey on metacognitive reading <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> a reading comprehension test were administered to identify students’ metacognitive reading <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> comprehension performance. The subjects were 31 students of English Department at a university in Surabaya. The findings revealed that students preferred to use PROB reading strategies the most, followed by GLOB reading <b>strategies,</b> <b>and</b> SUPP reading <b>strategies.</b> This finding on prime preferences indicates that students {{had a tendency to}} concentrate and monitor their comprehension, particularly when they had difficulties in doing the reading test. In terms of correlation, the findings revealed that (1) a positive, moderate (at. 66) correlation between GLOB <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> reading comprehension, (2) a positive, strong correlation (at. 72) between PROB <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> reading comprehension, and (3) a positive, weak correlation (at. 26) between SUPP <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> reading comprehension. In general, the overall correlation between metacognitive reading <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> reading comprehension was positive and strong at. 79. The aforementioned correlation results tell us that students whose metacognitive reading awareness was high performed better in their reading comprehension than students whose metacognitive reading awareness was low...|$|R

5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E

40|$|Recent wide {{acceptance}} of e-Portfolios has occurred because researchers believe it helps promote students’ learning in higher education. This study uses goal orientation theory {{to investigate the}} relationship between goal orientations, metacognitive <b>strategies,</b> <b>and</b> enjoyment when students use e-Portfolio. This paper contributes to research by goal orientation, metacognitive <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> enjoyment to explain student learning behavior when using e-Portfolio to providing further evidence. A sample of 219 university students took part in this research to verify the proposed model. The study employs structural equation modeling with the LISREL to explain the model. The results show that students’ mastery goals for using e-Portfolio {{have a positive effect}} on their metacognitive <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> enjoyment. Performance-approach goals have a negative effect on metacognitive <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> a positive effect on enjoyment. Performance-avoidance goals {{have a positive effect on}} metacognitive strategies. Students’ enjoyment has a positive effect on their metacognitive <b>strategies,</b> <b>and</b> mastery goals can predict metacognitive strategies through enjoyment.
