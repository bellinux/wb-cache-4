5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preference of the builder. A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually {{the home of the}} local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} a good chance that an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

25|$|Three {{kinds of}} forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load {{refers to the}} weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a {{tendency}} to collapse <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.|$|E
25|$|The new Bourbon dynasty {{which had}} taken power in Naples in May 1734 {{probably}} regarded Pergolesi with suspicion {{because of his}} links with the aristocratic circles of the previous Austrian Viceroyalty.

25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1961 Act, {{the areas}} {{trustees}} could invest in {{were based on}} the Trustee Act 1925, which set up a [...] "Statutory Lists" [...] system. The list contained only those investments available at the Post Office, along with land. It did {{not take into account the}} deprecation of currency or inflation, meaning that if the trustees invested in stocks and shares they were at risk of losing money <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falling value of the pound sterling. As a result, even though the income from a trust might remain nominally constant, the real value of that income could be much reduced over the lifetime of the trust. This was recognised by lawyers, who had been advising their clients to structure trusts in such a way as to allow their trustees to invest in wider areas than the Statutory Lists. In 1952 the report of the Nathan Committee advocated reform, and the government published a White Paper on [...] "Government Policy on Charitable Trusts in England and Wales" [...] in 1955, which proposed a reform of the Statutory Lists system. This came about under the Variation of Trusts Act 1958, which allowed trustees to apply to the courts to widen their investment powers, a process that was expensive and slow.|$|E
