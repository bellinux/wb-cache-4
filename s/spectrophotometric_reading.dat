40|$|A major {{limitation}} of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M 27 -A methodology is reliable detection of amphotericin B (AMB) resistance. The results obtained by using Iso-Sensitest, a synthetic medium, to detect AMB resistance were analyzed and compared with those obtained with RPMI and antibiotic medium 3 (AM 3). The ability to detect AMB resistance with RPMI is not enhanced by using a higher inoculum, glucose supplementation at a final concentration of 20 g/liter, <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading,</b> or 24 h of incubation time. Testing using AM 3 and an inoculum of 103 CFU/ml detects resistance. Identification of resistant isolates is not improved by glucose supplementation, changes in reading method, or changes in incubation time. However, the use of AM 3 as assay medium and an inoculum of 105 CFU/ml did not allow detection of AMB resistance. Testing using Iso-Sensitest medium appears {{to be similar to}} AM 3 in detecting resistance. The most pronounced discrimination is achieved by testing in Iso-Sensitest supplemented with glucose and <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading</b> after 24 h of incubation.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility {{of a new}} standard for susceptibility testing of fermentative yeasts. This standard {{is based on the}} M 27 -A procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), but incorporates several modifications, including <b>spectrophotometric</b> growth-dependent endpoint <b>reading.</b> MethodsNine laboratories participated in the study. Common material lots were used to test six Candida species (one each of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. lusitaniae), and two quality control strains (C. krusei ATCC 6258 and C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019). Triplicate testing on three separate days was performed in microtiter format with RPMI– 2 % glucose, pH 7. 0. Flucytosine, fluconazole and itraconazole were tested. In total, 3888 MIC values were included in the analyses. Reproducibility was calculated by means of agreement (percentage of MICs within one two-fold dilution of the mode) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, maximum value of 1). ResultsThe average intra-laboratory agreements were 99 % and 96 % after 24 h and 48 h of incubation, respectively, with ICCs of 0. 98 and 0. 97 (P < 0. 05). Two strains exhibiting a trailing effect showed intra-laboratory agreement of 92 % and ICCs of < 0. 91 at 48 h. The inter-laboratory agreement was 94 % and 88 % after 24 h and 48 h, respectively, with ICCs of 0. 93 and 0. 91 (P < 0. 05). Lower values of agreement and ICCs were obtained for strains exhibiting trailing after 48 h of incubation. Itraconazole yielded the lowest values of reproducibility.

40|$|The {{presence}} of free haemoglobin in serum or plasma can markedly {{affect the outcome}} of laboratory tests. Normal concentrations of plasma haemoglobin in carefully obtained specimens are less than 0. 025 g/l. The {{presence of}} free haemoglobin in a sample increases the spectrophotometric absorbance of tests run at wavelengths within the absorbance range of haemoglobin (400 – 440 nm). Little {{is known about the}} effects of haemolysis on the determination of antithrombin levels in canine plasma samples. Two plasma pools, designated AT 100 and AT 70 were prepared. The AT 70 pool was prepared by diluting pooled plasma with 0. 9 % saline in a ratio of 7 : 3. A unit of whole blood was collected from a healthy donor animal. The erythrocytes were lysed by freezing and thawing. The solution was centrifuged, the supernatant collected and filtered using 1. 2 um and 0. 22 um filters sequentially to remove residual red cell stroma. The haemoglobin concentration of the solution was determined using a modification of the automated Drabkin method. Intermediate haemoglobin solutions of decreasing known concentrations were prepared by the addition of saline. The intermediate solutions were added to the plasma pools in a 1 + 9 manner and a series of samples were prepared with final calculated and measured haemoglobin concentrations of 0. 0; 0. 5; 1. 5; 2. 5; 3. 5; 4. 5 and 5. 5 g/l. The AT determinations were performed using a functional chromogenic assay and the <b>spectrophotometric</b> absorbances were <b>read</b> using a 405 nm filter, as specified. Increasing concentrations of haemoglobin resulted in a decrease in the AT value measured. A simple linear regression analysis was performed on both AT 70 and AT 100 using a two-step regression analysis. The slopes up to [Hb] 1. 5 g/l were not significant whereas the slopes at between [Hb] 1. 5 – 5. 5 g/l were significant (p< 0. 001). The slope equation for AT 100 was y= - 5. 742 X+ 115. 24 with R 2 = 0. 794 and for AT 70 was y = - 4. 2037 X + 66. 821, with R 2 = 0. 936. A conversion table was created by interpolation of data between these two lines. These results show that it is possible, using a conversion equation, to perform the AT assay in haemoglobinaenic serum, thus opening the way to further evaluation of the coagulation status in patients with haemolytic disease processes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Given the {{increasing}} number of antifungal drugs and the emergence of resistant Aspergillus isolates, objective, automated and high-throughput antifungal susceptibility testing is important. The EUCAST E. Def 9. 3 reference method for MIC determination of Aspergillus species relies on visual reading. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading</b> was not adopted because of concern that non-uniform filamentous growth might lead to unreliable and non-reproducible results. We therefore evaluated <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading</b> for the determination of MICs of antifungal azoles against Aspergillus fumigatus. METHODS: Eighty-eight clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were tested against four medical azoles (posaconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole) and one agricultural azole (tebuconazole) with EUCAST E. Def 9. 3. The visually determined MICs (complete inhibition of growth) were compared with spectrophotometrically determined MICs and essential (+/- 1 twofold dilution) and categorical (susceptible/intermediate/resistant or wild-type/non-wild-type) agreement was calculated. Spectrophotometric data were analysed with regression analysis using the Emax model, and the effective concentration corresponding to 5 % (EC 5) was estimated. RESULTS: Using the 5 % cut-off, high essential (92 %- 97 %) and categorical (93 %- 99 %) agreement (< 6 % errors) was found between spectrophotometric and visual MICs. The EC 5 also correlated with the visually determined MICs with an essential agreement of 83 %- 96 % and a categorical agreement of 90 %- 100 % (< 5 % errors).

In this work, we studied the impact of glucose supplementation, incubation time, agitation of the plates prior to reading, endpoint determination rule, visual versus <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading,</b> Candida species, and fluconazole MIC on the MIC of voriconazole for Candida isolates tested by using the microdilution format assay of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M 27 -A antifungal susceptibility testing methodology. For both voriconazole and fluconazole, a spectrophotometric endpoint of 50 % reduction in turbidity relative to the growth control correlated most closely with the NCCLS-defined visual endpoint of “prominent decrease in turbidity. ” Correlation was generally better after 24 h of incubation than after 48 h. Supplementation of the medium to contain 20 g of glucose/liter did not alter the MIC significantly but did enhance growth and simplify visual readings.

The fractional extraction and quantitative determination of pectins were performed on the total dietary fibre residue, following the procedure suggested by Robertson (1979). Total pectin content (TP), calculated as sum of the three fractions, ranged from 2. 4 to 49. 8 g/kg of dry matter. The variation coefficient of TP measurements repeated on the same foods were, on average, 2 %. Total pectin content was 49. 8 g/kg DM in dried beet pulp and averaged 33. 8 +/- 0. 3 g/kg DM in fruits and vegetables, 13. 2 +/- 8. 4 g/kg DM in legumes and tubers and only 2. 8 +/- 0. 5 g/kg DM in cereals. HM fraction prevailed in apple and pear samples (> 40 % of TP), while LM and protopectin largely prevailed in legumes and vegetables. A strong variability among foods was found for the TP/SDF ratio.

The influences of the end-point definition (partial or complete inhibition) and the mode of reading (visually or spectrophotometrically) were determined. Interactions between antifungal drugs were also evaluated by agar diffusion tests. Combinations of caspofungin with either amphotericin B or voriconazole were additive for all the isolates, and antagonism was not observed. The interaction between caspofungin and flucytosine was synergistic for 62 % of the isolates. In contrast, the interaction between voriconazole and flucytosine was never synergistic and antagonism was noted for 93 % of the isolates. The triple combination of caspofungin with flucytosine and amphotericin B was synergistic for all the isolates tested. The triple combination of caspofungin with flucytosine and voriconazole was also mostly synergistic; but complex interactions were obtained for some isolates, with synergy or antagonism depending on the concentrations of caspofungin and voriconazole.

The total starch content (TS) was determined directly by liquid chromatography (TS 1) and as sum of resistant and non-resistant starch using a specific enzymatic kit before the <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading</b> (TS 2). In vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) by pepsin-cellulase technique was also estimated.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the in vitro activity of posaconazole (Posa) with that of amphotericin B (AmB), itraconazole (Itra) and voriconazole (Vor) against A. fumigatus isolates according to NCCLS method (M 38 -P), and to compare visual and spectrophotometric readings for MIC determination. Methods. A total of 106 A. fumigatus isolates were selected as follows: 88 clinical isolates from colonized patients, 18 from patients with invasive aspergillosis and 7 environmental isolates. Their in vitro susceptibility was evaluated by the NCCLS microdilution method (M 38 -P) in RPMI 1640 medium. Determination of results was made by visual and spectrophotometric readings (630 nm) after 48 hours incubation at 35 degreesC. Three A. fumigatus reference strains (IHEM 5734, 6149 and 13935) were included as control. Results. 1. Geometric mean MICs/MIC 90 (microg/ml) obtained by visual reading were respectively 0. 66 / 1 (AmB), 0. 37 / 0. 5 (Itra), 0. 27 / 0. 5 (Vor) and 0. 02 / 0. 03 (Posa). 2. MIC values were comparable by spectrophotometric and by visual readings for all antifungal agents tested (p>. 05) and did not depend on the isolates origin (p>. 05). 3. Posaconazole had the lowest MICs (p< 0. 001). 4. The itraconazole-resistant reference strain did not give cross resistance with voriconazole and posaconazole.

This method is cumbersome and time-consuming and includes MIC endpoint determination by visual and subjective inspection of growth inhibition after 48 h of incubation. An alternative microdilution procedure was compared with the M 27 -P method for determination of the amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole susceptibilities of 8 American Type Culture Collection strains (6 of them were quality control or reference strains) and 50 clinical isolates of candida albicans. This microdilution method uses as culture medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 18 g of glucose per liter (RPMI- 2 % glucose). Preparation of drugs, basal medium, and inocula was done by following {{the recommendations of the}} National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The MIC endpoint was calculated objectively from the turbidimetric data read at 24 h. Increased growth of C. albicans in RPMI- 2 % glucose and its <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading</b> allowed for the rapid (24 h) and objective calculation of MIC endpoints compared with previous microdilution methods with standard RPMI 1640. Nevertheless, good agreement was shown between the M 27 -P method and this microdilution test. The MICs obtained for the quality control or reference strains by the microdilution method were in the ranges published for those strains. For clinical isolates, the percentages of agreement were 100 % for amphotericin B and fluconazole and 98. 1 % for flucytosine.

40|$|Este estudo teve como objetivo analisar o conteúdo de compostos {{antioxidant}}es (ácido ascórbico - AA, ácido desidroascórbico - ADA, vitamina C total, licopeno, β-caroteno, β-criptoxantina e estimativa de compostos fenólicos) e avaliar a atividade antioxidante, em goiaba, manga e mamão. A análise de carotenoides e vitamina C foi realizada por Cromatografia Líquida de Alta Eficiência (CLAE). O teor de fenólicos totais foi determinado utilizando o reagente de Folin-Ciocalteu e leitura espectrofotométrica. A atividade antioxidante foi avaliada pelo Teste do 2, 2 -diphenil- 2 -picril-hidrazil (DPPH•) e do Poder Redutor. A Anova (α = 0, 05) foi utilizada para a análise dos dados. Os teores dos constituintes antioxidantes diferiram entre as três frutas, mas a goiaba foi a fruta que apresentou teores mais elevados de compostos fenólicos, vitamina C total, ADA e licopeno, além dos maiores valores para atividade antioxidante. Foi constatada forte correlação entre os testes que avaliaram a atividade antioxidante e o teor de fenólicos totais, demonstrando serem estes os principais compostos antioxidantes a contribuírem para a atividade antioxidante das frutas analisadas, em ambos os testes. É importante incentivar a utilização das frutas avaliadas neste estudo, tanto em nível doméstico quanto em estabelecimentos de alimentação coletiva para aumentar o consumo de antioxidantes naturais pela população. This study {{aimed to}} analyze the content of antioxidant compounds (ascorbic acid - AA, dehydroascorbic acid - DHA, total vitamin C, lycopene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and phenolic compounds) and to evaluate the antioxidant activity in guava, mango and papaya. The analysis of carotenoids and vitamin C was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of phenolic compounds was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading.</b> Antioxidant activity was evaluated by testing the 2. 2 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazil (DPPH•) and reducing power. ANOVA was used for data analysis (α = 0. 05). The levels of antioxidant constituents differed among the three fruits; guava was the fruit that had {{the highest levels of}} phenolic compounds, total vitamin C, lycopene and DHA, and the highest values for antioxidant activity. There was a strong correlation between tests that evaluated antioxidant activity and the content of phenolic compounds, demonstrating that these are the main antioxidant compounds to contribute to antioxidant activity of fruits examined in both tests. It is important to encourage the use of fruits evaluated in this study, both at home and in food service establishments, in order to increase the intake of natural antioxidants by the population...|$|E
40|$|The susceptibilities of 25 {{clinical}} isolates {{of various}} Aspergillus species (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. ustus, and A. nidulans) to itraconazole (ITC) and amphotericin B (AMB) were determined using the standard proposed by NCCLS for antifungal susceptibility testing of filamentous fungi, {{a modification of}} this method using spectrophotometric readings, and a colorimetric method using the tetrazolium salt 2, 3 -bis { 2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -[(sulfenylamino) carbonyl]- 2 H-tetrazolium-hydroxide} (XTT). Five MIC end points for ITC (MIC- 0, no visible growth or ≤ 5 % the growth control value [GC]; MIC- 1, slight growth or 6 to 25 % the GC; MIC- 2, prominent reduction in growth or 26 to 50 % the GC; MIC- 3, slight reduction in growth or 51 to 75 % the GC; and MIC- 4, no reduction in growth or 76 to 100 % the GC) and one for AMB (MIC- 0) were determined visually by four observers and spectrophotometrically. The intraexperimental (between the observers) and interexperimental (between the experiments) levels of agreement of the NCCLS and XTT methods exceeded 95 % for MIC- 0 of AMB and MIC- 0 and MIC- 1 of ITC. The MIC- 2 of ITC showed lower reproducibility, although <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading</b> and/or incubation for 48 h increased the interexperimental reproducibility from 85 to > 93 %. Between visual and spectrophotometric readings, high levels of agreement were found for AMB (≈ 97 %) and MIC- 1 (≈ 92 %) and MIC- 2 (≈ 88 %) of ITC. Poor agreement was found for MIC- 0 of ITC (51 % after 24 h), since the spectrophotometric readings resulted in higher MIC- 0 values than the visual readings. The agreement was increased to 98 % by shifting the threshold level of MIC- 0 from 5 to 10 % relative optical density and by establishing an optical density of greater than 0. 1 for the GC as the validation criterion. No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the NCCLS method and the XTT method, with the levels of agreement exceeding 97 % for MIC- 0 of AMB and 83 % for MIC- 0, MIC- 1, and MIC- 2 of ITC. The XTT method and spectrophotometric readings can increase the sensitivity and the precision, respectively, of in vitro susceptibility testing of Aspergillus species...|$|E
40|$|Title A new genetically {{engineered}} human cell {{line for the}} in vitro characterization of biomaterials. Description In the dentistry and orthopaedic perspectives tissue engineering {{is focused on the}} development of innovative materials whose action consists in recruiting bone progenitor cells and in stimulating their proliferation. Doing so, they favourite the development of the tissue which should be replaced. In this context, it is clear that these materials should not only allow cells adhesion and proliferation, but also ensure that the attached cells will maintain the histological features of the original tissue. Careful attention should therefore be addressed to characterize the influence of the biomaterial on bone cells behaviour and, in turn, on bone tissue formation. The ultimate approach to define the above parameters is the in vivo testing, implanting the biomaterial in artificially induced bone injury in experimental animals. This is usually carried out after biophysical and biomechanical characterization of the new material, and assessment of bio-tolerability. This is determined as lack of cytotoxic and inflammatory reaction displayed by cells growing on the biomaterial. No further characterization of biomaterial/cells interaction are conducted in vitro, due to the unavailability of adequate cellular model. The proposed cellular model is suitable for the in vitro characterization of osteoinductive and osteogenic properties of biomaterials. We genetically modified a tumor derived cell line, which has been shown to maintain the osteoblastic phenotype and to posses unlimited growing potential in vitro. By stable transfection of an expression vector, containing as reporter gene the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we selected an immortal, genetically uniform clonal cell line, the Saos-EGFP. The engineered cell line Saos-EGFP maintains the histological features of osteoblast cells and constitutively expresses the EGFP. The presence of the heterologous protein does not perturb the physiological expression of molecular markers specific of the bone tissue. Comparative analysis carried out on parental and engineered cells demonstrated that both cell populations express molecular markers specific for bone tissue, such as osteocalcin and osteonectin, which belong to the extra cellular matrix proteins, necessary for bone tissue formation, produced by the osteoblasts. Furthermore, the distribution and cellular localization of the marker proteins were undistinguishable between parental and Saos-EGFP cells, indicating that functional properties were not altered. Another criteria of paramount importance in bone tissue histology is the cytoskeletal organization of cells. Studies have shown that the actin cytoskeletal element {{plays an important role in}} cell attachment and stabilization. Actin bundles coupled with adhesion plaques can transmit forces to the substrate and help to maintain cell shape and facilitate cell adhesion. Cytoplasmic actin fibers organization was not affected by the presence of the exogenous protein, since a prefect match in the cytoskeletal architecture between the two cell populations was observed. It was shown that the measure of EGFP fluorescence is proportional to the EGFP molecule number within each sample. This means that, having a genetically uniform clonal cell line, the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of cell within each sample. The high expression level of the trans-gene in the genetically modified cell line Saos-EGFP ensures a direct proportion between fluorescence intensity and cell number down to 5 x 103 cells per sample. This relationship is very useful to assess easily and quickly the number of cells within any sample, just determining the fluorescence intensity by a <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>reading.</b> Thank to the immortal phenotype, the proposed cell line can be mantanined indefinitelly using standard cell culture condition...|$|E
