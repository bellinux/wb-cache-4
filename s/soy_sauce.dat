5|$|Bacteria, often {{lactic acid}} bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, in {{combination}} with yeasts and moulds, {{have been used for}} thousands of years in the preparation of fermented foods, such as cheese, pickles, <b>soy</b> <b>sauce,</b> sauerkraut, vinegar, wine and yogurt.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and <b>soy</b> <b>sauce.</b> Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. <b>Soy</b> <b>sauce</b> has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E
5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment. In its place, condiments such as <b>soy</b> <b>sauce,</b> {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce {{tend to have a}} high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E
50|$|Stories began {{circulating}} {{in the press}} about cheap <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> made from human hair. These sauces were manufactured in China using a chemical amino acid extraction process similar to artificially hydrolyzed <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> and then quietly exported to other countries. An investigative report that aired on Chinese television exposed the unsanitary and potentially contaminated sources of the hair:In response, the Chinese government banned production of <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> made from hair. Other carcinogens remain; see 3-MCPD.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> {{made in the}} Japanese way or styled {{after them}} contain about 50% wheat.|$|R
50|$|Fermented bean pastes are {{sometimes}} the starting material used in producing <b>soy</b> <b>sauces,</b> such as tamari, or an additional product created {{from the same}} fermented mass.|$|R
5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (<b>soy</b> <b>sauce)</b> and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd-century-BCE {{tomb of the}} Lady Dai {{contained}} {{not only}} decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it. This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, <b>soy</b> <b>sauce,</b> and salt. Recipes in the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and <b>soy</b> <b>sauce.</b> Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze the determinant factors of intention of the food sellers in using  the traditional <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> for their products. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as approach to  explaine the intention as the major causal for the occurrence of a certain behavior. The research was conducted  in Bogor and involved the food sellers who were using the traditional <b>soy</b> <b>sauces.</b> The data collection was  conducted by personal interview of 102 respondents using quesionairres. The data was processed by the descriptive and the multiple linear regression methods. The result showed that the attitude toward behavior (A act)   and the perceived behavioral control (PBC) significantly affected the intention, while the subjective norm (SN) did  not significantly affect the intention. Based on the result, the determinant factors of intention for using the  traditional <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> were creating of profit, creating of food deliciousness, creating of welfare for local  communities, accceptable price, good quality, and easiness to get. </span...|$|R
50|$|Shōyu is {{traditionally}} divided into five main categories depending on {{differences in their}} ingredients and method of production. Most, but not all Japanese <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> include wheat as a primary ingredient, which tends {{to give them a}} slightly sweeter taste than their Chinese counterparts. They also tend towards an alcoholic sherry-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural preservative. The widely varying flavors of these <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> are not always interchangeable, some recipes only call for one type or the other, much as a white wine cannot replace a red's flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as fish stock.|$|R
50|$|Versions of char koay teow {{prepared}} by Muslims in Malaysia will exclude pork fat and may include extra <b>soy</b> <b>sauces</b> and spices {{and the use}} of broader-width flat rice noodles. There are also vegetarian varieties {{that may or may not}} include eggs.|$|R
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, <b>soy</b> <b>sauce,</b> oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and <b>soy</b> <b>sauce,</b> and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and <b>soy</b> <b>sauce.</b> Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
