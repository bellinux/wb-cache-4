40|$|In {{the first}} part the paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of the}} rural develoment theories from 50 s to nowadays. Consequently, in the second part, it is addressed the issue of how the transition from <b>subsistance</b> <b>economy,</b> to traditional economy, to agricultural economy, to rural economy could delineate virtuous processes of local development in specific contexts. This concept is futher developed in the third part, where territorial development is analysed in accordance with international studies, and more specifically with European ones, and in the forth where the topic is critically focused in the framework of the Brazilean literature. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, I {{argue that}} {{traditional}} business {{community in the}} Sirohi District of Rajasthan was the only community there to consider the local economic process in terms that approximate to Western Economic thought. Despite the fact that rural economy produced almost no surplus and used money only on a few occasions, {{it can not be}} said that it was simply a <b>subsistance</b> <b>economy.</b> It could be defined rather as a fully monetarised system but one where the use of money remained largely nominal because most transactions between economic agents took either the form of redistribution or the form of credit and debt relations. The local business community aplied a "rational" conception of economics based on the pursuit of long term equivalence between the production and the consumption of the different communities in the District. They could do so, firstly because they were the only ones to use the simple tools of monetary accountancy; and secondly because they had sociological knowledge of the behaviour of other communities. These two forms of knowledge enabled them to adjust the economic process to communities which did not themselves act according to a model of "rational" economic behaviour. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} sport in two small Ontario towns, Ingersoll and Woodstock, between 1838 and 1895. During this period urbanization and industrialization socially and structurally changed Ontario. Changes in sport illuminate structural changes in class, {{gender and age}} relations.;Before 1850 the towns had both similarities and differences. Their societies were pre-industrial, parochial, and constrained by a <b>subsistance</b> <b>economy.</b> Sport was informal and communal, bound by kinship and neighborhood. Unlike Ingersoll, Woodstock had a group of retired British officers who viewed England 2 ̆ 7 s gentry as its reference. They engaged in exclusive gentry sport to express their social station.;By 1853 railway communications ended both towns 2 ̆ 7 inland isolation. Each {{was transformed into a}} complex urban-industrial centre. In the process their subsistance class and Woodstock 2 ̆ 7 s gentry class declined in importance; a middle class of merchants, professionals, and artisans, and an unskilled wage-earning class arose; and gender, age-group, and social class relationships became more differentiated.;Sport also changed. Gentry sport disappeared with Woodstock 2 ̆ 7 s officers and traditional sports gradually yielded to highly regulated team sports. While nominally open to anyone, team sports excluded both workers, who lacked time and financial resources to participate, and females. Inter-urban competition broke down earlier parochialism and sport became increasingly disorderly: rowdyness marked civic holiday celebrations, and gaming, professionalism, and rigged competition plagued horseracing, Caledonian competition, and team sports.;Faced with rowdyness and disorder, middle class males expressed their newly-felt social prominence by reforming sport through amateurism, muscular Christianity, and institutionally regulating civic holiday celebrations and ongoing competition. They achieved only partial success. Certain groups, such as juveniles, professional athletes, gamblers, and workers, resisted their efforts.;A demon from within also checked their success. If reform led the middle class to embrace amateurism and muscular Christianity, competitiveness led them to marry inter-urban team sport to boosterism. Focusing on winning over playing the game escalated levels of competition, and subsequently professionalism, betting, and player and spectator violence crept back into sport. In the heady atmosphere of nineteenth century urban boosterism, the middle class notion of playing for 2 ̆ 2 the love of the game and the honour of the town 2 ̆ 2 did not comfortably fit...|$|E
