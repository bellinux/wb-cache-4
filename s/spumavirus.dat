40|$|The genome of the feline {{foamy virus}} (FeFV) isolate FUV was {{characterized}} by molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of subgenomic proviral DNA. The overall genetic organization of FeFV and protein sequence comparisons of different FeFV genes with their counterparts from other known foamy viruses confirm that FeFV is a complex foamy virus. However, significant differences exist when FeFV is compared with primate foamy viruses. The FeFV Gag protein is smaller {{than that of the}} primate <b>spumaviruses,</b> mainly due to additional MA/CA sequences characteristic of the primate viruses only. Gag protein sequence motifs of the NC domain of primate foamy viruses assumed to be involved in genome encapsidation are not conserved in FeFV. FeFV Gag and Pol proteins were detected with monospecific antisera directed against Gag and Pol domains of the human foamy virus and with antisera from naturally infected cats. Proteolytic processing of the FeFV Gag precursor was incomplete, whereas more efficient proteolytic cleavage of the pre 125 Pro-Pol protein was observed. The active center of the FeFV protease contains a Gln that replaces an invariant Gly residue at this position in other retroviral proteases. Functional studies on FeFV gene expression directed by the promoter of the long terminal repeat showed that FeFV gene expression was strongly activated by the Bell/Tas transactivator protein. The FeFV Bell/Tas transactivator is about one-third smaller than its counterpart of primate <b>spumaviruses.</b> This difference is also reflected by a limited sequence similarity and only a moderate conservation of structural motifs of the different foamy virus transactivators analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Mapping of {{transcripts}} {{of the human}} foamy virus genome {{was carried out in}} permissive human embryonic fibroblast cells by Northern blot hybridization and S 1 nuclease analysis. Since several splice sites that are localized within a relatively narrow genomic region were detected, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed, and cloning and sequencing of the splice site junctions of the corresponding viral cDNAs were subsequently performed. All <b>spumavirus</b> transcripts have a common but relatively short leader RNA. Genomic, singly spliced env mRNAs and several singly and multiply spliced subgenomic transcripts were identified. The multiply spliced viral mRNAs consist of various exons located in the central or 3 ' part of the viral genome. At least four novel gene products, termed Bet, Bes, Beo, and Bel 3, are predicted to exist. The poly(A) addition site that defines the boundary of the R and U 5 region in the 3 ' long terminal repeat was determined. The pattern of <b>spumavirus</b> splicing is more complex than that of oncoviruses and more similar to that of lentiviruses. One of the characteristic features of <b>spumavirus</b> transcription is the existence of singly spliced bel 1 and bel 2 mRNAs that alternatively are multiply spliced, thereby generating a complexity comparable to, but different from, that of lentiviruses and from that of other known retroviruses.

Proteases from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, equine infectious anaemia virus, human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 and human <b>spumavirus</b> were produced and were shown to cleave their cognate Gag substrates produced in trans. Analysis of cross reactivity revealed that lentivirus proteases cleaved only entivirus Gag proteins and oncovirus proteases acted primarily on oncovirus Gag proteins. The HIV- 2 protease cleaved the HIV- 1 Gag precursor almost as efficiently as HIV- 1 protease. Expression of the 5 ' end of the human <b>spumavirus</b> polgene revealed that it encodes afunctional protease that acts specifically on the human <b>spumavirus</b> Gag polyprotein.

X-ray crystal structures of functional spumaviral intasomes were previously revealed to harbor a homotetramer of integrase, and it was generally believed that integrase tetramers catalyzed the integration of other retroviruses. The elucidation of new structures from four different retroviruses over the past year has however revealed this is not the case. The number of integrase molecules required to construct the conserved intasome core structure differs between viral species. While four subunits suffice for <b>spumaviruses,</b> α- and β-retroviruses require eight and the lentiviruses use up to sixteen.

The splice donor and splice acceptor sites of the subgenomic mRNA responsible for Pro-Pol protein expression were identified by nucleotide sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs. The leader exon of the feline foamy virus is 57 nucleotides long. The splice acceptor of the subgenomic pol mRNA was found to be located in gag.

In contrast, infection of recovered amnion (RA) aneuploid cells resulted in a persistent infection with less than 100 p. f. u. /ml infectious virus produced. The decreased sensitivity of RA cells to the <b>spumavirus</b> was not due to the failure of virus to penetrate into the cell since infectious virus was not produced even after transfection of infectious proviral DNA. The effect of 5 -azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methylation, on virus replication was examined. Whereas virus production i HFDL cells was not affected, there was a 100 -fold increase in virus yield in RA cells treated with the drug for at least 48 h and maximum virus yields were obtained 4 days post-infection. The human syncytium-forming virus (HSFV) is a <b>spumavirus</b> of the family Retroviridae (Achong et al., 1971). While the other subfamilies of the Retroviridae, the oncoviruses and lentiviruses, have been studied comprehensively in many laboratories, the spumaviruses (also called foamy viruses), in contrast, have not been characterized in detail.

40|$|Spumaviruses {{are complex}} retroviruses whose {{replication}} cycle {{resembles that of}} hepadnaviruses, especially by a late-occurring reverse transcription step. The possible existence of an early reverse transcription as observed in other retroviruses was not documented. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we addressed directly the kinetics of DNA synthesis during <b>spumavirus</b> infection. An early phase of viral DNA synthesis developed until 3 h postinfection, followed by a second phase, culminating 10 h postinfection. Both phases were abolished by the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine. Similar to other retroviruses, circular forms of viral DNA harboring two long terminal repeats were mainly found in the nucleus of infected cells. Interestingly, a fraction of these circular forms were detected in the cytoplasm and in extracellular virions, a feature shared with hepadnaviruses. Combined with packaging of both viral DNA and RNA genomes in virions, early and late reverse transcription might allow <b>spumavirus</b> to maximize its genome replication...|$|E

40|$|The APOBEC 3 {{cytidine}} deaminases {{are part}} of the intrinsic defense of cells against retroviruses. Lentiviruses and <b>spumaviruses</b> have evolved essential accessory proteins, Vif and Bet, respectively, which counteract the APOBEC 3 proteins. We show here that Bet of the Prototype foamy virus inhibits the antiviral APOBEC 3 C activity by a mechanism distinct to Vif: Bet forms a complex with APOBEC 3 C without inducing its degradation. Bet abolished APOBEC 3 C dimerization as shown by coimmunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments. These findings implicate a physical interaction between Bet and the APOBEC 3 C. Subsequently, we identified the Bet interaction domain in human APOBEC 3 C in the predicted APOBEC 3 C dimerization site. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Bet inhibits incorporation of APOBEC 3 Cs into retroviral particles. Bet likely achieves this by trapping APOBEC 3 C protein in complexes rendering them unavailable for newly generated viruses due to direct immobilization...|$|R
40|$|Gag {{proteins}} play {{an important}} role in many stages of the retroviral replication cycle. They orchestrate viral assembly, interact with numerous host cell proteins, engage in regulation of viral gene expression, and provide the main driving force for virus intracellular trafficking and budding. Foamy Viruses (FV), also known as <b>spumaviruses,</b> display a number of unique features among retroviruses. Many of these features can be attributed to their Gag proteins. FV Gag proteins lack characteristic orthoretroviral domains like membrane-binding domains (M domains), the major homology region (MHR), and the hallmark Cys-His motifs. In contrast, they contain several distinct domains such as the essential Gag-Env interaction domain and the glycine and arginine rich boxes (GR boxes). Furthermore, FV Gag only undergoes limited maturation and follows an unusual pathway for nuclear translocation. This review summarizes the known FV Gag domains and motifs and their functions. In particular, it provides an overview of the unique structural and functional properties that distinguish FV Gag proteins from orthoretroviral Gag proteins...|$|R

FV vectors had a distinct integration profile relative to other types of retroviruses. They did not integrate preferentially within genes, despite a modest preference for integration near transcription start sites and a significant preference for CpG islands. The genomewide distribution of FV vector proviruses was nonrandom, with both clusters and gaps.

Until now, available structural information {{was limited to the}} INs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), avian sarcoma virus (ASV) and their close orthologs from the Lentivirus and Alpharetrovirus genera. Here, we characterized the in vitro activity of the prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN from the <b>Spumavirus</b> genus and determined the three-dimensional structure of its catalytic core domain (CCD). Recombinant PFV IN displayed robust and almost exclusively concerted integration activity in vitro utilizing donor DNA substrates as short as 16 bp, underscoring its significance as a model for detailed structural studies. Comparison of the HIV- 1, ASV and PFV CCD structures highlighted both conserved as well as unique structural features such as organization of the active site and the putative host factor binding face.

The genome of simian foamy virus type 1 (SFV- 1), an isolate from rhesus macaques, has been molecularly cloned, {{and the role of the}} viral long terminal repeat (LTR) in transcriptional control has been investigated. The SFV- 1 LTR is 1, 621 base pairs long, and sequence comparisons with human foamy virus revealed a pattern of clustered homology. A cap site in the LTR was identified by analysis of SFV- 1 transcripts in infected cells. Transient expression assays in cell lines representing several species and different cell types showed that the SFV- 1 LTR has low basal activity in uninfected cells, whereas LTR-directed expression is greatly increased in cells infected with SFV- 1. This transactivation is mediated by a mechanism involving increases in steady-state levels of viral transcripts. Thus, the SFV- 1 genome encodes a transactivator that functions on the LTR at the transcriptional level...|$|E
40|$|Recent discoveries {{indicate}} that the foamy virus (FV) (<b>Spumavirus)</b> ancestor may {{have been among the}} first retroviruses to appear during the evolution of vertebrates, demonstrated by foamy endogenous retroviruses present within deeply divergent hosts including mammals, coelacanth, and ray-finned fish. If they indeed existed in ancient marine environments hundreds of millions of years ago, significant undiscovered diversity of foamy-like endogenous retroviruses might be present in fish genomes. By screening published genomes and by applying PCR-based assays of preserved tissues, we discovered 23 novel foamy-like elements in teleost hosts. These viruses form a robust, reciprocally monophyletic sister clade with sarcopterygian host FV, with class III mammal endogenous retroviruses being the sister group to both clades. Some of these foamy-like retroviruses have larger genomes than any known retrovirus, exogenous or endogenous, due to unusually long gag-like genes and numerous accessory genes. The presence of genetic features conserved between mammalian FV and these novel retroviruses attests to a foamy-like replication biology conserved for hundreds of millions of years.

Mutational analyses demonstrated that the PFV IN contains a potent but non-transferable nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its C-terminal domain and contains five arginine and lysine residues between amino acids 308 and 329 that are critical for its NLS function. Foamy viruses (FVs), also called <b>spumaviruses,</b> are members of the retroviral family Retroviridae.

Previous work indicated that HFV extracellular particles contain apparently full-length double-stranded DNA, as well as RNA. We have further characterized the amount of DNA in particles and the role that this DNA has in viral replication.

To use a recombinant viral vector to express FCoV proteins, the agent chosen should be apathogenic and replication incompetent within the host following gene delivery. <b>Spumaviruses</b> confer several advantages over the more traditionally explored retro-viral vectors.

Necropsy specimens were collected from 14 West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) from three communities in the Taı ̈ National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. PCR analysis revealed SFV-related int- and env-specific sequences in 12 / 14 chimpanzees. Two young chimpanzees were not infected. Plasma from ‘PCR-positive ’ chimpanzees reacted against Pr 71 / 74 gag in Western blot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of all analysed sequences with SFVcpz previously identified from the other P. troglodytes verus, although interestingly the sequences were diverse and no grouping according to a particular animal community was observed. The body compartments of two infected animals were examined and found to contain SFV sequences. Frequent SFV infections in chimpanzees from this area significantly increase the potential risk of zoonotic transmission to rural populations through direct contact, hunting and consumption of bush meat.

The analysis employs a cophylogeny mapping technique, implemented in TREEMAP v 2. 0, to find the most parsimonious combinations of evolutionary events able to reconcile any incongruence. This technique is guaranteed to recover all potentially optimal solutions to the reconciled tree and specifically tests the null hypothesis that an associate phylogeny is no more congruent with a host phylogeny than would a random tree with the same taxon set. Phylogenies for Hantavirus, <b>Spumavirus</b> and avian sarkoma leukosis virus were found to be significantly similar to their host trees, whilst Lyssavirus and Arenavirus displayed no significant congruence.

Both HFV and HBV express their Pol proteins independently from the structural proteins. However unlike HBV, Pol is not required for assembly of HFV core particles or for packaging of viral RNA. These {{results suggest that the}} assembly of Pol into HFV particles must occur by a mechanism different from those used by retroviruses and hepadnaviruses. We have examined possible mechanisms for HFV Pol incorporation, including the role of proteolysis in assembly of Pol and the role of initiation of reverse transcription. We have found that proteolytic activity is not required for Pol incorporation. p 4 Gag and the residues immediately upstream of the cleavage site in Gag are also not important.

Retroviral NC proteins are formed of either one or two CCHC zinc finger(s) flanked by basic residues and have nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker properties essential for virus replication. Interestingly, the GAG protein of a number of retroelements including <b>Spumaviruses</b> does not possess the hallmarks of retroviral GAGs and in particular lacks a canonical NC protein. In an attempt to search for a nucleic acid chaperone activity in this class of retroelements we used the yeast Ty 1 retrotransposon as a model system. Results shows that the C-terminal region of Ty 1 GAG contains a nucleic acid chaperone domain capable of promoting the annealing of primer tRNA(i) (Met) to the multipartite primer binding site, Ty 1 RNA dimerization and initiation of {{reverse transcription}}. Moreover Ty 1 RNA dimerization, {{in a manner similar to}} Ty 3 but unlike retroviral RNAs, appears to be mediated by tRNA(i) (Met). These findings suggest that nucleic acid chaperone proteins probably are general co-factors for reverse transcriptases. The reverse transcription process for retroviruses and retrotransposons {{takes place in a}} nucleocore structure in the virus or virus-like particle. In retroviruses the major protein of the nucleocore is the nucleocapsid protein (NC protein), which derives from the C-terminal region of GAG. Retroviral NC proteins are formed of either one or two CCHC zinc finger(s) flanked by basic residues and have nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker properties essential for virus replication.

40|$|<b>Spumaviruses,</b> {{commonly}} called foamy viruses (FV), are complex retroviruses that establish lifelong persistent infections without any accompanying pathologies. In tissue culture, cells {{can be either}} lytically or latently infected, depending on cell type. Regulation of FV replication is controlled by two promoters: the LTR and a second promoter within the env gene termed the internal promoter (IP). The IP directs expression of the transcriptional activator, Tas, and a second accessory protein, Bet, whose function has been elusive. In this study, we report that expression of exogenous Tas is sufficient to initiate a switch from latent to lytic replication. We also show that treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) can {{lead to an increase}} in transcription from the IP, and that Bet protein expression abrogates this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that Bet expression severely limits the ability of PMA to activate transcription of latent FV genomes, and that replication of a Bet(-) virus is more easily activated than wild-type FV. Taken together, these data suggest that viral transcription is regulated by a sensitive switch, and that Bet functions as a negative regulator of basal IP activity...|$|R
40|$|Although foamy viruses (<b>Spumaviruses)</b> have {{repeatedly}} been isolated from both healthy and diseased cats, cattle, and primates, the primary {{mode of transmission}} of those common viruses remains undefined. A database of the feline foamy virus (FeFV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibody status, age, and sex of 389 domestic cats presented to veterinarians was assembled. A similar database for 66 feral (wild) cats was also assembled. That FeFV antibody status reflects infection was validated by PCR. Both FeFV and FIV infection rates were found to gradually increase with age, and over 70 % of cats older than 9 years were seropositive for FeFV. In domestic cats, the prevalence of FeFV infection was similar in both sexes. In feral cats, FeFV infection was more prevalent in female cats than in male cats. Although both FeFV and FIV {{have been reported to}} be transmitted by biting, the patterns of infection observed are more consistent with an interpretation that transmission of these two retroviruses is not the same. The prevalence of FIV infection is highest in nondesexed male cats, the animals most likely to display aggressive behavior. The gradual increase in the proportion of FeFV-infected animals is consistent with transmission of foamy viruses by intimate social contact between animals and less commonly by aggressive behavior...|$|R
