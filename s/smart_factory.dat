50|$|In {{the context}} of {{manufacturing}} ecosystems, a <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> could relate to a way to enhance the collective and individual capabilities of manufacturing companies to foster growth and competitiveness by providing integration and alliance between partners and systems when they collaborate in an open innovation ecosystem where competences and technologies are mutually shared. The organization and management of a <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> {{should be based on}} in-depth technological understanding as well as clear rules and procedures regarding knowledge sharing and potential disclosure in this open innovation environment (Bogers et al. 2012). This could be either related to open networks of wireless connected devices operating without direct human interaction, or to an organization where interconnection between different actors chosen to collaborate is more physical.|$|E
50|$|Industry 4.0 is {{a project}} in the {{high-tech}} strategy of the German government that promotes the computerization of traditional industries such as manufacturing. The goal is the intelligent factory (<b>Smart</b> <b>Factory)</b> that is characterized by adaptability, resource efficiency, and ergonomics, {{as well as the}} integration of customers and business partners in business and value processes. Its technological foundation consists of cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things.|$|E
30|$|The {{insights}} {{gained by}} the sensitivity analysis demonstrate {{the importance of}} the utilization as an influencing factor. We were able to show that the threat potential increases with an increasing utilization because risk reduction effects, such as the compensation ability, decrease gradually. Considering the high utilization of <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> through automation and optimization technologies as key benefits, the threat potentials posed by IT availability risks will be rather high in <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> (Radziwon et al. 2014; Schuh et al. 2014).|$|R

The equipment would then be transferred from the <b>Smart</b> <b>factory</b> to a former Dunlop tyre factory in Coventry where the Roadster would be built under the MG brand. It was understood that Project Kimber was being funded by Grant Gazdig's Access-Capital firm, as well as a private equity firm called European American Securities. Barrie Wills, another key member of Project Kimber, formerly of Jaguar, Reliant Scimitar and DeLorean, and founder of de Montfort Resources which held the Agreements with Smart.|$|E
5000|$|One {{previous}} {{definition of}} an advanced manufacturing enterprise is the [...] "intensified application of advanced intelligence systems to enable rapid manufacturing of new products, dynamic response to product demand, and real-time optimization of manufacturing production and supply-chain networks (SMLC 2011)." [...] This idea is represented by a <b>Smart</b> <b>Factory</b> that relies on interoperable systems; multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation; intelligent automation; scalable, multilevel cyber security; and networked sensors. Such enterprises utilize data and information throughout the entire product life cycle {{with the goal of}} creating flexible manufacturing processes that respond rapidly to changes in demand at low cost to the firm, {{as well as to the}} environment. These processes facilitate the flow of information across all business functions inside the enterprise and manage the connections to suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders outside the enterprise.|$|E
30|$|Of course, {{there are}} other {{influencing}} factors aside from utilization and loss potentials, such as the <b>smart</b> <b>factory’s</b> network structure, and the interference degrees of IT components.

40|$|Part 3 : Cyber-Physical (IIoT) Technology Deployments in Smart Manufacturing SystemsInternational audienceLean Production {{has proven}} to be a {{valuable}} methodology to improve productivity while reducing costs. Notwithstanding the countless successful lean implementations in the extant literature, others highlight its limitations, especially in production environments characterized by demand volatility, high product mix and reduced lot sizes. Technology is seen by many as a potential solution to such limitations, especially in the last years, with Industry 4. 0 becoming an emerging frontier for the <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> of the future. However, studies about the relationship between lean and smart manufacturing are scarce and often anecdotal. Therefore, the proposed work aims to fill this gap by developing a comprehensive model that links these two perspectives and serves practitioners to achieve lean’s core goals in <b>smart</b> <b>factories...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{real and}} the virtual worlds are growing speedily and closely {{to form the}} Internet of Things (IoT). In fact, IoT has stimulated the {{factories}} and the governments to launch an evolutionary journey toward the fourth industrial revolution called Industry 4. 0. Industrial production of the new era will be highly flexible in production volume and customization, extensive integration between customers, companies, and suppliers, and above all sustainable. Reviewing and analyzing the current initiatives and related studies of the smart factories/Industry 4. 0, this paper presents a reference architecture for IoT-based <b>smart</b> <b>factories,</b> defines the main characteristics of such factories {{with a focus on}} the sustainability perspectives. And then it proposes an approach for energy management in <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> based on the IoT paradigm: a guideline and expected benefits are discussed and presented...|$|R
5000|$|EXAPTpdo (EXAPT ProductionsDataOrganization) {{provides}} a neutrally applicable technology {{platform for the}} information compound of the NC planning - to the shop floor. This applies to all NC production data which are necessary for the set-up of NC machines, for the provision, presetting and stocking of manufacturing resources and provided by EXAPTpdo in a central database. Beside classical functions of the tool management system (TMS) as the management of cutting tools, measuring, testing and clamping devices the technology data management and tool lifecycle management (TLM) is also included. System-supported [...] "where-used lists" [...] help to handle the manufacturing resource cycle by secured requirement determination and requirement fulfillment. Unnecessary transports and unplanned dispositive adjustments are dropped, stocks are reduced, set-up times reduced and the throughput is increased. EXAPTpdo synchronizes involved systems within the value chain. Stock systems, MES systems or ERP systems (e.g. from the purchasing or production areas) do not work in isolation from each other but they interact with each other. EXAPTpdo provides the base to <b>Smart</b> <b>Factory,</b> for more flexibility in production and a faster communication.|$|E

The <b>Smart</b> <b>Factory</b> approach is an new dimension of multi-scale manufacturing by using the stat-of-the-art ubiquitous/pervasive computing technologies and tools. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Factory</b> represents a context-sensitive manufacturing environment that can handle turbulences in real-time production using decentralized information and communication structures for an optimum management of production processes.

30|$|The {{insights}} {{gained by}} the loss potential sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the underestimation or overestimation of loss values has a greater effect on the model’s results in application scenarios with high utilizations. Therefore, considering the probable high utilization of <b>smart</b> <b>factories,</b> the loss potential estimation’s accuracy is of crucial importance for risk quantification to derive accurate results.|$|R
30|$|The risk {{quantification}} approach determines the unprocessed units {{caused by the}} non-availability of an IT component based on the <b>smart</b> <b>factory’s</b> dependency structure.

40|$|The {{development}} and implementation of the last technological progresses is driving an evolution in different areas, making many of our daily tasks easier. In the production field the progress of new technological systems such as Cyber-­Physical Systems or Internet of Things is helping to create the so-called ‘factories of the future’, also known as <b>Smart</b> <b>Factories.</b> Some governmental initiatives developed in several countries are encouraging the implementation of these technologies in industry. This paper describes the main characteristics of Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things and <b>Smart</b> <b>Factories,</b> as well as clears up the relation established between these concepts. It also explains the main objectives of the Industry 4. 0 initiative, developed by the German government; and takes also an in-­ depth look at the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) initiative, promoted by the U.

Results reveal that two <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> concepts are significantly and positively related to the firm performance when e-learning is applied...|$|E
3000|$|Another {{shortcoming}} of {{the current}} literature {{is the lack of}} a common definition of the term <b>smart</b> <b>factory,</b> although widely used in both scientific literature and practice (Radziwon et al. 2014). Based on a collection of different definitions, Radziwon et al. (2014) define the <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> as a “manufacturing solution that provides such flexible and adaptive production processes that will solve problems arising on a production facility […].” Hermann et al. (2015) define the <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> as a “factory where CPS communicate over the IoT and assist people and machines in the execution of their tasks”. They further describe, that “within the modular structured Smart Factories […], CPS monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions”. Based on SmartFactoryKL and adopting the idea of IoT, Zuehlke (2010) describes that a “factory-of-things will be composed of smart objects which interact based on semantic services.” Yoon et al. (2012) describe a <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> as a “factory system in which autonomous and sustainable production takes place”. And Lucke et al.

30|$|A decisive lever for the IT {{security}} {{strategy is}} the degree of interconnectedness within the <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> information network. Companies {{are faced with the}} question of where interconnectedness makes sense and creates added value and where air gaps should be deliberately made or redundancies should be created. For this, our approach provides a risk-oriented guidance for the solid design of <b>smart</b> <b>factory</b> information networks.|$|E
5000|$|Interesting {{results have}} already been proven in real situations. Korean {{government}} has just announced the raise of a 57.5 billion $ for building <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> this year after that 1240 Korean smart SMEs have showed [...] "a 27.6% decrease in fraction defective, a cost reduction of 29.2% and a 7.1% reduction in {{the length of time}} taken for prototype production".|$|R
40|$|While {{digitization}} {{as well as}} {{new technologies}} and paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) help solving issues within <b>smart</b> <b>factories,</b> they simultaneously trigger new challenges. The creation of <b>smart</b> <b>factories,</b> whose components communicate in an intelligent manner, is located at the frontier of the virtual and the real world. To connect both worlds, spatio-temporal information can be used to structure and integrate data streams, models and other content such as documents in Enterprise Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). One part of Enterprise SDIs is building information, to support and enhance contextualization of indoor environments and its corresponding information in form of sensor measurements and other digital resources. We identified five major requirements: (1) Three-dimensionality, (2) (Re-) use of available data, (3) Use of GIS-principles and standards, (4) Adaptivity, and (5) Completeness. Our novel approach “OLS 3 D” addresses these requirements through the use of SDI-principles and linked-data strategies. A prototypical implementation was developed in order to show the potential of our approach...|$|R

5000|$|Industry 4.0 creates {{what has}} been called a [...] "smart factory". Within the modular {{structured}} <b>smart</b> <b>factories,</b> cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions.

30|$|Due to {{the large}} number of {{possible}} IT security measures, these must be assessed in an economically sound manner, taking into account the cost–benefit aspect and its effect on the overall system. For this, our structured approach helps to assess risks associated with the ever increasing interconnection within <b>smart</b> <b>factories,</b> to assess where interconnections and dependencies should be deliberately avoided and where redundancies should be deliberately created, e.g., by means of backup servers or cloud-based modules.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSmart {{factories}} Industry 4. 0 on {{the basis}} of collaborative cyber-physical systems represents a future form of industrial networks. Supply chains in such networks have dynamic structures which evolve over time. In these settings, short-term supply chain scheduling in <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> Industry 4. 0 is challenged by temporal machine structures, different processing speed at parallel machines and dynamic job arrivals. In this study, for the first time, a dynamic model and algorithm for short-term supply chain scheduling in <b>smart</b> <b>factories</b> Industry 4. 0 is presented. The peculiarity of the considered problem is the simultaneous consideration of both machine structure selection and job assignments. The scheduling approach is based on a dynamic non-stationary interpretation of the execution of the jobs and a temporal decomposition of the scheduling problem. The algorithmic realisation is based on a modified form of the continuous maximum principle blended with mathematical optimisation. A detailed theoretical analysis of the temporal decomposition and computational complexity is performed. The optimality conditions as well as the structural properties of the model and the algorithm are investigated. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed...|$|R
