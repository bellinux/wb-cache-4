5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of <b>spondyloarthropathy.</b> Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

50|$|HLA-B27 is {{associated}} with the <b>spondyloarthropathies,</b> a group of disorders that includes ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory joint diseases. Some of these diseases are associated with a common skin condition called psoriasis or chronic inflammatory bowel disorders (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). One of the <b>spondyloarthropathies,</b> reactive arthritis, is typically triggered by bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal or genital tract. Following an infection, affected individuals may develop arthritis, back pain, and eye inflammation.

500|$|Previously it {{had been}} {{suggested}} that the fusion {{of the first three}} neck vertebrae, such as seen in the mature specimen MOR571, might have been a paleopathology, an instance of the disease <b>spondyloarthropathy,</b> but in 1997 it was concluded that it was more likely a normal ontogenetic trait, the vertebrae growing together to form a so-called [...] "syncervical" [...] to support the heavy head. All three main known specimens have syncervicals consisting of three fused neck vertebrae; the trait could have been inherited from a smaller ancestor using a stiffer neck for burrowing or food acquisition.|$|E

40|$|Arthralgias and <b>spondyloarthropathies</b> of the {{peripheral}} and axial joints {{are common in}} inflammatory bowel disease. Evidence for a strong association between these clinical manifestations and diseases of the joints has been provided by several clinical and epidemiological studies.

The role of the ubiquitous bacterial flora and pathogenic microorganisms present in the intestinal lumen may induce these joint diseases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this review we will focus on the pathogenesis of <b>spondyloarthropathies</b> and arthralgia in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.

40|$|Abstract: Spine {{involvement}} is less common in Reiter's syndrome {{than in other}} seronegative <b>spondyloarthropathies.</b> Also, cervical spine involvement rarely occurs in Reiter's syndrome and other <b>spondyloarthropathies.</b> This paper reports a rare case of Reiter's syndrome {{in which there was}} cervical spine involvement that presented clinically as an atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation. Reiter's Syndrome (RS) {{is one of the most}} common types of seronegative <b>spondyloarthropathies</b> (SSAs) that presents clinically with a triad of symptoms, i. e., conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis. This case highlighted the importance of radiographs of the lateral cervical spine and dynamic cervical imaging for all patients who have Reiter's syndrome with cervical spine symptoms to ensure that this dangerous abnormality is not overlooked...|$|R
