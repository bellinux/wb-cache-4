For comparison, an extra sample was prepared by directly depositing a droplet of the GNP sol onto an ITO glass substrate, and GNPs remained {{on the surface of}} the substrate after evaporating the sol under ambient conditions. FESEM observations (not shown in figure) were carried out at the same positions on the substrates both before and after applying 5 -min ultrasonication on the GNP thin films and the reference one.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to deposit nanocrystalline stainless steel onto steel substrates (homometallic) for enhanced wear and corrosion resistance. Homometallic coatings provide <b>superior</b> <b>adhesion,</b> {{and it has been}} shown that ultrafine-grained materials exhibit the increased hardness and decreased permeability desired for protective coatings. Nanocrystals will be produced by controlling nucleation and growth and use of an ion beam during deposition by e-beam evaporation or sputtering.

These coatings exhibit hardnesses comparable to those normally obtained for ceramic coatings such ZrO 2, and possess the <b>superior</b> <b>adhesion</b> of seamless, homometallic coatings. Hardening the surface with a similar material also enhances adhesion, by avoiding problems associated with thermal and lattice mismatch. So far we have deposited nanocrystalline homometallic 316 L stainless steel coatings by varying the ions and the current density of the ion beams. For all deposition conditions we have produced smooth, uniform, superhard coatings. All coatings exhibit hardness of at least 200 % harder than that of bulk materials. Our measurements indicate that there is a direct relationship between nanohardness and the current density of the ion beam. Stress measurements indicate that stress in the films is increasingly proportional to current density of the ion beam.

Using self-assembled mono layer (SAMs) of known {{physical and chemical properties}} on molecularly smooth gold substrates in 5 mM NaCl at pH 7. 3, (1) the adsorption mechanisms of the barnacle inspired peptides are explored using quartz crystal microbalance, and (2) adhesion mediating properties are measured using the surface force apparatus. The hydrophobic Bp 1 peptide with a cysteine residue adsorbs irreversibly onto Au surfaces due to thiol bond formation, while on hydrophobic CH 3 SAM surface, the interactions are hydrophobic in nature. Interestingly, Bp 2 that contains both hydrophobic and protonated amine units exhibits asymmetric bridging with an exceptionally high adhesion energy up to 100 mJ/m(2) between mica and both gold and CH 3 SAM. Surprisingly on hydrophilic surfaces such as COOH- or OH-SAMs both peptides fail to show any interactions, implying the necessity of surface charge to promote bridging.

40|$|A pack {{diffusion}} {{process has been}} developed which permits the introduction of nearly 6 wt % Al into solid solution in the near surface region of TDNiCr (Ni- 20 wt % Cr- 2 vol % ThO 2) and Ni- 20 Cr. Alumina scales, adherent under cyclic heating and cooling conditions, were produced on TDNiCr- 5. 86 Al upon exposure to an environment of 1330 N/sq m (10 torr) or 101, 000 N/sq m (760 torr) air at temperatures of 1093 and 1204 C. While the same oxidation kinetics were observed in isothermal tests for Ni- 14. 6 Cr- 5. 86 Al as were obtained for the TDNiCr- 5. 86 Al, the dispersion-strengthened alloy exhibited <b>superior</b> oxide scale <b>adhesion</b> during cyclic testing. At 1204 C, continuous weight gains were observed under all test conditions for TDNiCr- 5. 86 Al, {{in contrast to the}} weight loss with time which occurred several hours after exposure of TDNiCr to an oxidizing environment. TDNiCr with an initial aluminum surface concentration of 4. 95 wt % has nearly comparable oxidation resistance to the TDNiCr- 5. 86 Al alloy...|$|R
40|$|Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films {{demonstrated}} significant {{advantages in}} cutting and forming non-ferrous materials. The ultra-low friction coefficient and high surface hardness make DLC {{one of the}} most promising surface modification technologies available for processing advanced structural materials. In this study, Ti-doped and hydrogen-free DLC films (a-C:Ti) were synthesized by unbalanced magnetron sputtering of Ti and graphite targets. The high residual stress of the DLC thin films was dissipated through a compound interface;consisting of a series of Ti, TiN, and TiC(x) N(y) graded interlayers. The target poisoning problem was resolved with a 2 kHz medium-frequency DC power supply. In addition, a 20 - 100 kHz variable frequency DC power supply was used for both are suppressing and substrate biasing. The effects of deposition parameters on film qualities were investigated by SEM/EDS, XRD, EELS and wear tests. Results demonstrated an improved DLC thin film with <b>superior</b> microhardness and <b>adhesion</b> strength compared with the conventional DLC deposited by PVD or PECVD processes.
