40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{question}} of solar periods in absorption, the pattern was studied of the solar Lyman-alpha radiation (the principal ionizing agent of the lower ionosphere) and of the radio wave absorption at five widely <b>spaced</b> <b>places</b> in Europe. When the solar Lyman-alpha flux variability is very well developed, then it dominates in the lower ionospheric variability. The most pronounced Lyman-alpha variation on time scale day-month is the solar rotation variation (about 27 days). When the Lyman-alpha variability is developed rather poorly, as it is typical for periods dominated by the 13. 5 day variability, then the lower ionospheric variability appears {{to be dominated by}} variations of meteorological origin. The conclusions hold for all five widely spaced placed in Europe...|$|E

The possibility of changing meaning is significant in that new meanings open doors to different choices—and living choices is living health. While reflecting upon the focus of this column—that is, the possibility of changing meaning in light of space and place—as I ran through a forest in the heart of Toronto, I heard a noise. In that moment, I thought that this very sound, just a week prior, had alarmed me when I was hiking and ca-noeing with my family through the Rockie Mountains in Al-berta, Canada.
