No men were considered to be professional. However, the 1881 Census was the first Census to introduce women's occupations. One woman was considered a professional, twenty five worked in Domestic Services or Offices, one was a Dress Worker whilst thirty one women were not considered to have a specified occupation and a further 17 women had an unknown occupation. The occupations of residents who live in Pettistree has changed over the years and in the 2011 Census there were 92 economically active residents and 55 economically inactive residents. However, 33 of the economically inactive residents were retired. The industry which employs {{the greatest number of}} people in Pettistree is Health and Social Work Activities with 12% of total residents working in this sector. In addition, the second most popular industry was Public Administration and Defence, employing a total of 10.9% of people. However, there were 3 sectors in which no residents were employed; they were Mining and Quarrying, Water Supply; Sewerage Waste Management and Remediation Activities and Gas, Electricity, <b>Steam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Conditioning</b> Supply.|$|E

Large eddy simulation coupled with a Lagrangian bubble tracking routine are used in this work to study the dynamics of microbubbles in vertical channel upflows and downflows of water at shear Reynolds numbers of 150 and 590. A dynamically calibrated Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model was used with the large eddy simulation, and a stochastic Markov model was employed {{to account for the}} effect of the subgrid-scale velocity fluctuations on bubble dispersion. The microbubbles, of diameters 110 and 220 μm, were uniformly dispersed within the flows, momentum coupled with the fluid, and subjected to drag, lift, pressure gradient, gravity/buoyancy and added mass forces. Predictions were validated against direct numerical simulations for a limited number of cases, showing good agreement. Predictions are used to understand the effect of the microbubbles’ presence on the fluid flow and the turbulence in the continuous field. Microbubbles concentration profiles are analysed, with microbubbles segregating at the wall in upflow and moving towards the channel centre in downflow. The different forces acting on the bubbles and the effect of the turbulence on the bubble concentration are also considered...|$|R

DOE has been funding Direct FuelCell{reg_sign} (DFC{reg_sign}) development at FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE) for stationary power plant applications. The program efforts are focused on technology and system optimization for cost reduction leading to commercial design development and prototype system field trials. FCE, Danbury, CT, is a world-recognized leader for the development and commercialization of high efficiency fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the customer, including hospitals, schools, universities, hotels and other commercial and industrial applications. FuelCell Energy has designed three different fuel cell power plant models (DFC 300, DFC 1500 and DFC 3000). FCE's power plants are based on its patented Direct FuelCell technology, where the fuel is directly fed to fuel cell and hydrogen is generated internally. These power plants offer significant advantages compared to existing power generation technologies [...] higher fuel efficiency, significantly lower emissions, quieter operation, flexible siting and permitting requirements, scalability and potentially lower operating costs. Also, the exhaust heat by-product can be used for cogeneration applications such as high-pressure <b>steam,</b> district heating, <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Several FCE sub-megawatt power plants are currently operating in Europe, Japan and the US. Because hydrogen is generated directly within the fuel cell module from readily available fuels such as natural gas and waste water treatment gas, DFC power plants are ready today and do not require the creation of a hydrogen infrastructure. Product improvement progress made during the reporting period in the areas of technology, manufacturing processes, cost reduction and balance of plant equipment designs is discussed in this report. FCE's DFC products development has been carried out under a joint public-private effort with DOE being the major contributor.

40|$|AbstractWhether it is {{analyzed}} from {{a classical}} or modern perspective, corporate profitability evolution represents a benchmark for current and potential capital providers of companies. This study performs a comparative {{analysis of the}} evolution of profitability of Romanian companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange in a period fully affected by the manifestation of the global financial crisis, i. e. 2009 - 2013. Thus, there were selected 35 companies listed on BSE, which are representative for eight sectors of the Romanian economy, of the total 10 existing in the national capital market, i. e. Mining and quarrying, Manufacturing, Electricity, gas, and air conditioning supply, Constructions, Wholesale and retail trade, Transportation, Storage, Professional, scientific and technical activities. Thus, half of the sectors to which the analyzed companies belong to have not seen a dramatic drop in profitability in the period studied. However, a visible manifestation of the financial crisis took place in 2011 in the sectors of Electricity, gas, <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> supply, Professional, scientific and technical activities and Constructions. By contrast to the first two of these, in the constructions sector, profitability evolves in increasingly negative {{over the next two years}} of analysis.

40|$|Carbon dioxide, {{the famous}} and vital to life gas, {{is also an}} {{important}} greenhouse gas. Since the combustion of fuels leads to the production of carbon dioxide it had to be expected that since the industrial revolution the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was to be rapidly increased. When the consequences and the causes of the greenhouse effect were understood, serious efforts were made by the global community to reduce the greenhouse gases production and CO 2 among them. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, commits State Parties, also EU among them, to reduce the greenhouse gases by setting internationally binding emission reduction targets. The first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012 and had as goal an average 5 % reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, whereas during the second commitment period (2013 - 2020) the parties committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 18 % below the 1990 levels. Greenhouse gas emissions in the EU- 28 in 2013 stood at 4611 million tones of CO 2 and the fuel combustion and the fugitive emissions were responsible for the 57. 2 % of the carbon dioxide production. The electricity, gas, <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> supply activities account for the 26. 6 % of the emissions. Therefore it can be easily understood that the power plants is an important sector in CO 2 production and therefore their carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) process is one of the available solutions to reduce the greenhouse gases. With CCS it is possible to capture the CO 2 waste from large point sources and to transport it and deposit to a storage site, usually to a geological formation. This way the carbon dioxide can be prevented from getting released into the atmosphere. Within the framework of this thesis only the capture process of this method is to be examined. More specifically this thesis project involves research over a mature technology for CO 2 capture, able to be adapted at plants exhaust gases. This technology is carbon dioxide absorption. The research on CO 2 absorption today appears to focus mostly on power plants gases as the gases production of power plants are increased in comparison to other plants. It is indicated that using the classic solvents - amines for the CO 2 absorption system results to a significant amount of energy consumption for the solvents regeneration. The purpose of this thesis is to search over the biphasic solvents as an alternative option to amines for the CO 2 capture system and state the pros and cons mainly from the energy aspect. It is expected that the biphasic solvents contribute to energy reduction of the system as the solvents are separated into two phases after the absorption, giving the capability to remove the water phase from the absorption column and as a result use less energy in the regeneration column...|$|E
