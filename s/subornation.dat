25|$|Pharaoh {{is set in}} the Egypt of 108785 BCE as {{that country}} {{experiences}} internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom. The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge the powers that be are vulnerable to co-option, seduction, <b>subornation,</b> defamation, intimidation and assassination. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1906, {{new changes}} were brought against all Spade {{officials}} for [...] "conspiracy to defraud {{the government of}} the title and use of public lands, <b>subornation</b> of perjury, and conspiracy to suborn perjury". The case was called to trial on November 12, 1906, in the Federal District Court in Omaha before Judge William H. Munger. Richards and Comstock did not testify. United States Secret Service men spent 13 months investigating and getting evidence. Affidavits were taken from 600 witnesses, subpoenas were issued for 165 witnesses, and 132 people offered evidence in trail.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and <b>subornation</b> of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E

60|$|Indeed when I saw the Proceedings {{against this}} poor Man run to a heighth so extravagant and monstrous, when I found Malice, Forgery, <b>Subornation,</b> Perjury, and a {{thousand}} unjustifiable Things which their own Sense, if they had any, might ha' been their Protection against, and which any Child in the Moon might ha' told them must one time or other come upon the Stage and expose them; I began to think these People {{were all in the}} Crolian Plot too.|$|E

Oh, you Englishmen, I ask you how does this <b>subornation</b> show in one of yourselves, who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours, and to your children's and your children's children's?' ...|$|E
60|$|But, by the way; why {{are these}} idle people so indiscreet to name those two words, which afford {{occasion}} of laying open to the world such an infamous scene of <b>subornation</b> and perjury, as well as calumny and informing, as I believe is without example: when a whole cabal attempted an action, wherein a condemned criminal refused to join with them for the reward of his life?[7] Not that I disapprove their sagacity, who could foretell so long before, by what hand they should one day fall, and therefore thought any means justifiable by which they might prevent it.|$|E
6000|$|That paper {{mentions}} [...] "such {{persons to}} have been examined, who were desirous and willing to be heard upon that subject." [...] I am told, they were four in all, Coleby, Brown, Mr. Finley the banker, and one more whose name I know not. The first of these was tried for robbing the Treasury in Ireland, and although he was acquitted for want of legal proof, yet {{every person in the}} Court believed him to be guilty. The second was tried for a rape, and stands recorded in the votes of the House of Commons, for endeavouring by perjury and <b>subornation,</b> to take away the life of John Bingham, Esq.[3] ...|$|E

I ain't goin' to be {{unreasonable}} with you. Make it worth my while, and I'll keep the thing close. Let Mr. Arthur take his seat, and his rich wife, if you like; I don't want to marry her.

60|$|Here {{is another}} discovery, my Lords. When he {{recalled}} Mr. Bristow, {{he did it}} under the pretence of its being desired by the Nabob of Oude; and that, consequently, he would not keep at the Nabob's court a man that was disagreeable to him. Yet, when the thing comes to be opened, it appears that Mr. Middleton had made the Nabob, unwillingly, write a false letter. This <b>subornation</b> of falsehood appears also to {{have been known to}} Mr. Hastings. Did he, either as the natural guardian and protector of the reputation of his fellow-servants, or as the official administrator of the laws of his country, or as a faithful servant of the Company, ever call Mr. Middleton to an account for it? No, never. To everybody, therefore, acquainted with the characters and circumstances of the parties concerned, the conclusion will appear evident that he was himself the author of it. But your Lordships will find there is no end of his insolence and duplicity.|$|E
60|$|Another {{method by}} which the meanest wicked man, may have it {{in his power to}} injure the public, is false accusation, whereof this kingdom hath afforded too many examples: Neither is it long since no man, whose {{opinions}} were thought to differ from those in fashion, could safely converse beyond his nearest friends, for fear of being sworn against, as a traitor, by those who made a traffic of perjury and subornation; by which the very peace of the nation was disturbed, and men fled from each other as they would from a lion or a bear got loose. And, it is very remarkable, that the pernicious project now in hand to reduce us to beggary, was forwarded by one of these false accusers, who had been convicted of endeavouring, by perjury and <b>subornation,</b> to take away the lives of several innocent persons here among us; and, indeed, there could not be a more proper instrument for such a work.|$|E
60|$|Secondly: Fear {{and hope}} {{are the two}} {{greatest}} natural motives of all men's actions: But, neither of these passions will ever put us {{in the way of}} virtue, unless they be directed by conscience. For although virtuous men do sometimes accidentally make their way to preferment, yet the world is so corrupted, that no man can reasonably hope to be rewarded in it, merely upon account of his virtue. And consequently, the fear of punishment in this life will preserve men from very few vices, since some of the blackest and basest do often prove the surest steps to favour; such as ingratitude, hypocrisy, treachery, malice, <b>subornation,</b> atheism, and many more which human laws do little concern themselves about. But when conscience placeth before us the hopes of everlasting happiness, and the fears of everlasting misery, as the reward and punishment of our good or evil actions, our reason can find no way to avoid the force of such an argument, otherwise than by running into infidelity.|$|E
60|$|However, {{although}} {{virtue and}} innocence are no infallible defence against perjury, malice, and <b>subornation,</b> {{yet they are}} great supports for enabling us to bear those evils with temper and resignation; {{and it is an}} unspeakable comfort to a good man under the malignity of evil mercenary tongues, that a few years will carry his appeal to an higher tribunal, where false witnesses, instead of daring to bring accusations before an all-seeing Judge, will call for mountains to cover them. As for earthly judges, they seldom have it in their power; and, God knows, whether they have it in their will, to mingle mercy with justice; they are so far from knowing the hearts of the accuser or the accused, that they cannot know their own; and their understanding is frequently biassed, although their intentions be just. They are often prejudiced to causes, parties, and persons, through the infirmity of human nature, without being sensible themselves that they are so: And therefore, although God may pardon their errors here, he certainly will not ratify their sentences hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Barsad," [...] he went on, in {{the tone}} of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: [...] "Sheep of the prisons, {{emissary}} of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of <b>subornation</b> in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?" ...|$|E
60|$|And here, my Lords, I {{would wish}} to say {{something}} of the miserable situation {{of the people of}} that country; but it is not in my commission, and I must be silent, and shall only request your Lordships to observe how this crime of bribery grows in its magnitude. First, the bribe is taken, through Gunga Govind Sing, from this infant, for his succession to the zemindary. Next follows the removal from their offices, and consequent ruin, of all his nearest natural relations. Then the delivery of the province to Debi Sing, upon the pretence of the arrears due to the Company, with all the subsequent horrors committed under the management of that atrocious villain. And lastly, the gross <b>subornation</b> of perjury, in making this wretched minor, under twelve years of age, bear testimony upon oath to the good qualities of Mr. Hastings and of his government,--this minor, I say, who lived three hundred miles from the seat of his government, and who, if he knew anything at all of his own affairs, must have known that Mr. Hastings was the cause of all his sufferings.|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--of course not; one doesn't wish {{to get at}} them," [...] {{said the}} gentleman from the club,--"particularly as we are safe without them." [...] Then he went into statistics, and succeeded in proving to Sir Thomas {{that there would be}} a hard fight. Sir Thomas, who was much pressed as to time, took a day to consider. [...] "Did Mr. Griffenbottom intend to fight the battle with clean hands?" [...] The gentleman from the club was eager in declaring that {{everything}} would be done in strict accordance with the law. He could give no guarantee as to expenses, but presumed it would be about £300,--perhaps £400,--certainly under £500. The other party no doubt would bribe. They always did. And on their behalf,--on behalf of Westmacott and Co.,--there would be treating, and intimidation, and <b>subornation,</b> and fictitious voting, and every sin to which an election is subject. It always was so with the Liberals at Percycross. But Sir Thomas might be sure that on his side everything would be--"serene." [...] Sir Thomas at last consented to go down to Percycross, and see one or two of his proposed supporters.|$|E
60|$|I had {{the curiosity}} to inquire in a {{particular}} manner, by what methods great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and prodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period: however, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to give no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be told, that I do {{not in the least}} intend my own country, in what I say upon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called up; and, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy, that I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness. Perjury, oppression, <b>subornation,</b> fraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were among the most excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave, as it was reasonable, great allowance. But when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy, or incest; others, to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters; others, to the betraying of their country or their prince; some, to poisoning; more to the perverting of justice, in order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that profound veneration, which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.|$|E
6000|$|And here it may {{be worth}} observing how {{unanimous}} a concurrence there is between some persons once in great power, and a French Papist; both agreeing in the great end of taking away Mr. Harley's life, though differing in their methods: the first proceeding by <b>subornation,</b> the other by violence; wherein Guiscard {{seems to have the}} advantage, as aiming no further than his life; while the others designed to destroy at once both that and his reputation. The malice of both against this gentleman seems to have risen from the same cause, his discovering designs against the government. It was Mr. Harley who detected the treasonable correspondence of Gregg, and secured him betimes; when a certain great man who shall be nameless, had, out of the depth of his politics, sent him a caution to make his escape; which would certainly have fixed the appearance of guilt[14] upon Mr. Harley: but when that was prevented, they would have enticed the condemned criminal with promise of a pardon, to write and sign an accusation against the secretary. But to use Gregg's own expression, [...] "His death was nothing near so ignominious, as would have been such a life that must be saved by prostituting his conscience." [...] The same gentleman lies now stabbed by his other enemy, a Popish spy, whose treason he has discovered. God preserve the rest of her Majesty's ministers from such Protestants, and from such Papists! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grey, {{who was not}} so blind as Augustus thought him, saw a {{great deal}} of this. Augustus {{suspected}} him as well as the squire. His mind went backward and forward on these suspicions. It was more probable that the squire should have contrived all this with the attorney's assistance than without it. The two, willing it together, might be very powerful. But then Mr. Grey would hardly dare to do it. His father knew that he was dying; but Mr. Grey had no such easy mode of immediate escape if detected. And his father was endowed with a courage as peculiar as it was great. He did not think that Mr. Grey was so brave a man as his father. And then he could trace the payment of no large sum to Mr. Grey,--such as would have been necessary as a bribe in such a case. Augustus suspected Mr. Grey, on and off. But Mr. Grey was sure that Augustus suspected his own father. Now, of one thing Mr. Grey was certain:--Augustus was, in truth, the rightful heir. The squire had at first contrived to blind him,--him, Mr. Grey,--partly by his own acuteness, partly through the carelessness of himself and those in his office, partly by the <b>subornation</b> of witnesses who seemed to have been actually prepared for such an event. But there could be no subsequent blinding. Mr. Grey had a well-earned reputation for professional acuteness and honesty. He knew {{there was no need for}} such suspicions as those now entertained by the young man; but he knew also that they existed, and he hated the young man for entertaining them.|$|E
