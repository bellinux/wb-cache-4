5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and <b>social</b> <b>thought,</b> and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, the {{university}}'s fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; {{the university}} underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football {{from the university}} {{in an attempt to}} emphasize academics over athletics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core, and organized the university's graduate work into four divisions. In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university. During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students. Also, the Committee on <b>Social</b> <b>Thought,</b> an institution distinctive of the university, was created.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsidiarity}} principle resolves some {{of these}} issues. The term originates from <b>social</b> <b>thought</b> within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve an issue that can be resolved at a more local level. It {{can be compared to}} federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy.|$|E

The present {{study investigated the}} role of <b>social</b> threat <b>thoughts</b> and <b>social</b> skills perception in relation to childhood trait and state social anxiety. In total, 141 children varying in their levels of social anxiety performed a short speech task {{in front of a}} camera and filled out self-reports about their trait social anxiety, state anxiety, social skills perception and <b>social</b> threat <b>thoughts.</b> Results showed that <b>social</b> threat <b>thoughts</b> mediated the relationship between trait social anxiety and state anxiety after the speech task, even when controlling for baseline state anxiety. Furthermore, we found that children with higher trait anxiety and more <b>social</b> threat <b>thoughts</b> had a lower perception of their social skills, but did not display a social skills deficit. These results provide evidence for the applicability of the cognitive social anxiety model to children...|$|R
