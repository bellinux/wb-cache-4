Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jess that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> and thanks him for being {{a very good friend}} to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school.

5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his actions have reminded her of why <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E

25|$|Arthur and {{his sister}} {{remained}} close until her death in 1915. He had once expressed concern that when Ellen married, he would have lost all connections with any family. When Ellen became engaged, she told her brother {{that he was not}} losing her and that getting married hadn't altered the extent to which <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> When Myra became pregnant, Arthur told his sister first before anyone else.|$|E

He then kisses her on the lips and promises to give Asagiri a moonstone necklace for their wedding. Before he gets killed by Enju, he presents her with the necklace.

25|$|Johan Wagenaar's De getemde feeks (1909) is {{the second}} of three {{overture}}s Wagenaar wrote based on Shakespeare, the others being Koning Jan (1891) and Driekoningenavond (1928). Another overture inspired by the play is Alfred Reynolds' The Taming of the Shrew Overture (1927). Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's verismo opera Sly, ovvero la leggenda del dormiente risvegliato (1927) focuses on the Induction, with libretto by Giovacchino Forzano. A tragedy, the opera depicts Sly as a hard-drinking and debt-ridden poet who sings in a London pub. When he is tricked into believing {{that he is a}} lord, his life improves, but upon learning it is a ruse, he mistakenly concludes the woman he loves (Dolly) only told him <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> as part of the ruse. In despair, he kills himself by cutting his wrists, with Dolly arriving too late to save him. Starring Aureliano Pertile and Mercedes Llopart, it was first performed at La Scala in Milan. Rudolf Karel's The Taming of the Shrew is an unfinished opera upon which he worked between 1942 and 1944. Philip Greeley Clapp's The Taming of the Shrew (1948) was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera. Vittorio Giannini's The Taming of the Shrew (1953) is an opera buffa, with libretto by Giannini and Dorothy Fee. It was first performed at the Cincinnati Music Hall, starring Dorothy Short and Robert Kircher. Vissarion Shebalin's Ukroshchenye stroptivoy (1957), with libretto by Abram Akimovich Gozenpud, was Shebalin's last opera and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece throughout Russia. Dominick Argento's Christopher Sly (1962), with libretto by John Manlove, is a comic opera in two scenes and an interlude, first performed in the University of Minnesota. Sly is duped by a Lord into believing that he himself is a lord. However, he soon becomes aware of the ruse, and when left alone, he flees with the Lord's valuables and his two mistresses.|$|E

[...] She wrote that while each wife {{had her own}} bedroom, they shared meals and devotional time together with Strang and that life in their household was [...] "as pleasant as possible." [...] On the other hand, Strang and Phoebe Wright's daughter, Eugenia, wrote in 1936 that after only eight months of marriage, her mother had [...] "begun to feel dissatisfied with polygamy, though <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> [...] devotedly all her life." ...|$|E

[...] Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair ("You'll Never Walk Alone").|$|E
500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli {{promoted}} {{the theory that}} [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic & The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer {{that he was the}} father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer {{to the extent that he}} suffered nightmares.|$|E

500|$|On 24 December 1809, Cavendish married Granville {{with her}} aunt's blessing. Though ageing, Granville {{maintained}} his handsome appearance and Cavendish {{was said to}} have [...] " [...] high degree the charm of voice and manner which belongs to the Cavendish family". Their marriage was happy; <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> until her death, writing in September 1810 to her sister, [...] "I really think I am happier every hour. There never was anything so adorable as he is in every way". Their eldest child, Susan, was born in October 1810 in London. The couple would go on to have four further children, and his two illegitimate issue with Henrietta also flourished in the happy household. Granville was made a Viscount in 1815; an earldom awarded in 1833 led to Harriet becoming known as Countess Granville.|$|E
500|$|By 1933, {{tensions}} in Fortune's marriage were tearing it apart. There were rumours that Evans was having extra-marital affairs with other women, while Fortune confided in female {{members of the}} Fraternity that she had married him for magical reasons rather than because <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> Evans eventually asked for a divorce in order to marry another woman; Fortune was appalled, but did not contest it. Fortune had begun renting The Belfry, a converted Presbyterian chapel in West Halkin Street, where she then took up residence. It was here, during the latter 1930s, that she produced a number of rituals, among them the Rite of Isis and the Rite of Pan. As these {{and other aspects of}} her work testify, during {{the latter half of the}} decade Fortune had moved in what Richardson described as [...] "an increasingly pagan orientation".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he {{gradually}} gets used to his {{new body}} and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he [...] "finally clicks into place" [...] after picking out his new outfit." [...] The rooftop scene {{was not in the}} original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not really have a formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed {{this was the kind of}} relationship viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, she is a very different person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor.|$|E

500|$|Mercedes lied {{that she}} has {{contracted}} HIV from Malachy who ends his relationship with Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) to reunite with Mercedes. When Malachy discovered her lies, he hit Mercedes, who felt, according to Metcalfe, that she [...] "deserved it" [...] because she was [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "the lies she told were just disgusting. She doesn't resent Malachy for hitting her at all". Mercedes reconciled with Malachy; Metcalfe explained that Mercedes still loved Malachy {{but was unable to}} stay away from other men. She added that seeing Malachy with Lynsey helped Mercedes [...] "realise" [...] how much <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> After Malachy is injured in an explosion, Metcalfe explained that Mercedes regretted her affair with Calvin and she [...] "desperately" [...] wanted the chance to [...] "make things work" [...] with Malachy. She added that if he died, Mercedes would find it difficult to live with her guilt. If Malachy were to die Mercedes would be [...] "devastated" [...] as he was [...] "the only positive thing in her life. [...] She thinks that she's nothing without him". Malachy died. Metcalfe felt that when Malachy shielded Mercedes from the explosion by throwing himself over her it [...] "proves to her how much he loves her. She knows that's special and regrets she ever took him and his love granted". Metcalfe felt that she and Wallace [...] "had amazing storylines", opining that Malachy's death was the most emotional scene she had filmed while with the serial.|$|E
500|$|Aspects of [...] "The Big Bang" [...] were {{outlined}} by lead writer {{and executive producer}} Steven Moffat as he planned the arc of the series. Moffat stated he left room to improvise on the story and {{was pleased with the}} result, describing it as [...] "mad" [...] and [...] "amazing". Moffat stated that the title [...] "The Big Bang" [...] is his favourite dirty Doctor Who joke as it is a reference to the fact that Amy and Rory conceive their child on the TARDIS that night, as revealed in the next series in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". Gillan described Rory's vigil for Amy as the [...] "ultimate romantic gesture" [...] which showed how much he loved Amy, and was where Amy realised how much <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> Moffat thought that standing guard for two thousand years would make up for shooting her. Moffat had always intended for Amy and Rory to get married [...] "from the off". Moffat described the conclusion as the story of how Amy has been changed by the Doctor and the Doctor's success at restoring her spirit to the girl he first met, believing that a man could drop out of the sky and [...] "fix everything". However, he did not return for her as he had promised and she grew believing that he was a liar and could not be trusted; Amy returns to her original belief when she stands up at her wedding and proclaims that the Doctor is real and that he will arrive. Though the episode {{is the end of the}} series, Moffat left questions to be answered in the next series, including the mystery of River Song's identity and the [...] "Silence" [...] which appeared to cause the TARDIS to blow up.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Montag {{revealed}} to People {{that she had}} undergone ten cosmetic surgery procedures {{in a single day}} two months prior, performed by Frank Ryan. Among the procedures were brow-lifts, ear-pinnings, a chin reduction, as well as a second rhinoplasty and second breast augmentation. She commented that she almost died from too much Demerol, reducing her heart rate to five beats per minute. Her debut studio album Superficial was digitally released later that month to an overwhelmingly negative critical response from critics. The self-funded record cost nearly $2 million and sold approximately 1,000 copies in first-week downloads, failing to earn back the money spent making it. In May, she and Pratt made their final appearance on The Hills halfway through the sixth and final season. In December 2013, Montag stated that she and Conrad have [...] "talked a few times" [...] since the series' conclusion, elaborating that [...] "it's unfortunate things happened the way that it did, but we're both different people now, older and more mature." [...] However, in 2015, Montag angrily excoriated Conrad when she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp, during a sequence where the contestants were asked to forgive someone who had hurt them in the past; Montag told a stand-in for Conrad that Conrad had [...] "ruined my life with her lies", said that Conrad DID have a sex tape and had falsely blamed it on her, and that she [...] "forgave" [...] Conrad for being terrible and trying to ruin her life. Montag was universally lambasted for bringing up the sex tape lies anew, parroting the views of Pratt (who Conrad actually blamed for spreading the false rumors; Conrad felt Montag knew he was lying but took Pratt's side because <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him)</b> and trying to use Conrad's name to get publicity for herself.|$|E

The eldest spoke, <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> more, than the whole kingdom; the second, more than all the precious stones and pearls in the world; but the third said, <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> more than salt. The king was so upset, that she compared her love of him with such a small thing, gave her to a servant and commanded, he should take her into the forest and kill her." ...|$|E

Marianne is devastated. After Elinor has read the letter, Marianne tells her that she and Willoughby were never engaged, but <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> and thought that he loved her.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{recurring}} {{themes were}} incorporated into the JR and Babe romance, such as the pairing's meeting on the pier in San Diego, being star-crossed, JR's inner turmoil, and Babe's cheating. The [...] "pier in San Diego" [...] theme became symbolic for JR and Babe's experience of love at first sight. In the December 23, 2003 episode, Babe refers to meeting JR on a foggy dock {{as the answer to}} their prayers and confesses that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> upon seeing him. In the February 16, 2006 episode, the two describe themselves as lost until they saw each other.|$|E
