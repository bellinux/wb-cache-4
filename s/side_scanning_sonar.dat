40|$|Abstract- There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} autonomous underwater vehicles for ocean exploration. <b>Side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonars</b> are often installed onboard these vehicles to survey the sea floor. In this context, the need to transmit <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> images over an acoustic low-bandwidth channel calls for the use of compression techniques. This paper proposes a wavelet-based method for compressing <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> images. Wavelets are an adequate choice because their intrinsic properties suit <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> images. In fact, achieved results confirm that wavelets yield high compression rates. Furthermore, wavelet-based compression enhances <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> images by reducing noise without smoothing important details...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of multiplicative speckle noise in <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> images unfavourably affects the detection and classification of ob- jects in the image. This noise {{is related to}} the sensing system and the image formation process. Speckle removal is a pre-processing step required in such images for applications like segmentation and registration. Most of the speckle reduction techniques intro- duces a bias after the homomorphic approach is applied on the observation model of the <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> image to convert the multiplicative model into an additive one. In this paper an unscented Kalman filter based approach for single look <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> image estimation from the observation model of the image is proposed. First the noise level in the single look <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> image is estimated using a patch based algorithm and then non blind denoising is done. For the blind denoising part, the heterogeneity of <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> image patches is exploited. Simulation results are given to substantiate the effectiveness of the despeckling method. The different non reference image performance evaluation measures are used to assess the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the current population status of Amazonian manatees (Trichechus inunguis) and their habitat in eastern Ecuador. Threats to this endangered species include oil exploration and extraction, water pollution, subsistence hunting, and incidental mortality. Our methods included <b>side</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>sonar</b> surveys of the Amazon River and tributaries in eastern Ecuador, interviews with local residents, and analysis of water samples using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods. Data collection will be in progress until the first of August. Sonar surveys were recorded and further analyzed for evidence of manatees. Forty possibIe manatee detections were identified. There were two visual sightings and thirty-eight sonar sightings. This is evidence that manatees persist in Amazonian Ecuador but are very rare. Upon completion of data collection, the population data will be analyzed using patch occupancy models. Interviews were conducted with local residents who live on the rivers and tributaries and have direct contact with the animals. Hundreds of manatee sightings were reported. It was noteworthy how many people had hunted and eaten these creatures. Many locals had multiple harpoons specifically for hunting manatees. Water samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pAHs), volatile organics, toxic metals, mercury, and petroleum hydrocarbons in samples collected while conducting manatee surveys. All samples contained varying concentrations of crude oil with 30 - 40 carbons and both total and fecal coliforms, but no evidence of toxic PAHs, metals, or volatile organics has been found currently. This suggests that the oil development in the Orellana region of Ecuador is not directly impacting the habitat of Trichechus inunguis. We conclude that the most notable threat to the sustainability of the Trichechus inunguis population in eastern Ecuador is hunting...|$|E

40|$|The {{size and}} {{organization}} of bed material, bed texture, is a fundamental attribute of channels and is one component of the physical habitat of aquatic ecosystems. Multiple discipline-specific definitions of texture exist {{and there is not}} a universally accepted metric(s) to quantify the spectrum of possible bed textures found in aquatic environments. Moreover, metrics to describe texture are strictly statistical. Recreational-grade <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> systems now offer the possibility of imaging submerged riverbed sediment at resolutions potentially sufficient to identify subtle changes in bed texture with minimal cost,expertise in sonar, or logistical effort. However, inferring riverbed sediment from <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> data is limited because recreational-grade systems were not designed for this purpose and methods to interpret the data have relied on manual and semi-automated routines. Visual interpretation of <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> data is not practically applied to large volumes of data because it is labor intensive and lacks reproducibility. This thesis addresses current limitations associated with visual interpretation with two objectives: 1) objectively quantify <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> imagery texture, and 2) develop an automated texture segmentation algorithm for broad-scale substrate characterization. To address objective 1), I used a time series of imagery collected along a 1. 6 km reach of the Colorado River in Marble Canyon, AZ. A statistically based texture analysis was performed on georeferenced <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> imagery to identify objective metrics {{that could be used to}} discriminate different sediment types. A Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix based texture analysis was found to successfully discriminate the textures associated with different sediment types. Texture varies significantly at the scale of ≈ 9 m 2 on <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> imagery on a regular 25 cm grid. A minimum of three and maximum of five distinct textures could be observed directly from <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> imagery. To address objective 2), linear least squares and a Gaussian mixture modeling approach were developed and tested. Both sediment classification methods were found to successfully classify heterogeneous riverbeds into homogeneous patches of sand, gravel, and boulders. Gaussian mixture models outperformed the least squares models because they classified gravel with the highest accuracies. Additionally, substrate maps derived from a Gaussian modeling approach were found to be able to better estimate reach averaged proportions of different sediments types when they were compared to similar maps derived from multibeam sonar...|$|R

During the months of August 2004 and May and July 2005, we used <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> to image several regions of the sea floor in the northern OCNMS, and the data were mosaicked at 1 -meter pixel resolution. Video from a towed camera sled, bathymetry data, sedimentary samples and <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> mapping were integrated to describe geological and biological aspects of habitat.

For three small areas that were mapped with both <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> <b>sonar</b> and multibeam echosounder, we made a comparison of output from the classified images indicating little difference in results between the two methods. With these considerations, backscatter derived from multibeam bathymetry is currently a costefficient and safe method for seabed imaging in the shallow (< 30 meters) rocky waters of OCNMS. The image quality is sufficient for classification purposes, the associated depths provide further descriptive value and risks to gear are minimized.

The development of newer technologies such as intereferometric multibeam systems and bathymetric <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> systems could also provide great potential for mapping these nearshore rocky areas as they allow for high speed data acquisition, produce precisely geo-referenced <b>side</b> <b>scan</b> imagery to bathymetry, and do not experience the angular depth dependency associated with multibeam echosounders allowing larger range scales to be used in shallower water.
