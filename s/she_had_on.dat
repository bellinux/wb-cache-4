5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

25|$|The Mongols practiced polygamy. Ögedei Khan's {{favorite}} son was Kochu, {{who was his}} through another wife, and he had nominated Kochu's son Siremun to succeed him after his father suddenly died in China in 1237. But some sources mention that Khoch was a son of Töregene {{and she did not}} want little Shiremun to succeed. Töregene opposed the choice in favor of Güyük, but despite the enormous influence <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> him, she was unable to persuade Ögedei to change his selection. She did, however, achieve her aims through cunning. When the lesser khans appointed her regent after her husband's death, she appointed her favorites to high positions in the imperial household and initiated what was to be a successful scheme to elevate her son Güyük. When Temüge Otchigen, the youngest brother of Genghis, gathered his men and tried to unsuccessfully seize the throne, Güyük quickly came to meet him. Töregene managed to keep a Kurultai from being held until it was sure her son Güyük was favored by the majority. Töregene passed power onto to her son Güyük in 1246. She retired west to Ögedei's appanage on the Emil.|$|E

As she leaves, her {{colleague}} Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies in his bed, half of his body covered by bedsheets. The narrative flashes back to a few days earlier: Scully arrives at a hospital and, after a series of coincidences, meets her former professor, Daniel Waterston (Nicolas Surovy), with whom she had an affair while attending medical school. [...] He is ill and suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition. She questions whether she made the right decision to leave him and abandon her medical career to pursue a career in the FBI. She meets Waterston's daughter, Maggie (Stacy Haiduk), who is extremely resentful of Scully for the effect <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> Waterston's family.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith is well {{regarded}} by science fiction historians for her innovation, {{and the impact}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> the early careers of writers such as Ursula K.

The following March both Amazing and Fantastic were sold to Ultimate Publishing Company, run by Sol Cohen and Arthur Bernhard. Goldsmith was given the choice of going with the magazines or staying with Ziff-Davis; she stayed, and Cohen hired Joseph Wrzos to edit the magazines, starting with the August and September 1965 issues of Amazing and Fantastic, respectively. Wrzos used the name [...] "Joseph Ross" [...] on the mastheads to avoid mis-spellings. Both magazines immediately moved to a bi-monthly schedule.|$|E

500|$|Monroe's screen persona {{centered}} on her blonde {{hair and the}} stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was [...] "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with double entendres {{that came to be}} known as [...] "Monroeisms". For example, when she was asked what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, [...] "I had the radio on". Having begun her career as a pin-up model, Monroe's hourglass figure was one of her most often noted features. Film scholar Richard Dyer has written that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and in her publicity photos often posed like a pin-up. Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body, earning her the nickname [...] "the girl with the horizontal walk".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Circus {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of hundred to reviews from mainstream critics, Circus received an average score of sixty-four, based on twenty-two reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine provided a favorable review, describing it as a [...] "friendly {{remake of the}} hedonistic Blackout", but preferred its predecessor for being more [...] "sleek or addictive" [...] than Circus. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club appreciated that Spears appeared to [...] "put some real effort into her Circus performances", rather than seeming [...] "flat-sounding" [...] as she felt Blackout had. Writing for Digital Spy, Nick Levine opined that Spears [...] "sounds more confident" [...] than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> Blackout. While Chris Willman from Entertainment Weekly appreciated the overall production of Circus, he was critical of Spears' recently established pattern of [...] "putting out albums with titles that promise more self-revelation than she's ultimately able to provide." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} {{emasculation}} is prevalent in Hemingway's work, {{most notably in}} The Sun Also Rises. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, {{is a result of}} a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times. Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the [...] "natural" [...] versus the [...] "unnatural". In [...] "Alpine Idyll" [...] the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the [...] "natural" [...] spring for redemption.|$|E

500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and the people that I care about in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|With Carey in the captain's chair, {{having more}} control than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> any other album, {{she took the}} album in a new direction, {{alongside}} Afanasieff. For Carey's third studio effort, she enrolled {{the help of a}} range of songwriters, as well as record producers. Aside from Afanasieff, Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds, a man who would collaborate with Carey often in the near future, also took part in the project. Babyface, who helped produce much of the album, also co-wrote a track with Carey titled [...] "Never Forget You", a song that was released as a B-side to [...] "Without You" [...] exclusively in the United States. The album, which consisted mostly of slower ballads (with the exception of [...] "Dreamlover", [...] "Now That I Know", and [...] "I've Been Thinking about You"), contained collaborations with some carry-on producers and writers from Emotions. Of these were Clivillés & Cole (of C+C Music Factory), who co-wrote the track [...] "Now That I Know", a danceable pop ballad, which used similar formulas and synthesizers from tracks on Emotions. Another writer–producer that worked on the album was David Hall, who with Carey wrote the U.S. single [...] "Dreamlover".|$|E
500|$|Left Behind {{was written}} {{to focus on}} the {{relationship}} between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in , a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed Left Behind if American Dreams hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in The Last of Us dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in Left Behind deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in Left Behind, reprising her role from The Last of Us. To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that it was interesting to act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about [...] "fit in". The team found it interesting {{to tell the story of}} Riley, as players of The Last of Us were already aware of the effect that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> Ellie; Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.|$|E
