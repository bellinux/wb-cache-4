40|$|Linear <b>spectropolarimetry</b> is a "photon-hungry" observing technique, {{requiring}} a specific sequence of observations {{to determine the}} Stokes Q and U parameters. For dual-beam spectropolarimeters, the parameters can be ideally determined using observations at N= 2 retarder plate positions. The additional polarization signal introduced by instrumental effects requires the redundancy of N= 4 observations to correct for these effects. We wish {{to determine if the}} "instrumental signature corrections", eQ and eU, are identical for observations with dual-beam spectropolarimeters. For instances when observations were acquired at N= 3 retarder plate angles, we wish to determine if the complete measurement of one Stokes parameter and the associated instrumental signature correction can be used to determine the other Stokes parameter. We constructed analytical and Monte Carlo models of a general dual-beam spectropolarimeter to study the factors affecting the assumption eQ=eU. We compared these models with VLT FORS 1 <b>spectropolarimetry.</b> We find that eQ-eU= 0, with the variance around zero (Δ(eQ-eU)) being directly related to the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations. Observations of a polarized standard star, over the period 2002 - 2007, show that the assumption of eQ-eU= 0 is generally true, although the absolute values of eQ and eU vary between observational epochs. Incomplete <b>spectropolarimetry</b> datasets can be analyzed under the assumption that eQ=eU.

The Stokes parameters derived from the broad-band polarimetry are consistent with zero polarization. The <b>spectropolarimetry,</b> however, shows broad spectral features which are due intrinsically to an asymmetric supernova atmosphere. The spectral features in the flux spectrum and the polarization spectrum show correlations in the wavelength range from 4900 ˚A up to 5500 ˚A. The degree of this intrinsic component is low (∼ 0. 3 %). Theoretical polarization spectra have been calculated. It is shown that the polarization spectra are governed by line blending. Consequently, for similar geometrical distortions, the residual polarization is smaller by about a factor of 2 to 3 compared to the less blended Type II atmosphere, making it intrinsically harder to detect asphericities in SNIa. Comparison with theoretical model polarization spectra shows a resemblance to the observations.

40|$|Optical metasurfaces {{revolutionized}} {{the approach to}} moulding the propagation of light by enabling simultaneous control of the light phase, momentum, amplitude and polarization. Thus, instantaneous <b>spectropolarimetry</b> became possible by conducting parallel intensity measurements of differently diffracted optical beams. Various implementations of this very important functionality have one feature in common - the determination of wavelength utilizes dispersion of the diffraction angle, requiring tracking the diffracted beams in space. Realization of on-chip <b>spectropolarimetry</b> calls thereby for conceptually different approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that random nanoparticle arrays on metal surfaces, enabling strong multiple scattering of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), produce upon illumination complicated SPP scattered patterns, whose angular spectra are uniquely determined by the polarization and wavelength of light, representing thereby spectropolarimetric fingerprints. Using um-sized circular arrays of randomly distributed μm-sized gold nanoparticles (density 75 μm^-^ 2) fabricated on gold films, we measure angular distributions of scattered SPP waves using the leakage radiation microscopy and find that the angular SPP spectra obtained for normally incident light beams different in wavelength and/or polarization are distinctly different.

40|$|Channeled <b>spectropolarimetry</b> {{measures}} the spectrally resolved Stokes parameters. A key {{aspect of this}} technique is to accurately reconstruct the Stokes parameters from a modulated measurement of the channeled spectropolarimeter. The state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithm uses the Fourier transform to extract the Stokes parameters from channels in the Fourier domain. While this approach is straightforward, it can be sensitive to noise and channel cross-talk, and it imposes bandwidth limitations that cut off high frequency details. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a reconstruction method called compressed channeled <b>spectropolarimetry.</b> In our proposed framework, reconstruction in channeled <b>spectropolarimetry</b> is an underdetermined problem, where we take N measurements and solve for 3 N unknown Stokes parameters. We formulate an optimization problem by creating a mathematical model of the channeled spectropolarimeter with inspiration from compressed sensing. We show that our approach offers greater noise robustness and reconstruction accuracy compared with the Fourier transform technique in simulations and experimental measurements. By demonstrating more accurate reconstructions, we push performance to the native resolution of the sensor, allowing more information to be recovered from a single measurement of a channeled spectropolarimeter.

40|$|Channeled <b>spectropolarimetry</b> {{is a novel}} {{method of}} {{measuring}} the spectral dependence of the polarization state of light. Amplitude modulation is employed to encode all four Stokes component spectra into a single optical power spectrum. The encoding is performed with a simple arrangement of two thick birefringent retarders and a linear analyzer. No moving parts are required, and the system is able to acquire its data in a single detector array integration time. We report {{the results of an}} in-depth study of channeled <b>spectropolarimetry.</b> The mathematics of the amplitude modulation analogy are explored, providing a basic design procedure. The system's spectral resolution is described in terms of the space bandwidth product. The technique is then analyzed in the general context of linear operator theory, using both analytic and computational approaches to the singular value decomposition and pseudoinversion of the system's operator. This analysis highlights the importance of the choice of object space in constraining linear reconstructions of data from under-determined systems, and provides the underpinnings of the calibration and reconstruction techniques for a hardware prototype. Calibration of the prototype is approached as experimental estimation of the system's operator. Our basic method of reconstruction involves pseudoinversion of the operator while constraining object space to a truncated Fourier basis. Apodization is helpful in reducing the ringing of reconstructions of spectra which extend beyond the edges of the system's spectral range.
