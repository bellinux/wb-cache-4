His Princeton graduate student Hayes proved a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> about the iron ores of his native Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1919, Smyth showed that a green mineral in the Clinton ores was chamosite and also a primary sediment.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten years}} the Super 12 was {{expanded}} to include two extra teams; the Western Force from Australia, and the Cheetahs from South Africa. The expanded competition was renamed the Super 14. The Highlanders continued under Cooper in 2006. After losing their first match of 2006 to the Crusaders, they then won their next three. After only won two of their last six games, they finished the season ranked ninth. The 2007 ended with a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> to 2006. The Highlanders again finished ninth on the table, and worst of the New Zealand teams. They finished the season with five wins and eight losses from their thirteen matches.|$|E

5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Andrew Strominger {{published}} a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions {{might have an}} equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five-dimensional branes. Initially, physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons. On the one hand, the Montonen–Olive duality was still unproven, and so Strominger's conjecture was even more tenuous. On the other hand, there were many technical {{issues related to the}} quantum properties of five-dimensional branes. The first of these problems was solved in 1993 when Ashoke Sen established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both electric and magnetic charge which were predicted by the work of Montonen and Olive.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a <b>similar</b> <b>result.</b> This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú and colleagues independently recovered a <b>similar</b> <b>result,</b> with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{ended with}} a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> to 2006. The Highlanders again {{finished}} ninth on the table, and worst of the New Zealand teams. They finished the season with five wins and eight losses from their thirteen matches. They started their season with a win over the Western Force, but then lost both their matches in South Africa to the Lions and Sharks. Of their next five matches they won three; against the Stormers, Reds and Cheetahs. They then won only one of their last five matches, against the Waratahs in Sydney. Following his fourth season in charge, and third with the Highlanders finishing ninth, coach Greg Cooper left the franchise {{to take up the}} assistant coaches position with the Blues. The coach for the 2008 season, Glenn Moore, was appointed 28 August 2007.|$|E
