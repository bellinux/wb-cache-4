5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida <b>stone</b> <b>crab.</b> Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close the aperture using the operculum.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, <b>stone</b> <b>crab,</b> blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered {{by the state of}} Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} species of trees that are {{considered}} mangroves: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All grow in oxygen-poor soil, can survive drastic water level changes, and are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water. All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves have the farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms. All three types of trees absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for crustaceans and fish, and rookeries for birds. The region supports Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) and <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> (Menippe mercenaria) industries; between 80 and 90 percent of commercially harvested crustacean species in Florida's salt waters are born or spend time near the Everglades.|$|E

500|$|The {{estuaries}} act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails {{thrive in}} these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a $59million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a $22million-a-year <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> (Menippe mercenaria) industry. [...] Between 80 and 90percent {{of species that}} are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem {{to build up the}} coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.|$|E
