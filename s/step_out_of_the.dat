With Starkey's help, Mulder canvases abandoned buildings in a desolate part of town. However, the Dark Figure finds and kills the girl. After finding Father Gregory at the scene, Mulder believes that {{he is responsible for}} the murders. Under questioning by Mulder and Scully, Father Gregory insists that he tried to protect the girls' souls from the Devil, and that the fourth girl must be located. While the agents <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interrogation room, Starkey enters and demands to know the location of the fourth girl. When Gregory does not answer, he is burned alive by Starkey, who is revealed to be the Devil.|$|E

25|$|The entire losing team {{remains in}} the {{boardroom}} and are confronted with their loss. They are interrogated as to {{the reasons for their}} loss and which players contributed to it or failed at the task. Then, for the final stage of the boardroom meeting, the project manager is asked to select a certain number of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meeting. The remaining teammates return to the suite while the project manager and the selected teammates <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boardroom momentarily so the host can consult with his advisors.|$|E
25|$|Giles played winter cricket in South Africa for Vredenberg & Saldanha (1992–95) and Avendale (1995–96). On 2 July 1998, Giles {{made his}} Test debut against South Africa, and took 1 for 106 in 36 overs. He {{then went on}} to tour Australia in the One Day squad. On 31 December, it was {{announced}} that Giles was to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> One Day match between the ODI squad and the Bradman XI, and into the Test squad for the final Test match in Sydney. He was chosen in light of Australia's selection of Shane Warne, Colin Miller and Stuart MacGill, England captain Alec Stewart stating that the selection of Giles gave England another option.|$|E
25|$|Veteran Mark Martin, {{coming off}} his final year with Roush Racing, was signed drive {{the car for}} 23 races (21 points races plus the Budweiser Shootout and Nextel All-Star Challenge) in 2007, with Joe Nemechek moving over to the team's new 13 team. Regan Smith was pinned to fill the {{remaining}} 16 races of the season, while driving in the Busch Series for the team as well. The team also {{changed its name to}} Ginn Racing to reflect Bobby Ginn's new majority interest in the team. Martin was leading in the final turn of the season-opening Daytona 500, after lining up on the final restart with former Roush teammates Greg Biffle and Matt Kenseth behind him. Coming down the front stretch, and with the field wrecking behind him, Martin looked to have finally come through at Daytona. But the caution was not called, and Kevin Harvick caught Martin on his outside, beating him to the line by two-hundredths of a second. Martin put together more strong finishes, and after the fourth race at Atlanta was leading the points standings in {{what was supposed to be}} his first season of semi-retirement. Resisting the chance to capture his first championship, Martin did <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car as scheduled, breaking a streak of 621 consecutive starts. In 24 starts for the team, Martin scored 11 top 10s, and finished 27th in points despite missing 12 races.|$|E

500|$|In {{the bedroom}} scene, both the {{negative}} and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire. Her feelings cause her to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered. At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible. By forcing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e. the apple, the pact made with Bertilak—and therefore the Green Knight—is broken. In this sense, {{it is clear that}} {{at the hands of the}} Lady, Gawain is a [...] "good man seduced".|$|E
500|$|The {{publication}} of [...] "Growth and Function of Stegosaurus Plates" [...] by Buffrénil, et al. in 1986 marked a major <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> realm of speculation {{and into the}} realm of science, with its microscopic analyses of multiple Stegosaurus plate specimens, proving unequivocally [...] "extreme vascularization of the outer layer of bone", which was seen by Buffrénil as further evidence the plates [...] "acted as thermoregulatory devices". Later, more comprehensive histological surveys of plate microstructure attributed the vascularization to the need to transport nutrients for rapid plate growth, asserting the plates' physiology, if beneficial, was a side benefit secondary to their primary function, identification and display. The use of exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E

The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} The Guardian, Killian Fox said Between the Times and the Tides was [...] "more interesting sonically in {{the tension between}} questing guitars and straightforward song structures {{than it is in}} terms of lyrics, which aim to be down to earth but end up middle of the road." [...] NME writer John Doran wrote, [...] "sure enough here are a wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm-hearted, Neil Young-like intensity. Those wanting clangour and dissonance will be disappointed, but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Grayson Currin deemed it a [...] "motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers" [...] but that [...] "Ranaldo's opportunity to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity." [...] Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as: [...] "while it may be traditional in structure, Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance. The playing may draw on jazz, country, rock and Ranaldo's own avant-garde catalogue." [...] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes found it [...] "great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out. But it's also a reminder of their irreplaceable magic." ...|$|E
500|$|Season ten {{begins with}} Clark {{stuck in the}} afterlife, where Jor-El informs him that a great {{darkness}} is coming to Earth. Clark is unknowingly resurrected by Lois, who is now aware that he is [...] "the Blur". Jor-El also informs Clark {{that he is not}} ready to be Earth's true savior, as there are inner demons that Clark must overcome first. In the episode [...] "Homecoming", Clark is visited by Brainiac 5, who shows Clark how his past has shaped his present, and will one day shape his future; including a vision of Clark's future self when he has fully embraced his destiny. In the episode [...] "Isis", Clark reveals his secret to Lois only to find out that she already knew he was [...] "the Blur", which is followed in a later episode by Clark proposing to Lois. Clark realizes that in order to be the hero the world needs, he will have to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows and into the light. As a result, Clark makes the decision to turn [...] "Clark Kent" [...] into a real disguise— opting to wear eyeglasses and alter his mannerisms to be more shy and reserved— so that the Blur does not have to hide his face to the world. By the series finale, the darkness, which is revealed to be Darkseid, arrives on Earth to enslave all of humanity. Clark realizes that his entire life has been one big trial by Jor-El; accepting his true destiny, the Blur saves Earth from Darkseid's coming Apokolips. The series ends by moving seven years into the future, where Clark and Lois are finally getting married, and Clark has embraced his new identity as [...] "Superman".|$|E
