5|$|In 2009, two Muslim {{reporters from}} Al-Islam, a small Malaysian magazine, {{participated in a}} Catholic Mass and {{received}} Holy Communion, which they then <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> and photographed. The resulting photo was then published in their May 2009 edition. The magazine, {{which is owned by}} Utusan Karya, part of the Utusan Malaysia Group, sent its reporters including one Muhd Ridwan Abdul Jalil, to two churches in the Klang Valley, as part of a special investigative report. The act of desecration occurred at St Anthony's Church in Jalan Robertson, Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
25|$|The {{alveolar}} {{epithelial cells}} of the lung selectively concentrates paraquat. Even a single swig, immediately <b>spat</b> <b>out,</b> can cause death from fibrous tissue developing in the lungs, leading to asphyxiation.|$|E
60|$|But begob I {{was just}} {{lowering}} {{the heel of}} the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and <b>spatting</b> <b>out</b> of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.|$|R
60|$|RUFIO (aside to Pothinus). You {{should have}} <b>spat</b> it <b>out</b> sooner, you fool. Now {{it is too}} late.|$|R
60|$|Another silence {{followed}} these words. There was a stout {{man standing}} in the aisle, and he <b>spat</b> deftly <b>out</b> of the open window.|$|R
25|$|An unsympathetic {{person might}} {{characterize}} Melville as a failed writer who held a low-level government job, drank too much, heckled his wife unmercifully about the housework, beat her occasionally, {{and drove the}} children to distraction with his unpredictable behavior. A sympathetic observer might characterize him as an underappreciated genius, a visionary, an iconoclastic thinker, a sensitive, orphaned American idealist, and {{a victim of a}} crude, materialistic society that ate artists and visionaries alive and <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> their bones. He was both, and more.|$|E
25|$|Before {{that was}} vetoed by early missionaries, it was {{customary}} for the dried 'ava root to be chewed {{by one or}} more of the members of the aumaga. Those chosen for this work were possessed of clean mouths and good teeth and they were required to thoroughly rinse out their mouths before commencing their duty. When the 'ava had been sufficiently chewed it was <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> on to the leaf of a banana or breadfruit or taro and carried and deposited in the 'ava bowl.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess <b>spat</b> <b>out.</b> Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
60|$|Briefly and {{concisely}} I {{told the}} colonel exactly what had happened. He chewed his cigar, then <b>spat</b> it <b>out</b> with an unintelligible exclamation.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Stuka dive-bomber had fixed, {{rather than}} retractable, landing gear and this greatly simplified Langhurst’s {{choice of a}} substitute. He installed the landing gear and tail wheel salvaged from a Fairchild PT-19 training plane. It mattered little that these did not exactly resemble the originals as the main wheels on a Stuka were normally covered with streamlined metal spats. Langhurst would later fashion similarly shaped <b>spats</b> <b>out</b> of fiberglass. He also utilized the PT-19’s control stick and linkages for the control surfaces on his Stuka.|$|R
50|$|In mid-2011, West {{tasted the}} newest flavor of Doritos, Late Night All Nighter Cheeseburger. According to family members, West {{took a bite}} of the cheeseburger-flavored chip and <b>spat</b> it <b>out.</b>|$|R
25|$|The next {{match was}} a Cruiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship. Último Dragón and Shannon Moore started the match with Dragón getting a pinfall victory after the Dragon-DDT, but was then forced to submit by Jamie Noble with the Dragon Sleeper, who next {{eliminated}} Funaki in 8 seconds. Nunzio was {{then in the}} match, but was eliminated after being counted out of the match when {{he was unable to}} return to the ring by the referee's count of ten. Billy Kidman then entered the match, pinning and eliminating Noble following a top rope BK-Bomb. Kidman was then pinned and eliminated by Rey Mysterio with a Modified Powerbomb from the top rope. Tajiri was the next entrant, but was also pinned by Mysterio following a standing West Coast Pop. Akio was the next scheduled entrant but was unable to compete due to being inadvertently attacked by Tajiri with his signature green mist he <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> of his mouth when Mysterio ducked. The Cruiserweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero, was the final entrant and pinned Mysterio with a reversal of Mysterio's Sunset Flip to win with the assistance of his father Chavo Classic, thus retaining the title.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth day}} {{began in the}} same fashion as the first three had: with a one-hour delay for rain. Play {{eventually}} got underway at 12:00, but the partnership only lasted another eight overs, as Strauss was caught behind by Graham Manou off Hilfenhaus. Collingwood was next to fall to Hilfenhaus, caught by Ponting at second slip with the last ball before lunch. Bell reached his half-century just after lunch, but was trapped LBW by Johnson five overs later. Matt Prior and Andrew Flintoff then developed a strong partnership, putting on 89 runs for the sixth wicket. Flintoff and Stuart Broad then combined for another 52 runs before Flintoff was caught out by a Nathan Hauritz ball that <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> of the rough and caught him on the glove. The last three wickets went for 66 runs, with Broad top-scoring with 55 to take England to 376 all out, 113 runs ahead of the Aussies. The Australian innings began well, with the openers putting on 47 runs before two quick wickets fell to Onions and Swann in consecutive overs: Katich edged Onions to Prior, and then Swann tormented Ponting before clean-bowling him with the last ball of his over. The day ended with Australia on 88/2.|$|E
25|$|Strauss and Trott built a {{partnership}} of 118 before the England captain edged to Michael Clarke at first slip {{just before the}} lunch break on day three. With the final ball of the morning session, Prior drove a ball from North to the off side and hit Ricky Ponting at silly point square in the jaw. The Australian captain, looked nonplussed, simply <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> some blood. After lunch, Prior was run out while attempting to sneak a run, despite hitting the ball straight to Katich, who threw down the stumps at the bowler's end. The next man in was Andrew Flintoff, playing in his final Test innings, and he added 22 off 18 before being caught on the long-on boundary. A lofted straight drive from England's most promising all-round prospect, Stuart Broad, brought up the 400 lead, but an attempted slog found his top edge and he was caught by Ponting off North for 29. Meanwhile, Trott progressed towards his maiden Test century, ably supported by Graeme Swann, who reached his half-century in just 44 balls. However, the England spinner was eventually caught behind, top-edging a pull shot off a bouncer from Hilfenhaus. Trott then became the 18th England cricketer to make a century on debut with a four off Hilfenhaus's next over, but he and Anderson only managed to add another 31 before Trott was caught by North at point off Stuart Clark, prompting a declaration from Andrew Strauss. England's score of 373/9 declared meant {{that in order to}} win the match Australia would need to make 546 runs in just over two days on a pitch that had not yet produced more than 400 {{over the course of the}} match. England, on the other hand, needed only to take 10 Australian wickets. The Australian openers managed to get to 80 without loss by the end of play.|$|E

60|$|BUT {{the trout}} was so displeased with {{the taste of}} the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it <b>spat</b> him <b>out</b> again; and the only thing it {{swallowed}} was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.|$|R
60|$|Cranly {{examined}} the fig {{by the light}} of a lamp under which he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, <b>spat</b> it <b>out</b> and threw the fig rudely into the gutter.|$|R
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{incendiary}} exchange between Roosevelt and MacArthur occurred over an administration proposal to cut 51% of the Army's budget. [...] In response, MacArthur lectured Roosevelt that [...] "when {{we lost the}} next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> his last curse, I wanted the name not to be MacArthur, but Roosevelt." [...] In response, Roosevelt yelled [...] "you must not talk that way to the President!" [...] MacArthur offered to resign, but Roosevelt refused his request, and MacArthur then staggered out of the White House and vomited on the front steps.|$|E
500|$|A chronic cough {{is often}} the first symptom to develop. When it {{persists}} {{for more than three}} months each year for at least two years, in combination with sputum production and without another explanation, there is by definition chronic bronchitis. This condition can occur before COPD fully develops. The amount of sputum produced can change over hours to days. In some cases, the cough may not be present or may only occur occasionally and may not be productive. Some people with COPD attribute the symptoms to a [...] "smoker's cough". Sputum may be swallowed or <b>spat</b> <b>out,</b> depending often on social and cultural factors. Vigorous coughing may lead to rib fractures or a brief loss of consciousness. Those with COPD often have a history of [...] "common colds" [...] that last a long time.|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Boston Corbett {{crept up}} behind the barn and shot Booth in [...] "the {{back of the head}} about an inch below the spot where his [...] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", {{severing}} his spinal cord. Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he <b>spat</b> <b>out,</b> unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, [...] "Tell my mother I die for my country." [...] Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: [...] "Useless... useless." [...] He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{was given}} to Smoke to see a {{wonderful}} thing. The food between her teeth roused her to consciousness. She <b>spat</b> it <b>out,</b> and with a great anger struck herself with her clenched fist on the offending mouth.|$|R
5000|$|Chef Gordon Ramsay {{challenged}} James May {{to sample}} three [...] "delicacies" [...] (Laotian snake whiskey, bull penis, and kæstur hákarl) on The F Word; after eating kæstur hákarl, Ramsay <b>spat</b> it <b>out,</b> although May kept his down. May offered {{to do it}} again.|$|R
60|$|A Jungle-dweller gets {{to learn}} by {{experience}} {{as much as}} many doctors know of poisonous plants and berries. Mowgli sniffed the smoke that came up from the fire, broke off a morsel of the blackened bread, tasted it, and <b>spat</b> it <b>out</b> again.|$|R
500|$|On {{its release}} most critics {{agreed that the}} book was both scandalous and career-ending. [...] (Even with {{a quarter of the}} 1,000-page {{original}} manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but <b>spat</b> <b>out,</b> a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice inside my head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer." [...] Rapper Tupac Shakur mispronounces {{the title of the book}} in a Vibe Interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. [...] "You’ll Never Work Again in Hollywood, whatever that is that they’re talking about, all the people that slept together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{training}} agencies, such as PADI and Technical Diving International, {{teach the}} use of two depth limits to protect against oxygen toxicity. The shallower depth is called the [...] "maximum operating depth" [...] and is reached when the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas reaches [...] [...] The deeper depth, called the [...] "contingency depth", is reached when the partial pressure reaches [...] Diving at or beyond this level exposes the diver to {{a greater risk of}} central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity. This can be extremely dangerous since its onset is often without warning and can lead to drowning, as the regulator may be <b>spat</b> <b>out</b> during convulsions, which occur in conjunction with sudden unconsciousness (general seizure induced by oxygen toxicity).|$|E
5000|$|Literally {{translating}} as [...] "That Water", {{the name}} Tefnut {{has been linked}} to the verb 'tfn' meaning 'to spit' and versions of the creation myth say that Ra (or Atum) <b>spat</b> her <b>out</b> and her name was written as a mouth spitting in late texts.|$|R
6000|$|So {{they reached}} the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water {{in the hollow of}} his hand, tasted it, and <b>spat</b> it <b>out.</b> A little further he tried again. [...] "This will do," [...] he said, and they began {{drinking}} eagerly.|$|R
