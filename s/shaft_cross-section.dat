The {{apex of the}} trend toward heavy, strong bows was {{exemplified}} in the output of Eugene Sartory, who developed a style of bow to which his atelier adhered consistently for decades. He fortified the Voirin model, producing sturdily built bows with strong shafts. Later on Sartory innovated the design of his bows; widening the head and altering the <b>shaft</b> <b>cross-section</b> as well as thickening the shaft above the handle. These changes provided more stability and reliability in the handling. In his early period, Sartory preferred dark pernambuco wood, whereas the later bows are generally of lighter color.|$|E

40|$|Rotor to stator rub is a {{very common}} topic in rotor {{dynamics}} and several models have been proposed in literature. Anyhow these models are often able to explain only the experimental dynamical behaviour of simple test rigs, which are deliberately reproducing a Jeffcott rotor. On the contrary case histories related to real machines are seldom presented and analyzed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present an actual case history of a large turbo generator unit that was subjected to partial arc rubs. The experimental results are shown and discussed along with the model based diagnostic strategy employed to identify the fault severity and the location of the <b>shaft</b> <b>cross-sections</b> where the heaviest rubs occurred.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{stability problem}} of a viscoelastic Voigt-Kelvin balanced rotating shaft subjected to action of axial forces at the ends is studied. The shaft is of circular cross-section, it rotates at a constant rate about its longitudinal axis of symmetry. The effect of rotatory inertia of the <b>shaft</b> <b>cross-section</b> and external viscous damping are included into account. The force consists of a constant part and a time-dependent stochastic function. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for simply supported boundary conditions. By using the direct Liapunov method almost sure asymptotic stability conditions are obtained as the function of stochastic process variance, external damping coefficient, retardation time, angular velocity, and geometric and physical parameters of the shaft. Numerical calculations are performed for the Gaussian process with a zero mean and variance σ 2 {{as well as for}} harmonic process with amplitude H...|$|E
40|$|Osteocytes, {{the most}} {{abundant}} cell within bone, {{have been linked to}} the processes of mechanosensation and transduction. Based upon relatively limited empirical evidence, variations in their abundance and morphology have been linked to sex, age, biomechanics and disease. In order to better elucidate lacunar variation within a healthy cohort, samples from 30 women aged 20 - 86 and 36 men aged 18 - 92 were studied utilizing synchrotron radiation micro-CT. Initial studies of normal variation within the femoral proximal <b>shaft</b> <b>cross-section</b> found high variation in lacunar density (up to ~ 54 %) and associated morphological differences linked to biomechanical regions. In women, a non-significant trend in lacunar density reduction was apparent with age; however, a significant reduction in lacunar volume with age (~ 30 %) was observed. Also noted were differences in lacunar morphology, with the lacunae of younger women characterized as flatter and less equant than their older counterparts. The males, who demonstrated lacunar density decline with age and a tendency towards more equant and less elongate lacunae, did not share these characteristics. Intriguingly, the previously noted reductions in lacunar volume were not observed in males. The results of this research indicate that normal variation in osteocyte lacunar parameters is high. To our knowledge the observation that lacunar volume differs in women with age is novel, potentially resulting from preferential surface infilling within the extracellular space. The functional impact of this infilling is unclear but such a change in scale likely impacts the mechanosensing function of the osteocyte network. This hypothesis warrants further investigation as, if confirmed, it would represent a profound negative impact on the osteocyte network and may provide new insights into age-related bone loss...|$|E

In this study, a sizing program for the reducer has been developed in order to replace the manual sizing process. We aim at the total center distance of the gear reducer for optimization to reduce gear volume and weight. Also, we checked constrains such as, tooth root bending, tooth contact strength, gear <b>shaft</b> endangered <b>cross-section,</b> bearing life, gear shaft deflection, and torsion angle deformation, etc., to obtain reliable drive strength. Comparisons of sizes and weights before and after optimization confirm that the purpose for reducing production cost is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Air Space Proportion (ASP) is {{a measure}} of how much air is present within a bone, which allows for a {{quantifiable}} comparison of pneumaticity between specimens and species. Measured from zero to one, higher ASP means more air and less bone. Conventionally, it is estimated from measurements of the internal and external bone diameter, or by analyzing cross-sections. To date, the only pterosaur ASP study has been carried out by visual inspection of sectioned bones within matrix. Here, computed tomography (CT) scans are used to calculate ASP in a small sample of pterosaur wing bones (mainly phalanges) and to assess how the values change throughout the bone. These results show higher ASPs than previous pterosaur pneumaticity studies, and more significantly, higher ASP values in the heads of wing bones than the shaft. This suggests that pneumaticity has been underestimated previously in pterosaurs, birds, and other archosaurs when <b>shaft</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are used to estimate ASP. Furthermore, ASP in pterosaurs is higher than those found in birds and most sauropod dinosaurs, giving them among the highest ASP values of animals studied so far, supporting the view that pterosaurs were some of the most pneumatized animals to have lived. The high degree of pneumaticity found in pterosaurs is proposed to be a response to the wing bone bending stiffness requirements of flight rather than a means to reduce mass, as is often suggested. Mass reduction may be a secondary result of pneumaticity that subsequently aids flight...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the Saint-Venant torsion problem of composite shafts. Two {{different kinds of}} imperfect interfaces are considered. One models a thin interphase of low shear modulus and the other models a thin interphase of high shear modulus. The imperfect interfaces are characterized by parameters given {{in terms of the}} thickness and shear modulus of the interphases. Using variational principles, we derive rigorous bounds for the torsional rigidity of composite <b>shafts</b> with <b>cross-sections</b> of arbitrary shapes. The analysis is based on the construction of admissible fields in the inclusions and in the matrix. We obtain the general expression for the bounds and demonstrate the results with some particular examples. Specifically, circular, elliptical and trianglar shafts are considered to exemplify the derived bounds. We incorporate the cross-section shape factor into the bounds and show how the position and size of the inclusion influence the bounds. Under specific conditions, the lower and upper bounds will coincide and agree with the exact torsional rigidity...|$|R

In testing, films are attached to a substrate provided with a circular hole, through which loading {{is applied to the}} film by a flat-ended <b>shaft</b> of circular <b>cross-section.</b> The effect of substrate deformation on the deflection of the loaded film is taken into account by using a line spring model. For small deflections, an analytical solution is derived, while for large deflections a numerical solution is obtained using the shooting method. The resulting load-shaft displacement relation, which is essential in blister tests, compares favorably with finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|Rotor {{dynamics}} is {{the study}} of the behaviour of the machines resulting from excitations originating from its rotating elements, and has a very important role to play throughout the fast-growing mechanical and industrial world. <b>Shafts</b> or circular <b>cross-section</b> beams are important parts of rotating systems and their geometries play important role in rotor dynamics. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} consider the dynamic characteristics of special shaft-rotor systems with disks and shafts whose radii are functions of their length. The procedures for the determination of the deflection slope, shear force and bending moment at the extremities of the shaft are used and the dynamics of shaft-rotor system are considered. Conventional frequency response method is used for the computation of resonance, critical speed or whirling frequency. For particular lengths and rotational speeds, the response of the system is determined for the establishment of the dynamic characteristics. Several types of such shaft-rotors are analysed as examples. Hollow tapered shaft-rotors with uniform thickness and uniform bore are also considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{designing}} the profiles of construction elements {{are defined as}} a perfect shape of line, circle or cylinder etc. Due to the production process the elements macrogeometry can be distorted in many ways. The direct measure of deviation of the real shape of a part from its nominal shape (the designed one) is a form deviation. If any additional restrictions concerning form deviations are not given in a production drawing, then the influence of these form deviations {{should be taken into}} account in allowable area of dimensions variation which is defined with tolerance zone. High values of rectilinearity deviations of a generating line, roundness deviations and cylindricity deviations can be a reason of changes of the assumed functional requirements. On the basis of saddleback <b>shafts</b> with oval <b>cross-sections</b> manufactured in three accuracy classes, i. e. IT 4, IT 6 and IT 9, the authors have presented the variation of static parameters of cooperation. The shafts were coupled with sleeves (with a nominal circular cross-section) on experimental test stand.

The applied method also allowed to determine the values of contact pressures in a connection...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} geared towards {{the study of}} warping as {{that takes place in}} non-circular shafts under torsion loading. For this purpose {{specimens}} of square cross-sections were used [...] This activity constitutes a laboratory unit in Mechanics of Materials course taught at the junior level.

The setup used for the experiment on torsion of a circular shaft was employed to study torsion of a <b>shaft</b> of square <b>cross-section.</b> The results for the circular cross-section were used to compute the shear modulus which was then used in the expressions for torsional stiffness of a square shaft by addressing warping. Warping in square shafts was demonstrated using geometrically similar Styrofoam specimens. Both the circular and square cross sections were further studied using the membrane analogy in which rubber membranes were stretched over square and round holes on plates pressurized by air from beneath the holes. The membranes were bulged forming “torsion ” hills and the slopes at different locations around the contour were noted. These slopes were proportional to the shear stresses at the outer edge of the cross section...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a simple}} but {{comprehensive}} study of the dynamic behavior of a shaft with a crack on elastic supports. The analysis is restricted to the single span shaft with uniform circular cross-section. The natural frequency and modes of vibration of a shaft having a transverse crack are investigated using the finite element method. The local flexibility due to the crack is evaluated using the theory of fracture mechanics. The effect of crack depth on the natural behavior is discussed. The results show that {{an increase in the}} depth of the of crack magnifies the response amplitude and decreases the natural frequencies. The effect of elastic supports on the dynamic behavior of the shaft is presented through computation. The range of maximum effect is given. [...] The element stiffness matrix of a cracked shaft considering the longitudinal translation and axial rotation is first presented. This makes it possible to analysize the dynamic response of a practical shaft by FEM. A Fortran- 77 program is developed which can be used to calculate the two and three dimensional vibration of a shaft containing more than one transverse crack, concentrated mass and elastic foundation. It can also be used in multi-span <b>shaft</b> with different <b>cross-section</b> and applied to some loads...|$|R

Among suitable forming technologies, spin extrusion is a pioneering and particularly flexible hollow-shaping technique. All outside form elements, straight or stepped cylinders, cones or spherical rotation elements emerge {{just from the}} kinematics of tools. The inside hollow shapes, as e. g. circular <b>cross-sections,</b> <b>shaft</b> to collar connections such as spherical triangles, polygons, splines or dovetail forms are manufactured with a shaping mandrel.
