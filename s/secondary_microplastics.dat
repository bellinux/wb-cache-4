50|$|Two classifications of {{microplastics}} currently exist: {{primary microplastics}} are manufactured {{and are a}} direct result of human material and product use, and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> are microscopic plastic fragments derived from the breakdown of larger plastic debris like the macroscopic parts that make up the bulk of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Both types are recognized to persist in the environment at high levels, particularly in aquatic and marine ecosystems.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of these}} include dust from {{car and truck}} tyres, {{synthetic}} textiles, ropes, paint and waste treatment. These sources of microplastics are quite recently recognized and are somewhere between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics.</b> A Norwegian Environment Agency review report about microplastics published in early 2015 states it would be beneficial to classify these sources as primary, as long as microplastics from these sources are added from human society at the [...] "start of the pipe", and their emissions are inherently a result of human material and product use and not secondary defragmentation in nature.|$|E
40|$|The term {{microplastic}} is {{used for}} small plastic particles of different origins, sizes and chemical composition. The exact sizes of microplastics have not been uniformly defined in the relevant literature, they mostly range from 0. 001 mm to less than 5 mm. Basically, two types of microplastics are distinguished, primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastic.</b> Primary microplastic is specific produced industrially {{in the form of}} plastic-based granulates or pellets. <b>Secondary</b> <b>microplastic</b> occurs through chemical and physical ageing and degradation processes in products such as plastic bags and plastic bottles. As far as can be ascertained today, <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastic</b> is the main source of entry into the environment. Currently, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) does not have any reliable data on the chemical composition, particle size or concentration of microplastic particles in food. Due to a lack of robust data, a health risk assessment of the consumption of food contaminated with microplastic particles is presently not possible. The BfR has requested the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for a scientific opinion on the occurrence of microplastic and nanoplastic particles in food, especially in seafood...|$|R
40|$|Plastic litter in {{the marine}} {{environment}} is receiving increasing attention. Namely, through rivers, ship traffic and recreation is anthropogenically produced litter introduced into the marine environment. Sun radiation and mechanical impact degrade plastic items into smaller pieces, i. e. <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastic.</b> Alternatively, primary microplastics from cosmetic products can enter the environment through waste water drains. The number of microplastics at beaches can vary substantially. In this study, the occurrence and the quantity of the microplastic in the Slovenian beach sediments was investigated. Samples were taken in March 2017. Microplastic particles were isolated by density separation in an aqueous solution of common salt (NaCl). The floating particles were separated and filtered over a 100 -µm metal filter. Assumed microplastics were photographed and their characteristics were noted (i. e. source, form, color) and stored in glass vials with a Teflon lid. Potential contamination during the processing of the samples was controlled with a white filter in petri dish exposed to air. The reliability of the separation method was confirmed by a recovery experiment which yielded 86 - 90 % recovery of intentionally added <b>microplastic.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>microplastic</b> were present as fragments, films, and fibers. However, the present study showed lower concentrations of microplastic at the Slovenian beaches than previously reported by Laglbauer et al. (2014, Marine Pollution Bulletin  89 : 356 - 366). The differences in the concentrations are probably due to seasonal fluctuations of microplastic concentration. Moreover, contamination was not considered in the former study. Potential pollutants of the Slovenian coast are tourism, industry, sea- and road traffic, wastewater treatment plant, port, and agriculture. Since Laglbauer et al. (2014) excluded tourism as the contributor of the microplastic pollution the real contributors need to be identified. Polluted beaches are not attractive and may scare tourists and, thus, impair economy...|$|R
50|$|Recreational and {{commercial}} fishing, marine vessels, and marine industries are all sources of plastic that can directly enter the marine environment, posing {{a risk to}} biota both as macroplastics, and as <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> following long-term degradation. Tourism and recreational activities account for an array of plastics being discarded along beaches and coastal resorts. Marine debris observed on beaches also arises from beaching of materials carried on in-shore and ocean currents. Fishing gear {{is one of the}} most commonly noted plastic debris items with a marine source. Discarded or lost fishing gear, including plastic monofilament line and nylon netting, is typically neutrally buoyant and can therefore drift at variable depths within the oceans.|$|E
30|$|Consequently, {{quantitative}} {{information on the}} contribution of different sources to the overall amount of macro- and, especially microplastics in the environment is generally lacking [8, 104, 105]. There are, e.g. no reliable estimates {{of the percentage of}} plastic packaging material reaching the marine environment [25]. Given the large amount of macroplastics entering the environment, it is generally assumed that most microplastics in the environment are <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics,</b> i.e. a result of weathering of larger plastic debris [11, 25]. However, fragmentation rates of macroplastics are largely unknown [57, 59, 99]. As a result, no {{quantitative information}} is available on the relative contribution of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> to the overall amount of microplastics in the environment [50].|$|E
30|$|As {{a result}} of the {{widespread}} use of plastics there are a great number of sources of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> in the environment. First estimates indicate that the contribution of personal care products to the overall amount of microplastics in the environment is of minor relevance. Abrasion and fragmentation of larger plastic items and of materials containing synthetic polymers have been considered as much more relevant.|$|E
40|$|Marine litter is {{attracting}} attention {{of scientists and}} environmentalists worldwide, as it is easily entering the marine environment through river runoff, sewage systems or winds. Accordingly, ports, industries, maritime and road traffic, tourism and agriculture are the main producers of litter. Synthetic plastic products are particularly hazardous to the environment, as they are fragmenting into numerous tiny microplastics {{under the influence of}} intense solar radiation and mechanical agitation. Microplastics can originate from larger plastic items (i. e. <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics)</b> or are entering the marine environment as primary microplastics. A steadily growing number of publications and reports are documenting the continuous littering of the marine environment and the consequences of microplastics on marine biota. In this study, the occurrence, distribution and composition of microplastics is being investigated in sediments of Slovenian beaches. Sediment samples were collected in March 2017 and are currently being analysed for comparison with results from a previous study conducted in July 2012. Microplastics are recovered from sediments by density separation and filtration. The particles are analysed by infrared spectroscopy to identify the polymer type of the plastics. Microplastics are abundant in Slovenian beach sediments. Most of the items are of irregular shape, including fibres, films and fragments, indicating that the particles mostly constitute <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics.</b> In the previous study, it has been proven that tourism is not the main producer of microplastics. Accordingly, major polluters of the Slovenian coast are yet to be identified. The applied approach will provide in-depth information on the plastic pollution on the coast of Slovenia. The data generated in this project will be of societal importance, as pollution tends to reduce the aesthetic value of the environment and can, thus, reduce revenues from Slovenian tourism...|$|E
30|$|Primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> {{as well as}} macroplastics {{may enter}} the {{environment}} through wastewater. During the primary (mechanical) treatment step in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), coarse suspended or floating solids are removed from the wastewater by screens or sieves. Sand and other heavy particles are retained in sand traps; floating material is removed in grease separators [84]. Coarse screens have openings of approx. 20 – 50  mm, intermediate screens of approx. 10 – 20  mm and fine screens of approx. 2 – 10  mm [84, 85]. Such screens are suitable for removing macroplastics from wastewater [72, 86, 87], while they will—based on the opening sizes mentioned above—not be able to capture smaller microplastics. Still, microplastics may be captured, if other materials are clogging the screens. Mintenig et al. [31] suggested that buoyant microplastics may be removed in the grease separating step. Microplastics with a high density such as PU {{can be expected to}} sediment and, thus, to be captured in the sand trap or with the sludge.|$|E
30|$|Since <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> are {{generated}} when larger plastic materials fragment, sources of macroplastics and their routes {{of entry into}} the environment are considered in this section. It {{has been estimated that}} about 75 – 90  % of the plastic debris in the marine environment originates from land-based and about 10 – 25  % from ocean-based sources [25, 70]. General littering, dumping of plastic waste and loss from inappropriately managed landfill sites and during waste collection are assumed {{to be the most important}} routes of entry of plastic materials into the environment. Windblown litter is also lost from recycling facilities [60, 70 – 72]. In this context, it should be noted that a large percentage of the produced plastics is used for packaging, i.e. for products with a short service life [1]. In industrialised countries, waste that is deposited in landfills is usually covered regularly with soil or a synthetic material, and the landfill is surrounded by a fence to prevent that debris is blown away. However, in developing regions this is often not the case [71 – 73]. In addition, large amounts of plastic debris can enter the marine environment during natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis and strong sea [18, 74, 75].|$|E
40|$|Microplastics {{enter the}} {{environment}} {{as a result of}} larger plastic items breaking down (‘secondary’) and from particles originally manufactured at that size (‘primary’). Personal care productsare an important contributor of <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> (typically referred to as ‘microbeads’), for example in toothpaste, facial scrubs and soaps. Consumers {{play an important role in}} influencing the demand for these products and therefore any associated environmental consequences. Hence we need to understand public perceptions in order to help reduce emissions of microplastics. This study explored awareness of plastic microbeads in personal care products in three groups: environmental activists, trainee beauticians and university students in South West England. Focus groups were run, where participants were shown the quantity of microbeads found in individual high-street personal care products. Qualitative analysis showed that while the environmentalists were originally aware of the issue, it lacked visibility and immediacy for the beauticians and students. Yet when shown the amount of plastic in a range of familiar everyday personal care products, all participants expressed considerable surprise and concern at the quantities and potential impact. Regardless of any perceived level of harm in the environment, the consensus was that their use was unnatural and unnecessary. This research could inform future communications with the public and industry as well as policy initiatives to phase out the use of microbeads...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{illustrates}} {{the breadth of}} research methods in the Social and Behavioural Sciences and how these may {{be applied to the}} issue of environmental microplastics. Microplastics are a human-caused problem and we need to understand the human dimension in order to address it. Nine key points are emphasised in this paper and follow from the key observation that humans, through their perceptions, decisions and actions, are pivotal to the issue of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> in the environment: (1) human perception and behaviour can be subject to systematic and rigorous scientific study, using theory-based hypothesis testing, measurement and statistical analysis; (2) qualitative methods can explore new areas of research and provide novel, in-depth insights; (3) best practice and recommendations exist for measuring social data; (4) quantitative cross-sectional approaches can test how important social factors are for key outcomes (e. g., the role of perceived risk, values, social norms for behaviour); (5) experimental quantitative approaches can compare randomised groups and study cause–effect relations; (6) certain limitations and challenges are unique to research with people; (7) communications and interventions (e. g., change campaigns, new regulation, education programmes) should be developed based on scientific insights into human thought and behaviour and then evaluated systematically; (8) social researchers should work towards developing standardised tools and protocols; and (9) social research on microplastics and its determinants is in its infancy and a number of important research questions remain to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microplastics}} on zooplankton are an increasing environmental concern. Both primary microplastics that are produced as constituents of cosmetic products, {{as well as}} <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> that are formed by degradation of larger plastic debris, are ubiquitous in aquatic environments. Today, primary microplastics are being phased out and replaced by plant-derived bioplastics. Whether these new materials have similar effects as oil-based microplastics on animals is currently unknown. Here, we compare the effects of secondary microplastic exposure to Daphnia magna, using polylactic acid (PLA) as a representative for bioplastics and polystyrene (PS) for oil-based plastics. To increase the ecological relevance of our tests, we also provided treatments where the particles were coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{as a means to}} simulate the coating of biofilms which readily form on particles under natural conditions. Furthermore, to be able to differentiate the effects of general particles from those specific to microplastics, kaolin clay was used as a control treatments, as well as one treatment containing only algae. The objectives were to test the influence of particles on feeding rates, reproduction and growth. PS caused a higher mortality, decreased feeding rate and reproductive output, while PLA and kaolin did not produce any negative effects. BSA did not {{have a significant effect on}} reproduction or growth. However, a decrease in reproduction was observed in the plastic treatments. Degradation of PS into styrene monomers is suggested as a possible explanation for the observed toxicity and effects on life history parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), the EFSA Panel for Contaminants in the Food Chain was asked to deliver a {{statement}} {{on the presence of}} microplastics and nanoplastics in food, with particular focus on seafood. Primary microplastics are plastics originally manufactured to be that size, while <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics</b> originate from fragmentation. Nanoplastics can originate from engineered material or can be produced during fragmentation of microplastic debris. Microplastics range from 0. 1 to 5, 000 μm and nanoplastics from approximately 1 to 100 nm (0. 001 – 0. 1 μm). There is no legislation for microplastics and nanoplastics as contaminants in food. Methods are available for identification and quantification of microplastics in food, including seafood. Occurrence data are limited. In contrast to microplastics no methods or occurrence data in food are available for nanoplastics. Microplastics can contain on average 4 % of additives and the plastics can adsorb contaminants. Both additives and contaminants can be of organic as well of inorganic nature. Based on a conservative estimate the presence of microplastics in seafood would have a small effect on the overall exposure to additives or contaminants. Toxicity and toxicokinetic data are lacking for both microplastics and nanoplastics for a human risk assessment. It is recommended that analytical methods should be further developed for microplastics and developed for nanoplastics and standardised, in order to assess their presence, identity and to quantify their amount in food. Furthermore, quality assurance should be in place and demonstrated. For microplastics and nanoplastics, occurrence data in food, including effects of food processing, in particular, for the smaller sized particles (< 150 μm) should be generated. Research on the toxicokinetics and toxicity, including studies on local effects in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, are needed as is research on the degradation of microplastics and potential formation of nanoplastics in the human GI tract...|$|E
40|$|Plastics {{are present}} in every aspects of our {{everyday}} life. The combination of properties such as its versatility, light weight, strength and durability, have made plastic a very popular material {{for use in a}} myriad of applications. Their widespread use has driven the annual global production from 1. 7 million tonnes (MT) in the 1950 s to 299 MT in 2013. Although the societal benefits of plastic are undeniable, there are serious environmental concerns associated with it. One aspect of this is microplastic pollution. Plastics {{are present in}} the environment {{in a wide variety of}} sizes, but the smallest form is called microplastic, and comprises a heterogeneous mixture of plastic particles ranging in size from several millimetres to a few micrometres. These microplastics are present in the environment as ‘microplastics by design’, so-called primary microplastics, or arise from the degradation of larger plastic litter. While the former are typically resin pellets and microbeads associated with industrial spillages and the use of cosmetics, the latter (or <b>secondary</b> <b>microplastics)</b> are formed through the action of degrading forces such as UV radiation and physical abrasion. Another important source comprises fibres originating from synthetic clothing. The presence of these microplastics has been demonstrated in different marine compartments worldwide such as inter- and subtidal sediments and in (sub) surface waters. Because of their small dimensions, microplastics have a similar size range as planktonic organisms and other suspended particles, making them available to an array of marine invertebrates commonly not affected by larger marine debris. The potential for ingestion and potential associated (adverse) effects have resulted in the recognition of microplastics as contaminants of concern. This type of pollution is, however, scarcly regulated in terms of production, use and emissions neither in Europe nor in the rest of the world. Although there is an increasing number of studies available on the presence and potential effects of microplastic pollution and it is likely that the amount of microplastics in the oceans will continue to increase in the future, so far no real risk assessment of present and future risks of microplastic to marine systems and human health has been performed. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis was to perform a assessment of the environmental and human health risks associated with microplastic pollution using both data generated during this thesis as well as those available in literature. While the main theme of this dissertation was the marine environment, we started off in the freshwater environment, more specifically a river, as they are often considered major contributors of microplastics to the marine environment. In Chapter 2, we therefore investigated the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in sediment of the Belgian Scheldt river. These sediments showed high spatial variability in microplastic abundance, with the highest concentrations detected in the vicinity of suspected point sources, i. e. a plastic production plant in the harbour of Antwerp and a sewage treatment plant (STP) near Ghent. Near these facilities, sediment microplastic abundances were up to 10 times higher those observed at other sampling stations, indicating an important contribution of these land-based point sources to environmental microplastic abundances. In fact, at the majority of sampling locations, microplastic abundances were higher than those reported for marine compartments. The sewage treatment plant (STP) discharging directly into the river was investigated in more detail, since a lot of household and industrial applications will generate microplastics that are discharged together with the domestic and industrial sewage. Our findings confirm the results of previous pilot projects: sewage contains large amounts of microplastics, which are insufficiently removed during the sewage treatment process. As a result, large amounts of microplastics are discharged into the environment on a daily basis. With this initial assessment of river sediments, we were able to identify important point sources of microplastics and demonstrate the magnitude of microplastic pollution in rivers. In Chapter 3, a comprehensive assessment of marine litter in three environmental compartments of Belgian coastal waters was performed to establish a baseline for future marine litter monitoring and research. Although microplastic pollution is not as obvious as macrolitter, it represents an important part of the overall plastic pollution problem. While at Belgian beaches macroplastics are dominant with respect to total weight, this relationship shifts towards a dominance of microplastic at the sea surface and especially on the seafloor. On the beach, the weight of macroplastic litter is over an order of magnitude higher than that of microplastics. On the Belgian Continental Shelf (BCS), micro- and macroplastics represent the same weight fraction at the sea surface, while on the seafloor there is a kilogram of macroplastics for every 400 kg of microplastics. In Chapter 4, the techniques used to assess microplastic abundance in Chapter 3 were applied on deep-sea sediments, in the first ever assessment of microplastic pollution of the deep sea. In this way, we established that microplastic presence in sediments is not only limited to accumulation hot spots such as the continental shelf, but that they are also ubiquitously present in some of the most remote of marine environments, the deep sea (up to 4800 m depth). Microplastic concentrations observed here were substantially lower than those observed on the BCS. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the world’s seas and oceans, and has reached remote and largely unknown environments such as the deep sea In the first part of this dissertation, we demonstrated that microplastics are ubiquitously present in the marine environment, and this a wide variety of marine compartments and systems. Because of their small dimensions (ranging from a few micrometres up to five millimetres) microplastics represent a collection of particles that are of particular, biological, interest: since they are within the same size range as small particulate matter, they can be taken up by marine biota, especially invertebrates. These invertebrates often represent the lower levels of marine food webs, and are hence of great importance to marine systems. In Chapter 5, we studied the uptake of microplastics under field conditions, i. e. in organisms exposed to ambient microplastic concentrations. The two species under investigation, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the lugworm Arenicola marina, represented two different feeding strategies: while the bivalve species is a filter feeder, the polychaete was representative of a deposit feeding strategy. Although exposed to environmental concentrations of microplastics, which are thousands of times lower than those used in laboratory trails investigating microplastic ingestion in these species, microplastics were detected in all organisms collected in the field. The observed microplastic body burdens in these animals were, however, relatively low (less than 1 particle per gram of tissue). Yet, the accumulation of microplastics in these animals could result in the transfer of these particles to higher trophic level organisms. In a subsequent proof-of-principle laboratory experiment the potential (adverse) effects of microplastic exposure and ingestion on the organisms’ energy metabolism (cellular energy allocation) was assessed. Although organisms were exposed to high concentrations of microplastics, no significant adverse effects on the organisms’ overall energy budget were observed. As seafood, including shellfish such as mussels, is consumed by humans worldwide, the presence of marine microplastics in “naturally exposed” species indicates a risk to human health and food safety. In Chapter 6, we therefore extended the assessment of microplastic accumulation in natural systems to include two species of economic interest: the commercially grown bivalves Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas. In accordance with the findings of chapter 5, microplastics were recovered from the soft tissues of both bivalve species grown for human consumption. These results hence indicate that, through the consumption of shellfish, microplastics will end up in the human food chain. Based on consumption data obtained from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), it was calculated that European shellfish consumers will ingest between 1, 800 and 11, 000 microplastics per year, depending on whether they are minor or top shellfish consumers. The implications of this presence of microplastics in seafood, i. e. whether there truly is a risk to human food safety, were investigated in the Chapter 7. Assessing possible (adverse) effects of microplastic ingestion to humans consuming contaminated seafood, was achieved using the intestinal cell line Caco- 2. While no cytotoxic effects were observed in the intestinal cells exposed to microplastics, we did observe translocation of particles. Already in the first hour after administering the microplastics, a small fraction could be observed on the basal side of the cells, indicating transport of the particles through the epithelial monolayer. Based on the average concentration of microplastics in and the average consumption of shellfish in humans, we calculated that 3 to 60 microplastics will translocate to the underlying circulatory system on an annual basis. However, we are still unable to assess the adverse effects of this translocation, as data are currently lacking in literature. Finally, all aspects of microplastic pollution investigated in the previous chapters were integrated into a risk assessment. Indeed, while it is often stated that microplastics pose a risk to the marine environment, this has never been thoroughly assessed. The risk assessment, performed in Chapter 8, suggests that current microplastic levels (i. e. anno 2015) are of minor concern to marine systems. Concentrations of pelagic microplastics do not appear to constitute any risk to biota living in the water column. However, in sediments, microplastics can reach very high levels, especially in highly impacted coastal areas (e. g. industrial harbours). Here, we demonstrated that these current microplastic concentrations already exceed safe, predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC), indicating there is a risk for biota inhabiting these sediments. By the end of the century, we predict an 60 -fold increase in total microplastic abundances. While we see this increase in all marine compartments studied, only highly impacted sediments (this time both coastal and deep-sea sediments) will exceed the predicted safe level by 2100. With regards to human health, we can state that microplastic ingestion through the consumption of contaminated shellfish will not pose significant risks. Current and future (i. e. 2015 vs. 2100) ingestion patterns in individuals consuming shellfish will not bring about significant health risks. Neither direct effects on intestinal cells nor any indirect effects associated with chemicals transported from plastic to shellfish for human consumption were identified. However, it has to be mentioned that currently toxicity data regarding the (adverse) effects associated with translocated microplastics in humans (and other vertebrates) are lacking. Although still very preliminary, the risk assessment presented here gives the indication that microplastics may not be as harmful as previously thought. Yet, we stress that the lack of an apparent risk associated with microplastic pollution should never be considered a safe conduct to continue our present attitude towards plastic and plastic management. It would be immensely irresponsible and negligent to seize the apparent (current) lack of adverse impacts associated with microplastics to give up on the efforts made and to be made to reduce this type of pollution...|$|E
