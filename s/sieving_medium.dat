Two {{relatively}} high concentration 4 % and 6 % the replaceable Linear polyacrylamide(LPA) gel {{was used as}} the <b>sieving</b> <b>medium.</b> An extensive series of experiments has been performed using DNA fragments ranging in size from 80 to 587 base pairs; the properties such as the mobilities, the width at half height, and the resolution were compared. The electric field was changed from 100 V/cm to 375 V/cm. From the experiment results, it is shown: increasing the gel concentration from 4 %LPA to 6 %LPA can not improve the resolution to separate the DNA sample (the length of fragments≤ 600 bp).

The dietary treatments were as follows: fine texture (F) for wheat sieved by 4 mm, medium texture 1 (M 1) for 5 mm <b>sieved</b> wheat, <b>medium</b> texture 2 (M 2) for 6 mm sieved wheat, coarse texture (C) for 7 mm sieved wheat and whole (W) for whole wheat. All diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous, and all other main dietary ingredients except wheat were ground to pass 5 mm sieve. The performance parameters were feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio from 0 to 42 d. In vivo viscosity of ileal digesta, fresh lengths and weights of whole digestive tract {{and the amount of}} abdominal fat were also determined for all treatments. The results revealed that the best performance was obtained from the C diets, the F diet resulted in the lowest performance and those resulting from the M 1, M 2 and W were intermediate.

40|$|The {{movement}} of salts in soils following application of feedlot wastes was studied experimentally and theoretically. The {{objectives of the}} study were (1) to evaluate the {{movement of}} salts in the soil following heavy application of animal wastes as related to the aggregate sizes of manure and water management practices and (2) to develop a mathematical model to predict the movement of salts within the soil and manure mixture. In the experimental study, air dried manure was formed into three distinct sizes, small (to pass 40 mesh <b>sieve),</b> <b>medium</b> (0. 9 am in diameter, 1. 2 cm in length), and large (1. 8 cm in diameter, 1. 8 cm in length). Soil columns of 15 cm inside diameter were packed with 30 cm of a soil-manure mixture over a 10 cm depth of soil. The manure application rate was equivalent to 100 metric tons/ha calculated {{on the basis of the}} cross-sectional area of the column. A total of five pore volumes of water was passed through the soil under continuous and intermittent water applications. The leachates were collected in 1 / 2 pore volume increments and the volume, EC, and pH determined immediately. Within 48 hours of the sampling, the leachates were analyzed for Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, and five trace elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Ni). The EC of the leachate for the first 1 / 2 pore volume was significantly (1 % level) highest for the small-sized aggregates and the lowest for the large aggregate treatments under both moisture regimes. During the second increment, the order was reversed. In the later water applications, the EC for small aggregates was higher than the other sizes. There were no significant differences between the EC of the leachate from medium and large aggregate treatments during the later periods under either water treatments. Under both moisture regimes, the amount of Na removed from small aggregates decreased more rapidly than the other sizes. More than 90 % of the total Na added to the system by manure was removed from the small aggregate treatment. In contrast, the highest amount of K removed (895 mg from small-sized aggregates under continuous leaching' represents about 35 % of the total amount present In the manure applied. More Ca was removed from the small-sized aggregate treatments under both moisture regimes than was added by manure application. As for Mg the pattern of the removal was similar to that of Ca. No Cl was detected in the leachate after the fifth 1 / 2 pore volume was displaced. A mathematical model was developed to predict the movement of readily soluble ions such as Na, K, and Cl from different aggregate sizes of manure. The theoretical curves were compared with earlier experimental data and the parameters appearing in the mathematical equation were estimated. The results for Cl, Na, and K are presented graphically, and the estimated parameters as well as the values of the square roots of the sum of the squares between the theoretical and experimental values as percentage of the sum of the experimental values (SSR) are reported. From the low value of SSR's, it is evident that the model can predict the movement of the readily soluble ions from different aggregate sizes of manure quite accurately. A discussion on the suitability of the model for different sizes of manure aggregates and also a comparison between two different procedures to fit the model to the experimental data are given. In addition, a three phase theoretical model was developed to describe the movement of readily soluble ions from a soil-manure-water system. Experimental data were used in testing the model. The results for Na, K, and Cl are presented graphically. Estimated parameters for the experimental system and the values of SSR are presented. This model also can predict the movement of readily soluble ions from a soil-manure-water system...|$|R
40|$|Stimuli-responsive {{separation}} membranes with tunable molecular scale pore size, {{which are}} desirable for on-demand sieving of targeted macromolecules, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. It is well-known that magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) can generate heat {{when exposed to}} an alternating magnetic field (AMF), due to hysteresis and relaxation losses. When combined with thermo-responsive polymers, the heat generated by MNP can trigger the phase or conformation change of polymer and therefore by their synergistic effect, magneto-responsive material systems can be designed. In this study, by using iron oxide MNP as localized heater and thermo-responsive Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogel as <b>sieving</b> <b>medium</b> and actuator, two kinds of magneto-responsive membranes with excellent responsivity and tunability for molecular sieving have been developed. One type is magneto-hydrogel pore-filled membrane constructed by post modification of commercial polyethylene terephthalate (PET) track-etched membrane. Such membranes use the hydrogel mesh as the ultrafiltration <b>sieving</b> <b>medium,</b> and the iron oxide entrapped in the hydrogel network as localized heater. It has been demonstrated that by manipulating AMF and thus controlling the heat generated by the incorporated MNP, the micro-syneresis of PNIPAAm network can be locally triggered and magneto-responsive molecule sieving can be achieved. The other type is polyethersulfone (PES) mixed matrix membrane blended with prefabricated PNIPAAm nanogel and iron oxide MNP fabricated by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. It has the PNIPAAm nanogels as responsive gates and the co-blended iron oxide nanoparticles as local heaters. By manipulating the swollen/shrunken state of PNIPAAm nanogels triggered by the heat generation of nearby MNP, the molecular sieving performance of the membrane can be adjusted. Overall, important parameters affecting the construction of both kinds of membranes have been studied, their stimuli-responsive barrier properties including thermo- and magneto-responses have been investigated, and their structure and molecular sieving effect in the ultrafiltration range have been evaluated. Based on the results, correlations between synthesis, structure and separation performance of the novel magneto-responsive membranes and their potential for applications have been discussed in this work...|$|E
40|$|This CRADA was {{developed}} to enable ORNL to assist Protein Discovery, Inc. to develop a novel biomolecular separation system based on an ORNL patent application 'Photoelectrochemical Molecular Comb' by Thundat, Ferrell, and Brown. The Molecular Comb concept is based on creating light-induced charge carriers at a semiconductor-liquid interface, which is kept at a potential control such that a depletion layer is formed in the semiconductor. Focusing light from a low-power illumination source creates electron-hole pairs, which get separated in the depletion layer. The light-induced charge carriers reaching the surface attract oppositely charged biomolecules present in the solution. The solution is a buffer solution with very small concentrations of biomolecules. As the focused light is moved {{across the surface of}} the semiconductor-liquid interface, the accumulated biomolecules follow the light beam.

In this article we describe a silicon microfabricated device to measure the stretching of tethered DNA in electric fields. Upon application of an electric field, electro-osmosis generates bulk fluid flow in the device, and a protocol for eliminating this flow by attaching a polymer brush to all silicon oxide surfaces is shown to be effective. Data on the steady stretching of DNA in constant electric fields is presented. The data corroborate the approximate theory of hydrodynamic equivalence, indicating that DNA is not free-draining in the presence of both electric and nonelectric forces. Finally, these data provide the first quantitative test of a Stigter and Bustamante's detailed theory of electrophoretic stretching of DNA without adjustable parameters.

Therefore, we have firstly fulfilled such an implementation and successfully set a new record for solving the DLP in GF(36 n), the DLP in GF(3671) of 676 -bit size. We conclude that n = 97 case, where there are many implementations of the T pairing, is not recommended in practical use. In addition, we also conduct comparisons between JL 06 -FFS and an earlier version, named JL 02 -FFS, by practical experiments.

Poly(2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid) (polyAMPS) polymers of a uniform distribution of molecular mass were synthesized and used as novel spacers in ITP. Since these polymeric spacers are strongly acidic species, their ionic charges remain constant over a wide pH range, so that their ionic mobilities are governed solely by their molecular masses and not by the pH of the milieu. A modification of ITP known as telescope electrophoresis was used to separate a number of acidic dyes of varying ionic mobility, using polyAMPS polymers as spacers.

40|$|Seminal bioanalytical {{technologies}} for high-throughput analysis, such as flow cytometry and capillary electrophoresis, were leveraging microfluidic physical phenomena {{long before the}} advent of the term “microfluidics”. Transitioning from the initial solid-state micro-electronic fabrication approaches, microfluidic fabrication has moved towards polymer based technologies that are amenable to a rapid design, prototype, and test development cycle. In my dissertation, I took advantage of these features to create new tools for performing electrophoresis-based protein assays over a range of applications, including, rapid low-power electrophoretic immunoassays, open-microfluidic ‘soft-MEMS’ platform for high-throughput protein analysis, and spatially & temporally controlled separation media for enhanced single-cell western blotting assays. Rapid low-power electrophoretic immunoassay: To reduce the power requirements for a portable electrophoresis platform, we developed a new assay format that minimized the separation length to 1 mm for an electrophoretic immunoassay. The polyacrylamide gel moving boundary electrophoresis (PAGMBE) assay consumed just 3 μW and was completed in less than 30 seconds using only a 9 V battery - the lowest voltage reported for an electrophoretic protein separation. Open-microfluidic ‘soft-MEMS’ platform: We developed an open-channel hydrogel architecture for rapid protein analysis. Directly photo-patterned free-standing polyacrylamide gel (fsPAG) microstructures support electrophoretic performance rivalling that of microfluidic platforms while maintaining easy interfacing with automated robotic controllers and downstream processing (e. g., sample spotters, immunological probing). We demonstrated 96 concurrent SDS protein fsPAGE separations in under 5 minutes. Spatially varied separation media: Grayscale mask photo-patterning of gel density realized periodic 1 mm gradient gels arrays for single cell analysis. These dense arrays with a spatially varied <b>sieving</b> <b>medium</b> enabled concurrent protein sizing for 1000 s of single cells in parallel. We demonstrated the single cell gradient gel western blotting to analyze multiple targets in the Her 2 signaling pathway in a primary breast cancer tissue that varied by an order of magnitude in molecular weight. This broad-range protein sizing 1 mm gradient gel condition corresponds to the molecular weight range for 78 % of the human proteome. Pore-expansion for enhanced intra-gel assays: Protein separations in dense sieving media followed by in-gel immobilization enable high performance separations and minimal protein loss. This assay integration is necessary for processing low abundance samples – for example the protein content of a single cell. Unfortunately, for dense <b>sieving</b> <b>medium</b> prevents easy access for downstream assays on the immobilized proteins. We developed an active hydrogel matrix that could maintain a dense form to achieve a high-resolution protein separation and immobilization, then after a simulation, could transition to a lower-density form that is more accessible to antibody probing and the delivery of other large-reagents. In summary, this dissertation focused on high-throughput protein analysis platforms that are designed towards the goal of massively parallelized proteomics, a major unrealized goal from bioanalytical technology...|$|E
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is the workhorse {{of countless}} analytical laboratories {{and is used}} routinely in various industries including pharmaceutical, forensic and clinical applications. Basically, CE is a method for separating charged molecular species in a buffer-filled capillary by the application of an electric field; the analytes move {{from one end of}} the capillary to the detector at the other end at speeds determined by their charge, size and shape. Generally, in free solution CE uniformly charged polyelectrolytes (such as DNA) are free-draining, meaning that their speed is independent of their size. Hence, until recently, a gel or other <b>sieving</b> <b>medium</b> has been necessary for the separation of polyelectrolytes; however, modifying uniformly charged polymers on the molecular level, via conjugation to uncharged polymers, allows for separation in free solution CE. In this thesis, advancements to the theory of free solution electrophoresis of polyelectrolytes, in particular, to the theories for two new free solution electrophoresis methods relying on conjugation, are presented. The first method, called End Labelled Free Solution Electrophoresis (ELFSE), can be used to sequence DNA, a negatively charged polymer in solution. Two different means of improving the resolution of ELFSE are predicted, one based on the molecular end effect, the other based on using a controlled electro-osmotic flow. In addition, a theory for the segregation of the DNA and label coils in ELFSE is presented. The second method is called Free Solution Conjugate Electrophoresis (FSCE); it allows for characterization of a sample of neutral polymers differing in length. The relevant theory, developed herein, elucidates how to accurately determine the molar mass distribution of the sample through FSCE measurements. In addition, supporting theories are developed that clarify the correct equation for the diffusion coefficient of molecules undergoing free solution electrophoresis, as well as illustrate that under ideal conditions, a viscosity gradient within the capillary serves only to decrease resolution and hence can not be used to improve performance. These theoretical studies constitute the six articles presented in this thesis. In addition, a comprehensive review article covering the development of ELFSE over the last decade, the theoretical concepts used to predict the ultimate performance of ELFSE for DNA sequencing, and the technological advances that are needed to speed the development of competitive ELFSE-based sequencing and separation technologies, is given in Appendix A. The predicted improvement in ELFSE resolution based on the end effect theory was also proven experimentally; the article with these findings is provided in Appendix B...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} aims at the {{recovery}} of residual copper from electrical cables with low content of copper (less than 5 %). The sample originated from the tailings of electrical cables that had been previously subjected to copper recycling treatment. The tailings were successively treated with physical methods (<b>sieving,</b> heavy <b>medium</b> sep- aration in ZnCl 2 bath, and counter-current separation) and electrochemical methods (cementation, electrowin- ning). Sieving {{seems to be more}} efficient than gravity separation methods, since, for 1. 00 mm aperture and sieving time as short as 2 min, the undersize copper grade of the product was 57 % in copper (from 4 % in the feed), with corresponding copper recovery of 53 %. Longer sieving times or larger apertures led to products with higher copper recovery but of lower grade. As regards cementation, preliminary tests were carried out to investigate the effect of pH using high purity CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O instead of dissolving metallic copper. Subsequent tests using the sieving undersize product of the scrap copper wire confirmed the results of the preliminary tests; in addition to pH, this product was also used to investigate the effects of the attacking chemical (H 2 SO 4, HCl, H 2 O 2), sacrificial metal (aluminium, iron scrap), temperature, and surface area on cementation. The results show that cementation of the dissolved copper from scrap wire is efficient at pH = 2. 5 – 3. 2, with sufficient copper recovery within a few hours. Also, electrowinning tests on the undersize sieving product proved the feasibility to obtain pure copper by electrodeposition onto stainless steel cathode with lead anode, without contamination of the electrolytic solution. In both methods, copper purity degrades when HCl acid is used instead of H 2 SO 4. Espe- cially with the use of H 2 SO 4 in electrowinning, it was observed that lead anode is passivated when the solution is entirely depleted from copper ions. The results of the current work clearly demonstrate the feasibility to obtain pure copper from low-grade electric wire scraps by successively submitting the tailings to sieving and cementation...|$|R

The dietary treatments were as follows: fine texture (F) for wheat sieved by 4 mm, medium texture 1 (M 1) for 5 mm <b>sieved</b> wheat, <b>medium</b> texture 2 (M 2) for 6 mm sieved wheat, coarse texture (C) for 7 mm sieved wheat and whole (W) for whole wheat. All diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous, and all other main dietary ingredients except wheat were ground to pass 5 mm sieve. The performance parameters were feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio from 0 to 42 d. In vivo viscosity of ileal digesta, fresh lengths and weights of whole digestive tract {{and the amount of}} abdominal fat were also determined for all treatments. The results revealed that the best performance was obtained from the C diets, the F diet resulted in the lowest performance and those resulting from the M 1, M 2 and W were intermediate. However, the worsened performance induced by F and W starter diets of 30 % wheat up to 21 d old was statistically become insignificant at later ages with finishing diets of 50 % in comparison with the M 1, M 2 and C diets, suggesting that particle size of wheat grain lead to significant changes in bird`s performance at early starting and growing periods, but not during the finishing periods even though the rate of wheat in the diet was increased from 30 to 50 %. The diet of fine wheat particle resulted in significantly higher ileal digesta viscosity than the coarse and whole wheat added diets at both 21 d and 42 d old. It is most likely that increased digesta viscosity and changes in gut size can induce significant changes in the performance of broiler chickens, especially when the birds were young. In short, feeding broiler chickens with fine texture of wheat grain at early growing periods is not suggested due to the increased ileal viscosity and depressed performance although the negative effects of fine texture of wheat grain were overcome during finishing period even with 50 % wheat additions. Medium and coarse texture of wheat grain remained to be the most preferred form of cereal grains although the whole grain is of great importance when no cost is considered for grinding...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to petrographically analyze the Holocene-Pleistocene sandy intervals to determine how sand composition within the offshore Canterbury succession reflects the influence of both south-to-north (shore-parallel) and west-to-east (shore-perpendicular) sediment transport. Sand samples were obtained from both IODP drill core and onshore settings. Thirty-eight offshore core samples (10 - 20 cc) of Holocene-Pleistocene age and nine onshore samples (eight from rivers and one from a beach) were collected and air-dried. Offshore samples were sieved to separate the bulk sand-size fraction (2. 0 - 0. 0625 mm) and the onshore samples were <b>sieved</b> to separate <b>medium,</b> fine, and very-fine sand fractions. A total of 63 thin sections, 38 offshore and 25 onshore, were made and stained for feldspar recognition. Four hundred points (grains) were counted for each sample using the Gazzi-Dickinson method to estimate composition. Onshore samples range from quartzo-feldspathic (South) to lithic rich (Central/Northern). Mica and metamorphic lithic fragment proportions allow for further discrimination. Northern rivers draining mainly Torlesse lithologies are dominated by lower-grade metamorphic lithic fragments. Central rivers, draining the Torlesse to schist (semi-schist) transition, contain more high-grade metamorphic lithic fragments. The southern rivers are mica rich, having been derived from coarse schist. The differences observed in onshore samples allowed for the provenance classification of offshore samples as: 1) Northern (Torlesse Group), 2) Central (Torlesse-Schist Transition Group), 3) Southern (Schist Group), or 4) Mixed. The distribution of the sand composition in the shelf and slope sites reflects a complex interaction of different factors. Compositional trends indicate a dynamic system where shore-parallel and shore-perpendicular processes alternate on the shelf, and shore??? perpendicular processes dominate on the slope. Mixing processes include: shelf currents, transgressive erosion, bioturbation, and earthquake liquefaction, plus potential drilling disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Starch in grains {{represents}} {{the main source}} of dietary energy for monogastric production animals. However, utilization of this energy is not complete due to factors related to grain source and in vivo gastrointestinal conditions. Incomplete starch digestion is a significant economic issue for the pork industry in Australia and prior evidence suggests that there is room for improvement. The general hypothesis of this thesis is that milled grain particle size fractions obtained by sieving posses a significantly different and wide range of functional and compositional properties in relation to digestion and hydrothermal processing. To identify these properties, sorghum and barley grains were milled separately using a 4 mm hammer-mill and then the ground cereals were segregated by size using a series of analytical sieves. Generated different particle sizes were investigated for their properties before and after cooking using extrusion processing. Sorghum was used {{as an example of a}} high starch content grain with low fibre content and barley was used as an example of a grain which contains high levels of fibre. Both grains are widely used as major feed ingredients in Australia, particularly in Queensland. Particle Size Effect on Digestibility The effect of milled uncooked grain particle size on the kinetics of enzymatic starch digestion and starch sources was examined. The in vitro starch digestion for different particle sizes were well fitted by simple first order kinetics for both barley (r 2 range 0. 90 - 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 range 0. 87 - 0. 99). The digestion rate coefficients for different particle sizes decreased with increasing particle size, and were shown to be well fitted by an inverse square relationship for both barley (r 2 = 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 = 0. 98). This supports the hypothesis that the rate-determining step in starch digestion is the diffusion of enzyme through the grain fragment. Quantitatively, the estimated (apparent) diffusion coefficient was estimated for both barley and sorghum (1. 7 and 0. 76 x 10 - 7 cm 2 s- 1, respectively). The apparent diffusion coefficient of á- amylase enzyme in grains was lower by an order of magnitude than that obtained in water, thus quantifying the barriers to amylase diffusion caused by grain structure. Particle Size Distribution in Milled Grain The contribution of individual size fractions to the overall hydration, rheological, and enzyme susceptibility properties of milled grain was evaluated. Sieve fractions were obtained from hammer-milled barley and sorghum grains (eight sieves, 0. 125 mm to 2. 8 mm opening size). Different particle size fractions showed a significant effect on digestion and hydrothermal properties. The extent of starch digestibility varied between different particle size up to 10 fold between the smallest and the largest particle size. When the results obtained for the unfractionated milled grain were compared to the weight average values (calculated from fraction yields and property values for each size fraction), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), and starch digestibility values were not significantly different from values obtained for non-fractionated ground grains of both barley and sorghum. Generally, hydration and digestibility results can be attributed to particle size and composition (starch or soluble fibre) of individual fractions. Response to hydrothermal treatment was different between sorghum and barley. In sorghum, viscosity profiles for the fractions were controlled by starch swelling which became increasingly limited as particle sizes increased. However in barley, viscosity profiles for segregated fractions did not show typical starch-based behaviour and were most likely controlled by the soluble fibre component. The results show the possibility of predicting and manipulating hydration and digestibility properties of ground grains simply by indentifying the particle size distribution of ground grains. Extrusion Processing of Milled Grain Extrusion processing was used in attempts to increase the rate and extent of starch digestibility as well as to characterize processing parameters and extrudate properties. Extrusion processing of three levels of particle size after <b>sieve</b> fractionation (fine, <b>medium</b> and coarse fractions) affected processing parameters (torque, specific mechanical energy [SME], die pressure), extrudate properties (WAI, WSI, expansion index, pasting profiles, and the kinetics and extent of starch digestion). The differences in response to processing parameters and extrudate properties was mainly due to the differences in viscosity during extrusion, while extrusion temperature (100 °C versus 140 °C maximum barrel temperature) had a smaller effect. The different particle size fractions of sorghum and barley both before and after extrusion showed a good fit to first-order kinetics of starch digestion, with all r 2 values above 0. 95. Results of the extrusion experiment suggested that the extent of swelling and gelatinisation during the extrusion may have been further improved by incorporating a pre-conditioning stage prior to extrusion. Particle size had a significant effect on the fractional digestion rate for both grains, but extrusion temperature had no effect. Based on fractional digestion rate values, extrusion processing at low temperature (100 °C) could be an alternative method to fine milling for achieving a high rate and extent of starch digestion. Feed Conversion in Pigs A novel processing procedure, based on separating the coarse fraction after hammer milling and then regrinding this fraction, was used in an attempt to improve growth performance in pigs offered barley and sorghum based diets. The pig feeding trial examined the effect of (a) grain type (barley; sorghum), (b) particle size (ground grain; ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction), and (c) diet form (mash, pellet), on feed conversion ratio (FCR), rate of growth (ROG) and average daily intake (ADI). Particle size had the largest effect on FCR in pigs. Feeding pigs a barley or sorghum based diet in the mash form after regrinding the coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 10 % and in barley by 7. 8 % compared to diets prepared without regrinding the coarse fraction. The form of the diet showed a smaller effect on FCR. In the pellet form, pigs fed sorghum or barley based diets after regrinding the coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 5. 1 % and in barley by 4. 8 % compared to diets prepared without regrinding the coarse fraction. Within grain type, effects of particle size or diet form on ROG and ADI in barley were not statistically significant, although their ratio (FCR) did show significance. In sorghum, pigs offered diets in the ground-mash form had the highest ADI. Pigs offered ground-mash form (ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction) had the highest ROG. The results from this investigation suggest that regrinding the coarse fraction after sieve separation can be used to maximise feed conversion ratio (FCR) for both barley and sorghum based diets. In contrast to single stage grinding through a smaller screen size, the regrinding method used in this work did not result in major increases in fractions with sizes below 0. 5 mm and particularly below 0. 25 mm. This is important as these very small particles cause dust problems in handling and on ingestion. Desired hydration properties, chemical composition, response to hydrothermal treatment, and extent of starch digestion could be manipulated by modifying the distribution of particular size fractions of ground grains. Extrusion of medium and coarse size fractions can enhance digestibility with efficient utilization of thermal energy compared to extrusion of ground but unfractionated grains. This could be a good processing strategy as this work has found that the rate and extent of starch digestion is relatively high for uncooked small particle size fractions. Alternatively, regrinding the coarse fraction after separation could be an alternative method to conventional steam pelletizing for increasing starch digestibility and energy delivery to growing pigs...|$|R
