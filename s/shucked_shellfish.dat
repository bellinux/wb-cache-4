40|$|Bivalve {{shellfish}} readily bioconcentrate pathogenic microbes and substance, such as algal and dinoflagulate toxins, fecal {{viruses and}} bacteria, and naturally present vibrio bacteria. High pressure processing (HPP) is currently {{used as an}} intervention for Vibrio vulnificus bacteria within molluscan shellfish and its potential to inactivate food-borne viruses and bacteria are discussed. Mechanisms of action of high pressure against bacteria and viruses, {{as well as how}} time of pressure application, pressure levels, and pre-pressurization temperature influence inactivation are described. Matrix influences such as ionic strength are noted as important additional considerations. The potential of HPP to influence spoilage and enhance shelf-life of <b>shucked</b> <b>shellfish</b> is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This section {{contains}} {{the requirements for}} high pressure processing (HPP) where it is applied {{for the purpose of}} producing a safe product, by reducing the identified pathogens to acceptable levels. It does not apply to processes that are intended to achieve a technological effect only such as the <b>shucking</b> of <b>shellfish</b> or meat extraction from crustaceans. HPP (also known as high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and ultra high pressure processing (UHP)) involves subjecting liquid or solid foods, with or without packaging, to pressures of between 100 and 1000 MPa to inactivate pathogens and extend a productâ€™s shelf life. Almost always, products that are subject to HPP only (without the addition of sterilising temperatures or other means of preservation) are not shelf stable at room temperature and so must be stored under refrigeration. The resistance of microorganisms to pressure is highly variable and is not usually correlated to heat resistance. It depends mainly on the type of organism and the food matrix involved. For most forms of vegetative bacteria, significant reductions (usually higher than 4 log units) can be achieved when pressures of 400 - 600 MPa are used. However, under these conditions, significant reductions in the load of spores are not achieved. (Rendueles at al...|$|R
40|$|The {{process whereby}} live oysters (shellstock) {{are exposed to}} heat (water) to {{facilitate}} shucking of meats was audited to determine proper sanitary and good manufacturing practices. Two North Carolina certified <b>shellfish</b> <b>shucking</b> plants participated. Oysters were obtained from Galveston Bay, Texas. Sixteen batches of oysters were heat shocked in two tanks over 7 hours at plant one. Individual baskets of oysters were heat shocked at plant two over 10 hours of operations. Temperature profiles, water samples and meat samples were collected during processing operations. Process water samples were analyzed for pH, total solids (mg/l), aerobic plate counts (APC, cfu/ml), thermophilic aerobic plate counts (TAPC, cfu/ml) and fecal coliforms (FC, MPN/ 100 ml). Oyster meats were analyzed for APC (cfu/g), and E. coli (E. C, MPN/ 100 g) according to NSSP procedures. No evidence was found that not completely draining and flushing the tanks at 3 -hour intervals or less poses a significant public health hazard. Implications for industry/public health personnel are discussed in relation to GMPs, sanitation SOPs and HACCP requirements. To determine the health significance of the process water used in heat shocking of oysters {{to prepare them for}} shucking. Objective: This study was conducted {{in order to determine the}} health significance of not changing the process water at three-hour intervals in heat shock tanks used in commercial oyster shucking operations...|$|R
