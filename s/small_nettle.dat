50|$|The {{recorded}} food {{plants of}} the European peacock are stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), hop (Humulus lupulus), and the <b>small</b> <b>nettle</b> (Urtica urens).|$|E
50|$|Most of Skokholm {{is simple}} sub-maritime grassland, with the wetter areas graded as heath and some salt marsh. All {{of these areas}} house common natural species {{including}} three-lobed water crowfoot, tree mallow, marsh St. Johnâ€™s wort, <b>small</b> <b>nettle,</b> and sea campion.|$|E
50|$|Hesperocnide is a <b>small</b> genus of <b>nettles</b> {{containing}} two species. These are annual herbs {{covered in}} stinging hairs and toothed leaves.|$|R
60|$|In {{the plant}} world, {{substitution}} often takes place far more rapidly. I doubt whether the stinging nettle, which renders picnicking a nuisance in England, is truly indigenous; certainly the two worst kinds, the <b>smaller</b> <b>nettle</b> and the Roman nettle, are quite recent denizens, never straying, {{even at the}} present day, far from the precincts of farmyards and villages. The shepherd's-purse and many other common garden weeds of cultivation are of Eastern origin, and came to us at first with the seed-corn and the peas from the Mediterranean region. Corn-cockles and corn-flowers are equally foreign and equally artificial; even the scarlet poppy, seldom found except in wheat-fields or around waste places in villages, has probably followed the course of tillage from some remote and ancient Eastern origin. There is a pretty blue veronica which was unknown in England some thirty years since, but which then began to spread in gardens, and {{is now one of}} the commonest and most troublesome weeds throughout the whole country. Other familiar wild plants have first been brought over as garden flowers. There is the wall-flower, for instance, now escaped from cultivation in every part of Britain, and mantling with its yellow bunches both old churches and houses and also the crannies of the limestone cliffs around half the shores of England. The common stock has similarly overrun the sea-front of the Isle of Wight; the monkey-plant, originally a Chilian flower, has run wild in many boggy spots in England and Wales; and a North American balsam, seldom cultivated even in cottage gardens, has managed to establish itself in profuse abundance along the banks of the Wey about Guildford and Godalming. One little garden linaria, at first employed as an ornament for hanging-baskets, has become so common on old walls and banks as to be now considered a mere weed, and exterminated accordingly by fashionable gardeners. Such are the unaccountable reverses of fortune, that one age will pay fifty guineas a bulb for a plant which the next age grubs up unanimously as a vulgar intruder. White of Selborne noticed with delight in his own kitchen that rare insect, the Oriental cockroach, lately imported; and Mr. Brewer observed with joy in his garden at Reigate the blue Buxbaum speedwell, which is now the acknowledged and hated pest of the Surrey agriculturist.|$|R
50|$|In late summer, {{the warm}} Chesapeake waters were plagued with sea <b>nettles,</b> <b>small</b> {{stinging}} jellyfish. Kalb combatted these with nettle nets which were erected around the swimming area (which was roughly a truncated semi-circle which extended perhaps 100-120 {{feet into the}} Chesapeake). The nettle nets were actually panels of wire mesh (with quarter-inch openings) installed between semi-permanent wood pilings in May and removed into storage each September. Each evening, a lifeguard would be tasked with hanging hurricane lanterns {{on some of the}} pilings, to warn boaters of the obstruction. Each morning, they would be taken down, refueled, wicks trimmed, and stored until evening. It was not considered to be an unpleasant duty, as the lifeguards took the opportunity to harvest soft-shelled crabs which were often found clinging to the nettle nets.|$|R
50|$|Urtica urens, {{commonly}} known as annual nettle, dwarf nettle, <b>small</b> <b>nettle,</b> dog nettle or burning nettle, is a herbaceous annual flowering plant species in the nettle family Urticaceae. It is native to Eurasia {{and it can be}} found in North America and New Zealand as an introduced species.|$|E
50|$|There is {{historical}} evidence {{of use of}} Urtica species (or nettles in general) being used in medicine, folk remedies, cooking and fiber production. Urtica dioica is the main species used for these purposes, but a fair amount also refers {{to the use of}} Urtica urens, the <b>small</b> <b>nettle.</b> Arthritic joints were traditionally treated by whipping the joint with a branch of stinging nettles, a process called urtication. Nettles {{can also be used to}} make a herbal tea known as nettle tea.|$|E

60|$|March 23.--When I was a child, {{and indeed}} {{for some years}} after, my {{amusement}} was in supposing to myself a set of persons engaged in various scenes which contrasted them with each other, and I remember to this day the accuracy of my childish imagination. This might be {{the effect of a}} natural turn to fictitious narrative, or it might be the cause of it, or there might be an action and reaction, or it does not signify a pin's head how it is. But with a flash of this remaining spirit, I imagine my mother Duty to be a sort of old task-mistress, like the hag of the merchant Abudah, in the Tales of the Genii--not a hag though, by any means; on the contrary, my old woman wears a rich old-fashioned gown of black silk, with ruffles of triple blonde-lace, and a coif as rich as that of Pearling Jean;[496] a figure and countenance something like Lady D.S.'s twenty years ago; a clear blue eye, capable of great severity of expression, and conforming in that with a wrinkled brow, of which the ordinary expression is a serious approach to a frown--a cautionary and nervous shake of the head; in her withered hand an ebony staff with a crutch head,--a Tompion gold watch, which annoys all who know her by striking the quarters as regularly as if one wished to hear them. Occasionally she has a <b>small</b> scourge of <b>nettles,</b> which I feel her lay across my fingers at this moment, and so Tace is Latin for a candle.[497] I have 150 pages to write yet.|$|R
50|$|As {{with several}} nymphalid butterflies, the {{caterpillars}} feed on stinging nettles (Urtica dioica) and <b>small</b> <b>nettle</b> (Urtica urens). Adults feed on nectar. The species {{has one of}} the longest seasons of any Eurasian butterfly, extending from early spring to late autumn. Adults overwinter in hibernation, emerging on the first warm sunny days of the year to mate and breed. In southern parts of the range there may be two broods each year, but northern insects are inhibited by long length of summer days from breeding a second time.|$|E
