40|$|Management of {{radioactive}} legacy wastes {{is complicated by}} difficulties of access for sampling and measurement.

40|$|The Hanford Site in Washington State manages 177 {{underground}} storage tanks containing approximately 250, 000 m 3 of waste generated during past defense reprocessing and waste management operations. These tanks contain {{a mixture of}} sludge, saltcake and <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquids.</b> The insoluble sludge fraction of the waste consists of metal oxides and hydroxides and contains the bulk of many radionuclides such as the transuranic components and 90 Sr. The saltcake, generated by extensive evaporation of aqueous solutions, consists primarily of dried sodium salts. The supernates consist of concentrated (5 - 15 M) aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium salts. The 177 storage tanks include 149 single-shell tanks (SSTs) and 28 double -hell tanks (DSTs). Ultimately the wastes need to be retrieved from the tanks for treatment and disposal. The SSTs contain minimal amounts of liquid wastes, and the Tank Operations Contractor is continuing a program of moving solid wastes from SSTs to interim storage in the DSTs. The Hanford DST system provides the staging location for waste feed delivery to the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection’s (ORP) Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP).

40|$|In a {{study of}} {{production}} of the common enterobacterial antigen (CA) {{by members of the}} Aeromonas group, ten strains of A. shigelloides, nine strains of A. hydrophila, and nine strains of A. salmonicida were used. Passive hemagglutination and hemolysis tests as well as the hemagglutination-inhibition procedure revealed that all strains of A. shigelloides, in contrast to the strains of the other two species, produce this antigenic determinant. The antigen of A. shigelloides was demonstrated even when the supernatant fluids of agar-grown cultures were used in a dilution of 1 : 1, 000, whereas 10 -times concentrated supernatant fluids obtained from the other two species were negative. <b>Supernatant</b> <b>liquids</b> of cultures of A. shigelloides failed to induce a significant CA immune response in rabbits; nonetheless, the animals were primed immunologically and responded with prompt production of CA antibodies in significant titers to a booster injection of a subeffective dose of CA obtained from Salmonella typhimurium. Strains of A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida neither induced CA antibody formation nor primed the animals. It is concluded that of the three species of the Aeromonas group only A. shigelloides, which may produce O antigen cross-reacting with Shigella sonnei and which has been isolated from patients with dysentery or gastroenteritis, produces CA. Production of this antigen, therefore, may help to characterize microorganisms belonging or related to the family Enterobacteriaceae...|$|R

The overall objective of the WHC program is (1) to evaluate ion exchange materials for the recovery of cesium from alkaline wastes, (2) to determine their loading and elution capacities, (3) to determine the physical life cycle (including radiation and chemical stability) for selected ion exchangers, (4) to determine if basic ion exchange data can be applied to a broad range of tank wastes, and (5) to provide credible laboratory data for engineering-scale evaluation and ion exchange media selection. The goal will be to provide the technology to produce a Class A waste. The results presented in this document provide initial test cesium loading and elution results for ion exchange column operations for two selected ion exchange resins under a limited range of conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program is to deliver pertinent, {{fundamental}} {{information that can be}} used to make technically defensible decisions on safety issues and processing strategies associated with storage and clean up of DOE mixed chemical and radioactive wastes. The radioactive and chemical wastes present in DOE underground storage tanks contain complex mixtures of sludges, salts, and <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquids.</b> These mixtures, which contain a wide variety of oxide materials, aqueous solvents, and organic components, are constantly bombarded with gamma quanta, beta and alpha particles produced via the decay of radioactive isotopes. Currently, there is a vital need to understand radiolysis of organic and inorganic species present in mixed waste tanks because these processes: (a) produce mixtures of toxic, flammable, and potentially explosive gases (i. e., H{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 }O and volatile organics) (b) degrade organics, possibly to gas-generating organic fragments, even as the degradation reduces the hazards associated with nitrate-organic mixtures, (c) alter the surface chemistry of insoluble colloids in tank sludge, influencing sedimentation and the gas/solid interactions that may lead to gas entrapment phenomena. This report summarizes the technical achievements of a 3 -year project that is now in its 2 nd year.

Following the inoculation of purified tobacco mosaic virus possessing high radioactivity to normal Turkish tobacco plants, most of the radioactivity was found to be associated with non-virus components of which about 40 per cent was in the inoculated and 60 per cent in the uninoculated portions of the plants. Although a small amount of radioactive virus was isolated from the uninoculated portions of the plants, it was impossible, because of a number of complicating factors which have been discussed, to draw from the results any reliable conclusions regarding the mode of reproduction of tobacco mosaic virus...|$|R
