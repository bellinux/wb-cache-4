40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Presentation date: 1970 - 12 - 09 This was a two part {{study to}} develop self-instructional {{material}} {{to meet the}} needs of students and teachers in an individualized clothing construction program. First, two self-instructional kits were prepared, called Skills of <b>Sewing</b> <b>Kits</b> (SoS Kits), to teach stay-stitching and a lapped zipper application. Each kit contained guidelines for using the kit, general information about the technique, practice material on tissue paper, and a self-evaluation device. A teacher kit was also prepared which included additional teaching aids and suggestions for using the material, In developing the kits the investigator endeavored to keep in mind the theories of learning and the needs of students and teachers indicated by findings from experiments with individualized programs. The kits were field tested by 30 eighth grade girls in two heterogeneous classes as part of an experimental program to find the most effective instructional material for use in an individualized clothing program. The second part of the study involved a two part evaluation of the goals of the study. The students completed a written evaluation form and a tape recorded interview was made by the investigator and two teachers. Conclusions were drawn from the positive and negative ratings and comments made in the evaluations, and from these, recommendations were formulated for the future use of SoS Kits, The results indicated that students saw SoS Kits as being of most value in helping them learn to follow directions (80 percent), learn a new technique (70 percent), and to feel more confident when they had to work on their projects (60 percent). The teachers concluded that: - SoS kits were an excellent technique for individualizing instruction. - the role of the teacher changed. - the opportunity to practice helped students considerably. - students could work at their own rate. - learning and retention was increased. - using the kits required more time than conventional teaching methods. - most of the students liked using self-instructional material. - the kits did not motivate students. - external rewards might help motivate some students. - students displayed less frustration, especially on their zipper applications. - availability of a range of kits would help teachers cope with individual differences. - students might not be motivated to use SoS Kits to learn construction techniques not included in a project. - the kits were of most help to average students. - practice material could be used for demonstration and display purposes. - practice material could be used for pretests. - the kits could be used as a conventional teaching tool. - teachers had more time to help individual students. - teachers would use the kits if they were available on a commercial basis for a reasonable fee. Based on the findings of this limited study, the investigator concluded there was a real and urgent need for this type of self-instructional material in the clothing construction area. It was recommended that the investigator or some designated company produce a range of Skills of <b>Sewing</b> <b>Kits</b> to cover the basic sewing techniques. These should be made available on a re-order basis, for a nominal fee, to any teacher desiring to use the material, either in an individualized program or in a traditional program...|$|R

One day, he began experimenting and combined some of his chemicals {{with some of his}} mother's bathroom cleaning solutions and developed an anesthetic. Testing out his new concoction, he discovered that he could cause the native brown-spotted horned toad (or lizard) to fall asleep and become temporarily unconscious. Out of curiosity, he cut open a toad {{to take a closer look}} at the internal organs. He recorded everything that happened, noting that the heart continued beating and the lungs continued to draw breath. Afterwards, he carefully closed the wound with supplies from his mother's <b>sewing</b> <b>kit.</b> When the toad continued to show signs of life, apparently unharmed, he released it safely in the backyard pond.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States, Schrade made a final improvement to his Presto series of switchblades, filing his patent application on June 6, 1916. The next year, Schrade licensed a new flylock switchblade design to the Challenge Cutlery Company, which he then joined. Under the trademark of Flylock Knife Co., Challenge made several patterns of the flylock switchblade, including a large 5-inch folding hunter model with hinged floating guard and a small pen knife model designed to appeal to women buyers. A Challenge Cutlery advertisement of the day depicted a female hand operating a fly-lock automatic pen knife, accompanied by a caption urging women to buy one for their <b>sewing</b> <b>kit</b> {{so as not to}} break a nail while attempting to open a normal pen knife. Schrade pursued his knifemaking interests at both Challenge and at Schrade, where his brother George now managed one of the company's factories.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Dent Mütter (1811-1859) was {{an early}} American pioneer of {{reconstructive}} plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The Mütter Museum began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including Benjamin Rush's medical chest and Florence Nightingale's <b>sewing</b> <b>kit.</b> In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, Joseph Hyrtl (1810-1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the [...] "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of Chang and Eng Bunker, the Siamese twins; and in 1893, Grover Cleveland's jaw tumor.

50|$|Wedding {{traditions of}} Chinese Filipinos, {{regardless}} of religious persuasion, usually involve {{identification of the}} dates of supplication/pamamanhikan (kiu-hun), engagement (ting-hun), and wedding (kan-chhiu) adopted from Filipino customs, through feng shui based on the birthdates of the couple, {{as well as of}} their parents and grandparents. Certain customs found among Chinese Filipinos include the following: During supplication (kiu-hun), a solemn tea ceremony within the house of the groom ensues where the couple will be served tea, egg noodles (misua), and given ang-paos (red packets containing money). During the supplication ceremony, pregnant women and recently engaged couples are forbidden from attending the ceremony. Engagement (ting-hun) quickly follows, where the bride enters the ceremonial room walking backward and turned three times before being allowed to see the groom. A welcome drink consisting of red-colored juice is given to the couple, quickly followed by the exchange of gifts for both families and the Wedding tea ceremony, where the bride serves the grooms family, and vice versa. The engagement reception consists of sweet tea soup and misua, both of which symbolizes long-lasting relationship. Before the wedding, the groom is expected to provide the matrimonial bed in the future couples new home. A baby born under the Chinese sign of the Dragon may be placed in the bed to ensure fertility. He is also tasked to deliver the wedding gown to his bride on the day prior to the wedding to the sister of the bride, as it is considered ill fortune for the groom to see the bride on that day. For the bride, she prepares an initial batch of personal belongings (ke-chheng) to the new home, all wrapped and labeled with the Chinese characters for sang-hi. On the wedding date, the bride wears a red robe emblazoned with the emblem of a dragon prior to wearing the bridal gown, to which a pair of sang-hi (English: marital happiness) coin is sewn. Before leaving her home, the bride then throws a fan bearing the Chinese characters for sang-hi toward her mother to preserve harmony within the brides family upon her departure. Most of the wedding ceremony then follows Catholic or Protestant traditions. Post-Wedding rituals include the two single brothers or relatives of the bride giving the couple a wa-hoe set, which is a bouquet of flowers with umbrella and <b>sewing</b> <b>kit,</b> for which the bride gives an ang-pao in return. After three days, the couple then visits the brides family, upon which a pair of sugar cane branch is given, which is a symbol of good luck and vitality among Hokkien people.|$|E
