40|$|Objective This paper proposes {{definitions}} {{of safety and}} safety promotion. They apply both to unintentional and intentional injuries or violence. Method These definitions {{are the result of}} a consensus reached over a two-year period through a variety of activities involving nearly 50 experts from different sectors (public security, transportation, justice, health and <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> sports and recreation, municipalities, etc.). Results Safety has been defined as a state in which hazards and conditions leading to physical, psychological or material harm are controlled in order to preserve {{the health and well-being of}} individuals and the community. Four basic conditions are regarded as essential to achieve safety in a community. Safety promotion was defined as a process that leads to the development and maintenance of those basic conditions. This process involves various actors and may be applied at various levels of intervention. It may put into contribution both environmental and behavioural modifications. Discussion Common operational {{definitions of}} safety and safety promotion can facilitate collaboration among those concerned with safety enhancement (e. g., public safety, health and <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> <b>transport,</b> justice, municipalities, etc.) by describing more precisely the goals they are all trying to achieve and by making possible a better understanding of the potential contribution of each sector and of the common areas where they can collaborate most effectively...|$|R

Random cluster samples were drawn of 195 residents in Langa and of 170 in Khayelitsha (age range 59 - 89 years).

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{postal survey}} of bereaved carers {{was conducted in}} order to examine levels of satisfaction with services provided for people in their last year of life in the rural county of Powys, Wales, UK. A self-complete questionnaire, using {{a modified version of the}} Views of Informal Carers – Evaluation of Services instrument was sent to all bereaved carers of all those people dying of cancer in Powys between 1 April 1999 and 30 June 2001. Eight hundred and five (out of a possible of 815 people) were contacted and 407 agreed to receive the questionnaire. Out of these 407 individuals, 301 (74 % of those who agreed to receive a questionnaire and 37 % of the 815 contacted) returned a completed questionnaire. A single reminder letter was sent to non-responders. It was found that the majority of those who received help from district nurses or practice nurses (90 %) said that they were excellent or good. However, nearly 40 % of respondents reported needing more nursing help. More help was also needed from <b>social</b> care <b>services.</b> For 103 out of the 301 respondents, it was known that the deceased person wanted to die at home; only 44 did so. Only one-fifth of respondents had the opportunity to talk to someone from health and <b>social</b> <b>services</b> after their bereavement; a large majority (four-fifths) found this helpful. One-tenth of respondents reported untreated pain at home; however, there was evidence for an increasing proportion of those treated having received good pain relief. Although there are high levels of satisfaction with care and services received by Powys residents, deficits exist in relation to: symptom control, nursing help, assistance from <b>social</b> <b>services</b> with <b>transport</b> and bathing, communication, and bereavement support...|$|R
