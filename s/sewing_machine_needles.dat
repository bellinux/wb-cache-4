5000|$|More {{than a dozen}} modern {{conventions}} {{exist for}} numbering the sizes of <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> <b>needles,</b> though only two remain in common use: the American (established and propagated by Singer) and the European (also called the [...] "number metric" [...] or [...] "NM"). The European designation, established in 1942, is considered the uniform fixed size and corresponds to {{the diameter of the}} needle in hundredths of a millimeter at a non-reinforced point above the scarf. The following chart gives a comparison of the two systems. In both cases, a larger number corresponds to a larger, heavier needle. Most <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> <b>needles</b> will have packaging that gives both numbers in its size description— that is, the size numbers 100 and 16 always occur together (as either 100/16 or 16/100).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The manufacture of conventional textiles usually involves either weaving or knitting. The author {{and his colleagues have}} devised a completely new technology for textile fabric construction involving the use of simple elements. These elements are basically similar in shape to <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> <b>needles</b> which interact with each other {{in such a way that}} yarns 'stitch-knit' themselves together to produce a fabric. As a result of this unique interaction the number of loops produced is doubled when compared to the time cycle of a conventional knitting action. Further enhancement of at least doubled fabric production rates should accrue from the dual effects of decreased yarn tensions and the lowered dynamic disturbing forces of the simplified knitting element manipulating system. A survey has been made of the looped-type textile manufacturing processes and the most appropriate groups have been enumerated in order to form a basis of comparison for the novel process. A basic study (including computer aided graphics) of probable textile structures, that could be produced by this technology, has revealed a substantial range of novel fabrics. These fabrics have been analysed and possible uses for them are suggested. A powered research-rig has been designed and constructed on which the important yarn manipulation characteristics have been determined. This experimentation has facilitated a more positive yarn pick-up to be evolved. As a result of this, more practicable design tolerances may be given for the manufacture and setting-up of the manipulative elements. Moreover, narrow-width novel fabric samples have been produced from spun-staple yarns at rates exceeding the current commercially available maximum, thereby substantiating the earlier predictions. Finally, the new technology and its resulting products are appraised and design proposals for a prototype machine are made; it is hoped that this will be offered to industry in due course for further development and potential exploitation...|$|E

50|$|When {{creating}} a zigzag stitch, the back-and-forth {{motion of the}} <b>sewing</b> <b>machine's</b> <b>needle</b> is controlled by a cam. As the cam rotates, a fingerlike follower, connected to the needle bar, rides along the cam and tracks its indentations. As the follower moves in and out, the needle bar is moved from side to side. Very old <b>sewing</b> <b>machines</b> lack this hardware and so cannot natively produce a zigzag stitch, but there are often shank-driven attachments available which enable them to do so.|$|R

With a <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> <b>needle</b> cathode, the maximum Cu-Kα emission in 4 π-geometry was found to be 260 mJ and the corresponding average efficiency for the Cu-Kα generation was about 0. 06 %.

5000|$|The {{solution}} arrived—at first {{unbeknownst to}} its creators—in 1864, when another transplanted [...] "Nutmegger," [...] a former Vermont toolmaker, Orrin L. Hopson, and his associate, Herman P. Brooks, {{made their own}} pivotal discovery in Waterbury, Connecticut. Hopson and Brooks developed and patented a machine that year described as [...] "An Improvement in Pointing Wire for Pins," [...] which perhaps was as specific a use for the machine as the two inventors had in mind. Their machine could compress a section of steel but for what purpose and to whose interest, they were unclear. The two designers of the wire-compressing machine decided to leave Waterbury {{to find a market}} for their invention. Hopson and Brooks, who reacted to their discovery with a decided entrepreneurial bent, had settled by 1866 in Wolcottville, Connecticut, by which time they had determined that the marketability of their invention was not the machine itself but the products it could manufacture: <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> <b>needle</b> blanks.|$|R

40|$|In high {{performance}} waterproof clothing, seam tape and welds fail before {{other parts of}} the garment. This paper examines a method of sealing seams in which the needle waterproofs the holes it creates by sealing them with a film of a thickness governed by the Landau-Levich law. The equation governing Landau-Levich behavior is combined with equations describing hole geometry to develop a phase space describing the fluidic and geometric properties necessary to seal a hole. A manual proof of concept test is performed which demonstrates that the basic method works. The needle speed of a standard <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> is then measured as is the size of the hole made by a standard <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> <b>needle.</b> These values are then used to calculate the viscosity of a fluid that will satisfy the conditions described by the phase space. An adhesive with the calculated viscosity is made and is used on a test bed to seal holes made by a needle. Each individual hole is sealed and further tests show that the seals are waterproof. Both the proof of concept and test bed experiments confirm the theory and it is concluded that needle speed, film length, and viscosity are the variables that can be controlled to tune hole sealing. by Cole Houston.

40|$|Purpose: Ultrasonic seaming: the pertained {{technology}} {{for this research}} is identified {{as one of the}} alternatives which offers many advantages over traditional sewing. Ultrasonic technology was initially used for plastic welding. It has been utilized in automotive, electronics and electrical appliances, filtration, packaging, aerospace and apparel industries. However, the use of <b>sewing</b> <b>machine,</b> <b>needle</b> and threads still remains as the most popular method of joining fabrics together. The aim of this research is to investigate the possibility of constructing different types of seams for clothing using ultrasonic technology which is an existing technology that is not fully utilized and not fully realized the advantages associated with it in the apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental reflective practice' was used as the main method for practical investigation. The basis for analysis was formed by reflections made during and after the experimentations. Findings: Though the construction of the seams are possible, due to thickness of the layers, LSc and LSe seam types were not successful in terms of quality. The bound seam type and the flat seams are possible using ultrasonic technology without the blade, the quality is not satisfactory when comparing to the conventional sewing technique. However, ornamental stitching (OS) and edge finishing (EF) with ultrasonic are possible and successful. Originality/value: The results of this study will shed more light on ways of using ultrasonic technology in the apparel industry...|$|R
