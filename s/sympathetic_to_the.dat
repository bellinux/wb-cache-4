5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British rulers, and too co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and his party member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British.|$|E
5|$|Paddy and Jacky Snowdon {{bought the}} {{property}} in 1988. They increased occupancy to seven flats, carried out alterations and achieved compliance with fire regulations. The Snowdons undertook renovations that were long overdue, and that were <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historic significance of the building. By 2002, a conservation report had been completed.|$|E

40|$|Media sources brought {{international}} attention to dog fighting during the Michael Vick case. Although {{a significant number}} of people who watched footage of the abused dogs used in the Vick case may have felt sympathy for them, the characteristics associated with those types of individuals are not known. The current study examined personality and gender as predictors of <b>sympathetic</b> reactions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mistreatment of a bait dog depicted in a film clip. The results supported the predictions that animal-oriented sympathy, trait sympathy, agreeableness, and gender would predict <b>sympathetic</b> reactions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bait dog. The analyses showed that trait sympathy could not explain unique variance beyond animal-oriented sympathy, however, and that agreeableness fully mediated the relation between gender and <b>sympathetic</b> reactions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bait dog. Unexpectedly, emotional stability was also a unique predictor. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Modi {{administration}} appointed Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who {{had previously}} {{been associated with the}} RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR). In reaction to his appointment, other historians and former members of the ICHR, including those <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ruling party, questioned his credentials as a historian. Several stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} Chetnik commanders, Baćović carried out {{numerous}} massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians and those <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Partisan movement. In April 1945, {{he was captured}} near Banja Luka by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić, and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what was apparently a trap. According to some sources, Baćović {{and the others were}} taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where they were killed.|$|E
50|$|During {{the crisis}} in CPC during the 1990s, the PCQ became disorganized, closed its offices, and its {{remaining}} members drifted apart from the CPC, adopting positions <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> nationalism. <b>The</b> CPC maintained relations with the PCQ, however, which addressed its congresses in Toronto and Vancouver.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle. <b>Sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact {{that his wife was}} less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E
5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated along religious lines, the rebels' commented {{caused a}} negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau called on Buddhists {{to support the}} incumbent junta. The pro-Diệm speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist and anti-Diệm generals, such as Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Hữu Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively. They thought that Thảo and Phat might seek revenge, driving many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been neutral or <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E

50|$|Damascus Between Democracy and Dictatorship, (Maryland, 2000), {{the book}} covers the periods between 1949 and 1957, when ten coups shook Syria.

The book claims ultimately that this destroyed Syria's chances for a stable democracy.|$|R

5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
50|$|Gary McKeever (played by Scott Lane) was {{the lead}} {{character}}, a likable but mischievous cadet. He often found himself {{in trouble with the}} camp commandant, the pompous Colonel Harvey T. Blackwell (played by character actor Allyn Joslyn). Jackie Coogan played Sgt. Barnes, a down-to-earth school staffer who was more <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> McKeever. <b>The</b> program also starred John Eimen as Monk and character actor John McGiver.|$|R
50|$|Completed in 1813, St John's was {{the first}} Roman Catholic chapel {{to be built in}} Poulton-le-Fylde, a parish which had {{remained}} <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> Catholicism after <b>the</b> Reformation. The box-shaped rendered brick building, with slate roofs, was replaced by a larger church in 1912.|$|R
50|$|After the {{conservative}} Abdul Hamid II became sultan, Suavi attempted a coup in 1878 {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> increasing authoritarianism and reinstall Murad V, who had been <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> liberal ideals. <b>The</b> coup failed and Ali Suavi {{was killed in the}} attempt.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts {{did have}} some success. In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abolitionist cause.|$|E
5|$|During the 1978 FIFA World Cup, held in Argentina, Rudel {{visited the}} German {{national}} football team in their {{training camp in}} Ascochinga. The German media criticized the German Football Association, and viewed Rudel's visit as being <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military dictatorship that ruled Argentina following the 1976 Argentine coup d'état. During the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, he visited the German team at Malmö on 8 June 1958. There he was welcomed by team manager Sepp Herberger.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{patients}} were studied in whom a lesion within {{the central nervous}} system caused constant pain and hyperpathia. Blockade of <b>the</b> <b>sympathetic</b> supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> periphery was carried out in each patient by stellate ganglion block or intravenous infusion of guanethidine 15 mg in 30 ml saline into a limb on the affected side. On almost every occasion the pain and hypersensitivity were reduced, sometimes completely. Thus chronic pain and hyperpathia arising from a lesion in {{the central nervous system}} may be abolished by blocking <b>the</b> <b>sympathetic</b> supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> periphery; this effect may be achieved when not all the peripheral nerves of the affected region have had their sympathetic nerve supply blocked. Such blockade may be worth repeating in the hope of achieving lasting relief of the intractable pain...|$|R

5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, {{published}} in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the other to the southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{record of}} instigating {{localised}} conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, {{appealed to the}} League for international intervention. Western countries were <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, {{a city with a}} substantial number of foreigners. The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Missouri {{called a}} {{convention}} {{to determine whether}} it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union. Knott was <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E
25|$|The {{period from}} 1969 <b>to</b> 1976 was <b>the</b> stormiest {{because of a}} faction {{struggle}} over the centrality of guerrilla warfare in Latin America and elsewhere. The 1969 congress had adopted a <b>sympathetic</b> approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tactics of guerrilla warfare; {{only one of the}} International's leaders opposed this approach at that time, Peng Shuzi.|$|R
2500|$|Magic {{is simply}} {{the ability of a}} mage (or [...] "willworker") to impose their will onto reality.
