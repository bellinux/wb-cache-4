The use of these instruments comes with benefits, such as a reduction of moral hazard and higher transparency. However, at the same time, it introduces basis risk as a crucial key risk factor, since the index and the company's losses are usually not fully dependent. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the impact of basis risk on an insurer's solvency situation when an industry loss warranty contract is used for hedging. Since previous literature has consistently stressed the importance of a high degree of dependence between the company's losses and the industry index, we extend previous studies by allowing for non-linear dependencies between relevant processes (high-risk and low-risk assets, insurance company's loss and industry index). The analysis shows that both the type and degree of dependence play a considerable role with regard to basis risk and <b>solvency</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> and that other factors, such as relevant contract parameters of index-linked catastrophic loss instruments, should not be neglected to obtain a comprehensive and holistic view of their effect upon risk reduction.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to measuring interest rate risk for insurers within the Swiss Solvency Test, which overcomes the shortcomings of the standard model. The standard model of the Swiss Solvency Test is based on more interest rate risk factors than are actually needed to capture interest rate risk, it allows for significantly negative interest rates and it tends toward procyclical <b>solvency</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirements.</b> Our new approach treats interest rate risk with direct reference to the underlying term structure model and interprets its parameters as a canonical choice of the relevant interest rate risk factors. In this way, the number of interest rate risk factors is substantially reduced and interest rate risk measurement is linked to the term structure model itself. The consideration of empirical interest rate data and the acceptance of the economical implausibility of persistently negative interest rates significantly below the cost of holding cash motivate the introduction of a truncated Gaussian process to simulate innovation in the future development of the parameters of the underlying term structure model. In a natural way this leads to mean-reverting interest rate behaviour and to countercyclical <b>solvency</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R

40|$|In life {{insurance}} business, longevity risk, i. e. {{the risk that}} the insured population lives longer than the expected, represents the heart of the risk assessment, having significant impact in terms of <b>solvency</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> (SCRs) needed to front the firm obligations. The credit crisis has shown that systemic risk as longevity risk is relevant and that for many insurers it is actually the dominant risk. With the adoption of the Solvency II directive, a new area for insurance in terms of solvency regulation has been opened up. The international guidelines prescribe a market consis-tent valuation of balance sheets, where the <b>solvency</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> to be set aside are cal-culated according to a modular structure. By mapping the main risk affecting the insurance port-folio, the capital amount able to cover the liabilities corresponds to each measured risk. In Sol-vency II, the longevity risk is included into underwriting risk module. In particular, the rules pro-pose that companies use a standard model for measuring the SCRs. Nevertheless, the legislation under consideration allows designing tailor-made internal models. As regards the longevity risk assessment, the regulatory standard model leads to noteworthy inconsistencies.

Martin Kožár Department: Department of probability and mathematical statistics Supervisor: Mgr.

It pre- sents basic division and capital requirements arising from it. It describes division of the project into the three areas, refered to as pillars in practice. The thesis summarizes the basic methods for measuring the risk (Value at Risk, Tail Value at Risk), necessary in the calculation of the solvency capital requirements. The thesis studies the method of calculation of the <b>solvency</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> SCR and the minimum capital requirement MCR. The calculation of the SCR is focused mainly on the method of the calculation of the capital requirement using the standard formula.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of using different correlation assumptions between lines of business when estimating the risk-based capital reserve, the <b>Solvency</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Requirement</b> (SCR), under Solvency II regulations. A case study is presented and the SCR is calculated according to the Standard Model approach. Alternatively, the requirement is then calculated using an Internal Model based on a Monte Carlo simulation of the net underwriting result at a one-year horizon, with copulas being used to model the dependence between lines of business. To address {{the impact of}} these model assumptions on the SCR we conduct a sensitivity analysis. We examine changes in the correlation matrix between lines of business and address the choice of copulas. Drawing on aggregate historical data from the Spanish non-life insurance market between 2000 and 2009, we conclude that modifications of the correlation and dependence assumptions {{have a significant impact on}} SCR estimation.
