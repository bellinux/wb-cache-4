40|$|Soft soil {{improvement}} techniques using {{a network of}} rigid inclusions and geosynthetic reinforcement are investigated to improve our understanding of load transfer mechanisms towards piles. The physical modelling of the system consists in simulating fictional soft soil settlement through downward displacement of a perforated tray above a network of rigid piles placed in the centrifuge <b>swinging</b> <b>basket.</b> Tests are used to validate {{the results of the}} numerical study. Elasto-plastic and hypoplastic constitutive models have been used to predict the behaviour of the granular mattress, which simulates a Load Platform Transfer (LPT). A two-dimensional, axisymmetrical model has been adopted, which fulfils the validation on the experimental test and the time needed for calculation. The results of the parametric studies show that load transfer increases with mattress thickness and closer pile spacing. Geosynthetic deflection is reduced when load transfer is high...|$|E
60|$|The sailors of the ship, {{eager for}} {{anything}} {{by way of}} a change of food, held out both hands invitingly for the fish, and I contrived to <b>swing</b> the <b>basket</b> aboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ready!" [...] {{cried the}} voices below. [...] "Haul!" [...] cried Disko. [...] "Hi!" [...] said Manuel. [...] "Here!" [...] said Dan, <b>swinging</b> the <b>basket.</b> Then they heard Harvey's voice, clear and fresh, {{checking}} the weights.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} she stood still, and then, <b>swinging</b> the <b>basket</b> indignantly from her shoulder, took up her {{suspended}} task. It was no light {{one in the}} increasing wind, and the unfastened clothes-line had precipitated a part of its burden to the ground through the loosening of the rope. But on picking up the trailing garments her hand struck an unfamiliar object. The stranger's lost knife! She thrust it hastily {{into the bottom of}} the basket and completed her work. As she began to descend with her burden she saw that the light of the kitchen fire, seen through the windows, was augmented by a candle. Her mother was evidently awaiting her.|$|R
6000|$|They {{went down}} between the stores full of fishermen's {{oilskins}} to Wouverman's wharf, where the [...] "We're Here" [...] rode high, her Bank flag still flying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light. Disko {{stood by the}} main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle Salters at the tackle. Dan was <b>swinging</b> the loaded <b>baskets</b> inboard as Long Jack and Tom Platt filled them, and Harvey, with a notebook, represented the skipper's interests before the clerk of the scales on the salt-sprinkled wharf-edge.|$|R
60|$|When Count von Galgenstein {{had ridden}} {{half a mile}} on the Stratford road, looking as black and dismal as Napoleon {{galloping}} from the romantic village of Waterloo, he espied, a few score yards onwards, {{at the turn of}} the road, a certain object which caused him to check his horse suddenly, brought a tingling red into his cheeks, and made his heart to go thump--thump! against his side. A young lass was sauntering slowly along the footpath, with a <b>basket</b> <b>swinging</b> from one hand, and a bunch of hedge-flowers in the other. She stopped once or twice to add a fresh one to her nosegay, and might have seen him, the Captain thought; but no, she never looked directly towards him, and still walked on. Sweet innocent! she was singing as if none were near; her voice went soaring up to the clear sky, and the Captain put his horse on the grass, that the sound of the hoofs might not disturb the music.|$|R
60|$|There {{were many}} little knots {{and groups of}} persons in Westminster Hall: some few looking upward at its noble ceiling, and at the rays of evening light, tinted by the setting sun, which {{streamed}} in aslant through its small windows, and growing dimmer by degrees, were quenched in the gathering gloom below; some, noisy passengers, mechanics going home from work, and otherwise, who hurried quickly through, waking the echoes with their voices, and soon darkening the small door in the distance, as they passed into the street beyond; some, in busy conference together on political or private matters, pacing slowly {{up and down with}} eyes that sought the ground, and seeming, by their attitudes, to listen earnestly from head to foot. Here, a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air; there, a solitary man, half clerk, half mendicant, paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait; at his elbow passed an errand-lad, <b>swinging</b> his <b>basket</b> round and round, and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof; while a more observant schoolboy, half-way through, pocketed his ball, and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on. It was that time of evening when, if you shut your eyes and open them again, the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second. The smooth-worn pavement, dusty with footsteps, still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly, save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder, and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound.|$|R
