5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. All species are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as <b>special</b> <b>reserves.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are 444 Croatian {{protected}} areas, encompassing 8.5% of the country. These include 8 national parks, 2 strict {{reserves and}} 11 nature parks, accounting for 78% {{of the total}} protected area. The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The strict and <b>special</b> <b>reserves,</b> as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties.

5000|$|The militia was {{transformed}} into the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> by the military reforms of Haldane in the reforming post 1906 Liberal government. In 1908 the militia infantry battalions were redesignated as [...] "reserve" [...] and a number were amalgamated or disbanded. Numbered Territorial Force battalions, ranking after the <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve,</b> were formed from the volunteer units at the same time. Altogether, 101 infantry battalions, 33 artillery regiments and two engineer regiments of special reservists were formed. Upon mobilisation, the <b>special</b> <b>reserve</b> units would be formed at the depot and continue training while guarding vulnerable points in Britain. The <b>special</b> <b>reserve</b> units remained in Britain throughout the First World War, but their rank and file did not, since {{the object of the}} <b>special</b> <b>reserve</b> was to supply drafts of replacements for the overseas units of the regiment. The original militiamen soon disappeared, and the battalions simply became training units. The <b>Special</b> <b>Reserve</b> reverted to its militia designation in 1921, then to Supplementary Reserve in 1924, though the units were effectively placed in [...] "suspended animation" [...] until disbanded in 1953.|$|R

500|$|Until the 21st century, brief {{observations}} and lemur surveys had merely documented {{the presence of}} the silky sifaka in <b>special</b> <b>reserves</b> and national parks. More recently, a 14-month study and two short-term studies in Marojejy National Park have revealed previously unknown details about its behavioral biology, communication, and feeding ecology. [...] The silky sifaka has a variable social structure and is known to live in male-female pairs, one-male groups, and multiple-male/multiple-female groups. Group sizes range from two to nine individuals, while the home ranges are estimated to range from , varying in size by location.|$|E

500|$|Comparisons {{of species}} counts from subfossil {{deposits}} and remnant populations in neighboring <b>Special</b> <b>Reserves</b> has further demonstrated decreased diversity in lemur communities and contracted geographic ranges. [...] At Ampasambazimba in central Madagascar, 20species of subfossil lemur have been found. [...] At nearby Ambohitantely Reserve, only 20% of those species still survive. [...] Only six of 13species found at Ankilitelo and Ankomaka Caves {{in the southwest}} still survive at Beza Mahafaly Reserve. In the extreme north, the caves of Ankarana have yielded 19species, yet only nine remain in the surrounding forests. [...] In the northwest, 10 or 11subfossil species have been found at Anjohibe, whereas only six species remain at nearby Ankarafantsika National Park.|$|E
