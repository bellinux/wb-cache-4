40|$|In this {{pedagogical}} note {{we present}} an improved method to solve and analyze linear programming (LP) problems. The method depends on solving {{a system of}} equations and is free of any <b>slack,</b> <b>surplus</b> <b>or</b> artificial <b>variables.</b> The proposed method eliminates the need to manipulate linear inequalities to introduce additional variables and works only within the original decision variables space. We present applications of the method to handle linear optimization with varying objective function. The proposed method is easy to implement and enhances understanding of the simplex method and LP solvers transparent. We believe it is a useful alternative approach to present LP in the class room {{during the first few}} hours of introducing the subject. Education LP Learning...|$|R

The structural changes in SEA has improved the region banking industry performances and brought significant effects through the regulatory changes as it spur a trend towards consolidation, resulting in the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions. This study investigates the impact of post crisis (1997 – 2005) banking reform on competition and performance of the banking system. Competition level is assessed by employing Panzar and Rosse methodology, while the efficiency is evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that adjusted to allow <b>slack</b> <b>or</b> <b>surpluses</b> due to the environment variables. Our analysis shows that the region has successfully transformed the banking sectors as the efficiency indicates score displays positive changes. However the relation between efficiency and competition {{may not be a}} straightforward impact...|$|R
