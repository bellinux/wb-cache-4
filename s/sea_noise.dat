The observatories are a new national research facility, which will provide long-term passive underwater acoustic observations for studying abundance and migration of marine mammals in Australian waters and for investigating other natural sources of noise in the ocean, such as earthquakes, underwater volcanoes and ice breaking processes in Antarctica. Each observatory consists of four autonomous <b>sea</b> <b>noise</b> loggers deployed on the seafloor to form a triangular array of about 5 -km sides with the fourth logger installed in the centre. The observatories can autonomously collect <b>sea</b> <b>noise</b> data over 8 to 12 months at useable frequencies up to 3 kHz, depending on the regime programmed for recording. After each cycle of autonomous recording, the observatories will be recovered for data retrieval and then redeployed for another recording cycle. It is planned to keep almost continuous data collection from the three observatories until at least 2011. <b>Sea</b> <b>noise</b> data from the IMOS acoustic observatories {{will be available for}} the scientific community worldwide...|$|E

Because the conventional spectrogram correlation method for recognizing whale calls in <b>sea</b> <b>noise</b> resulted in a too high false detection rate, alternative algorithms were tested and the most robust one applied to the multi-year dataset. The detection method was based on multivariate classification using two spectrogram features of transients in <b>sea</b> <b>noise</b> and Fisher's linear discriminant, which provided a misclassification rate of approximately 1 % for missed and false detections at moderate sensitivity settings. An analysis of the detection results revealed a consistent seasonal pattern in the whale presence and considerable interannual changes with a steady {{increase in the number}} of calls detected in 2002 – 2006. An apparent diel pattern of whales' vocal activity was also observed.

Fish choruses show daily and seasonal periodicity and most show lunar periodicity. At the longest site sampled over 2006 - 2010 from Scott Reef southern lagoon, a chorus produced by nocturnal planktivorous fishes displayed coupled daily, lunar and seasonal trends with calling most intense over late evening from October to April, least intense over June to August, but continuing at some level all year. This chorus is believed associated with feeding. As a comparison a near shore chorus produced by fish of the family Terapontidae is only produced over November to May, again at night. This chorus is believed associated with reproduction. As has been observed before, where multiple chorus occur each night which overlap in frequency content, time separation acts to reduce competition for the 'sound space'...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a reliable method for target vessel identification in passive sonar by exploiting the underlying periodicity of propeller noise signal, using {{the principles of}} cyclostationarity. In conventional signal processing methods, random signals are treated as statistically stationary and {{the parameters of the}} underlying physical mechanism that generates the signal would not vary in time. However, for most manmade signals, some parameters vary periodically with time and this requires that random signals be modeled as cyclostationary. In the field of sonar, the propeller noise signal generated by underwater vessels is cyclostationary. As a ship propagates in the <b>sea,</b> <b>noise</b> generated during the collapse of cavitation-induced bubbles are modulated by the rotating propeller shaft and this results in characteristic amplitude modulated random noise signal, which can be detected using passive sonar. Processing these signals, the number of blades and the shaft frequency of the propeller can be identified. In this work, cyclostationary processing technique is introduced for processing propeller noise signal and it is observed to provide better noise immunity. A detailed comparison with the conventional DEMON processing is also presented...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{identified}} and explored {{a method of}} detecting weak signals in Gaussian noise, based on the response of a nonlinear system to small input perturbations. The technique is applicable to the detection of weak underwater acoustic signals in unwanted ambient <b>sea</b> <b>noise.</b> Much of the research to date {{has been carried out}} using a forced Duffing oscillator as the nonlinear system, with parameters selected so as to place the system at the point of transition from a chaotic state to a stable periodic state. The additive input perturbation, most commonly comprising a simulated single frequency embedded in Gaussian noise with a very low input SNR, has been found to initiate the transition as indicated by the appearance of a stable trajectory in phase space. The attendant increase in amplitude at the output of the detector, at or near to the signal frequency, constitutes a detection of that weak signal. This paper presents a quantitative investigation of the technique as applied to underwater acoustic signals (real and simulated), using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) as a measure of its performance.

40|$|Abstract—For a low-frequency {{active sonar}} (LFAS) with a triplet {{receiver}} array, {{it is not}} clear in advance which signal processing techniques optimize its performance. Here, several advanced beamformers are analyzed theoretically, and the results are compared to experimental data obtained in sea trials. Triplet arrays are single line arrays with three hydrophones on a circular section of the array. The triplet structure provides the ability to solve the notorious port–starboard (PS) ambiguity problem of ordinary single-array receivers. More importantly, the PS rejection can be so strong that it allows to unmask targets in the presence of strong coastal reverberation or traffic noise. The theoretical and experimental performance of triplet array beamformers is determined in terms of two performance indicators: array gain and PS rejection. Results are obtained under several typical acoustic environments: <b>sea</b> <b>noise,</b> flow noise, coastal reverberation, and mixtures of these. A new algorithm for (beam space) adaptive triplet beamforming is implemented and tuned. Its results are compared to those of other triplet beamforming techniques (optimum and cardioid beamforming). These beamformers optimize for only one performance indicator, whereas in theory, the adaptive beamformer gives the best overall performance (in any given environment). The different beamformers are applied to data obtained with an LFAS at sea. Analysis shows that adaptive triplet beamforming outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms. Adaptive triplet beamforming provides strong PS rejection, allowing the unmasking of targets in the presence of strong directional reverberation (e. g., from a coast) {{and at the same time}} provides positive array gain in most environment...|$|E
