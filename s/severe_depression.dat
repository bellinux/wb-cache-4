5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of the}} negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and might also be a feature of <b>severe</b> <b>depression</b> or dementia. A patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration. Formal thought disorder is a common feature of schizophrenia. Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Applewhite briefly {{moved to}} New Mexico, where he {{operated}} a delicatessen. He was popular with customers {{but decided to}} return to Texas later that year. His father died around that time; the loss took a significant emotional toll on him, causing <b>severe</b> <b>depression.</b> His debts mounted, forcing him to borrow money from friends.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{had grown}} tired of Lira's {{drinking}} and considered breaking up with him when Lira called {{a few weeks later}} and demanded Milk come home. When Milk arrived, he found Lira had hanged himself. Already prone to <b>severe</b> <b>depression,</b> Lira had attempted suicide previously. One of the longest notes he left for Milk indicated he was upset about the Anita Bryant and John Briggs campaigns.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>severe</b> {{postpartum}} <b>depression</b> {{can lead}} to infanticide.|$|R
50|$|Mathisen {{always was}} a gentleman in defeat and showed genuine respect towards skaters who had beaten him and top skaters afterwards, as {{illustrated}} by his losses against Nikolay Strunnikov and his message to Oleg Goncharenko. His life ended tragically. Mathisen killed his wife and then himself after his wife had suffered from <b>severe</b> <b>depressions</b> for many years.|$|R
50|$|Buprenorphine {{has been}} shown {{experimentally}} (1982-1995) to be effective against <b>severe,</b> refractory <b>depression.</b>|$|R
5|$|Soon after Minas Geraes {{arrival in}} Brazil, the country's {{prosperity}} began to wane, and a <b>severe</b> <b>depression</b> hit the Brazilian economy. The economic hardship, the racism prevalent in all {{branches of the}} Brazilian armed forces, and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships spawned a mutiny known as the Revolt of the Lash, or Revolta da Chibata, among sailors on the most powerful ships.|$|E
5|$|A <b>severe</b> <b>depression,</b> the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|Hogg had {{previously}} suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from <b>severe</b> <b>depression.</b> She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, {{a specialist in}} the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for more than a year, and spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.|$|E
50|$|Amineptine was {{approved}} in France for <b>severe</b> clinical <b>depression</b> of endogenous origin in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Repeated or {{prolonged}} exposure to organophosphates {{may result in}} the same effects as acute exposure including the delayed symptoms. Other effects reported in workers repeatedly exposed include impaired memory and concentration, disorientation, <b>severe</b> <b>depressions,</b> irritability, confusion, headache, speech difficulties, delayed reaction times, nightmares, sleepwalking, drowsiness, or insomnia. An influenza-like condition with headache, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and malaise has also been reported.|$|R
30|$|PHQ- 8 {{is widely}} {{used to assess the}} {{depression}} level in a given population [6]. It has eight questions with minimum and maximum possible scores of 0 & 24, respectively. The scoring assumptions of PHQ- 8 are; < 10  = no clinical depression, 10 – 19  = major depression and ≥ 20 <b>severe</b> major <b>depression.</b> Major <b>depression</b> and <b>severe</b> major <b>depression</b> were further categorized into clinical depression.|$|R
5|$|Jose Sarria's mother {{continued}} {{to work for the}} Jost family but it became increasingly difficult for her to fulfil her job responsibilities and care for an infant. Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered <b>severe</b> <b>depression.</b> Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and after meeting with her Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Bible is {{the third}} studio album by Welsh {{alternative}} rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 29 August 1994 by record label Epic. At the time the album was written and recorded, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards was struggling with <b>severe</b> <b>depression,</b> alcohol abuse, self-harm and anorexia nervosa, and its contents are considered by many sources to reflect his mental state. The songs focus on themes relating to politics and human suffering. The Holy Bible was the band's last album released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and <b>severe</b> <b>depression.</b> A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Christian Ferras {{struggled}} with <b>severe</b> lifelong <b>depression.</b> He {{committed suicide in}} Paris on 14 September 1982, aged 49.|$|R
50|$|With the new {{steadiness}} in {{supplying the}} nation’s increasing monetary needs, {{and with the}} consequent alleviation of <b>severe</b> <b>depressions,</b> the people’s savings would, in all probability, accumulate more rapidly and with less interruption than at present. Loans and investments would become larger and safer, thus swelling the total business of banks. (These new loans and investments {{would no longer be}} associated with demand deposits but only with time and savings deposits).|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} identified a potentially accurate and specific behavioral and neuroendocrine model {{of depression in}} the rat. The most effective somatic treatment for <b>severe</b> <b>depressions</b> is electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT). ECT was investigated in the preclinical model using a factorial design, and {{was found to be}} a specific and effective treatment both behaviorally and endocrinologically. These results suggest the model may successfully reflect the efficacy not only of pharmacological but additionally of other types of somatic treatments...|$|R
5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or <b>severe</b> <b>depression</b> and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required before it can be recommended.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for <b>severe</b> <b>depression</b> if government finances were not turned around dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with <b>severe</b> <b>depression,</b> Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Texas, Applewhite {{attended}} several universities and, {{as a young}} man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as {{the chair of the}} music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on <b>severe</b> <b>depression.</b> In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{were largely}} {{inactive}} following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 {{was at an}} Amnesty International concert in Paris. Yorke later said that during that period the band came close to splitting up, {{and that he had}} developed <b>severe</b> <b>depression.</b> In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to OK Computer. Although the album's success meant there was no longer any pressure or a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke experienced writer's block, influencing him toward a more abstract, fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles. After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.|$|E
5|$|Irvine {{is married}} to wife Rita, whom he met in a public house in Burnley. The couple were wed on 3 October 1966 and have three sons; Darren, Stephen and Jonathan, who played semi-professional {{football}} for Nelson and Colne. He {{has lived in the}} village of Worsthorne since retiring from football in 1974. Following his retirement he rented a warehouse from a friend and started a do-it-yourself retail business in the centre of Burnley. The shop was reasonably successful, and Irvine opened a second branch in Keighley, West Yorkshire. However, the business became untenable after several years and left Irvine owing £44,000 to the bank after a potential buyer for the shop pulled out of the deal. Following the collapse of the business, Irvine suffered <b>severe</b> <b>depression</b> and at one stage attempted suicide by taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets. He was discovered in time by his wife and admitted to Burnley General Hospital, where he underwent an emergency procedure to pump his stomach. After the attempt, he got a part-time job with Burnley Borough Council, working with young people at local community centres. He later worked as a window cleaner for 12months before selling the round for a profit. Irvine then took a job in an engineering factory, where he worked for 14years, before joining electrical firm LED. From there, he moved to Aeropia, an aircraft parts manufacturer, where he has worked as a stores manager ever since. On matchdays at Turf Moor, he gives guided tours of the ground to supporters.|$|E

5|$|Months later, a {{man known}} as Yukishiro Enishi starts attacking {{all the people}} Kenshin meets {{as an act of}} revenge for the death of his sister Yukishiro Tomoe. At this point, it is {{revealed}} that Kenshin was married to Tomoe in the Bakumatsu, but accidentally killed her while trying to rescue her from a group of assassins. When Enishi learns of Kenshin's feelings towards Kaoru, he sets out to kidnap her. He succeeds and leaves behind a professionally made decoy of Kaoru with a sword in her heart, making everyone believe that she has been murdered. Kenshin falls into a <b>severe</b> <b>depression</b> and runs off to a village of wanderers to mourn. However, he comes out of his depression after his friends discover Kaoru is alive. The group goes to rescue her on Enishi's island. A battle between Kenshin and Enishi follows. When Kenshin wins, he and Kaoru return home. Afterwards, Kenshin learns that since the Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū is only suitable for a wide-framed muscular build like that of Seijūrō's, his body will eventually begin to deteriorate and he will soon be unable to use it again. Five years later, Kenshin is married to Kaoru and has a son named Kenji. After an encounter with Kaoru's student Myōjin Yahiko, Kenshin gives his sakabatō to him as a gift for his coming-of-age.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{volatility}} of annual real macroeconomic indicators for the United States and the average severity of recessions have declined only slightly between the pre-World War I and post-World War II eras. Recessions have, however, become somewhat less frequent and more uniform. It argues that the advent of macroeconomic policy after World War II can account for both the observed continuity and change. Countercyclical monetary policy and automatic stabilizers have prolonged postwar expansions and prevented <b>severe</b> <b>depressions.</b> At the same time, policy-induced booms and recessions have led to continued volatility of the postwar economy. ...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{indicated}} in the preceding quotation bas accompanied the process of economic development throughout the Western world. The specialization of labour and the large-scale use of capital have not only led to a manifold increase in labour productivity, but they have also raised the problem of maintaining price stability and avoiding <b>severe</b> <b>depressions</b> and inflations. In contrast, the economics of underdeveloped countries are characterized by stability. We may say, therefore, that economic equilibrium and stability are not synonymous with prosperity. On the contrary, economic expansion is a pre-requisite for a high and increasing level of living...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} causes of the riots was the Panic of 1893. The panic precipitated {{one of the most}} <b>severe</b> <b>depressions</b> in American History. The closure of two major railroads and other major {{companies}} triggered a stock market collapse. The New York banks had heavily invested in the stock market, and bank failures soon began. This caused a contraction of credit, and many other, newer, businesses started to shut down as well. The depression produced widespread social unrest, mostly among the now-unemployed workers. Some people tried to create public works programs for the unemployed, but this was unsuccessful.|$|R
