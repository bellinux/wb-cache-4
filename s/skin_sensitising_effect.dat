40|$|AbstractThere is {{continued}} interest in, and imperatives for, {{the classification}} of contact allergens according to their relative <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> potency. However, achieving that end can prove problematic, not least {{when there is an}} apparent lack of concordance between experimental assessments of potency and the prevalence allergic contact dermatitis as judged by clinical experience. For the purpose of exploring this issue, and illustrating the important considerations that are required to reach sound judgements about potency categorisation, the lower alkyl methacrylate esters (LAM) have been employed here as a case study. Although the sensitising potential of methyl methacrylate (MMA) has been reviewed previously, there is available new information that is relevant for assessment of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> potency. Moreover, {{for the purposes of this}} article, analyses have been extended to include also other LAM for which relevant data are available: ethyl methacrylate (EMA), n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA), isobutyl methacrylate (iBMA), and 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate (EHMA). In addressing the <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> activity of these chemicals and in drawing conclusions regarding relative potency, a number of sources of information has been considered, including estimates of potency derived from local lymph node assay (LLNA) data, the results of guinea pig assays, and data derived from in silico methods and from recently developed in vitro approaches. Moreover, clinical experience of skin sensitisation of humans by LAM has also been evaluated. The conclusion drawn is that MMA and other LAM are contact allergens, but that none of these chemicals has any more than weak <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> potency. We have also explored here the possible bases for this modest sensitising activity. Finally, the nature of exposure to LAM has been reviewed briefly and on the basis of that information, together with an understanding of <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> potency, a risk assessment has been prepared...|$|R

40|$|Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is a {{chemical}} mediator of nociception that can evoke characteristic pain behaviour in animals after peripheral and spinal administration. The prostanoid is synthesised during tissue injury through {{activation of the}} arachidonic acid cascade, and its effects are mediated through binding to a family of specific G-protein coupled prostaglandin E (EP) receptors. The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate which EP receptors have an involvement in mediating the pronociceptive effects of PGE 2 within the rat peripheral and central nervous system.;Western blotting was used to characterise novel and commercially available EP receptor antibodies in EP receptor expressing cells to create a distribution of EP receptor subtypes present in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord of the rat. A highly selective EP 4 receptor antibody was identified, which immunocytochemically localised the EP 4 receptor to small diameter (< 1000 microm 2) DRG neurons of a nociceptor phenotype. In contrast, EP 4 receptor expression within the spinal cord was wider was widespread and was not restricted to any of the laminae associated with nociceptive processing.;Cultured rat DRG neurons were used to study the direct and <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> of PGE 2 on sensor neurons. PGE 2 was seen to evoke reproducible increases in intracellular calcium in a small proportion of capsaicin-sensitive DRG neurons following direct application. Conversely, PGE 2 reproducibly enhanced the capsaicin-elicited calcium response in a substantial proportion of DRG neurons and sensitised silent neurons to become capsaicin responsive, consistent with the prostanoid having a major <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> on nociceptors. With the use of novel potent and selective EP receptor compounds, the EP 3 and EP 4 receptors were identified as the key receptors responsible for mediating the <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> of PGE 2 on sensory neurons...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of {{endotoxin}} as a sensitising agent prior to neonatal hypoxiaischemia differing doses of endotoxin (E. coli lipopolysaccharide, LPS) were given to neonatal mice prior to hypoxia-ischemia, with <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> noted at dosages of 0. 3 mg/kg of LPS or higher. Varying the time interval between endotoxin administration and hypoxia-ischemia demonstrated that LPS given between 4 and 12 hours before hypoxia-ischemia had a <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> on subsequent hypoxia ischemia. In contrast, LPS given {{at the time of}} or 24 hours before hypoxia-ischemia did not. To help understand the mechanism by which this <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> occurs, a dose-response study of LPS alone was undertaken. Here, a dose-dependent activation of microglia was demonstrated throughout the brain, particularly in the thalamus and cortex, by 12 hours following endotoxin administration. There was also evidence of vascular endothelial activation (ICAM 1) as early as 4 hours after endotoxin administration. To study the role of the TNF cluster of cytokines (TNF alpha, lymphotoxin alpha and lymphotoxin beta), animals with a deletion of the entire TNF cluster were examined. Deletion of the TNF cluster was shown to abolish both endotoxin-mediated sensitisation of the developing brain to subsequent hypoxia, and to prevent upregulation of macrophage and vascular endothelium by endotoxin alone. This study also examined the effects of hypoxia-ischemia on intracellular pH. Increasing duration of hypoxia-ischemia resulted in a progressive intracellular acidosis within the brain, initially ipsilateral to the carotid ligation, but becoming bilateral with prolonged hypoxia. In the reoxygenation phase, there was a rebound intracellular alkalosis at 6 hours of reoxygenation across the whole forebrain. Previous studies have suggested that this alkalosis is mediated by a Na+/H+ exchanger. Blockade of this transporter with N-methyl isobutyl amiloride prior to hypoxia-ischemia was shown to confer neuroprotection in the developing brain. ...|$|R

To investigate {{the involvement of}} these detoxifying enzymes in the drug resistance of melanoma, an inducible (Tet-On™ system) antisense (AS) RNA strategy was used to specifically inhibit GSTP 1 expression in A 375 cells, a human melanoma cell line expressing high levels of GSTP 1 and MRP 1. Stable transfectant clones were established and analysed for GSTP 1 inhibition by AS RNA. The clone A 375 -ASPi 1, presenting a specific 40 % inhibition of GSTP 1 expression {{in the presence of}} doxycycline, was selected. Lowering the GSTP 1 level significantly increased (about 3. 3 -fold) the sensitivity of A 375 -ASPi 1 cells to etoposide. Inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (BSO), GSTs (curcumin, ethacrynic acid), and also of MRPs (MK 571, sulphinpyrazone) improved the <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of GSTP 1 AS RNA. All these inhibitors had stronger <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> in control cells expressing high GSTP 1 level (A 375 -ASPi 1 cells in the absence of doxycycline). In conclusion, GSTP 1 can act in a combined fashion with MRP 1 to protect melanoma cells from toxic effects of etoposide...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{sensitisation}} is {{an important}} occupational and environmental health problem {{and there is a}} continuing need to identify potential contact allergens. In recent years there has become available the local lymph node assay (LLNA), an alternative approach to <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> testing that offers scientific advantages compared with the guinea pig methods that were used previously. The LLNA is viewed as having made a significant contribution to animal welfare, achieved through a requirement for fewer experimental animals, coupled with a reduction in the trauma to which animals are potentially subject. Nevertheless there is clearly an aspiration to improve further animal welfare in the context of skin sensitisation testing, and in the long-term to seek ways to eliminate altogether the need for the use of animals. However, although this latter objective is laudable, and the subject of intensive research, it is appropriate also to consider other opportunities for refinement and reduction of animal use. To this end we have here explored the possibility of using {{a modified version of the}} LLNA for screening purposes when there is a need to evaluate the sensitising activity of a large number of chemicals, as will be the case under the auspices of REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals). Specifically we have examined, using an existing LLNA database of 211 chemicals, whether a cut-down assay comprising only a single high dose group, together with a concurrent vehicle control, would provide a realistic approach (either alone, or as part of an integrated testing strategy) for screening chemicals for sensitising potential. The analyses reported here suggest this is the case. Such an approach offers significant animal welfare benefits and we speculate here that these may be enhanced further by considering also a reduction in the number of animals required in each experimental group. However, it is emphasised that currently this remains speculation only and clearly a detailed evaluation will be necessary to provide reassurance that a reduction in group size would provide adequate sensitivity across a range of skin sensitisation potencies. This article provides recommendations for achieving additional animal welfare benefits with respect to screening for <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> activity using a reduced LLNA approach. JRC.

30|$|The {{process of}} {{identifying}} SVHC is {{well under way}} and constitutes a clear incentive for the continuous elimination of CMR substances. However, CMR substances have always been in the focus of regulation [8] and are a significant, but not the most frequent problem in workplaces. Currently, the SVHC process is very focused on CMR substances and PBT/vPvB substances. So far (status December 2013), only seven substances (respiratory sensitisation, endocrine disruption) out of 144 were identified as SVHC due to article 57 f where identification was of ‘equivalent level of concern’ to the related SVHC. From an occupational safety point of view, {{it could be argued}} that substances with less pronounced hazard properties, but high risks for exposure and harm (e.g. substances that are <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> or STOT RE) might also be subjected to SVHC identification and authorisation. In particular, substances causing dermal allergies might be candidates for such considerations because of the increasing frequency and gravity of skin diseases as observed at a community level [29, 30]. Nevertheless, this definitely needs a case by case investigation and discussion of every single substance.|$|R
40|$|TRPV 1 ion {{channels}} have crucial {{roles in}} inflammatory hyperalgesia as TRPV 1 -/- mice show reduced thermal hyperalgesia response {{in response to}} tissue inflammation. The activity of TRPV 1 is upregulated {{in the case of}} inflammation due to the release of different inflammatory mediators which can modulate the function of TRPV 1. Bradykinin is an algogenic substance which is released at the site of inflammation and it’s known to produce thermal hyperalgesia. However, the mechanism underlying the <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of bradykinin has not been full elucidated. The aim of present project is to investigate how bradykinin mediates the sensitisation of capsaicin evoked calcium responses in DRG neurons. With the use of immunocytochemical and morphometric techniques, the present study has demonstrated the expression and distribution of EP 4, TRPV 1, COX- 1 and B 2 proteins mainly in small diameter (< 1, 000 μm 2) cell bodies of rat DRG neurons which are typically nociceptors. Cultured rat DRG neurons were utilised to elucidate the direct and <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> of bradykinin on sensory neurons. Following direct application of bradykinin, a group of cells evoked calcium responses which were mediated via the B 2 receptor. In addition, bradykinin showed the ability to sensitise TRPV 1 in the presence of thapsigargin, conditions under which bradykinin does not elicit a Ca 2 + responses on its own. With the use of various pharmacological ligands that modulate prostaglandin biosynthesis, the formation of the second messenger, PGE 2, acting through EP 4 receptors was identified as a key signalling pathway mediating the effect of bradykinin on sensory neurons. The present study provides evidence for a novel signalling pathway through which bradykinin can regulate the TRPV 1 ion channel function...|$|R

Human HeLa cells that do not exhibit intrinsic MDR are not affected by these agents.

40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is {{the most}} common {{paediatric}} malignancy. Glucocorticoids (e. g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) form a critical component of chemotherapy regimens for paediatric ALL and initial resistance to glucocorticoid therapy is predictive of poor outcome. Our laboratory has previously shown that dexamethasone resistance in patient-derived ALL xenografts was associated with failure to induce the proapoptotic gene BIM. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) vorinostat partially reversed BIM repression and exerted synergistic in vitro and in vivo anti-leukaemic efficacy with dexamethasone. In this thesis I first evaluated the potential of a second-generation HDI, quisinostat, to reverse glucocorticoid resistance in ALL xenografts, reaching the conclusion that HDIs are likely to be of limited utility. Therefore, to identify novel glucocorticoid sensitisers, I performed a cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay using a dexamethasone resistant ALL xenograft. The HTS assay identified 4 thioimidazoline-containing compounds that showed little activity alone, but were synergistic when combined with dexamethasone. The lead compound, compound 3, exhibited a longer half-life than the chemotherapeutic vincristine, and required a functional glucocorticoid receptor to sensitise cells to glucocorticoids. The <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> was specific to glucocorticoids, with synergy observed when compound 3 was combined with prednisolone, but not with other chemotherapeutics. Compound 3 was a broad glucocorticoid sensitiser, with synergy observed in an additional 6 xenografts derived from several ALL subtypes. Compound 3 in combination with dexamethasone upregulated BIM expression and significantly increased binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to a novel intronic binding site at the BIM locus. The biological evaluation of 32 thioimidazoline analogues, 20 of which were synthesised, indicated that thioimidazoline alone does not have any dexamethasone <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect,</b> but altering this substructure resulted in complete loss of activity. Structure-activity relationship analysis identified that the most effective dexamethasone sensitisers contained a thioimidazoline acetamide substructure with a large hydrophobic moiety on the acetamide. In conclusion, using a clinically relevant xenograft model and a HTS assay, I have identified a novel class of compounds that are able to reverse glucocorticoid resistance in multiple ALL subtypes...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{present study}} {{examined}} whether local {{administration of the}} cannabinoid- 2 (CB 2) receptor agonist GW 405833 could modulate joint nociception in control rat knee joints and in an animal model of osteoarthritis (OA). MethodOA was induced in male Wistar rats by intra-articular injection of sodium monoiodo-acetate with a recovery period of 14 days. Immunohistochemistry {{was used to evaluate}} the expression of CB 2 and transient receptor potential vanilloid channel- 1 (TRPV 1) receptors in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and synovial membrane of sham- and sodium mono-iodoacetate (MIA) -treated animals. Electrophysiological recordings were made from knee joint primary afferents in response to rotation of the joint both before and following close intra-arterial injection of different doses of GW 405833. The effect of intra-articular GW 405833 on joint pain perception was determined by hindlimb incapacitance. An in vitro neuronal release assay was used to see if GW 405833 caused release of an inflammatory neuropeptide (calcitonin gene-related peptide – CGRP). ResultsCB 2 and TRPV 1 receptors were co-localized in DRG neurons and synoviocytes in both sham- and MIA-treated animals. Local application of the GW 405833 significantly reduced joint afferent firing rate by up to 31 % in control knees. In OA knee joints, however, GW 405833 had a pronounced <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> on joint mechanoreceptors. Co-administration of GW 405833 with the CB 2 receptor antagonist AM 630 or pre-administration of the TRPV 1 ion channel antagonist SB 366791 attenuated the <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of GW 405833. In the pain studies, intra-articular injection of GW 405833 into OA knees augmented hindlimb incapacitance, but had no effect on pain behaviour in saline-injected control joints. GW 405833 evoked increased CGRP release via a TRPV 1 channel-dependent mechanism. ConclusionThese data indicate that GW 405833 reduces the mechanosensitivity of afferent nerve fibres in control joints but causes nociceptive responses in OA joints. The observed pro-nociceptive effect of GW 405833 appears to involve TRPV 1 receptors...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{sensitisation}} {{potential is}} an endpoint {{that needs to}} be assessed within the framework of existing and forthcoming legislation. At present, skin sensitisation hazard is normally identified using in vivo test methods, the favoured approach being the local lymph node assay (LLNA). This method can also provide a measure of relative <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> potency which is essential for assessing and managing human health risks. One potential alternative approach to skin sensitisation hazard identification is the use of (Quantitative) structure activity relationships ((Q) SARs) coupled with appropriate documentation and performance characteristics. This represents a major challenge. Current thinking is that (Q) SARs might best be employed as part of a battery of approaches that collectively provide information on skin sensitisation hazard. A number of (Q) SARs and expert systems have been developed and are described in the literature. Here we focus on three models (TOPKAT, Derek for Windows and TOPS-MODE), and evaluate their performance against a recently published dataset of 211 chemicals. The current strengths and limitations of one of these models is highlighted, together with modifications that could be made to improve its performance. Of the models/expert systems evaluated, none performed sufficiently well to act as a standalone tool for hazard identification. JRC. I. 3 -Toxicology and chemical substance...|$|R

40|$|Inflammation plays a {{key role}} in the {{underlying}} pathogenesis of obesity and its associated health risks, with increased markers of inflammation evident in both liver and adipose tissue. In parallel, there is dysregulation of glucocorticoid metabolism in obesity, with increased adipose levels of the glucocorticoid-regenerating enzyme 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 βHSD 1) and increased hepatic levels of 5 α-reductase type 1 (5 αR 1), which catalyses the reduction of glucocorticoids. Both the mechanisms and consequences of this glucocorticoid metabolism dysregulation remain unclear, however, there is evidence that it may be related to inflammation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that pro-inflammatory markers upregulate 11 βHSD 1 expression in adipocytes, potentially explaining increased expression of this enzyme in obesity. Previous work has also demonstrated that the glucocorticoid metabolites produced by 5 αR 1 lack the metabolic effects of the parent glucocorticoid, but retain its anti-inflammatory properties, indicating that increased expression of hepatic 5 αR 1 may serve to dampen down inflammation in the liver. The hypotheses addressed in this thesis are that in obesity, inflammation regulates adipose glucocorticoid metabolism through 11 βHSD 1, and that hepatic glucocorticoid metabolism regulates the inflammatory state of the liver through 5 αR 1. The role of inflammation in the regulation of 11 βHSD 1 was assessed in vivo in mice treated with the anti-inflammatory compound sodium salicylate (salicylate). In diet-induced obese mice, salicylate downregulated 11 βHSD 1 expression and activity selectively in visceral adipose tissue, alongside improved glucose tolerance, reduced plasma non-esterified fatty acids, and changes in adipose lipid metabolism. 11 βHSD 1 -deficient mice fed a high-fat diet were resistant to the insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> of salicylate treatment. These results indicate a novel role for 11 βHSD 1 down-regulation in mediating the insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of anti-inflammatory treatment. The mechanisms underpinning the anti-inflammatory properties of 5 α-reduced glucocorticoids were explored in vitro and in vivo. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine macrophages, both 5 α-reduced glucocorticoid metabolites tested, namely 5 α-dihydrocorticosterone (5 αDHB) and 5 α-tetrahydrocorticosterone (5 αTHB), suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) release, although to a lesser extent than corticosterone (B). Similar to B, both 5 αDHB and 5 α THB suppressed phosphorylation of intra-cellular inflammatory signalling mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) proteins c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38, as well as increasing protein expression of MAPK phosphatase- 1 (MKP- 1). Treatment of phorbol ester-stimulated HEK 293 kidney cells with these 5 α-metabolites revealed that 5 αDHB suppressed nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) activation to a similar extent to that of B, whilst 5 αTHB increased activation of these pro-inflammatory transcription factors, indicating cell-specific effects of 5 αTHB. In conclusion, reduced intra-adipose glucocorticoid regeneration by 11 βHSD 1 mediates the insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> of salicylate, suggesting that altered glucocorticoid metabolism may reflect altered intra-adipose inflammation in obesity. Furthermore, these data support the concept that this enzyme provides a therapeutic target in obesity-related metabolic disorders. 5 α-reduced metabolites of glucocorticoids have similar anti-inflammatory properties to the parent glucocorticoid, indicating that the elevated hepatic levels of 5 α-reductase in obesity may be a protective mechanism to limit the adverse metabolic effects of glucocorticoids upon the liver, but maintain the beneficial anti-inflammatory properties. These 5 α-reduced glucocorticoid metabolites may provide a potential therapeutic treatment as selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators for inflammatory conditions.

The films have been fabricated using the reactive magnetron sputtering of a silica target. The energy transfer efficiency from Si-nc towards Er ions has been studied {{as a function of the}} fabrication parameters (hydrogen rate, annealing temperature) through time resolved PL intensity measurements on Er-doped silicon-rich silica layers. A multilayer approach has been developed to determine the critical parameters such as the optimum Si-nc size and the characteristic interaction distance Si-nc-Er ions which govern the transfer Si-nc-Er.

40|$|Cardiac {{failure is}} one of the leading causes of {{mortality}} in developed countries. As life expectancies of the populations of these countries grow, the number of patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency also increase. Effective treatments including the use of calcium sensitisers are being sought. They cause a positive inodilatory effect on cardio-myocytes without deleterious effects (arrhythmias) resulting from increases in intracellular calcium concentration. Levosimendan is a novel calcium sensitiser that hasbeen proved to be a welltolerated and effective treatment for patients with severe decompensated heart failure. Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is its target protein. However, there have been controversies about the interactions between levosimendan and cTnC. Some of these controversies have been addressed in this dissertation. Furthermore, studies on the calcium sensitising mechanism based on the interactions between levosimendan and cTnC as followed by nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) are presented and discussed. Levosimendan was found to interact with bothdomains of the calcium-saturated cTnC in the absence of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In the presence of cTnI, the C-domain binding site was blocked and levosimendan interacted only with the regulatory domain of cTnC. This interaction may have caused the observed calcium <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> by priming the N-domain for cTnI binding thereby extending the lifetime of that complex.

40|$|Development of thermotolerance is an {{important}} phenomenon that must be considered when thermochemotherapy with multiple heat treatments is used clinically. To study the effect of thermotolerance on cellular cisplatin (cDDP) sensitivity at 37 degrees C and 43 degrees C in cell lines with different cDDP sensitivities, two Ehrlich ascites tumour cell lines (one with high cDDP sensitivity and one with in vitro acquired cDDP resistance) were used. The results indicate that in both cell lines the state of thermotolerance per se {{did not affect the}} cDDP sensitivity at 37 degrees C. Thus, general elevations in 'all' heat shock protein levels as found in thermotolerant cells apparently do not influence cDDP sensitivity to a considerable extent. The <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of a (second) heat treatment given simultaneously with a cDDP treatment was less in thermotolerant cells. Thermal enhancement ratios (TERs) at the 10 % survival level for heat doses of 43 degrees C for 30 min or 43 degrees C for 60 min were reduced by a factor of 1. 6 and 2. 1 in cDDP-resistant and -sensitive thermotolerant cells respectively, as compared with control cells. Thus, protection against heat damage in thermotolerant cells seems to be paralleled by diminished thermal chemosensitisation.

40|$|Testicular {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} solid malignant tumour type in men 20 - 40 years of age. At the time of diagnosis up to 50 % of the patients suffer from metastatic disease. In contrast to most other metastatic solid tumours, the majority of metastatic testicular cancer patients can be cured with highly effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This review aims to summarise the current knowledge on response to chemotherapy and the biological basis of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in testicular cancer. The frequent presence of wild-type TP 53 and the low levels of p 53 in complex with the p 53 negative feed-back regulator MDM 2 contribute to cisplatin sensitivity. Moreover, {{the high levels of}} the pluripotency regulator Oct 4 and as a consequence of Oct 4 expression high levels of miR- 17 / 106 b seed family and pro-apoptotic Noxa and the low levels of cytoplasmic p 21 (WAF 1 /Cip 1) appear to be causative for the exquisite sensitivity to cisplatin-based therapy of testicular cancer. However, resistance of testicular cancer to cisplatin-based therapy does occur and can be mediated through aberrant levels of the above mentioned key players. Drugs targeting these key players showed, at least pre-clinically, a <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> to cisplatin treatment.

Dose enhancement ratios were calculated for each drug and each shock wave application mode in order to characterise the <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of shock wave pretreatment. The influence of the time between shock wave and drug treatment {{as well as the}} effects of different sequences of shock wave and drug treatment or concomitant treatment were assessed for selected combinations of cell lines and drugs.

The enhanced sensitivity to cis-platinum and actinomycin D decreased rapidly during the first hours after shock wave treatment. The antiproliferative effect was most pronounced after concomitant shock wave and drug treatment. The sensitisation to interferon alpha diminishes more slowly after shock wave exposure.

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) {{are well}} studied for their {{peripheral}} physiological and pathological impact, {{but they also}} {{play an important role}} for the pathogenesis of various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease. The observation that PPARs are able to suppress the inflammatory response in peripheral macrophages and in several models of human autoimmune diseases lead to the idea that PPARs might be beneficial for CNS disorders possessing an inflammatory component. The neuroinflammatory response during the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is triggered by the neurodegeneration and the deposition of the β-amyloid peptide in extracellular plaques. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been considered to delay the onset and reduce the risk to develop Alzheimer’s disease, while they also directly activate PPARγ. This led to the hypothesis that NSAID protection in AD maybepartlymediatedbyPPARγ. Several lines of evidence have supported this hypothesis, using AD-related transgenic cellular and animal models. Stimulation of PPARγ receptors by synthetic agonist (thiazolidinediones) inducing anti-inflammatory, antiamyloidogenic, and insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> may account for the observed effects. Several clinical trials already revealed promising results using PPAR agonists, therefore PPARs represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. Copyright © 2008 MarkusP.

40|$|Pontospinal noradrenergic neurons {{form part}} of an {{endogenous}} analgesic system that suppresses acute pain, but there is conflicting evidence about its role in neuropathic pain. We investigated the chronology of descending noradrenergic control during {{the development of a}} neuropathic pain phenotype in rats following tibial nerve transection (TNT). A lumbar intrathecal cannula was implanted at the time of nerve injury allowing administration of selective α-adrenoceptor (α-AR) antagonists to sequentially assay their effects upon the expression of allodynia and hyperalgesia. Following TNT animals progressively developed mechanical and cold allodynia (by day 10) and subsequently heat hypersensitivity (day 17). Blockade of α 2 -AR with intrathecal yohimbine (30 μg) revealed earlier ipsilateral sensitization of all modalities while prazosin (30 μg, α 1 -AR) was without effect. Established allodynia (by day 21) was partly reversed by the re-uptake inhibitor reboxetine (5 μg, i. t.) but yohimbine no longer had any <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect.</b> This loss of effect coincided with a reduction in the descending noradrenergic innervation of the ipsilateral lumbar dorsal horn. Yohimbine reversibly unmasked contralateral hindlimb allodynia and hyperalgesia of all modalities and increased dorsal horn c-fos expression to an innocuous brush stimulus. Contralateral thermal hyperalgesia was also reversibly uncovered by yohimbine administration in a contact heat ramp paradigm in anaesthetised TNT rats. Following TNT there is an engagement of inhibitory α 2 -AR-mediated noradrenergic tone which completely masks contralateral and transiently suppresses the development of ipsilateral sensitization. This endogenous analgesic system {{plays a key role in}} shaping the spatial and temporal expression of the neuropathic pain phenotype after nerve injury...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{induced by}} {{ionising}} radiation (IR) is mainly repaired by classical non homologous end joining (D-NHEJ), {{but a small}} subset of DSBs is repaired with slow kinetics in an ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and Artemis dependent manner. In addition, a PARP- 1 dependent NHEJ backup pathway (B-NHEJ) was described, which is thought to function {{in the absence of}} D-NHEJ. Using ATM, Artemis or DNA ligase IV deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a model system, the effect of the potent and specific PARP- 1 /- 2 inhibitor KU- 0059436 upon clonogenic survival after various types of damage that induce different spectra of SSBs and DSBs was measured. In Artemis or ATM deficient MEFs no <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> of KU- 0059436 was detected after neocarzinostatin (NCS) treatment; however PARP inhibition increased sensitivity to IR and methylmethane sulphonate (MMS) markedly. In these cell lines no specific single strand break repair (SSBR) defect was observed, and radio-sensitisation by KU- 0059436 was replication dependent. Furthermore PARP inhibition led to increased formation of DSBs, an effect which was augmented in Artemis deficient cells. PARP inhibition in DNA ligase IV deficient cells led to increased sensitivity after damage induction to all agents. However, radiosensitisation by KU- 0059436 was replication independent. Results show that PARP inhibition increases the dependence on Artemis and ATM after SSB induction, which is consistent with a model whereby DSBs that arise from SSBs during DNA replication {{in the presence of a}} PARP inhibitor require ATM and Artemis for their repair. In cells deficient for DNA ligase IV, PARP inhibition causes additional replication independent sensitisation both by abrogating B-NHEJ and promoting accumulation of replication independent DSBs.

40|$|In {{this study}} gamma-radiation-induced DNA strand breaks have been {{investigated}} using two systems: a plasmid-based assay, and a whole nuclei-, or whole cell-based, alkaline filter elution assay. Addition of alkali metal halides to DNA irradiated under frozen aqueous conditions were observed {{to have an effect}} on the radiosensitivity of the DNA. This, effect, which was not observed with DNA irradiated under fluid aqueous conditions, would appear to be due to two components; a physical component, and a chemical component which is dependent on the anions used. Addition of alkali metal halides appears to increase the volume of the hydrating layer of water which is formed around the DNA when it is frozen. This appears to increase the target volume when it is irradiated, with an observed increase in damage caused by H 2 O-+ and non-hydrated electrons from the ionisation of the hydration water. The chemical component, which may be a protective or a <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect,</b> is dependent on the anion in the system. The scavenging of electrons produced from the direct action of gamma radiation on DNA has been demonstrated using the intercalator, mitozantrone. This was demonstrated using plasmid DNA irradiated under frozen aqueous solutions, and compared with the e. s. r. spectroscopy results obtained by my coworkers. Finally, the protection of DNA by free-thiols has been investigated. Under indirect, dilute aqueous conditions, the amount of protection to plasmid DNA was observed to increase with increasing positive charge on the thiols. Under direct, frozen aqueous conditions, the radiosensitivity of plasmid DNA by the compounds used was less clear cut. Possible reasons for this contrast are discussed.

40|$|The dose–response {{relationships}} {{of the human}} immune system can be defined using the induction and elicitation of lymphocyte mediated allergic reactions to experimental contact sensitisers such as dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). Five groups of healthy volunteers received a sensitising dose of DNCB applied to a 3 cm diameter circle on the volar forearm. Doses applied were 62. 5 ?g, 125 ?g, 250 ?g, 500 ?g and 1000 ?g. Four weeks later a concentration series of 3. 125 ?g, 6. 25 ?g, 12. 5 ?g and 25 ?g {{was applied to the}} upper inner arm on 1 cm paper discs which were removed after 6 h. Forty-eight hours later the responses were scored clinically and thickness measured with callipers. The proportion of people reacting to the challenge doses showed a sigmoid log-dose–response curve, 100 % reacting to 500 ?g. The responses to challenge also showed a log-dose–reponse. As sensitising dose increased so more people were sensitised to a proportionately greater degree. These dose–response relationships reflect the effects of increasing the concentration of sensitiser on a fixed area. The effect was examined of keeping the concentration per sq cm constant but of varying the total area. When 35. 4 ?g/cm 2, which sensitised 80 % of people when applied to a circle 3 cm diameter (area 7. 1 cm 2), was applied on a 1. 5 cm diameter circle or 4. 5 cm diameter, there were no differences in the proportions sensitised or their degree of reactivity. This was clearly on the plateau for the <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect.</b> However, when the same concentration per cm 2 was applied on a 3 mm diameter area much weaker sensitisation was obtained. This shows the concentration of sensitiser per unit area is the critical determinant of whether sensitisation occurs, whereas the total dose may be varied over a wide range, but if the concentration per unit area is constant there is no <b>effect</b> on <b>sensitising</b> potency. In other words few Langerhans cells presenting many antigen molecules per cell is a much more potent sensitising stimulus than the same number of molecules presented by many Langerhans cells, each presenting few molecules. These observations clearly have important implications across the whole field of risk assessment for induction of contact sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Poster PresentationSession: Cancer CellCancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) {{are capable of}} self-renewal, multipotency, in vivo tumorigenicity, and driving metastasis, leading to {{recurrence}} of tumor. Thus, novel therapies capable of eliminating CSCs are needed. Cyclin D 1 is deregulated in many types of cancers. Beyond being a cell cycle regulator and oncogene, cyclin D 1 also promotes stem cell (SC) self-renewal and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) reprogramming efficiency. Yet, the role of cyclin D 1 in regulation of CSC is not well defined. In this study, we investigated potential role of cyclin D 1 in regulation of liver cancer stem cell properties. In cyclin D 1 overexpressed two lines of liver cancer cells, anchorage-independent spherical colony (spheres) formation was enriched. From dissected single spherical cells, the capacity of the secondary and the third sphere formation was significantly higher in cyclin D 1 -expressing liver cancer cells compared to parental cells, suggesting an enhanced self-renewal capacity. Cyclin D 1 expression conferred liver cancer cells more CSC and SC properties, shown by the increased CD 90 + and EpCAM+ liver CSC populations and the enhanced expression of SC-associated genes Nanog, Oct 4 and Nodal. At longer culturing time, cyclin D 1 -expressing spheres maintained a good spherical morphology, whereas parental spheres became more differentiated. Interestingly, Smad 2 / 3, a TGF-β signaling effector, was highly phosphorylated in cyclin D 1 -expressing spherical cancer cells compared to spherical cells without cyclin D 1. Application of TGF-β/Smad inhibitor (SB 431542) significantly reduced the CSC sphere formation in cyclin D 1 -expressing cells but had no effects on parental cell sphere formation. In addition, Erk inhibitor (UO 126) showed no inhibiting effects, a further proof of the cyclin D 1 - mediated activation of Smad 2 / 3. Our preliminary data also indicated the effects of SB 431542 in induction of CSC sphere differentiation and reduction of tumorigenicity. Thus, TGF-β/Smad inhibitor might have therapeutic potential for targeting liver CSCs. Liver cells are known being highly resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. We further investigated the sphere formation capacity of cyclin D 1 -expressing cells under the treatment of chemotherapeutic agents in combination with Smad inhibitor and found that there was an <b>sensitised</b> <b>effect</b> in low dose and synergistic effect in high dose of SB 431542. In summary, our results suggest that cyclin D 1 might promote liver CSC proliferation and self-renewal via activation of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, with underlining mechanism is under investigation...|$|R
40|$|When one {{considers}} the huge spectrum of chemicals that {{are available in the}} world today (sometimes estimated at greater than 100, 000) the opportunities for adverse health effects following exposure to these chemicals can appear to be very great. However, the reality {{is that most of the}} substances do not cause any significant impact on human health. Perhaps the most common effect, and certainly the most common in the field demeanour toxicology, appear to be the allergic responses that arise in susceptible individuals following exposure to chemicals that possess <b>skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> properties. It is not appropriate in this chapter to delve into great detail concerning the mechanistic immunobiology of skin sensitisation nor to provide a detailed account of the substances that are sensitising and the clinical effects known as allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) that they can produce. The mechanisms of skin sensitisation have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (1 - 3). In brief, to behave as a skin sensitiser a chemical must penetrate into the viable layers of the epidermis and once there form a stable association with skin proteins, typically via covalent binding. If this event occurs in the presence of danger signals (4, 5), the dendritic cells of the skin will be triggered to migrate to the draining lymph nodes where, in their mature form, they will interact with T lymphocytes. Those T lymphocytes bearing surface receptors which recognise the chemically modified protein being presented by the dendritic cell will be stimulated into clonal expansion and the daughter cells released back to the systemic circulation. When this process happens to a sufficient extent, the sensitised state has said to be to have been induced. Subsequent exposure to the same chemical by the dermal route can then elicit the characteristic delayed inflammatory response which we recognise as allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). The panoply of substances which can give rise to ACD and are most commonly diagnosed, include transition metals (nickel, chromium and cobalt), fragrance chemicals, preservatives, various topical medicaments, rubber chemicals, epoxy resins, acrylates, plant defence substances (e. g. pentadecylcatechol in poison ivy), and many others. They are fully detailed in current textbooks of contact dermatitis (6, 7) and in guidance concerning diagnosis of this disease (8). From the perspective of the practicing toxicologist what is therefore most important is to have the capacity to identify potential causes of allergic contact dermatitis, i. e. skin sensitizing chemicals, so that such hazards can be characterised and the risks they present to human health the assessed and appropriately managed (9). In the material which follows, a very brief account of in vivo predictive methods will be given so that an appreciation of the information these tests produce and how it is used can be gained. Subsequently, the details of in vitro methods that seem close to successful validation will be offered, together with the discussion concerning the strengths and limitations of the information that the yield. Finally, the focus will be on how we may in the reasonably foreseeable future try to close the remaining gaps so that using only non-animal methods, at least for this endpoint in toxicology, human health can people be protected as, or even more, successfully them in recent yearsJRC.

40|$|Chemicals in our {{environment}} {{with which we}} have repeated skin contact can cause skin sensitisation (contact allergy). To trigger an immune response a compound (hapten) {{must be able to}} penetrate the skin, where it needs to be reactive enough to bind to proteins and form immunogenic complexes that are recognised as foreign. Electrophilicity has been identified as an important characteristic, which enables haptens to react with nucleophilic amino acids in proteins. In this thesis, a specific type of electrophiles, epoxides, have been investigated. <b>Skin</b> <b>sensitising</b> potencies related to physicochemical parameters have been investigated using structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Studies on the formation of epoxides by abiotic (air oxidation) and biotic (metabolically in skin) activation from unsaturated compounds and the impact on the sensitising potency of such compounds were also performed. Cinnamic alcohol, a fragrance and flavouring compound, is a well-known contact allergen. However, it lacks the necessary structural alerts to function as a hapten and must be activated to be able to act as a sensitiser. In this thesis, cinnamic alcohol was used to study the formation of allergenic oxidation products (i. e. epoxides) by air exposure and metabolically. The autoxidation study was performed to gain knowledge regarding stability of cinnamic alcohol upon air exposure, oxidation products and sensitising potencies. The sensitising potency (as examined by the murine local lymph node assay) of cinnamic alcohol after two weeks of air exposure was enhanced about four-fold. Two strongly sensitising compounds, epoxy cinnamic alcohol and cinnamic aldehyde, were detected in the formed oxidation mixture. Thus, for the first time, it was shown that cinnamic alcohol acts as a prehapten. The bioactivation of cinnamic alcohol, using human liver microsomes, resulted in the same oxidation products although the mechanism for their formation is completely different. In addition, epoxy cinnamic aldehyde was detected. Most likely, the two epoxides and cinnamic aldehyde are all contributing to the sensitising potency of cinnamic alcohol whether they are formed outside the skin or in the skin. Up to now, the contact allergenic effect seen from cinnamic alcohol has only been associated with cinnamic aldehyde formed as a metabolite from cinnamic alcohol. The present findings shed new light on the mechanism behind the allergenic effect of cinnamic alcohol and offer explanations to the many clinical cases of contact allergy to cinnamic alcohol not reacting to the aldehyde. Terminal epoxides are known contact sensitisers present in compounds used in epoxy resin systems (ERS). The most commonly used epoxy resin monomer (ERM), diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), is causing high rates of occupational contact allergy. Thus, it would be highly advantageous to replace this strongly sensitising compound with less hazardous alternatives, since even a single accidental exposure may induce primary sensitisation to ERM. In this thesis, specially-designed analogues of phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) and DGEBA, with terminal epoxides intact, were investigated. The results reveal that the design of series of well-defined compounds can give important insights into the SARs thereof and increased knowledge about the structural basis for sensitisation potential. It has been demonstrated, for the first time, how the chemical reactivity and the sensitising potency of terminal epoxides vary with the overall structure of the compound. Using this knowledge regarding SARs of terminal epoxides novel epoxy resin monomers with reduced sensitising potency were achieved for the first time without compromising the technical properties. By modifying the intrinsic reactivity of ERMs, the fundamental and underlying causes of contact allergy to ERS have been addressed. Using these modified analogues with reduced sensitising potency, in addition to regulations and protective clothing, would reduce occupational contact allergy in the future...|$|R
40|$|Autophagy and {{apoptosis}} are {{two important}} cellular processes, whose dysfunctions {{are involved in}} many severe diseases, including cancer. Bulk autophagy is typically mediated by the sequestration of cytoplasmic material into double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes), which subsequently fuse with lysosomes to have their content degraded and recycled. Studies in yeast have revealed a critical role of the Atg 8 (autophagy-related 8) protein in autophagosome formation {{as well as for}} the selective recruitment of cargo. Mammalian cells contain several Atg 8 homologues (mAtg 8 s) that can be divided into the LC 3 and GABARAP subfamilies. Whereas LC 3 and GABARAP proteins have all been associated with cargo recruitment, their differential roles in autophagosome formation and bulk autophagy have been incompletely characterized in too few functional assays. LC 3 is the most studied member of the mAtg 8 s and is widely used as a marker for autophagy. Apoptosis is a major form of programmed cell death, which can be induced intrinsically or extrinsically by death receptor ligands, such as TRAIL, and is commonly mediated by activation of caspase cascades. Autophagy and autophagy-related proteins, including mAtg 8 s, have been reported to influence apoptosis at different levels and through diverse mechanisms, to either prevent or contribute to cell death. This study critically investigated the role of mAtg 8 proteins in bulk autophagy and their influence on TRAIL-induced cell death in two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC 3). To that end, we simultaneously depleted either one or both of the mAtg 8 protein subfamilies and measured changes in TRAIL-induced cell death and bulk autophagy. Our experiments demonstrated that, when induced by starvation or with an inhibitor of the autophagy suppressor mTOR, bulk autophagy required proteins of the GABARAP subfamily, but not LC 3 s, in both cell lines. This was most surprising, given the previously assumed role of LC 3 in bulk autophagy. Basal bulk autophagy likewise depended on GABARAPs, but not LC 3 s, in LNCaP cells. Intriguingly, however, none of the mAtg 8 subfamilies l were required for basal bulk autophagy in PC 3 cells. Similar results were obtained in cells that had been treated with TRAIL under nutrient-rich conditions. TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells did not alter their cell death response upon depletion of any of the mAtg 8 s, indicating an autophagy-independent resistance mechanism. Partly TRAIL-sensitive PC 3 cells, on the other hand, were sensitised to TRAIL-induced Caspase- 8 processing and apoptosis upon depletion of the GABARAP subfamily, but not the LC 3 subfamily. Based on our obtained results, we conclude that this <b>sensitising</b> <b>effect</b> is unrelated to inhibition of non-selective bulk autophagy, and that it may rather be related to a GABARAP-dependent form of selective autophagy, and/or to a more direct interaction of GABARAP subfamily members with the TRAIL-induced apoptotic machinery...|$|R
40|$|Pain subserves {{different}} functions. Acute {{pain from}} the intact body alerts the victim to immediately react and {{withdraw from the}} bodily threat, ideally before an injury happens. However, during manifest injury and tissue inflammation, withdrawal and flight are no longer adaptive. Instead, sparing the affected body part to promote healing requires heightened awareness and avoidance behaviour over longer periods of time. Quality and time scales of behavioural adaptations are therefore substantially different between pain during normal compared to abnormal tissue states. Given these functional differences we postulated that the two phenomena also recruit different forebrain systems. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and subtracted scans obtained during painful heating of normal skin from scans during equally intense but normally non‐painful heating of capsaicin‐treated skin. This comparison reveals the specific activation of a medial thalamic pathway to limbic forebrain structures such as anterior insula, perigenual anterior cingulate, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex during pain originating in the chemically <b>sensitised</b> <b>skin.</b> It {{is possible that the}} unique forebrain recruitment by pain under a patho‐physiological tissue status is caused by a significantly greater facilitation of the multi‐synaptic projections from the spino‐parabrachial tract of the superficial dorsal horn to the medial thalamus compared to deeper and direct lateral thalamic projections from the spino‐thalamic tract...|$|R
30|$|Disinfectants are {{chemicals}} that {{are able to}} reduce the amount of germs on objects to be disinfected. They are regulated mainly in the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 528 / 2012 [1]. They are used in several sectors by professional and non-professional users. The BPR separates disinfectants in five product types (Annex V): human hygiene, disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals, veterinary hygiene, food and feed area and drinking water [1]. In the professional sector, the use of disinfectants is very important to avoid infections, e.g. in hospitals or the food industry. The use of disinfectants in private homes by non-professional users however is intensely debated amongst scientists: In Germany, it is widely accepted that disinfectants should only be used by private persons if there are medical indications [2]. These might be infectious diseases of family members or if people in need of care are living in the household. The limitation of uses is due to the fact that disinfectants do not only inherit benefits but also might pose risks to humans and the environment [2]. Studies show that the use of disinfectants is only significantly reducing bacterial contamination in households if users follow a strict cleaning protocol [3, 4]. In a setting where households were not informed how to use a disinfectant, the prevalence of bacterial contamination was not reduced [3]. A study on the effects of antibacterial products on infectious disease symptoms showed that using antibacterial products did not result in a reduction of the primarily viral infectious disease symptoms [5]. Reports of resistances are often accompanied by reports of wrong uses or insufficient cleaning [6]. This may also cause cross-resistances to antibiotics [7]. For example, it is under discussion whether a resistance to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant, might lead to a resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [8]. For many disinfecting substances, data on possible cross-resistances is not available; and for this reason, it is unclear which active substances pose the highest risks of these cross-resistances [7]. However, quaternary ammonium compounds, biguanides (i.e. surface active agents) and phenolics are considered as high-risk biocides concerning resistance problems [7]. For several substances (isothiazolones, anilides, diamidines, inorganic acids and their esters, alcohols), little information is available on resistance or tolerance [7]. Due to ‘the nature of their interaction with the bacterial cell and their antimicrobial efficacy’ [7], the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) considers them as medium-risk biocides. Several disinfectants have irritating or sensitising properties. A study showed that concentrations of the sensitising substances CMI/MI, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide in disinfectants are in the same order of magnitude that leads to <b>sensitising</b> <b>effects</b> in laboratory tests [9]. Risks for the human health were especially high for spray applications or the use of concentrates for the cleaning of surfaces [9]. Some disinfectants or their metabolites can reach the environment. For example, the metabolite of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, was detected in surface waters [10] and biota [11]. Triclosan is also used in cosmetic products and in these cases does not fall under the BPR. Especially disinfection-by-products (DBP) which result from the reaction of halogenated oxidising substances with organic matter might pose risks that we are not aware of at the moment [12].|$|R
