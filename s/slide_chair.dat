60|$|As {{he swung}} Helen around, the low hum of voices inside the saloon {{suddenly}} rose to sharp, hoarse roars, {{accompanied by a}} scuffling of feet and crashing of violently <b>sliding</b> <b>chairs</b> or tables. Dale let go of Helen and leaped toward the door. But a silence inside, quicker and stranger than the roar, halted him. Helen's heart contracted, then seemed to cease beating. There was absolutely not a perceptible sound. Even the horses appeared, like Dale, to have turned to statues.|$|R

500|$|The {{increased}} {{realism of}} the puppets meant that their mobility was significantly reduced, ironically leaving {{the new design}} less lifelike than Anderson had hoped, as he recalls: [...] "Suddenly, all the movements had to be as realistic as the puppets and that {{made it difficult for}} the puppeteers to animate them." [...] To minimise the amount of movement required, the puppets were made to stand on moving walkways or sit at moving desks: for example, Colonel White's desk on Cloudbase is seen to rotate, while Lieutenant Green is seen to operate the Cloudbase main computer from a <b>sliding</b> <b>chair.</b> Puppeteer Jan King recalls: ...|$|R

Assistive devices exist to aid in motion, such as <b>sliding</b> <b>chairs</b> to provide pelvic thrust. Spasticity and pain also create barriers to sexual activity; these changes may require couples to use new positions, such as seated in a wheelchair.

40|$|Physics-based and {{data-driven}} {{models are}} the two major prognostic approaches in the literature with their own advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a similarity-based data-driven prognostic methodology and efficiency analysis study on remaining useful life estimation results. A similarity-based prognostic model is modified to employ the most similar training samples for RUL estimations on each time instance. The presented model is tested on; Virkler’s fatigue crack growth dataset, a drilling process degradation dataset, and a <b>sliding</b> <b>chair</b> degradation of a turnout system dataset. Prediction performances are compared utilizing an evaluation metric. Efficiency analysis of optimization {{results show that the}} modified similarity-based model performs better than the original definition. 1...|$|R

5000|$|... "Basket arch" [...] {{turnouts}} (Korbbogenweichen) {{were built}} in 1988 at Saalbach junction so that trains could branch at 200 km/h. They were initially the most elaborate turnouts in Germany. As {{the continuation of the}} high-speed line to Stuttgart was then under construction, the points were initially fixed in the branching position. Their length is 154 m and their weight (including the concrete sleepers) is 210 t. The point blades are 40 m-long, the moveable point frogs are 15 m long. The radius of the branching track is initially 7,000 m and reduces at the frog to 6000 m. The two sets of point blades are operated by two turnout motors with eight points of activation and closed with eight clamps. Separate test contacts are used to monitor the position of the points. The moveable point frogs are activated by a motor and secured by three clip fasteners. In the points area, two points signals are installed at the approaches and a third in the centre of the turnout. Another innovation was the use of <b>slide</b> <b>chairs</b> that require little lubrication. The two turnouts are still among the fastest in terms of operating speeds in Germany.|$|R
60|$|He had {{aimed at}} {{the body of the}} aeroplane, but at the very last instant a better idea had flashed into his mind. He twisted about and struck {{near the edge of the}} {{starboard}} wing with all his accumulated weight. He was jerked back as he struck. His prow went gliding across its smooth expanse towards the rim. He felt the forward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him and his aeropile along with it, and for a moment that seemed an age he could not tell what was happening. He heard a thousand throats yelling, and perceived that his machine was balanced on the edge of the gigantic float, and driving down, down; glanced over his shoulder and saw the backbone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up. He had a vision through the ribs of <b>sliding</b> <b>chairs,</b> staring faces, and hands clutching at the tilting guide bars. The fenestrations in the further float flashed open as the aeronaut tried to right her. Beyond, he saw a second aeroplane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its heeling fellow. The broad area of swaying wings seemed to jerk upward. He felt his aeropile had dropped clear, that the monstrous fabric, clean overturned, hung like a sloping wall above him.|$|R

40|$|This topic {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and analysis of a stair case lift, which can be use as Material Handling System. A stair case lift is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs {{up and down on}} the stairs, who may find difficulty in doing so themselves. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting platform is attached to the rail. A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure. This lift runs on electric power and consists of a motor, reduction gear box, rope drive, two rails a <b>sliding</b> <b>chair.</b> In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will make the motor run in reverse direction connected with the earlier, while the later will form the entire assembly run to in downward direction, with the help of Toggle switches and push buttons. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations. Can be of industrial use too. Moreover, considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the capacity of motor. There is lot of scope for further modification in the project as using monorail instead of two. Use of belt drive or chain drive instead of rope drive. Incorporation and automation/ timer unit which will ease the use of device. Rack and carrier arrangement for using the device for curved stair case. Use of work & roller reduction gear assembly...|$|R
60|$|Las Vegas ran {{his horse}} from Widow Cass's cottage to Turner's saloon, and the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door. Las Vegas's {{entrance}} was a leap. Then he stood {{still with the}} door ajar and the horse pounding and snorting back. All the men in that saloon who saw the entrance of Las Vegas knew what it portended. No thunderbolt could have more quickly checked the drinking, gambling, talking crowd. They recognized with kindred senses {{the nature of the}} man and his arrival. For a second the blue-hazed room was perfectly quiet, then men breathed, moved, rose, and suddenly caused a quick, <b>sliding</b> crash of <b>chairs</b> and tables.|$|R
50|$|Difficulties {{can arise}} in the playing of the game due to the vast {{differences}} in the physical abilities of the players. The only thing that is common to all players {{is that they have}} a physical disability and are wheelchair users. This means that players who kick the ball are usually more powerful and accurate than those who cannot. In response, some players who use electric wheelchairs attach a flat metal or wooden panel to the front of their foot plates. This measure both prevents the ball on <b>sliding</b> underneath the <b>chair</b> during play (a common problem), and also gives the player a flat surface when making contact with the ball. This increases passing and potential goalscoring accuracy.|$|R

A police constable said that she saw a <b>chair</b> <b>slide</b> {{on the floor and}} [...] "was convinced that nobody there had touched it", and later claims included allegedly demonic voices, loud noises, thrown rocks and toys, overturned chairs, and children levitating. Reports of further incidents in the house attracted considerable press attention and the story was covered in British newspapers such as the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror, until reports came to an end in 1979. On Halloween 2011, BBC News featured comments from a radio interview with photographer Graham Morris, who claimed that many of the events were genuine.|$|R

Although Gene swears that the absent Eddie is innocent, Crosby deduces that Eddie has gone to Kitty's apartment and follows him there. Crosby is about to arrest Eddie and Kitty, when Molly arrives and reveals that she killed Hawk because he no longer wanted her. As there was a reward for the killer of the policeman, dead or alive, Crosby tells Molly that things will not go badly for her.

At Barely Legal, the Dudleys faced The Eliminators for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. During the match, Gertner was hit by The Eliminators finishing move, the Total Elimination, and as a result he began wearing his now infamous neckbrace and continues to do so. The Eliminators would go on to win the match and the titles as well. Joel involved himself in a six-man tag team match at Heat Wave 98, between Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and Spike Dudley taking on D-Von, Big Dick and Bubba Ray, insulting head ECW referee John Finnigan.

Brooks {{continued}} to strike Sumner until Sumner rose to his feet and ripped the desk from the floor {{in an effort to get}} away from Brooks. [...] By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood. He staggered up the aisle and, arms outstretched, vainly attempted to defend himself. But then he was an even larger and easier target for Brooks, who continued to beat him across the head, face, and shoulders [...] "to the full extent of my power." [...] Brooks didn't stop when his cane snapped; he continued thrashing Sumner with the piece which held the gold head. Sumner stumbled and reeled convulsively, [...] "Oh Lord," [...] he gasped [...] "Oh! Oh!" [...] Near the end of the attack, Sumner collapsed unconscious, although shortly before he succumbed he [...] "bellowed like a calf" [...] according to Brooks. Brooks grabbed the falling Sumner, held him up by the lapel with one hand, and continued to lash out at him with the cane in the other. [...] Several other Senators and Representatives attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Edmundson, who yelled at the spectators to leave Brooks and Sumner alone, and Keitt, who brandished his own cane and a pistol, and shouted, [...] "Let them be!"
