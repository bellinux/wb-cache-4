40|$|The {{combination}} of wind generation and {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) on an industrial site brings significant design and operational challenges. The stochastic nature of wind power affects the flows of electricity imported and exported {{to and from}} the site. Economies of scale favor larger wind turbines, {{but at the same time}} it is also desirable to minimize the amount of electricity exported from the site to avoid incurring increased network infrastructure usage charges. Therefore the optimum situation is to maximize the proportion of the <b>site</b> <b>load</b> served by on-site generation. This paper looks at a visualization technique for power flows on an industrial site, which can be used to size on-site generators. The technique is applied to a test case, demonstrating how a simple combined heat and power control scheme can support the integration of on-site wind power. The addition of such CHP control has a small impact on the CHP unit but can greatly increase the proportion of wind generation consumed on-site. This visualization technique allows the comparison of different generation mixes and control schemes in order to arrive at the optimal mix from a technical and economic viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|The ATLAS {{computing}} {{model was}} originally designed as static clouds (usually national or geographical groupings of sites) around the Tier 1 centres, which confined tasks {{and most of}} the data traffic. Since those early days, the sites' network bandwidth has increased at O(1000) and the difference in functionalities between Tier 1 s and Tier 2 s has reduced. After years of manual, intermediate solutions, we have now ramped up to full usage of World-cloud, the latest step in the PanDA Workload Management System to increase resource utilization on the ATLAS Grid, for all workflows (MC production, data (re) processing, etc.).

40|$|Development of {{information}} technologies and market requirements in effective control over cargo flows, forces enterprises {{to look for}} new ways and methods of automated control over the technological operations. For rail transportation {{one of the most}} complicated tasks of automation is the cargo flows distribution over the <b>sites</b> of <b>loading</b> and unloading. In this article the solution with the use of one of the methods of artificial intelligence – a fuzzy inference has been proposed. The analysis of the last publications showed that the fuzzy inference method is effective for the solution of similar tasks, it makes it possible to accumulate experience, it is stable to temporary impacts of the environmental conditions. The existing methods of the cargo flows distribution over the <b>sites</b> of <b>loading</b> and unloading are too simplified and can lead to incorrect decisions. The purpose of the article is to create a distribution model of cargo flows of the enterprises over the <b>sites</b> of <b>loading</b> and unloading, basing on the fuzzy inference method and to automate the control. To achieve the objective a mathematical model of the cargo flows distribution over the <b>sites</b> of <b>loading</b> and unloading has been made using fuzzy logic. The key input parameters of the model are: «number of loading sites», «arrival of the next set of cars», «availability of additional operations». The output parameter is «a variety of set of cars». Application of the fuzzy inference method made it possible to reduce loading time by 15 % and to reduce costs for preparatory operations before loading by 20 %. Thus this method is an effective means and holds the greatest promise for railway competitiveness increase. Interaction between different types of transportation and their influence on the cargo flows distribution over the <b>sites</b> of <b>loading</b> and unloading hasn’t been considered. These sites may be busy transshipping at that very time which is characteristic of large enterprises. Besides, the question of gaining experience in this model isn't tackled yet and it is to be developed in further publication...|$|R

40|$|Grid systems {{integrate}} heterogeneous distributed {{resources that}} {{are not subject to}} centralized control, creating powerful infrastructures that can provide a variety of services. This thesis studies the allocation of jobs to resources in computational grids, with the use of simulation. The job allocation occurs at two levels. At the first level, the grid scheduler dispatches the jobs to the distributed independent sites, and at the next level, the local scheduler in each site allocates specific processors in order to start the actual process of jobs. Some of the challenges, which are taken into account in this thesis, are the effectiveness of resource management, the variability of job service demands, the system’s performance and the energy consumption. The main objective of the grid scheduler is the discovery and selection of the most appropriate sites and the efficient load sharing. To accomplish this task, the grid scheduler must have some sort of static information about the characteristics of sites. Additionally, it can utilize dynamic <b>site</b> <b>load</b> information in order to watch their state. In the present thesis, policies that utilize dynamic <b>site</b> <b>load</b> information are examined. Two different hybrid policies, which combine two policies, are proposed and evaluated. The first hybrid policy, which is applied in the case where the grid scheduler does not know in advance the service demands of jobs, selects a scheduling type based on the arrival time of a job. The second hybrid policy, which is applied when the grid scheduler is aware of the service demands of jobs, selects the scheduling policy based on a job’s demand. Jobs that are submitted to a computational grid can show high variability regarding their service demands, due to the different user demands. Schedulers must {{be able to deal with}} such a situation, especially when service demands are unknown. The performance of various policies at grid and local level, when service demands of jobs are highly variable, is studied in the present thesis. Different levels of variability are examined, and simulations are conducted in order to find the most effective combinations. The frequent transmission of dynamic load information from sites to the grid scheduler results in heavy network traffic and overhead. Two new site allocation policies are presented. One of their main advantages is that they require less frequent dynamic load information in order to operate. They are evaluated under the load balancing among the heterogeneous sites, in addition to performance. Besides performance evaluation, energy consumption is another issue that requires attention. In order to study the case where the energy consumption is taken into account, three local job scheduling polices in a cluster are proposed and evaluated. The cluster involves processors with different performance and power characteristics. One policy is optimized for energy conservation, while the other two policies are optimized for high performance. Simulation experiments are used to discover the most suitable policy according to system’s status and the desired priority (high performance or energy conservation...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{generation}} is used worldwide to provide prime power or {{as a backup}} should the mains electricity supply be lost. This thesis presents {{a model of a}} diesel generating set (gen-set) to simulate its behaviour following a sudden application of load. Load acceptance is of particular interest in standby applications where the <b>site</b> <b>load</b> is connected through a breaker to an unloaded gen-set, The quality of a gen-set's voltage and frequency are of the most concern when supplying a load. During large load acceptances, transient voltage and frequency deviations can be so large that lights will extinguish, contactors drop out, and permanent damage can occur to sensitive electronics. In extreme cases the load can cause the engine to stall. The increasing desire to predict the magnitude of these deviations from nominal values has identified the need to have an accurate gen-set model. The model presented in this thesis was developed in order that the voltage and frequency transients could be recreated and examined in the simulation environment. There is considerable detail included, with models of the engine, governor, synchronous machine and voltage regulator, and many of their component parts. The control signals and other interaction are also included, so that the gen-set's behaviour during load acceptance can be analysed. The gen-set model has been extensively validated against plant measurements under a number of test scenarios and is shown to remain accurate. The model has also been used to predict a number of potential performance enhancements which could be implemented on the gen-set in the future.

Telecommunication for mobiles is via base transceiver stations or BTSs. The telecom providers are pushed to provide greater coverage taking their technology into remote areas away from grid power or into areas of the grid that are unstable. Sited in remote areas, several BTSs are {{some distance from the}} electricity grid and this poses a problem of power supply for these stations. Traditionally remote sites are powered by diesel generators. In this dissertation the cost effectiveness of introducing solar PV is investigating. Focusing on the most cost effective solutions of solely generator produced power and comparing the results to the most economic amount of solar PV produced power. The research case studies centres on two locations namely Laos and Thailand. The method of research is a desktop analysis using Homer modelling software for energy systems. Figures for the cost of components were gathered from two sources one in Laos and the other in Thailand. The results are tabulated, and analysed. Although the technical feasibility aspects are not investigated it is assumed by the author that the proposed solution is viable. This dissertation shows that using solar PV for remote stations away from the grid is a cost effective method to power these sites, even with variations in price of fuel, solar resource and the considered load of the BTS site. The benefits of a PV System are: • The overall levelised cost of electricity is significantly lower. • Although the capital outlay is more for a PV system the operational costs are much lower. • The impact of increased fuel prices is very small with solar PV integrated into the system. • Even with a marginal solar resource there is still great value from choosing solar. • As the size of the BTS <b>site</b> <b>load</b> increases there is also a greater cost saving. • The autonomy of the system is increased. • Less environmental damage...|$|E
