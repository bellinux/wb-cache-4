40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare results {{obtained}} from three methods of assigning letter grades to students ’ achievement. The conventional and the most popular method to assign grades is the <b>Straight</b> <b>Scale</b> method (SS). Statistical approaches which used the Standard Deviation (GC) and conditional Bayesian methods are considered to assign the grades. In the conditional Bayesian model, we assume the data to follow the Normal Mixture distribution where the grades are distinctively separated by the parameters: means and proportions of the Normal Mixture distribution. The problem lies in estimating the posterior density of the parameters which is analytically intractable. A solution to this problem is using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach namely Gibbs sampler algorithm. The <b>Straight</b> <b>Scale,</b> Standard Deviation and Conditional Bayesian methods are applied to the examination raw scores of two sets of students. The performances of these methods are measured using the Neutral Class Loss, Lenient Class Loss and Coefficient of Determination. The results showed that Conditional Bayesian outperformed the Conventional Methods of assigning grades...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{survival}} potential of Russian firms. First, a composite measure of survival potential is developed using select {{characteristics of the}} firm, the firm's management, and the market structure faced by the firm. The measure is applied to 51 Russian firms, based on in-depth interviews with top-level managers of manufacturing, trade and other organizations conducted in 1995 in Moscow, Volgograd, Rostov and Taganrog. Using arbitrarily assigned weights for each element in the composite measure and a <b>straight</b> <b>scale</b> for categorizing firm performance, {{ten percent of the}} firms emerge as champions, more than fifty percent emerge as chaff. Second, two different proxies are used as a measure of survival potential, and the relative importance of firm, management and market structure characteristics is estimated. The weights are adjusted in the composite measure to reflect the regression results. The results indicate that survival potential is not driven by ownership structure, firm size, or the presence of monopoly power. ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{instructors}} have {{a tendency}} to place students on a curved grading scale based upon statistics and the average student's performance during the semester. This is often done because it makes it easy for professors to assign final grades. Professors can also feel more comfortable about their exams because any unfair questions will be normalized out through the curve. It is comfortable to use a curved scale, too, because many of the courses the instructors had were taught on curved grading scales. There are several problems with adopting a traditional curved grading scale within engineering courses. We will highlight several points that should demonstrate why a <b>straight</b> <b>scale</b> is more appropriate. Curved grading scales are based upon statistical assumptions that the class is large and that the student body is randomly dispersed over a wide range of performance. However, most engineering courses do not have hundreds of students in them so the size of the class could skew the results. Another problem is that engineering does not attract a random sample of student abilities. Within the three universities that I have been affiliated with, each school had...|$|E

The composite measure is applied to 51 Russian firms located in Moscow, Volgograd, Rostov and Taganrog, utilizing data collected in 1995 from in-depth interviews with top-level managers of manufacturing, trade, and other organizations. Using a <b>straight</b> <b>scale</b> with equal weights for each element of the composite measure, the survey results suggest that {{more than three years}} after the initiation of the transition from plan to market in Russia, champions number fewer than one-in-fifty, challengers may account for less than 10 %, and firms unlikely to survive the transition process, the chaff, represent 80 - 85 %. Utilizing unequal weights, that is, weighting current profitability, export experience, foreign investment,. monopoly power, and future financial and production strategies twice as much as the other elements in the composite measure, generates the outcome where 5 firms meet the criteria for champion (10 %), 18 firms are challengers (35 %), and 28 are chaff (55 %).

40|$|The offsite worker {{health risk}} {{analysis}} begins with estimating the pollutant concentration at a receptor location. To estimate this concentration, the typical {{approach is to}} use the residential annual concentration that is modeled based on the adjacent facility’s emission schedule. However, if the facility emissions are non-continuous (i. e., the facility does not emit for 24 hours a day and 7 days a week), the residential concentration may not represent what the offsite worker breathes during their work shift. In lieu of conducting additional special case modeling which can be time-consuming, the residential annual concentration is adjusted upwards using a worker adjustment factor based on the facility’s emission schedule with respect to the worker’s schedule. For an 8 -hour work shift that coincides with an adjacent facility that emits eight hours per day, a worker adjustment factor of 4. 2 (24 hours / 8 hours * 7 days / 5 days) is typically used for cancer risk assessment. A possible problem with using this approach is that wind direction, wind speed, and atmospheric stability can vary throughout the day and night and <b>straight</b> <b>scaling</b> as above may skew the results.

The present study focuses on the surgical scaling effectiveness in root deposits removal; the potential support of a disclosing agent during this procedure is also evaluated. Forty surgical periodontal patients were randomly divided between surgeries where the operator was informed about a final examination of the residual root deposits and surgeries where the operator was not informed. <b>Straight</b> after <b>scaling</b> procedures a supervisor recorded the O’Leary Plaque Index of the exposed roots by mean of a disclosing agent and the percentage of teeth with residual biofilm.

As such, {{the focus of this}} dissertation is placed on the outphasing amplifier concept, which can offer high-efficiency, good linearity and excellent opportunities for system integration. With this mind set, various outphasing concepts have been studied at different levels of abstraction, starting from their fundamental operation, to very detailed efficiency and bandwidth considerations. In order to enable the future package integration of complete RF high-power amplifiers and transmitter lineups, dedicated design techniques for very compact and high-power magnetic components have been developed utilizing low-cost wire bonding techniques. Using these techniques, a very low-loss, high-current RF transformer concept was introduced that allows <b>straight</b> forward power <b>scaling</b> in RF amplifiers. Next, to demonstrate the practical use of these low-loss magnetic components with their related design flow, two very compact high-power class-E branch amplifiers were realized and tested. Expanding on these initial works, one of the key demonstrators of this thesis was a " 70 W fully packaged-integrated GaN outphasing amplifier", which represents a remarkable combination of high-efficiency, high-output power with a very small form factor. Finally, to facilitate the future integration of advanced switchmode outphasing systems in a single package, the design of high-voltage CMOS drivers was discussed and demonstrated. These devices can provide the essential physical link between the final PA stages with the intelligence of the forgoing TX chain, which is typically implemented in standard low-voltage CMOS technologies.
