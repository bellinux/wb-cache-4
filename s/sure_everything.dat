The drivers, though, still were not convinced, but the race organizers threatened legal action if no race was run. This, and rumors that the Guardia Civil would seize the cars which were in the paddock, which was at Montjuïc Stadium, forced the drivers to call off the strike.|$|E

The album was originally scheduled for an early 2010 release, but Shinoda was concerned with [...] "the quality of the tunes" [...] and said, [...] "if we need to take a step back and make <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> is top, top quality by our standards, we will".

500|$|Bell began {{crafting}} his script, {{adding a}} mafia-related sub-plot and replacing the airplane drop with a fall from a building, for budgetary reasons. The biggest hurdle for the episode, however, was crafting the Rube Goldberg machine. However, because Bell had [...] "extra time" [...] {{to write his}} script, the art department was given {{a head start on}} crafting the contraption. Gillian Anderson later explained that working with the machines required a lot of patience, because multiple takes had to be filmed in order to make <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> went as planned. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, broke a [...] "long-standing rule" [...] on the show and re-cast Willie Garson—who had appeared in the third season episode [...] "The Walk"—as Henry Weems.

500|$|The crew {{spent a long}} {{amount of}} time {{plotting}} out the episode in a room, using sticky notes, {{in order to make}} sure it played out sensibly and was clearly understandable to viewers. The production staff based a lot of the usage of time travel in [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" [...] on those from the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1960). The goal of the crew was to make <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations, including several paradoxes involving time travel. The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements. The hopes of the production staff was to make the episode one that they could watch multiple times and notice something new with each viewing.|$|E

Jodi Bearman, who organized the trip, stated, [...] "the chaperones {{were not supposed to}} keep up with their every move." [...] Police Commissioner Gerold Dompig, who headed the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, stated that the Mountain Brook students engaged in [...] "wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every night. We know the Holiday Inn told them they weren't welcome next year. Natalee, we know, she drank all day every day.

Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> will turn out all right ("A Cockeyed Optimist").

500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion.

500|$|... "The Calusari" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, with critics citing {{inconsistencies in}} the plot as the main detractions. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] rating, calling it [...] "an Exorcist/Omen rip-off, but a classy one". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a [...] "C+", writing that it was [...] "an episode {{with a lot of}} great and spooky moments", but [...] "a messy, chaotic story that could have been much better developed, and too many things that happen [...] just because the writers thought it would be cool if they happened". However, while he was [...] "not <b>sure</b> <b>everything</b> hangs together" [...] and he wished for more backstory, VanDerWerff did praise some [...] "really great moments", particularly the opening teaser. John Keegan from Critical Myth, while calling the episode [...] "a mixed bag", awarded it a 7 out of 10. He praised the entry's [...] "fascinating implications [...] the mythology hidden within the events depicted", and noted that it was [...] "well directed and acted". Despite this, he was more critical of the episode's plot and wrote that there were [...] "clear logical flaws [...] and the subject matter can be disturbing. This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called it a [...] "pale retread of The Exorcist" [...] and noted that many of the episode's elements, like the chicken-sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members, were [...] "tremendously crass". Shearman and Pearson, however, did enjoy the episode's dialogue, praising one scene in particular where the spirit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother. Regardless, however, the duo concluded that [...] "there's something stale and pointless at [...] heart." [...] The plot for [...] "The Calusari" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Garth Nix.|$|E

[...] A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department.

[...] The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. [...] The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. [...] Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. [...] 15,000 images were taken {{during the first year of}} the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts.
