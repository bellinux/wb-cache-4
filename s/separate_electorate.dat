While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a <b>separate</b> <b>electorate.</b> It {{came to be known}} as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.|$|E

In February 1946, the Naga Club officially took shape into a unified Naga National Council in Wokha. In June 1946, the Naga National Council submitted a four-point memorandum to officials discussing the independence of India from British colonial rule.

25|$|In {{the round}} table conference held on August 1932, upon {{the request of}} Ambedkar, the then Prime Minister of Britain, Ramsay Macdonald made a Communal Award which awarded a {{provision}} for separate representation for the Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Dalits. These depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which voters belonging to the depressed classes only could vote. Gandhi went on a hunger strike against this provision claiming that such an arrangement would split the Hindu community into two groups. Years later, Ambedkar wrote that Gandhi's fast {{was a form of}} coercion. This agreement, which saw Gandhi end his fast and Ambedkar drop his demand for a <b>separate</b> <b>electorate,</b> was called the Poona Pact.|$|E

25|$|The 1950 Constitution of India, {{introduced}} {{after the}} country gained independence, included measures {{to improve the}} socioeconomic conditions of Dalits.

Communities that were categorised as being one of those groups were guaranteed {{a percentage of the}} seats in the national and state legislatures, as well as in government jobs and places of education. The system has its origins in the 1932 Poona Pact between Ambedkar and Gandhi, when Ambedkar conceded his demand that the Dalits should have an electorate separate from the caste Hindus in return for Gandhi accepting measures along these lines. The notion of a <b>separate</b> <b>electorate</b> had been proposed in the Communal Award made by the British Raj authorities, and the outcome of the Pact - the Government of India Act of 1935 - both introduced the new term of Scheduled Castes in replacement for Depressed Classes and reserved seats for them in the legislatures.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932, British {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a <b>separate</b> <b>electorate</b> for [...] "Depressed Classes" [...] in the Communal Award. Gandhi fiercely opposed a <b>separate</b> <b>electorate</b> for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community. Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, Congress politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada. On 25 September 1932, the agreement known as Poona Pact was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the Communal Award earlier proposed by British [...] Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The text uses the term [...] "Depressed Classes" [...] to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950. [...] In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates.|$|E
