500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|Brian D. Schiller of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He stated that [...] "the album is at best another good step toward their once great state and not a full return to it. What's true, though, is that it's the group's best full album since Vitalogy." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club ranked the album B+, {{considering}} it the [...] "tightest Pearl Jam album in a decade", describing the album as a comeback [...] "filled with straight-up, riff-a-riffic rock songs." [...] Mojo gave the album three out of five stars. The review said, [...] "elf-titled with good reason: Pearl Jam sound reborn, vital." [...] Kyle Anderson of Spin gave the album three out of five stars. He said that [...] "rather than rage against the time machine, they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> fun... Pearl Jam are taking themselves less seriously, and it fits them like a snug flannel shirt." [...] Mat Snow of The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars. In the review he stated that Vedder [...] "musters absolute conviction in writing and singing lyrics of male teenage angst." [...] Snow observed, [...] "And though few of these 13 numbers have the drama of tracks by the Who or Led Zeppelin, from whom the band draw much of their style, Pearl Jam play like men on a mission." [...] David Raposa of Pitchfork called it the [...] "most consistent effort the group's released since its second album," [...] but he added that it [...] "gets pretty boring pretty... quick." ...|$|E

Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend described [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as [...] "one of the most random episodes of The Office." ...|$|E
