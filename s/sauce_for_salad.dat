In this process emulsifier can be added to keep the stabilization, so salad dressing can’t be separated. Tool that was used on this homogenization process is called homogenizer. The homogenizer consist of a digital LCD, stirrer, stabilizer, statif, and clamp. It has the capability to create a high speed rotation until 27. 000 rpm to mix the oil and water. The purpose of the use of a homogenizer for salad dressing emulsion stability testing, using homogenization and variable rotation speed ratio of different materials. From the test of salad dressing stability and flavour, remain variable that was used is time and the total volume of corn oil and lemon juice that being used. While the cange variable that being used was ratio comparation between corn oil and lemon juice, and rotation speed of the homogenizer. As comparison, egg yolks addition and different temperature observing were used. Analysis conducted in this test were organoleptic test, density and viscosity test, and emulsion stability test. In the test density and viscosity obtained using the rotational speed ratio homogenasasi and different materials - different when mixing. The faster the rotation homogenizer, then the material will be homogenized so well that the density and viscosity will be smaller. The addition of egg yolk as a natural emulsifier that has its activity lowered the surface tension between two phases of different polarity and different densities, in this case the water is polar and the non-polar oil. Because of this emulsifier activity, both substances can be united with the good. Egg yolk as an emulsifier to produce density and viscosity greater after mixed with corn oil and lemon juice.
