40|$|Introduction Fej'er {{monotone}} {{methods are}} used to solve problems with convex solution sets. The theory of Fej'er monotone sequences and mappings has a long history. It started in the 1960 s with papers by the Russian mathematician Eremin. His monograph [1] from 1979 contains the first <b>summarized</b> <b>description</b> of such methods in finite dimensional Euclidian vector spaces, with many applications to the iterative solution of convex problems. The universal character of the methods and the weak assumptions which were necessary for proving their convergence created {{a great interest in}} completing the theoretical 1 foundations. Nowadays there exist important applications in computerized tomography and in image and signal reconstruction (see e. g. [10]). Considering a convex problem with solution set M we can attack it iteratively by the use of so-called ff-strongly M-Fej'er monotone sequences (x k) which satisfy...|$|E

40|$|Subspan {{oscillations}} is {{a well-known}} phenomenon in high-voltage and ultra-high-voltage transmission lines. It occurs on conductor bundles and it {{is due to the}} effect of the wake produced by the windward conductor on the leeward one. For this reason, the phenomenon is also classified as wake-induced oscillations. The oscillations are characterized by a frequency in the range 0. 5 - 3 Hz, which corresponds to the mode of vibration of a section of conductor between two spacers, with an antinode at mid-subspan. In this paper, an overview of the numerical models adopted for the evaluation of subspan oscillation is provided.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{questions}} concerning learning in a Multi-Agent System's environment is: "(How) can agents benefit from mutual interaction during the learning process?" This paper describes a technique that enables a heterogeneous group of Learning Agents (LAs) to improve its learning performance by exchanging advice. This technique uses supervised learning (backpropagation), where the desired response is not given by the environment but is based on advice given by peers with better performance score. The LAs are facing problems with similar structure, in environments where only reinforcement information is available. Each LA applies a different, well known, learning technique. The problem used {{for the evaluation of}} LAs performance is a simplified trafficcontrol simulation.

40|$|Introduction The {{theory of}} Fejer {{monotone}} sequences and mappings {{has a long}} history. It started already in the sixteeth of our century and was closely connected with the Russian mathematician Eremin ([4],[5]). The monography [6] contains a <b>summarizing</b> <b>description</b> for finitedimensional spaces with various applications to the iterative solution of convex problems. Parallel to this development the basic ideas of Fejer theory also occured in concrete applications (e. g. [9],[1],[7],[12]). This process continues up to present time. Often the authors {{do not know the}} original literature and the developed theory (e. g. [18],[10],[8],[3]). The great interest in Fejer methods is caused by the wide range of applications. At present they play an important part in computerized tomography and image recovery (see e. g. [19]). Consequently, there are strong requirements to expand and to complete the Fejer theory.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} description of linguistic phenomena of Verbo- Nominal Syntagmas (VNS) in Hindi, {{which is a}} connection of a noun or an adjective with a verb forming together a single predicate. These so called complex predicates are characteristic feature of Hindi and can be traced here more frequently than for example in Czech or English. There are two elements in VNS: Semantically weakened verb - it becomes rather a functional word, which means {{that it is a}} subject to conjugation. Sometimes term light verb is used. Though we can still perceive that the verbal element somehow modifies the new concept in accordance with it's basic meaning. The other element is a noun or an adjective. This part is the cornerstone of VNS from the semantic point of view. Concerning syntactic relations between the two components of VNS this thesis follows and <b>summarizes</b> <b>descriptions</b> made by Graham Bailey and Burton-Page and it also gives insight into research that has been carried out in this area...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing {{measurements}} of valve activity (i. e. {{the distance between}} the two valves) in populations of bivalves under natural environmental condition (16 oysters in the Bay of Arcachon, France, in 2007, 2013 and 2014), an algorithm for an automatic detection of the spawning period of oysters is proposed in this paper. Spawning observations are important in aquaculture and biological studies, and until now, such a detection is done through visual analysis by an expert. The algorithm is based on the fault detection approach and it works through the estimation of velocity of valve movement activity, that can be obtained by calculating the time derivative of the valve distance. A <b>summarized</b> <b>description</b> of the methods used for the derivative estimation is provided, followed by the associated signal processing and decision making algorithm to determine spawning from the velocity signal. A protection from false spawning detection is also considered by analyzing the simultaneity in spawning. Through this study, it is shown that spawning in a population of oysters living in their natural habitat (i. e. in the sea) can be automatically detected without any human expertise saving time and resources. The fault detection method presented in the paper {{can also be used to}} detect complex oscillatory behavior which is of interest to control engineering community...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{analysed}} {{the pollen}} content of 106 surface soil samples from evergreen and deciduous tropical forests distributed between 6 degrees and 13 degrees of latitude north in South India and Sri Lanka. The {{samples were collected}} along altitudinal gradients, ranging from 50 to 2420 m, in five regions that experience different rainfall regimes. Original pollen data from tropical vegetation subjected to seasonal monsoon rains are presented along altitude/temperature gradients. This paper includes a <b>summarized</b> <b>description</b> of the vegetation types mapped in the area.

Forests are well identified by percentages of Arboreal Pollen greater than 50 %, despite the fact that Dipterocarpaceae and Lauraceae are hardly recorded by pollen. The pollen distinction between low, medium and high elevation evergreen forests matches that established by ecologists. The botanical limits, respectively, placed at 900 m and 1500 m limits, correspond to the 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C-values of mean temperature of the coldest month.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{has increased}} {{as a result}} of two main factors: the economical recovering of industrialized countries after a decrease in energy demand and the economical emergence of countries such as China and India. Geothermal energy is one of the alternatives to ensure sustainable development, representing a clean, free, renewable energy available everywhere. The use of subsoil as a thermal energy reservoir has always been an opportunity. When the heat pump became a consolidated method, geothermal energy became cost-effective. In this method, the subsoil is used to take heat during winter and to release heat during summer, with a sustainable cost. The growing awareness and popularity of geothermal (ground-source) heat pumps have had the most significant impact on direct-use of geothermal energy. The annual energy use for these units grew 2. 45 times at a compound annual rate of 19. 7 %. The installed capacity grew 2. 29 times at a compound annual rate of 18. 0 %. This is due to better reporting and to the ability of geothermal heat pumps to utilize groundwater or ground-coupled temperatures anywhere in the world.
