40|$|<b>Spirotetramat</b> {{is a novel}} tetramic acid-based insecticide, {{belonging}} to keto-enol pesticide family, with a novel mode of action; it interferes with lipid biosynthesis. Its insecticide activity against various agricultural pest insects have been demonstrated (e. g. on [i]Myzus persicae[/i], [i]Bemisia tabaci[/i] and [i]Tetranychus urticae[/i]). However, information available is currently limited on the efficacy of <b>spirotetramat</b> on the cotton aphid, [i]Aphis gossypii[/i], a key cotton pest worldwide. We assessed the <b>spirotetramat</b> toxicity on [i]A. gossypii[/i] and evaluated its effects on aphid fecundity when exposed to a sublethal concentration (LC 10) and to increasing lethal concentrations (LC 25, LC 50, and LC 75). A key mechanism involved in insecticide resistance in aphids relates to esterase activity. We estimated the CarE activity and a CarE gene expression in aphids in response to <b>spirotetramat</b> exposure, then we tested tolerance of offspring to <b>spirotetramat</b> when the parents {{were exposed to the}} highest concentration tested in our study (LC 75). Results showed that <b>spirotetramat</b> showed increasing toxicity to [i]A. gossypii[/i] with exposure duration to treated leaves; LC 50 ranged from 23, 675. 68 to 12. 27 mg/L for 1 to 5 -days exposure. In addition, <b>spirotetramat</b> reduced aphid daily fecundity, in all concentration treatments, especially with up to 90 % reduction in case of exposure to LC 75. Total CarE activity increased dramatically and CarE mRNA expression was also up regulated in aphids after exposure to LC 75 <b>spirotetramat.</b> Finally, the tolerance to <b>spirotetramat</b> in offspring (when parents were exposed to the LC 75) showed a 2. 5 -fold increase when compared to control aphids. Consequently, spiroteramat showed potential for pest management of cotton aphids owing to both lethal and sublethal activities, notably strong impact on aphid fecundity. However, we also demonstrated that increased tolerance of [i]A. gossypii[/i] to <b>spirotetramat</b> may happen through increased CarE- activity and subsequent metabolic degradation of the insecticide in aphids' body...|$|E

Reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis, {{is a major}} pest of {{pineapple}} (Ananas comosus) {{and many}} vegetable crops in Hawaii reducing yields by 26. 8 - 50 %. Damage thresholds are low (300 - 1000 nematodes/ 250 cm 3 soil) and host-plant resistance is lacking. Therefore management of reniform nematode depends on other tactics. <b>Spirotetramat</b> is a systemic phloem-and-xylem mobility pesticide which acts as a lipid biosynthesis inhibitor. Lipids play a significant physiological role in molting and embryogenesis in plant-parasitic nematodes, hence <b>spirotetramat</b> may provide a viable nematode management tool. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine if <b>spirotetramat</b> was active against reniform nematode. An in vitro assay was conducted where reniform nematode eggs were subjected to different <b>spirotetramat</b> rates to assess its effect on hatching. A greenhouse experiment pot experiment where 14 -day-old tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants were transplanted, inoculated and treated with <b>spirotetramat</b> to assess nematode penetration. A second greenhouse assays were conducted in which 4 -month-old potted-pineapple plants were treated with different rates of <b>spirotetramat</b> 1 month post-inoculation (Pi) with R. reniformis and terminated at 4 or 10 months post-treatment (Pt) to assess nematode population and plant growth. A third greenhouse trial was conducted in which tomato plants were treated 14 days Pi and terminated 14 days Pt or 28 days Pi to assess nematode fertility. <b>Spirotetramat</b> treatment 14 days prior to inoculation significantly reduced 92 % nematode eggs/g of root. Nematode hatch was similar in all treatments. Penetration was suppressed 100 % at 50 g/ha in the tomato greenhouse experiment. In the pineapple trial, 200 g a. i/ha reduced 93 % nematode eggs/g of root and increased 34 % pineapple growth. Rhizosphere vermiform nematodes/g of root was reduced 89 % at 88 g a. i/ha.

The lethal and sublethal effects of <b>spirotetramat</b> were compared to those of chlorpyriphos and pyriproxyfen, two insecticides commonly used in Spanish citrus. <b>Spirotetramat</b> resulted harmless: (1) when directly applied on larvae and adults of C. montrouzieri, since it did not affect survival, longevity, fecundity, egg hatching, and offspring survival. In contrast, chlorpyriphos was classified as moderately toxic for adults due to its effects on fecundity, egg hatching and offspring survival. Pyriproxyfen was classified as harmful for larvae due to the acute effect on pupal mortality. When larvae and adults of C. montrouzieri were fed with treated prey, <b>spirotetramat</b> was also classified as harmless.

In this project we exposed M. sexmaculatus adults to two important commonly-used insecticides through feeding on treated prey (A. pistaciae) to evaluate the side-effects on this predator. We tested <b>spirotetramat,</b> which belongs to the keto-enol group inhibiting lipid biosynthesis in insects, at 2 / 1, 1 / 1 and 1 / 2 of the maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC), and abamectin, which is a mixture of avermectins and a natural fermentation product of the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis, at 1 / 1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 8 and 1 / 16 of its MFRC. <b>Spirotetramat</b> did not affect adult survival of M. sexmaculatus at all three concentrations when ingested via treated prey, while in marked contrast abamectin caused 100 % adult mortality of M. sexmaculatus when ingested via treated prey at 1 / 1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4 and 1 / 8 of the MFRC. At sublethal levels, <b>spirotetramat</b> reduced total and daily fecundity of M. sexmaculatus at all three concentrations tested, but did not affect egg hatching at 1 / 1 and 1 / 2 of the MFRC. Moreover, prey consumption was decreased when beetles were exposed to the prey treated with <b>spirotetramat</b> at 1 / 1 and 2 / 1 of the MFRC concentrations. With abamectin, even at 1 / 16 of the MFRC, total fecundity, daily fecundity and prey consumption of M. sexmaculatus adults were significantly affected. In conclusion, no acute toxicity was observed on M. sexmaculatus by ingestion of prey treated with <b>spirotetramat,</b> although reproduction parameters and prey consumption were affected at MFRC and lower concentrations.

ABSTRACT: If insecticides are not possible to exclude {{in the management of}} some pests, it is relevant that the resposable of an IPM program could known the effects of those products on natural enemies of primary pests of its crop. The objective of the present research was to assess the residual effects, and the lethal and sublethal toxicity of beta-cyfluthrin, bifenazate, clorantraniliprol, flonicamid, <b>spirotetramat</b> and thiametoxam on Catolaccus hunteri, an ectoparasitoid of the pepper weevil. For all experiments the residual contact method was used. We used leaf disks of pepper plants as the surface for exposition. Significant differences were found on lethal toxicity, according to the IOBC thiametoxam was moderately harmful (98 % of mortality, category 3) and beta-cyfluthrin was harmful (100 % of mortality, category 4) on C. hunteri. On the other hand, bifenazate, clorantraniliprol, flonicamid and <b>spirotetramat</b> were harmless (0 % of mortality). Beta-cyfluthrin and thiametoxam showed long residual effects, in both cases it was more than 34 days. Aditionally, beta-cyfluthrin was more residual than thiametoxam for 12 o 18 days. Talking about the sublethal effects the fecundity and the number of larvae eliminated, because of host feeding, were not different from the control. Longevity of C. hunteri disminished because of exposition to bifenazate, clorantraniloprol, <b>spirotetramat</b> and thiametoxam and it was shorter than the control.

40|$|The {{hoverfly}} Episyrphus balteatus (Degeer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} abundant predators of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae (L.)) in brussels sprouts in Belgium. In the current laboratory study, the toxicity of several insecticides applied at maximum recommended field rates was investigated on the larvae of E. balteatus. Two-to 3 -day-old larvae were confined in glass petri dishes with dry residues of freshly applied insecticides. Their mortality was checked daily until adult emergence. Sub-lethal effects were investigated by assessing the reproductive performance of adult hoverflies, originating from the surviving larvae. Of the five compounds tested, only pirimicarb caused 100 % larval mortality. The corrected mortality for spinosad was 60 % and the adults obtained from the surviving larvae did not succeed in laying eggs. Therefore, pirimicarb and spinosad were rated "harmful" (International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC) category 4) for the larvae of E. balteatus. In contrast, flonicamid, thiacloprid and <b>spirotetramat</b> yielded much lower mortality percentages. The hatching rate of hoverfly eggs treated with flonicamid was 25. 6 % vs 48. 7 % in the control. Hence, flonicamid was rated "slightly harmful" (IOBC category 2). The fertility of adults treated as larvae with thiacloprid or <b>spirotetramat</b> was not affected (IOBC category 1). These laboratory trials suggest that thiacloprid and <b>spirotetramat</b> can be used safely in integrated pest management programs to control the cabbage aphid.

The acaricidal effect after the treatment of eggs was not the result of <b>spirotetramat</b> toxicity to this developmental stage, but rather of its residual activity on hatched larvae (LC 50 = 0. 62 mg/L). Sublethal effects were evaluated after the treatment of pre-ovipositing adult females on leaf discs using the concentrations of 2 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 200 mg/L. After 18 – 20 hours of exposure on treated discs, females showing no visible symptoms of poisoning were transferred to untreated leaf discs and re-transferred to new discs at 48 h intervals over ten days.

The decontamination effect of catalyst on the residues of <b>spirotetramat</b> and imidacloprid in water was studied at three different buffer solutions (4. 0, 7. 0 and 9. 0). The catalytic reaction was measured under direct sunlight at two different concentration levels and the optimum concentration of catalyst required for the decontamination was also established by varying the amount of catalyst from 0. 02 to 0. 2 g/L. Residues are quantified by a high perform-ance liquid chromatography UV method (HPLC-UV) and calculated the DT 50 and DT 90 from the dissipation data. The rate of the reaction showed first order kinetics in water. The addition of zinc oxide nanorods induced the photocatalytic reaction contributing significantly to the rapid dissipation of residues. Complete mineralization of the residues was con-firmed by liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS).

Hence, research was conducted at the University of Florida to identify pesticides or biopesticides {{that could be used}} to manage these nematodes. The research comprised on-farm, field, and greenhouse trials. Nematicide treatments evaluated include commercial formulations of <b>spirotetramat,</b> furfural, and Purpureocillium lilacinum (=Paecilomyces lilacinus) strain 251. Treatment applications were made during the spring and fall seasons according to manufacturer's specifications. Efficacy was evaluated based on J 2 / 100 cm 3 of soil, J 2 /g of root, and crop yield (kg/plot). Unlike <b>spirotetramat,</b> which did not demonstrate any measurable effects on Meloidogyne incognita J 2 in the soil, furfural and P. lilacinum were marginally effective in reducing the population density of M. incognita on Pittosporum tobira. However, nematode reduction did not affect yield significantly. Although furfural and P. lilacinum have some potential for management of M. incognita on cut foliage crops, their use as a lone management option would likely not provide the needed level of control. Early treatment application following infestation provided greater J 2 suppression compared to late application,suggesting the need for growers to avoid infested fields...|$|E

It is mass-reared and released for augmentative biocontrol programs mainly aimed at controlling whiteflies and Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in greenhouses and open field. We evaluated the lethal and sublethal toxicity upon N. tenuis adults of label doses of three insecticides (pyriproxyfen, <b>spirotetramat,</b> cypermethrin) and seven fungicides (benomyl, chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride, cyazofamid, fluopicolide + propamocarb hydrochloride (FPH), penconazol, trifloxystrobin) commonly used in various crops. Two exposure routes were tested: (i) contact with dry residues of insecticides or fungicides on tomato sprouts and (ii) multiple exposure to these chemicals via topical sprays on adults which foraged on treated sprouts; and fed on treated eggs of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) simultaneously. Mortality and reproductive capacity were investigated as indicators of lethal and sublethal effects on N. tenius. The tested insecticides and fungicides were all classified as harmless when predator was exposed only to the dry residues of each. However, the multiple exposure to either cypermethrin, benomyl, chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or trifloxystrobin caused significant mortality of N. tenuis adults. Cypermethrin also significantly reduced its reproductive capacity. Interestingly, N. tenuis produced a higher number of progeny when exposed to fungicides penconazol and FPH in both exposure scenarios.

40|$|Abstract The European earwig (Forficula auricularia) is {{potentially}} a predator {{of a number}} of insect pests in apple orchards. However, its effectiveness as a natural enemy in apple orchards may be compromised by insecticide sprays. A laboratory bioassay of eight insecticides currently used in Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) apple orchards and one as-yet unregistered product was undertaken to determine their effects on earwigs. Adult earwigs were placed in ventilated containers where they were exposed to insecticide residues on apple leaves and monitored on four occasions over 10 days. Indoxacarb, thiacloprid, spinosad and diazinon caused the greatest mortality to earwigs while carbaryl appeared to be less harmful.

40|$|Spirodiclofen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recently}} developed acaricides and belongs to the new family of spirocyclic tetronic acids (ketoenols). This new acaricidal family is an important chemical tool in resistance management strategies providing sustainable control of spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae. Spirodiclofen targets lipid biosynthesis mediated by direct inhibition of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase). In this study, we investigated two genetically distant spider mite strains with high resistance to spirodiclofen. Despite the strong resistance levels to spirodiclofen (up to 680 -fold), only limited cross-resistance with other members of this group such as spiromesifen and <b>spirotetramat</b> could be detected. Amplification and sequencing of the ACCase gene from resistant and susceptible strains did not reveal common non-synonymous mutations, and expression levels of ACCase were similar in both resistant and susceptible strains, indicating the absence of target-site resistance. Furthermore, we collected genome-wide expression data of susceptible and resistant T. urticae strains using microarray technology. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed a broad response, but within the overlap of two resistant strains, several cytochrome P 450 s were prominent. Quantitative PCR confirmed the constitutive over-expression of CYP 392 E 7 and CYP 392 E 10 in resistant strains, and CYP 392 E 10 expression was highly induced by spirodiclofen. Furthermore, stage specific expression profiling revealed that expression levels were not significantly different between developing stages, but very low in eggs, matching the age-dependent resistance pattern previously observed. Functional expression of CYP 392 E 7 and CYP 392 E 10 confirmed that CYP 392 E 10 (but not CYP 392 E 7) metabolizes spirodiclofen by hydroxylation as identified by LC-MS/MS, and revealed cooperative substrate binding and a Km of 43 μM spirodiclofen. CYP 392 E 10 also metabolizes spiromesifen, but not <b>spirotetramat.</b> Surprisingly, no metabolism of the hydrolyzed spirodiclofen-enol metabolite could be detected. These findings are discussed in the light of a likely resistance mechanism...|$|E

The use of endosulfan has been banned in Benin since 2007 due to various nuisances on the environment and several cases of human poisoning detection by the Ministry of Health (Mbaye 2008). Endosulfan was replaced by Tihan 175 O-TEQ, a mixture of flubendiamide (100  g/L) and <b>spirotetramat</b> (75  g/L) which represents only 1.70  % of the pesticides applied in cotton culture (Agbohessi et al. 2011).

Essential oils from Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) and Thymus vulgaris (thyme) and their main constituents, linalool and thymol, respectively, were evaluated for insecticidal activity and synergistic action in combination with insecticides against green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The essential oils and their main constituents exerted similar insecticidal activity when aphids were exposed by direct sprays, but were non-toxic by exposure to treated leaf discs. In synergism experiments, the toxicity of imidacloprid was synergized 16 - to 20 -fold by L. angustifolia and T. vulgaris essential oils, but far less synergism occurred with linalool and thymol, indicating that secondary constituents of the oils were probably responsible for the observed synergism. In contrast to results with imidacloprid, the insecticidal activity of <b>spirotetramat</b> was antagonized by L. angustifolia and T. vulgaris essential oils, and linalool and thymol.

The two partial reactions, carboxylation of biotin followed by carboxyl {{transfer to the}} acceptor acetyl-CoA, are performed by two separate domains in animal ACCs. The cyclic keto-enol insecticides and acaricides have been proposed to inhibit insect ACCs. In this communication, we show that the enol derivative of the cylic keto-enol insecticide <b>spirotetramat</b> inhibited ACCs partially purified from the insect species Myzus persicae and Spodoptera frugiperda, {{as well as the}} spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) ACC which was expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed competitive inhibition with respect to the carboxyl acceptor, acetyl-CoA, indicating that spirotetramat-enol bound to the carboxyltransferase domain of ACC. Interestingly, inhibition with respect to the biotin carboxylase substrate ATP was uncompetitive. Amino acid residues in the carboxyltransferase domains of plant ACCs are important for binding of established herbicidal inhibitors. Mutating the spider mite ACC at the homologous positions, for example L 1736 to either isoleucine or alanine, and A 1739 to either valine or serine, did not affect the inhibition of the spider mite ACC by spirotetramat-enol.

40|$|Modern crop {{protection}} industry puts great efforts into {{the investigation and}} development of pesticides (insecticides, acaricides) with a novel mode of action, primarily because of increasingly important problem of resistance of pest organisms to pesticides. Resistance of many pest arthropod species (insects and mites) to insecticides and/or acaricides became a global phenomenon in the last decades. Therefore, pest management heavily relies on constant introduction of novel active ingredients in use, i. e. onthe alternative use {{of a number of}} compounds with different modes of action in order to save the longevity of newly developed products. Among pest arthropods, according to the potential for resistance development and a number of documented cases, spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae), especially species Tetranychus urticae and Panonychusulmi, as well as certain species of whiteflies and leaf aphids (Homoptra: Aleyrodidae,Aphididae) stand out.

40|$|Brussels sprouts are {{attacked}} {{by a variety of}} herbivore pests from several insect families. The most important leaf feeding ones are the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.), the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae (L.) and the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). As Brussels sprouts are a high yielding crop with an almost zero damage threshold, growers want to keep the sprouts free from damage by pest insects. Several measures are available to control insect pests, of which chemical control is most commonly applied. However, because of the negative side-effects of pesticides and in respect to the forthcoming implementation of the European directive 2009 / 128 /EC, growers have to resort to Integrated Pest Management strategies. The first principle of this strategy focusses on the prevention of pest outbreaks, which can be achieved by enhancing the populations of naturally occurring beneficial organisms (Conservation Biological Control). In Brussels sprouts, pest insects are {{attacked by}} several natural enemies which may all contribute to biological control. In a first part of the research, the phenology of the above mentioned pest insects and their key natural enemies was examined at three locations in Flanders (Beitem, Kruishoutem and Sint-Katelijne-Waver). The results revealed that the abundance of natural enemies was strongly related with pest abundance. Despite their high abundance, however, the natural enemies were unable to keep the key pests under control. Further, a substantial variability in the phenology of both pest insects and their natural enemies was found among locations and seasons, suggesting that for effective pest control monitoring should be done at each location of interest. In order to strengthen the biological control function of natural enemies, measures can be taken to increase their abundance in agro-ecosystems. Therefore, the impact of an annual flower strip on the pest complex in Brussels sprouts and the associated natural enemies was assessed. The results showed that the impact of a flower strip on the insect complex in and around Brussels sprout fields is not unambiguous. Despite the presence of an annual flower strip to enhance pest control by natural enemies, the sprouts could not be kept free from economic damage. Besides enhancing natural enemies by habitat management measures, conservation biological control also focusses on insecticide selectivity. Therefore, a set of laboratory experiments was carried out to assess the lethal and sub-lethal effects of selected insecticides (flonicamid, pirimicarb, pymetrozine, spinosad, <b>spirotetramat</b> and thiacloprid) on the hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus (Degeer), as a key natural enemy of the cabbage aphid. The susceptibility of the hoverfly differed among the selected insecticides and the experimental methods. Further, susceptibility to the tested compounds also varied among the life stages. It was concluded that flonicamid and pymetrozine were compatible in an IPM approach with this hoverfly. In a last part of this study a worst-case laboratory test was performed in which the selectivity of the above mentioned insecticides was examined on the hymenopteran parasitoid, Microplitis mediator (Haliday), as a natural enemy of the cabbage moth. Similar to the results of the hoverfly, selectivity varied among the tested insecticides. Thiacloprid and <b>spirotetramat</b> were rated harmless for the adult wasp. The results further indicated that the cocooned pupae were more protected from the insecticides compared to the adult wasps...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the impacts on natural enemies and competitor thrips species of insecticides used for control of western flower thrips in fruiting vegetables. Trials with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and with pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) were conducted to evaluate insecticide treatment effects on western flower thrips and natural enemies at the North Florida in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. A number of insecticides from different classes showed moderate to high efficacy against western flower thrips. The broad-spectrum insecticides acetamiprid, methomyl, and tolfenpyrad demonstrated activity against the pest, while also reducing populations of the key predator of thrips in pepper, Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). Insecticides that showed little impact on populations of O. insidiosus were cyantraniliprole, flonicamid, <b>spirotetramat,</b> and terpenes. Although only moderately active against the western flower thrips, they would be valuable additions to existing management programs for pepper. Insecticides with activity against western flower thrips also showed activity against Frankliniella tritici (Fitch).
