5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E

5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> serial, nearly double the amount <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include {{a larger proportion of}} pre-filmed inserts on 35mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E
