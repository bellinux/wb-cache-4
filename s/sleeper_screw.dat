40|$|Bachelor thesis {{developed}} in the bachelor degrees addresses technological process of the production <b>sleeper</b> <b>screw.</b> The production uses technology volume thermoforming. The project was elaborated {{in cooperation with the}} company ŠROUBÁRNA KYJOV s. r. o. The screw will be made from material ČSN 11 503. This material is unalloyed construction steel with property of weld. Based on the literature study technology volume thermoforming was chosen tamping in closed instrument for the production of head screw. For the production of screw-thread was chosen technology of rolling. For the production head of screw was chosen horizontal fitting press machine. After the production there were used surfacing by galvanic zinc coating because of the better corrosion resistance...|$|E

The durability of these sleepers depends verymuch on the fastening between the sleepers and the rails providedby the <b>sleeper</b> <b>screws.</b> The author suggests various systemsfor the fastening of the sleepers and the rails, especial~v in caseof the old ones, and particularly using the plastic replacingdowels...|$|R
5000|$|As {{well as the}} {{avoiding}} {{the use of the}} broad gauge, Brunel adopted a different form of track for the line: [...] "parallel rails" [...] weighing 55 lbs per yard, fixed in chairs with compressed wooden keys. The chairs were fixed to transverse <b>sleepers</b> by <b>screws</b> inserted prior to laying, [...] "ensuring accuracy of gauge".|$|R
2500|$|A screw spike, rail screw or {{lag bolt}} {{is a large}} (~ length, {{slightly}} under [...] diameter) metal screw used to fix a tie plate or to directly fasten a rail. Screw spikes are screwed into a hole bored in the <b>sleeper.</b> The <b>screw</b> spike has a higher cost to manufacture than the rail spike, but {{has the advantage of}} greater fixing power - approximately twice that of a rail spike - -and can be used in combination with spring washers.|$|R

5000|$|For the {{restoration}} of WHR (Caernarfon), the Ffestiniog Railway imported not only South African steam engines (some built in Manchester by Beyer Peacock and Company as recently as 1958) but also the rails and steel sleepers on which to run them. This track included eighty completely made up panels of [...] gauge (adjusted before use to [...] gauge) straight track (for the laying of which a special rail mounted track laying gantry - 'The Forth Bridge' - was built by Winson Engineering Ltd). The greater part of the rail came with a job lot of steel <b>sleepers,</b> clips, <b>screws,</b> bolts and fishplates, all to several different patterns, {{which had to be}} sorted by WHR and FR volunteers before they could be used. The bulk of the track including all the curved sections was built up on site with rails moved forward to the railhead using specially built rail grab trolleys known as RRMs - [...] "Roland's Rail Movers", named after WHLR Ltd construction manager Roland Doyle. These proved to be a highly successful innovation and they have been used on all subsequent tracklaying. Amusingly, they have also acquired the nickname [...] "Roland Rats", a title believed to have originated among the track gangs at the Porthmadog end, who also use the same technology.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Despite {{the steady}} {{increase}} in the length of sections of continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, wooden railway sleepers, {{as one of the}} options of under-rail bearings, are still operated on a sufficiently large number of areas, in particular, remain uncontested in the curve of up to 350 m radius, {{as well as on the}} main ways of subways. The main types of fasteners in the most common types of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden <b>sleepers</b> are track <b>screws</b> and spikes. Since the «wheel-rail» system contact peculiarities existing in track curved sections have a significant impact on the processes of interaction between the railway track and rolling stock, it is necessary in this work to determine the rigidity of the track screws and spikes, which are directly involved in the formation of spatial rigidity of the intermediate rail fastening nodes under the influence of horizontal transverse forces. Methodology. The study of the track screw and spike rigidity was conducted experimentally for the two types of intermediate rail fastenings – D 0 and «Metro». To carry out experimental tests, 10 test sites were selected on the roads of the regional branch of «Southern Railway» of «Ukrzaliznytsia», and 8 – in the main routes of KP «Kharkiv Metro». Each of the test sites was in approximately the same operating conditions, but had different values of passed tonnage. Findings. The values of the track screw and spike rigidity were obtained. Originality. The authors first obtained the experimental data on variation in rigidity of track screw and spike, depending on the useful life for the main railways and subway routes. This allows calculation of the horizontal shear forces in track curved sections (particularly in curves of up to 350 m radius), as well as the forecast evaluation of their level change during operation. Practical value. Based on the experimental data, it was found that variation in rigidity of track screw and spike depending on the lifetime is nonlinear. These experiments allow a more rational approach to the issue of determining the optimal design of the intermediate rail fasteners, based on the specific operating conditions, and may also contribute to the development of measures to improve the reliability of the components of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers...|$|R
