5|$|Elemental <b>Spirits,</b> {{also called}} Mana <b>Spirits,</b> are beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of <b>spirits</b> have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, the <b>spirits</b> serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple <b>spirits</b> of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the <b>spirits</b> are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of Dream Drop Distance is {{the inclusion of the}} Dream Eaters. Whilst they generally serve as the main enemies of the game, up to three good Dream Eaters, known as <b>Spirits,</b> can be recruited per character to assist them in battle. <b>Spirits</b> can be created by combining Dream Fragments together with an item or spell, either via experimenting with combinations or using recipes found throughout the game. Characters can also link with <b>Spirits</b> to perform unique attacks. Along the way, the player can care for these <b>Spirits</b> by petting them, feeding them items, or playing mini-games with them, which can unlock new abilities for the <b>Spirits.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic <b>spirits.</b> The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported <b>spirits</b> with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of <b>spirits</b> more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains <b>spirits</b> that need to be nourished by the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal <b>spirits.</b> Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the <b>spirits</b> be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E
