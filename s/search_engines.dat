This thesis is about <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization, which focus is to increase <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> rankings. <b>Search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization is an important branch of online marketing because {{the first page of}} <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> results is generating majority of the search traffic. Current articles about <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization and Google are indicating that with the proper use of quality content, there is potential to improve <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> rankings. However, the existing <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization literature is not noticing content at a sufficient level. To decrease that difference, the content-centered method for <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization is constructed, and content in <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization is studied. This content-centered method consists of three <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization tactics: 1) content, 2) keywords, and 3) links. Two propositions were used for testing these tactics in a real business environment and results are suggesting that the content-centered method is improving <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> rankings. <b>Search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization is constantly changing because Google is adjusting its search algorithm regularly. Still, some long-term trends can be recognized. Google has said that content is growing its importance as a ranking factor in the future. The content-centered method is taking advance of this new trend in <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization to be relevant for years to come...|$|R
