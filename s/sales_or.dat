Approximately 2,700tonnes (3,000tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it {{does not account for}} informal <b>sales</b> <b>or</b> consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700tonnes (8,500tons) annually.

5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via <b>sales</b> <b>or</b> purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

Under the revised clause (3) of article 286, Parliament will have the power to declare by law the goods which are of special importance to inter-State trade or commerce and also to specify the restrictions and conditions to which any State law (whether made before or after the Parliamentary law) would be subject in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> purchase of those goods. The full text of Article 286 of the Constitution, prior to being amended by section 4 of the 6th Amendment, is given below: 286.

50|$|Sales {{taxes in}} the United States are taxes placed on the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> lease of goods and {{services}} in the United States. In the United States, sales tax is governed at the state level and no national general sales tax exists. Forty-five states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam impose general sales taxes that apply to the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> lease of most goods and some services, and states also may levy selective sales taxes on the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> lease of particular goods or services.

For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for children's films), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.|$|E

This means that Kreuger gained a monopoly in match production, <b>sales,</b> <b>or</b> distribution, or a complete monopoly. The monopoly agreements differed from country to country. The capital was raised {{to a large extent}} through loans from Swedish and American banks, combined with issuing a large amount of participating debentures.
