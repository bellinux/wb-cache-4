40|$|We {{consider}} {{the task of}} computing (combined) function mapping and routing for requests in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). Function mapping refers to the assignment of nodes in the substrate network to various processing <b>stages</b> that <b>requests</b> must undergo. Routing refers to the assignment of a path in the substrate network that begins in a source node of the request, traverses the nodes that are assigned functions for this request, and ends in a destination of the request. The algorithm either rejects a request or completely serves a request, and its goal is to maximize {{the sum of the}} benefits of the served requests. The solution must abide edge and vertex capacities. We follow the framework suggested by Even for the specification of the processing requirements and routing of requests via processing-and-routing graphs (PR-graphs). In this framework, each request has a demand, a benefit, and PR-graph. Our main result is a randomized approximation algorithm for path computation and function placement with the following guarantee. Let m denote the number of links in the substrate network, denote a parameter such that 0 < < 1, and _f denote the maximum benefit that can be attained by a fractional solution (one in which requests may be partly served and flow may be split along multiple paths). Let denote the minimum edge capacity, and let denote the maximum demand. Let denote an upper bound on the number of processing <b>stages</b> a <b>request</b> undergoes. If /(·) =Ω((m) /^ 2), then with probability at least 1 - 1 /m-exp(-Ω(^ 2 ·_f /(·))), the algorithm computes a (1 -) -approximate solution. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

40|$|DIRAC is {{the grid}} {{solution}} developed to support LHCb production activities {{as well as}} user data analysis. It consists of distributed services and agents delivering the workload to the grid resources. Services maintain database back-ends to store dynamic state information of entities such as jobs, queues, <b>staging</b> <b>requests,</b> etc. Agents use polling to check and possibly react {{to changes in the}} system state. Each agent's logic is relatively simple, the main complexity lies in their cooperation. Agents run concurrently, and collaborate using the databases as shared memory. The databases can be accessed directly by the agents if running locally or through a DIRAC service interface if necessary. This shared-memory model causes entities to occasionally get into inconsistent states. Tracing and fixing such problems becomes formidable due to the inherent parallelism present. We propose more rigorous methods to cope with this. Model checking is one such technique for analysis of an abstract model of a system. Unlike conventional testing, it allows full control over the parallel processes execution, and supports exhaustive state-space exploration. We used the mCRL 2 language and toolset to model the behavior of two related DIRAC subsystems: the workload and storage management system. Based on process algebra, mCRL 2 allows defining custom data types as well as functions over these. This makes it suitable for modeling the data manipulations made by DIRAC's agents. By visualizing the state space and replaying scenarios with the toolkit's simulator, we have detected race-conditions and deadlocks in these systems, which, in several cases, were confirmed to occur in the reality. Several properties of interest were formulated and verified with the tool. Our future direction is automating the translation from DIRAC to a formal model...|$|R

40|$|The logic for {{handling}} of application <b>requests</b> to a <b>staged,</b> event-driven architecture is often distributed over different {{portions of the}} source code. This complicates changing and understanding the flow {{of events in the}} system. The article presents an approach that extracts request handling logic from regular stage functionality into a set of request scripts. These scripts are executed step-wise by sending continuations that encapsulate their request’s current execution state to stages for local processing and optional forwarding of follow-up continuations. A new domain specific language that aims to simplify writing of request scripts is described along with its implementation for the scala actors library. Evaluation results indicate that request handling with actor continuations performs about equally or better compared to using separate <b>stages</b> for <b>request</b> handling logic for scripts of at least 3 sequential steps...|$|R
