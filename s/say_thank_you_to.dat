500|$|The {{illustrated}} book of The Hockey Sweater {{was among}} the children's books included as official Canadian gifts presented to the Prince of Wales and his family during an official visit in 1991, for his then nine-year-old son William. Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, {{as part of a}} personal tradition of honouring others, brought a copy of the story to space when he travelled to the International Space Station in 2009 and later presented the copy to Carrier. Of the story, Thirsk said: [...] "It represents part of Canadian literacy, it represents support of reading and I just wanted to <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Carrier." [...] The story has also been set to music by composer Abigail Richardson-Schulte as part of a piece commissioned by the Toronto Symphony, the Calgary Philharmonic and National Arts Centre Orchestras in 2012.|$|E
500|$|On the {{following}} episode of Raw, Ric Flair made his farewell speech, {{which led to}} Triple H introducing various people from Flair's past, such as the Four Horsemen, Ricky Steamboat, and others, each coming out to give an emotional farewell. Afterward, the entire WWE roster came out to <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Flair (Including Undertaker, who came out after Raw went off the air and hugged Flair and did his kneeling stance). Shawn Michaels, who was clearly upset about retiring Flair, was forgiven by Flair. Despite Flair's forgiveness, his former protégé Batista later started a feud with Michaels, citing Michaels' [...] "selfishness" [...] at WrestleMania for not lying down for Flair. The two had a match booked at Backlash, WWE's next scheduled pay-per-view event, and after a confrontation between Michaels and Chris Jericho, Jericho was later added into the match as a Special Guest Referee. Michaels won with a superkick.|$|E

2500|$|Notwithstanding her oratory, Mendleson {{was convicted}} by a 10–2 {{majority}} of conspiracy to cause explosions. She {{was also found}} guilty of the possession charges, but not guilty of attempting to cause an explosion in Manchester.

Mendleson was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. While being taken down to the cells she called out [...] "I would like to <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the {{two members of the}} jury who had faith in us".

2500|$|Though NBC {{had made}} a {{considerable}} effort to scrub any references to O'Brien's brief tenure as The Tonight Show host following the controversy both on-air and online, with one former blogger for NBC Sports noting a corporate policy banning any mention of O'Brien, it was acknowledged by the network during the buildup to the 2014 transition from Leno to Fallon. A moving image of O'Brien walking onto his Tonight set was displayed (for less than one second) in an on-air promo chronicling the franchise's history, and Fallon referenced the conflict on his first Tonight Show episode, {{when he opened the}} show by joking: “I'm Jimmy Fallon, and I'll be your host—for now.

It was the band's first EP and with a list price of five dollars or under was Trans-Siberian Orchestra's way of <b>saying</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> their fans. Rather than containing the usual TSO story, {{it was more like}} a Harry Chapin album where a short story is contained within the song. For example, [...] "Someday" [...] is about how people have a tendency <b>to</b> put off <b>saying</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> individuals that they owe a great debt to and with the best of intention tell themselves that they will do it someday.

I just want to simply <b>say,</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me."

2500|$|I'd {{break out}} in hives if I had to sing ("Stairway to Heaven") in every show.

He did not even glance up at Blacky. He did not even <b>say</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Blacky for having shown him the way. He looked neither to the right nor to the left, but with eyes fixed eagerly ahead, began to steal forward swiftly.|$|E

"But {{to make an}} end of this comparison, I {{mention that}} Porthos is ever wishful to express {{gratitude}} for my kindness to him, so that looking up from my book I see his mournful eyes fixed upon me with a passionate attachment, and then I know that the well-nigh unbearable sadness which comes {{into the face of}} dogs is because they cannot <b>say</b> <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> their masters. Whereas David takes my kindness as his right. But for this, while I should chide him I cannot do so, for of all the ways David has of making me to love him the most poignant is that he expects it of me as a matter of course. David is all for fun, but none may plumb the depths of Porthos. Nevertheless I am most nearly doing so when I lie down beside him on the floor and he puts an arm about my neck. On my soul, ma'am, a protecting arm. At such times it is as if each of us knew what was the want of the other.|$|E
