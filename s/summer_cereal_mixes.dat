40|$|Following {{deregulation}} in the 1990 's the South African maize producing {{industry has}} been suffering a gradual decline. Current low prices suggest that this trend may continue or worsen. This paper discusses the results from a static general equilibrium model for the South African economy to evaluate the effects on the economy. The analysis covers <b>summer</b> <b>cereals</b> producing agricultural regions, production in other sectors in the economy, commodity markets and the economy at large. Additionally, the effects on factors, households and the government are analysed. The first set of experiments is aimed to evaluate the effects {{of an increase in}} import tariffs on <b>summer</b> <b>cereals.</b> The results indicate that under normal conditions South Africa will experience little effect for even relatively large increases in the tariff rate, which follows from the fact that South Africa does not currently import sizeable quantities of maize. The second set of experiments evaluate the effects of a change in world prices of <b>summer</b> <b>cereals,</b> under the presumption that a reduction in levels of producer support in developed countries may lead to increased world prices. The results indicate that this terms-of-trade improvement does not necessarily lead to benefits to all in the economy. Benefits to <b>summer</b> <b>cereals</b> producers are largely offset by losses in other sectors of the economy, for example producers of livestock, though the overall effect is still positive.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of T- 2 toxin and HT- 2 toxin in cereals and baby food was validated by collaborative study. In short, the method is as follows: A test portion of a sample is extracted {{with a mixture of}} methanol/water (80 / 20, v/v). This raw extract is then diluted, filtered, and applied to an immunoaffinity column. After washing and elution with acetonitrile the eluate is evaporated to dryness. T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins in the dry residue are then derivatised with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamid (MSTFA) / Trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (99 / 1, v/v), injected into a gas chromatograph, and detected and quantified by mass spectrometry. 14 laboratories from 10 different countries were selected to participate in the collaborative study. They received 6 different test materials as blind duplicates. The test materials consisted of a blank <b>cereal</b> <b>mix,</b> two <b>cereal</b> <b>mixes</b> naturally contaminated at different levels, a blank baby food, and two baby foods naturally contaminated at different levels. Furthermore, two blank <b>cereal</b> <b>mixes</b> and two blank baby foods together with specific spiking solutions were provided for recovery determination. The sum of the mass fractions of T- 2 & HT- 2 after spiking were 50 µg/kg in the <b>cereal</b> <b>mix,</b> and 25 µg/kg in the baby food. Reported recoveries in the <b>cereal</b> <b>mix</b> ranged from 87 to 127 % for the sum of T- 2 & HT- 2 with a mean value of 107 %. Reproducibility relative standard deviations (RSDR) for the cereal matrix were 19 % at a natural contamination level of ca. 32 µg/kg, 11 % at ca. 79 µg/kg, and 12 % for the spiked material at 50 µg/kg. For baby food the recovery values ranged from 91 to 127 % with 116 % for the mean value. The RSDR values were 23 % at a natural contamination level of ca. 10 µg/kg, 15 % at ca. 23 µg/kg, and 16 % for the spiked material at 25 µg/kg. The Horwitz ratios (HorRat) ranged from 0. 5 to 1. 1. Since all these performance parameters lie well within the acceptable ranges set forth in European legislation [1] this method is suited for official food control. JRC.

40|$|Methane {{production}} from Welsh ponies fed 2 isoenergetic diets (NE basis) at maintenance was studied in a crossover design with 4 mature geldings (230 ± 10. 5 kg BW, mean ± SE). Treatments included a roughage-only (R) diet (5. 1 kg DM/d) or a roughage plus <b>cereal</b> <b>mix</b> (RC) diet (2. 5 kg DM hay/d plus 1. 1 kg DM cereal mix/d). For both diets, the same grass hay was used (898 g DM/kg and 4. 5 MJ NEm/kg DM) and a commercial <b>cereal</b> <b>mix</b> {{was used in}} the RC diet (890 g DM/kg and 9. 6 MJ NEm/kg DM). Ponies were housed in pairs in climate-controlled respiration chambers. Carbon dioxide production (CO 2), oxygen (O 2) consumption, and CH 4 production were measured over 3 consecutive days. Heat production (HP) rates were calculated from gaseous exchange. Feces were collected quantitatively to determine dietary nutrient digestibility. Dry matter intake differed between diets (P < 0. 0001), but NE intake was equal for both diets (22. 3 ± 0. 07 MJ NEm/d). Organic matter digestibility was lower (P = 0. 006) for the R diet (47. 2 %) than the RC diet (55. 6 %). Methane production was higher (P = 0. 014) on the R diet (29. 8 L·pony– 1 ·d– 1) compared to the RC diet (23. 2 L·pony– 1 ·d– 1). Methane production expressed in liters/kilogram metabolic body weight (BW 0. 75) per day tended (P = 0. 064) to decrease with 21 % for the RC group compared with the R group. Heat production, O 2 consumption, and CO 2 production were not affected by diet. Diurnal patterns of CH 4 production and HP were similar for both diets. Methane production increased slightly (P < 0. 652) after feeding and was numerically lower for the RC diet for all time points throughout the day. For both diets, HP was higher after feeding than before feeding and decreased again within approximately 3 h after feeding.

The yield potential of maize and sorghum is about the same, but that of pearl millet is less (50 - 60 percent) when all three crops are well managed and under conditions of no stress. Africa is a traditional sorghum - millet area but maize has encroached over the last 50 - 70 years and the process is still taking place. The reverse is true in Latin America, particularly Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil where sorghum has encroached into traditional maize growing areas. The Buenos Aires district of Argentina is an example where maize was the dominant crop and it was yielding 1750 kg/hectare.

Such a low average yield is primarily due to a widespread use of low-yielding open-pollinated maize cultivars by farmers in the province. Hybrid-oriented maize breeding research work for the development of indigenous maize hybrids was initiated in the public sector at the Cereal Crops Research Institute (CCRI) Pirsabak Nowshera in the year 2000.

40|$|Abstract. The authors {{overview}} integrated {{pest management}} (IPM) in grain crops in north-eastern Australia, which {{is defined as the}} area north of latitude 32 S. Major grain crops in this region include the coarse grains (winter and <b>summer</b> <b>cereals),</b> oilseeds and pulses. IPM in these systems is complicated by the diversity of crops, pests, market requirements and cropping environments. In general, the pulse crops are at greatest risk, followed by oilseeds and then by cereal grains. Insecticides remain a key grain pest management tool in north-eastern Australia. IPM in grain crops has benefited considerably through the increased adoption of new, more selective insecticides and biopesticides for many caterpillar pests, in particularHelicoverpa spp. and loopers, and the identification of pest–crop scenarioswhere spraying is unnecessary (e. g. for most Creontiades spp. populations in soybeans). This has favoured the conservation of natural enemies in north-eastern Australia grain crops, and has arguably assisted in the management of silverleaf whitefly in soybeans in coastal Queensland. However, control of sucking pests and podborers such asMaruca vitrata remains a major challenge for IPM in summer pulses. Because these crops have very low pest-damage tolerances and thresholds, intervention with disruptive insecticides is frequently required, particularly duringpodfill. The threat posedby silverleafwhiteflydemandsongoingmulti...|$|R
