40|$|The DER-rating {{method has}} been adopted as the {{national}} standard for the rating of road structures. This method is defects-based and involves the rating of defects on the various inspections items of road structures in terms of degree (D), extent (E) and relevancy (R) rating. The DER-rating method has {{been included in the}} Draft TMH 19 Manual for the Visual Assessment of Road Structures. The D, E, and R ratings are used to calculate condition indices for road structures. The method used is a deduct-points approach, similar to what is recommended in the Draft TMH 22 Road Asset Management Systems Manual for calculating different condition and need indices for road pavements. This paper describes the procedure to arrive at a Priority Condition Index (PCI) that identifies those structures with critical defects that should receive urgent attention, using the D, E and R ratings allocated to defects during the visual assessment of the structure. For road structures, defects are identified per inspection <b>sub-item</b> and the worst defect on a <b>sub-item</b> is rated, which then becomes the rating for that inspection <b>sub-item.</b> The <b>sub-item</b> DER ratings are used as input to calculate deduct points for the <b>sub-item.</b> These <b>sub-item</b> deduct points are then used as input to calculate a PCI for the <b>sub-item.</b> The worst <b>sub-item</b> PCI value determines the condition index for an inspection item. Finally, the condition indices of the inspection items are used to calculate the PCI for the whole structure. The PCI value ranges from 0 (worst condition) to 100 (best condition). The structure?s PCI determines what condition category the structure falls in. Five condition categories, namely ?Critical?; ?Poor?, ?Fair?, ?Good?; or ?Very Good?, are used.

Methods: Cross-sectional assessment of 272 older adults (98 MCI, 82 AD, and 92 controls) with a standardized neuropsychological battery and the CAMCOG schedule. Backward logistic regression analysis with diagnosis (MCI and controls) as dependent variable and the <b>sub-items</b> of the CAMCOG as independent variable was carried out to determine the CAMCOG <b>sub-items</b> that predicted the diagnosis of MCI. Results: Lower scores on Language, Memory, Praxis, and Calculation CAMCOG <b>sub-items</b> {{were significantly associated with}} the diagnosis of MCI. A composite score obtained by the sum of these scores significantly discriminated MCI patients from comparison groups. This reduced version of the CAMCOG showed similar diagnostic accuracy than the original schedule for the identification of patients with MCI as compared to controls (AUC = 0. 80 +/- 0. 03 for the reduced CAMCOG; AUC = 0. 79 +/- 0. 03 for the original CAMCOG). Conclusion: This reduced version of the CAMCOG had similar diagnostic properties as the original CAMCOG and was faster and easier to administer, rendering it more suitable for the screening of subtle cognitive deficits in general clinical practice.

The Delphi method via LimeSurveyÂ® was utilized to identify competencies specific to AODA clinical supervision. A panel of six experts in RCT and AODA clinical supervision completed five rounds of data collection beginning with an open-ended question. Consensus and stability of responses were calculated following Rounds 2 - 5 of data collection. Panelist fatigue resulted in data collection being discontinued after Round 5, prior to a consensus or stability of responses being reached. A total of 115 competencies and 51 competency sub-items were administered in Round 5. Results suggested that a consensus was not reached on items as one panelist represented a minority view on many items during multiple rounds of data collection. This panelist discontinued responding during the fifth round of data collection. Rank analysis of items based upon mean response was inconclusive due to limited sample size and response options. <b>Sub-item</b> analysis revealed mixed results regarding original competencies versus sub-items. At times a competency was rated higher, at times a <b>sub-item</b> was rated higher, and in other examples a second <b>sub-item</b> was rated higher.

Aim {{of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility of a rehabilitation program for hypomimia in patients with PD, comparing two different approaches. Thirty-six patients with PD were included: 20 patients received a rehabilitative intervention for hypomimia either with a DVD showing exercises focused on facial muscles (PD-group-A) or with a therapist-guided facial rehabilitation with a proprioceptive/recognition approach (PD-group-B). Sixteen patients (PD-Ctrl group) did not receive any treatment and served as control group. The feasibility of the proposed rehabilitation techniques was the main focus of this evaluation. We also evaluate the efficacy of the treatments by means of the <b>sub-item</b> 19 of the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRS-III) and by a computerized analysis of facial expression (E-Motion), which was assessed prior to (T 0) and after therapy (T 1).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the inter- and intra-rater agreement of the Rehabilitation Activities Profile (RAP). The RAP is an assessment method that covers the domains of communication, mobility, personal care, occupation and relationships. Each domain consists of items which are further divided in <b>sub-items</b> for in-depth analysis. The RAP allows quantification of the severity of disabilities, handicaps and perceived problems of a patient with regard to the items and <b>sub-items.</b> For this purpose ordinal 4 -point Likert scales were constructed. The RAP can be used for goal setting and evaluation of rehabilitation. Because of the broad intended use of the RAP and its construction, a special design for the reliability study was needed. The study was carried out in 5 rehabilitation facilities with the participation of various professions. The items and <b>sub-items</b> of the RAP were divided over these professions according to their expertise. Pairs of interviewers were formed that questioned a patient. For the determination of inter- and intra-rater agreement each pair of interviewers was allowed to question a patient only once. To establish the intra-rater agreement, video recordings were made during the interviews. The median (weighted) kappa value and percentage of agreement about the severity grading of a disability or handicap for all items and <b>sub-items</b> exceeded 0. 84 and 81 %, respectively, with regard to the inter- and intra-rater agreement. For the severity grading of perceived problems these values were 0. 91 and 86 %. The interpretation of kappa was hindered by two paradoxes recently described in the literature. The paradox "high agreement but low kappa" manifested itself in particular. It is concluded that inter- and intra-rater agreement of the RAP can be considered to be good to very goo...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Foreign medical {{graduates}} have {{to overcome}} challenges such as language proficiency and cultural differences. Several studies indicate that foreign medical graduates show deficiencies in professional behaviour. For the assessment of foreign medical graduates' professional behaviour, a more specific and sensitive instrument was needed. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop such an instrument. The starting point was the Amsterdam Attitudes and Communications Scale (AACS). Two research questions were addressed: (a) What adaptations of the AACS are needed in order to assess foreign medical graduates' professional behaviour adequately? (b) Is the developed instrument reliable, valid and feasible? METHODS: Our study consisted of 4 phases: (1) a brief literature search; (2) consulting a panel of experts; (3) establishing the content-validity of the instrument; and (4) establishing the feasibility of the instrument as an assessment tool. RESULTS: From the literature and experts in the field we learned that deficiencies in professional behaviour of foreign medical graduates concern mainly language skills and culture related issues. In the instrument we developed special attention was given to these deficiencies. <b>Sub-items</b> were added to every dimension. These <b>sub-items</b> are behavioural descriptions of the respective dimension and serve as a basis for feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>sub-items</b> should enhance constructive feedback, not only focussing on inappropriate behaviour but also by emphasizing adequate behaviours.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{prevalence}} of sleep problems in a community-based sample of patients with Parkinsonâs disease (PD) in Norway, and their associated factors. Methods 176 consecutive PD outpatients (41 % females) were included in a study of non-motor symptoms, including sleep problems. All participants responded to the Parkinsonâs Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), where an overall score below 82 or a score below 5 on a <b>sub-item</b> indicate possible sleep problem. Factors associated with sleep were also investigated, with special emphasis on severity of PD, fatigue, mental health and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Results The mean age was 68. 5 [*]years (range 35 â 90); the mean Hoehn and Yahr stage was 2. 11 (SD 0. 86), and the mean UPDRS part III was 22. 3 (SD 11. 7). Sleep problems were common among PD patients. While only 17 % of the sample had an overall score below 82 on the PDSS, 70 % of the patients had a score below 5 on one item. There was no significant association between PD severity and any of the sleep items in the PDSS; whereas fatigue, mental health problems, and RLS were associated with PDSS score. Conclusions The current findings call for increased awareness of sleep problems in PD patients, especially focusing on the association with mental health problems, fatigue and RLS. </p...|$|E

The researcher {{has found that the}} characteristics of the drawings are gathered in three key axes which are: 1) the character of the hated 2) creation elements 3) drawing background. The total numbers of the key items are 11 items and 88 <b>sub-items.</b> After achieving the validity by using Cooper equation and reliability by using Scoot equation, the agreement of experts was 90...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} develop a palliative care measurement tool that could track and measure the rendering of care by informal caregivers to dying persons across the diversity of South African cultural and religious groups. This mixed method research {{led to the development}} of an instrument consisting of a one-dimensional domain, eight <b>sub-items</b> and 56 scores against which care can be numerically quantified on a radar graph. It is recommended that this tool be utilised to provide objective indications about the quality of home-based palliative care rendered to terminally ill patient...|$|R
