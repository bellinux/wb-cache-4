5|$|Distrust of Charles's {{religious}} policies {{increased with}} {{his support of}} a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines {{had been one of}} the few <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between the size and structure of social networks and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was examined in a population-based study of 1615 men and women age 65 years and older. Age {{was significantly associated with}} marital status, social network index quartile, and the social relationship to the primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Women and men differed with respect to current marital status, number of close friends and relatives, frequency of face-to-face contact, and participation in voluntary associations and religious institutions. Regardless of their marital status, women were also less likely than men to point to a spouse as their primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Beck Depression Inventory mean scores and rates of depressive symptoms were inversely associated with social network index and participation in voluntary associations and religious institutions for both men and women. Individuals with no primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or who depended on a relative had significantly higher than expected mean scores and rates of depressive symptoms. Both social network index and social distance to primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> were independently associated with depression after controlling for age, sex, and number of chronic conditions. Participation in voluntary associations, social distance from primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> church membership, and number of close friends were also significant independent predictors of depressive symptoms. Results indicate that depressive symptoms are inversely associated with the size of social networks. The structure of these networks, in turn, is influenced by biological factors such as age, physical disability, and mortality of network members, and by culturally-determined rules that define the individuals and institutions available for support. However, these rules appear to differ for men and women. social networks elderly depression sex...|$|R

The plan aimed to defeat the Malayan communists, who were operating out of rural areas as a guerrilla army, primarily by cutting them off from their <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> amongst the population. To this end, a massive program of forced resettlement of Malayan peasantry was undertaken, under which about 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya's population) were eventually removed from the land and interned in guarded camps called [...] "New Villages".|$|E

2500|$|Others in the territory, {{including}} Governor Henry Connolly, {{were not}} satisfied with General Canby's strategy of minimal engagement combined with drawing the Confederates further and further from their <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in southern-most New Mexico and Texas. The governor and others wanted to see more pitched battles with the invaders. The battle at Glorietta would never have taken place had Col. John Slough followed Canby's order to remain inside Fort Union. No doubt, Slough had gone forth {{with the blessing of}} the governor; yet, although the ultimate outcome of the battle favored the Union, Slough resigned his commission before Canby had the opportunity to demand it. (Though another interpretation is that he resigned in protest because Canby ordered him not to pursue the rebels.) Subsequently, Canby nearly engaged the retreating Confederates in a battle near Peralta, New Mexico, but halted preliminary skirmishing when a sandstorm arose. While Canby's decision was probably prudent in view of the bad weather {{and the fact that the}} Confederates were already defeated, many of his critics began to make up stories such as that Canby and Sibley [...] "had an understanding" [...] not to engage each other and that Louisa Canby was either Sibley's sister or Mrs. Sibley's cousin. (Mrs. Sibley was Charlotte Kendall, a New Yorker whose father was from Massachusetts and mother was from New York; there is no evidence that she and Louisa were related.) Many of these stories were seriously entertained by later historians, although Martin Hall and Heyman were among the first to realize that there was no basis for these rumors. In this context, it seems likely that Louisa's kindness toward the Confederate wounded played into the whispering campaign or even provided the germ of the rumor that the Kentucky-born officer's wife was actually the Louisiana general's sister; however, no one seems to have recorded any explicit charges against her, either officially or unofficially. This may have been because Louisa had her defenders (as evidenced by the April 26, 1862, article in the influential Gazette), but, finally, the fact of the Confederates' ultimate retreat from the territory rendered the issue moot.|$|E
60|$|Under the {{influence}} of such feelings, even Cherbury figured to his fancy in somewhat faded colours. There, indeed, he was loved and cherished; there, indeed, no sound was ever heard, no sight ever seen, that could annoy or mortify the high pitch of his unconscious ideal; but still, even at Cherbury, he was a child. Under {{the influence}} of daily intercourse, his tender heart had balanced, perhaps even outweighed, his fiery imagination. That constant yet delicate affection had softened all his soul: he had no time but to be grateful and to love. He returned home only to muse over their sweet society, and contrast their refined and gentle life with the harsh rude hearth that awaited him. Whatever might be his reception at home, he was thrown, back for solace on their memory, not upon his own heart; and he felt the delightful conviction that to-morrow would renew the spell whose enchantment had enabled him to endure the present vexation. But now the magic of that intercourse had ceased; {{after a few days}} of restlessness and repining, he discovered that he must find in his desolation sterner <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> than the memory of Venetia, and the recollections of the domestic joys of Cherbury. It astonishing with what rapidity the character of Cadurcis developed itself in solitude; and strange was the contrast between the gentle child who, a few weeks before, had looked forward with so much interest to accompanying Venetia to a childish festival, and the stern and moody being who paced the solitary cloisters of Cadurcis, and then would withdraw to his lonely chamber and the amusement of a book. He was at this time deeply interested in Purchas's Pilgrimage, one of the few books of which the late lord had not despoiled him. Narratives of travels and voyages always particularly pleased him; he had an idea that he was laying up information which might be useful to him hereafter; the Cherbury collection was rich in this class of volumes, and Lady Annabel encouraged their perusal.|$|E
6000|$|It wasn't {{either that}} John Bancroft tossed {{the ball of}} talk--which but for the {{presence}} of the supremely retentive agent just commemorated would have appeared on occasion to remain in his keeping by a preference, on its own part, not to be outwitted; this more or less at all times too, but especially during the first weeks of his dawning on us straight out of Germany and France, flushed with the alarm, as one might have read it, of having to justify rare opportunities and account for the time he had inordinately, obscurely, or at least not a little mysteriously, spent--the implication of every inch of him being that he had spent it seriously. Odd enough it certainly was that we should have been appointed to unveil, so far as we might, a pair of such marked monuments to modesty, marble statues, as they might have been, {{on either side of the}} portal of talk; what I at any rate preserve of my immediate vision of Bancroft--whose very promptest identity indeed had been his sonship to the eminent historian of our country and earlier and later diplomatist--was an opposition, trying to me rather than engaging as its like had been in the composition of Vanderpool, between what we somehow wanted from him (or what I at least did) and what we too scantly gathered. This excellent friend, as he was later on to become, with his handsome high head, large colourable brow and eyes widely divided--brave contribution ever to a fine countenance--sat there in a sort of glory of experience which, had he been capable of anything so akin to a demonstration, he would have appeared all unsociably to repudiate. It was bruited of him that, like John La Farge, whose friend he was admiringly to become--for he too had a Newport connection--he [...] "painted," [...] that is persisted (which was the wondrous thing!) in painting; and that this practice had grown upon him in France, where, en province, his brother had entirely taken root and where the whole art-life, as well as the rural life, of the country had been opened to him; besides its a little later coming to light that he had romantically practised at Dusseldorf, where too he had personally known and tremendously liked George du Maurier, whose first so distinguished appearances as an illustrator had already engaged our fondest attention--were they most dawningly in the early Cornhill, or in Punch, or in Once a Week? They glimmer upon me, darkly and richly, as from the pages of the last named. Not to be rendered, I may again parenthesise, our little thrilled awareness, William's and mine, though mine indeed but panting after his, of such peeping phenomena of the European day as the outbreak of a [...] "new man" [...] upon our yearning view of the field of letters and of the arts. I am moved to wonder at how we came by it, shifting all for ourselves, and with the parental flair, so far as the sensibility of home was concerned, turned but to directions of its own and much less restless on the whole than ours. More touching to me now than I can say, at all events, this recapture of the hour at which Du Maurier, consecrated to much later, to then still far-off intimate affection, became the new man so significantly as to make a great importance of John Bancroft's news of him, which already bore, among many marvels, upon the supreme wonder of his working, as he was all his life bravely to work, under impaired and gravely menaced eyesight. When I speak, as just above, of what, through so many veils, [...] "came to light," [...] I should further add, I use a figure representing a considerable lapse of time and shading off, for full evocation, into more associations than I can here make place for. Nothing in this connection came soon to light at least but that endless amazement might lie in the strange facts of difference between our companion and his distinguished sire--the latter so supremely, so quaintly yet so brilliantly, social a figure, I apprehended, when gaped at, a still more angular, but more polished and pacific Don Quixote, on the sleekest of Rosinantes, with white-tipped chin protrusive, with high sharp elbows raised and long straight legs beautifully pointed, all after the gallantest fashion, against the clear sunset sky of old Newport cavalcades. Mr. Bancroft the elder, the [...] "great," [...] was a comfort, that is a fine high identity, a cluster of strong accents, the sort of thing one's vision followed, in the light of history, if not of mere misguided fancy, for illustration of conceived type--type, say in this case, of superior person of the ancient and the more or less alien public order, the world of affairs transacted at courts and chancelleries, in which renown, one had gathered from the perusal of memoirs, allowed for much development of detail and much incision of outline, when not even directly resting on them. As it had been a positive bliss to me that words and names might prove in extremity <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> so it comes back to me that I had drawn mystic strength from just obscurely sighing [...] "Metternich!" [...] or [...] "Talleyrand!" [...] as Mr. Bancroft bounced by me--so far as a pair of widely-opened compasses might bounce--in the August gloaming. The value of which, for reflection, moreover, was not in the least in its being that if his son remained so long pleadingly inscrutable any derived Metternich suggestion had contributed to keep him so--for quite there was the curiosity of the case, that among the imputations John appeared most to repudiate was that of having at any moment breathed the air either of records or of protocols. If he persisted in painting for years after his return to America without, as the legend grew, the smallest disclosure of his work or confession of his progress to human eye or ear, he drew the rigour of this course wholly from his singleness of nature, in the aftertime to be so much approved to us. However, I pause before the aftertime, into the lap of which more than one sort of stored soundness and sweetness was to fall from him drop by drop.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Despite {{policies}} {{implemented by}} the NCAA {{with the intention of}} increasing student-athlete academic success and persistence to graduation, student-athlete graduation rates still remain low, with only 65 % of student-athletes receiving their college degree. Certain non- cognitive variables, including the availability <b>of</b> a strong <b>support</b> person, have been shown predict persistence to graduation in higher education for non-traditional students, including student-athletes. As the NCAA requires that academic advising services be offered to all student-athletes at Division I universities, the purpose of this thesis is {{to determine whether or not}} student-athletes in the revenue generating sports of football and men's basketball consider their academic advisor as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> and if so, what are the specific behavioral characteristics of these academic advisors which students find supportive? Additionally, the current study aimed to determine whether or not a difference exists between races with regards to whether or not student-athletes view their academic advisor as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> In order to address the research questions, the researcher developed and distributed a survey to 43 student-athletes on the football and men's basketball teams at a large research university in the Pacific Northwest. Survey results found that 20 % of the participants in the present study viewed their academic advisor as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> while 67 % of participants stated that their academic advisor could potentially play the role <b>of</b> <b>support</b> person to them.

In contrast, African American student-athletes were most likely to believe that their academic advisor could be a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for them. Additionally, certain behavioral characteristics associated with academic advising best practices and immediacy were associated with student-athletes viewing their academic advisor as a support person. These findings have implications for policy and practice, as academic advisors should remain available as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the student-athletes they work with due to their expertise in helping student-athletes navigate their university experience...|$|R
