50|$|In 1982 Sheller-Globe {{acquired}} the automotive business of Detroit-based Olsonite Corporation, a company which made steering wheels and injection-molded plastic parts and components. In 1984, Sheller-Globe acquired Northern Fibre Products Company, manufacturer of insulation and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>materials</b> and products for vehicle interiors.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} on the Apollo included {{in no particular}} order, a 250 cubic-inch 1-barrel L-6, semi-closed cooling system, manual brakes with finned front drums, coil spring front suspension with stabilizer bar, extensive use on insulation and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>materials,</b> flow-through ventilation system, full-foam seats, front and rear ashtrays, strong, reinforced front bumpers, carpeting, deluxe steering wheel, roof drip moldings, and front and rear wheel opening moldings.|$|R
5000|$|Damping: <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> {{is often}} used in the door {{cavities}} and boot/trunk area to damp excess vibration of the panels in the car in response to loud subwoofer bass tones, especially the boot/trunk.|$|E
50|$|The basic RS Edition {{does not}} come with power windows, locks, or mirrors, an audio system, rear wing, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material,</b> map lamps or an {{anti-lock}} braking system. All Evo VIII RS models sold in the US have an air conditioning system.|$|E
50|$|For Passenger models, an XLT Premium {{model was}} offered, adding these {{features}} to the XLT: A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, leather seating surfaces, rear cargo door trim, and enhanced interior <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material.</b> This model appealed {{very much to}} families.|$|E
50|$|Although the Lincoln Navigator {{shares the}} same {{bodyshell}} as the Ford Expedition, {{giving it a}} similar exterior appearance, Lincoln stylists would make many design changes to differentiate the two vehicles. Forward of the windshield, the Lincoln Navigator shares no body panels with its Ford counterpart, with its own front fascia (a grille design shared with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car and the 2000 Lincoln LS), wheels, roof rack, lower body trim, and taillights. The interior of the two vehicles shared more commonality, with the dashboard common to both vehicles (with greater use of wood trim); the Navigator was given its own seat design. To make for a quieter interior over the Expedition and Ford F-Series, the Navigator made greater use of <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>materials</b> and higher-quality carpeting.|$|R
50|$|Teletype also {{introduced}} {{a more expensive}} ASCII Model 35 for heavy duty use, whose printer mechanism {{was based on the}} older, rugged Model 28. The basic Model 35 was mounted in a light gray console that matched the width of the Model 33, while the Model 35 ASR with eight-level mechanical tape punch and reader was installed in a console about twice as wide. The tape reader was mounted separately from the printer-punch mechanism {{on the left side of}} the console and behind it was a tray for storing a manual, sheets of paper, or other miscellanea. To the right of the keyboard was a panel that could optionally house a rotary dial or Touch-Tone pushbuttons for dialing a connection to a network via telephone lines. The printer cover in later units also featured <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>materials,</b> making the Model 35 somewhat quieter than the Model 33 while printing and punching paper tapes. All versions of the Model 35 had a copy holder on the printer cover, making it more convenient for the operator when transcribing written material.|$|R
50|$|Specific {{methods for}} {{improving}} NVH {{include the use}} of tuned mass dampers, subframes, balancing, modifying the stiffness or mass of structures, retuning exhausts and intakes, modifying the characteristics of elastomeric isolators, adding <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> or absorbing <b>materials,</b> or using active noise control. In some circumstances, substantial changes in vehicle architecture may {{be the only way to}} cure some problems cost effectively.|$|R
50|$|All 2.0-litre models had {{the option}} of {{automatic}} transmission, and with the 2.3-litre V6, it was the only transmission offered. The 2.3 also received power steering and additional <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material.</b> A five-speed box was not available. A unique option, offered under guarantee by a dealership, South Auckland Ford, was a turbocharger.|$|E
5000|$|The stages were purpose-designed, sound-proof {{structures}} {{with heavy}} <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> {{on the walls}} and ceiling, overhead catwalks, sound locks for entry and even pneumatically-sealed large access doors at the rear. Tremaine had installed large wiring troughs of shielded audio cable, running from the stages to the machine room, presumably to allow recording and playback. The building was wired with [...] "wig-wags", bells and flashing lights to warm of active filming.|$|E
50|$|For the 2015 {{model year}} Pajero has {{received}} an updated front fascia with a revised grille, LED {{daytime running lights}} and a new spare tire cover. The interior design of the model is also slightly updated and it includes the metallic trim, the new piano black accents for the VR II, the wood grain trim for the Exceed and Super Exceed and the additional <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material.</b> The engines will be carried over and they will include the 3.0-liter 6G72 V6, the 3.5-liter 6G74 V6, the 3.8-liter 6G75 V6, the 2.8-liter four-cylinder turbo diesel 4M40, and the 3.2-liter 4M41 common rail four-cylinder turbo diesel.|$|E
50|$|A stripped-out {{interior}} {{devoid of}} power windows or seats, rear seats, air conditioning, cruise control, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> or a stereo system (optionally fitted) and new racing-bucket front seats {{were part of}} the package. The trunk hood was made of aluminum, the chassis was seam welded and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> was deleted. Wheels were made of magnesium and the glass was thinner in the doors and rear window. The Carrera RS is approximately 345 pounds (155 kg) lighter than the US version Carrera 2 model. Also available were a heavier Touring variant (with <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> power seats (optional), undercarriage protection and power windows) and an N/GT racing variant with a stripped, blank metal interior and a roll cage. They also came with optional lights on the visors.|$|R
5000|$|Vibration damping: {{applicable}} {{for large}} vibrating surfaces. The damping mechanism works by extracting the vibration {{energy from the}} thin sheet and dissipating it as heat. A common <b>material</b> is <b>sound</b> <b>deadened</b> steel.|$|R
25|$|The Mk2 also {{received}} numerous updates {{including a new}} revised A/C HVAC system, six airbags standard across the range to enhance safety and improved <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> to all models to give a more refined, quiet ride.|$|R
5000|$|Mach 1s {{came with}} {{upgraded}} suspension {{to varying degrees}} dependent upon powertrain choices. Big block cars had front shock tower reinforcement, thicker sway bars (no rear bar for 69), and heavier springs and shocks. 428 CJ/SCJ 4 speed cars also came with staggered rear shocks. Standard on Mach 1s was a fierce but cosmetic hood scoop that had integrated turn-signal lights mounted in the back. A more functional option was the signature [...] "Shaker hood", an air scoop mounted directly {{to the top of}} the motor, used to collect fresh air and so named for its tendency to [...] "shake" [...] above the rumbling V-8 below. The interior came complete with teak wood grain details, full <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> and high-back sport bucket seats.|$|E
50|$|The S-Zero {{is a more}} circuit-oriented {{version of}} the {{standard}} Type S. The suspension is even stiffer by using the NA1 Type R (1992 to 1995) suspension but retaining the Type S's larger rear sway bar. Unlike the standard Type S, the S-Zero did not offer cruise control, stereo, power door locks, airbags, air conditioning, traction control, power steering, fog lights or a navigation system. Honda {{came up with a}} new lightweight lead-acid battery and halved the thickness of the partition glass between engine bay and cabin to reduce even more weight. Changes were also made to the interior's manual transmission boot shifter, replacing the original material from leather to mesh. Much of the <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> was also removed to reduce weight. Making the S-Zero 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the Type S.|$|E
50|$|The new {{platform}} {{is based on}} the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500. Both SUVs feature <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> to improve cabin quietness. A new Cadillac Escalade and Cadillac Escalade ESV arrived in dealerships in April 2014. Models continued for the Tahoe and Suburban as LS, LT, and LTZ, and the Yukon and Yukon XL as SLE, SLT, and Denali. The Tahoe and Yukon went on sale in February 2014 as an early 2015 model year vehicle. Prices for the all-new GM SUVs are expected to stay the same as the current-generation GMT900 SUVs. The Tahoe Hybrid, Yukon Hybrid, and Yukon Denali Hybrid models will be dropped along with their powertrains, as well as the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid and Cadillac Escalade Hybrid Platinum. The Yukon Denali AWD is also being dropped as well. And despite reports that it is under consideration at this point, GM is mulling plans to bring the SS and RS package back for the Tahoe.|$|E
5000|$|Sound reflections: by {{limiting}} the reflection using many methods, e.g. by using acoustic absorption (<b>deadening)</b> <b>materials,</b> trapping the <b>sound,</b> opening a [...] "window" [...] to let sound out, etc.|$|R
50|$|Carpet and {{headlining}} were downgraded {{to basic}} specification {{and even the}} documentation wallet was changed from faux leather to cloth. <b>Sound</b> <b>deadening</b> {{was removed from the}} 182 Cup, the horn was downgraded from a twin to single unit and the interior light no longer included a map reading function.|$|R
5000|$|A new [...] "luxury" [...] model became {{available}} starting for 1969, available in only the hardtop body style. The 'Grande' featured a soft ride, 55 lb of extra <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> {{as well as}} deluxe interior with simulated wood trim. It was popular with buyers with 22182 units sold through 1969.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{no longer}} than its predecessor, the Mark III was a heavier car, {{reflecting}} a trend towards improving secondary safety by making car bodies more substantial. Weight was also increased by the stout cross-member incorporated into the new simplified front suspension set-up, and by the inclusion of far more <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> which insulated the cabin from engine and exhaust noise, making the car usefully quieter than its predecessor, though on many cars the benefit was diminished by high levels of wind noise apparently resulting from poor door fit around the windows. [...] Four-speed manual transmissions were by now almost universally offered in the UK for this class of car, and contemporary road tests commented on the rather large gap between second and third gear, and the resulting temptation to slip the clutch when accelerating through the gears in the smaller-engined cars: [...] it was presumably in tacit acknowledgment of the car's marginal power-to-weight ratio that Ford no longer offered the automatic transmission option with the smallest 1,298 cc-engined Cortina.|$|E
5000|$|From 1993 through 1995, Porsche {{offered a}} lighter-weight [...] "Club Sport" [...] {{version of the}} 968 {{designed}} for enthusiasts seeking increased track performance. Much of the 968's luxury-oriented equipment was removed or taken off the options list; less <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material</b> was used, electrical windows were replaced with crank-driven units, upgraded stereo systems, A/C and sunroof were still optional as on the standard Coupe and Convertible models. In addition, Porsche installed manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats rather than the standard power-operated leather buckets (also manufactured by Recaro), a revised suspension system optimized and lowered by 20 mm for possible track use, 17-inch wheels (also slightly wider to accommodate wider tires) rather than the 16-inch as found on the Coupe and wider tires, 225 front and 255 rears rather than 205 and 225 respectively. The four-spoke airbag steering wheel was replaced with a thicker-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel with no airbag, heated washer jets were replaced with non heated, vanity covers in the engine bay were deleted, as was the rear wiper. The Club Sport has no rear seats, unlike the 2+2 Coupé.|$|E
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> <b>material,</b> carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|E
50|$|Lancia {{claimed the}} car could reach {{top speed of}} 225 km/h and {{accelerate}} from standstill to 100 km/h in six seconds.In contrast to its bare bones racing sisters, the S4 Stradale featured an Alcantara-upholstered interior, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> a suede steering wheel, and was equipped with power steering, trip computer and air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|With the T6 now {{hitting the}} roads {{it is very}} clear it {{would appear to be}} just a facelift. New front, new {{tailgate}} and a new dash. There are quality improvements, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> new colours and improved consumption, but many believe VW have missed an opportunity {{to go back to the}} top.|$|R
50|$|Perforations {{are usually}} used to allow easy {{separation}} of two {{sections of the}} material, such as allowing paper to be torn easily along the line. Packaging with perforations in paperboard or plastic film is easy for consumers to open. Other purposes include filtrating fluids, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> allowing light or fluids to pass through, and to create an aesthetic design.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{versions}} were produced. The initial 2,500 {{units were}} [...] "homologation specials" [...] {{used to get}} the FIA accreditation for entry into the World Rally Championship. They were fitted with a Garrett T3/T04B turbocharger. Among these initial units, a handful were badged as Motorsport versions, these lacked certain refinements such as a sunroof and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening.</b>|$|R
50|$|LATICRETE International is a family-owned, global {{manufacturer}} of construction supplies. With headquarters in Bethany, Connecticut, LATICRETE manufactures on six different continents, {{specializing in the}} development of latex-fortified Portland cement-based mortars, adhesives and grouts for the installation of ceramic and porcelain tile, glass mosaics, and stone. The LATICRETE product line also includes waterproofing, anti-fracture, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> membranes, floor warming, surface preparation, and concrete construction chemicals.|$|R
5000|$|Sound {{isolation}}: Noise {{isolation is}} isolating noise {{to prevent it}} from transferring out of one area, using barriers like <b>deadening</b> <b>materials</b> to trap <b>sound</b> and vibrational energy. Example: In home and office construction, many builders place sound-control barriers (such as fiberglass batting) in walls to deaden the transmission of noise through them.|$|R
2500|$|GM {{introduced}} a facelifted sedan at Auto Shanghai 2005, designed {{in cooperation with}} PATAC. Bearing the internal code T250 and sold in South Korea as the [...] "Daewoo Gentra", revisions included exterior styling changes, a new interior instrument panel and minor equipment changes, including increased <b>sound</b> <b>deadening.</b> Incorporation of the radio antenna into the rear glass and extensive wind tunnel testing helped reduce the coefficient of drag from 0.348 to 0.326.|$|R
50|$|CMPP Studios has 11 sound stages {{ranging from}} 5,500 sq. ft.to 26,000 sq. ft., {{including}} a mega-stage, a perfectly square stage, and smaller insert studios. The stages offer state-of-the-art <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> laser-smooth floors, clear-spans to 40’ heights, and trusses designed for heavy loads. The complex {{has its own}} custom-built power stations to meet the heavy power demands of the film industry. In addition, there are custom-built, computer-controlled air exchange systems.|$|R
