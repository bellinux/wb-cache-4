5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E

For {{the month of}} July the English ships formed a picket line spaced about six miles apart along a north/south axis. From the {{southern}} flank near Flores Island, the order of ships was Dainty, Golden Dragon, Roebuck, Tiger, Sampson, Prudence and Foresight. The Spanish fleet, which had been sighted briefly, <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> longer a threat; Alvaro de Bazan had made a major miscalculation: he disobeyed orders and headed further west, allowing the English to first reach the area of interception.|$|E

500|$|Judaism {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for [...] "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying [...] "to sanctify God's Name" [...] (see Martyrdom). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded by some as examples of heroic martyrdom, while others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.|$|E
500|$|She was {{the first}} child of Queen Victoria to die, with her mother outliving her by more than 20 years. Victoria noted the {{coincidence}} of the dates of Albert's and Alice's deaths as [...] "almost incredible and most mysterious". Writing in her journal {{on the day of}} Alice's death, Queen Victoria referred to the recent sufferings of the family: [...] "This terrible day come round again!" [...] Shocked by grief, she wrote to her daughter Princess Victoria: [...] "My precious child, who stood by me and upheld me seventeen years ago on the same day taken, and by such an awful and fearful disease...She had darling Papa's nature, and much of his self-sacrificing character and fearless and entire devotion to duty!" [...] The animosity that Victoria had towards Alice <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> longer present. Princess Victoria expressed her grief to her mother in a 39-page letter, and deeply mourned Alice, the sister to whom she was closest. However, both {{she and her husband were}} forbidden from attending the funeral by the Emperor of Germany, who was worried about their safety.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} part of Girard's career, there <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> place for {{beneficial}} imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that [...] "imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take [...] his place [...] This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems." [...] Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a 'scapegoat' himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis. [...] Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.|$|E
2500|$|The London and Birmingham Railway, {{now part}} of the [...] "West Coast Main Line", was officially opened from [...] as far as [...] (approximately one mile north of Bletchley station) on 9 April 1838, where a {{temporary}} station was built. The line was fully opened in September 1838, and there <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> apparent need for a station in the Bletchley area at all. It was not until 1846 that Bletchley station was built following the opening of the line from Bedford. Originally a major intercity station, that role passed to Milton Keynes Central in 1982 when the latter was built, long after the east–west route had been downgraded, taking Bletchley's importance as a junction with it. Today, no Virgin Trains stop at Bletchley.|$|E

Dr Franjo Rački (a founder member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) and Dr Iso Kršnjav (head of the Department of Culture (...) [...] ) invited him to Zagreb to join the group of artists around Vlaho Bukovac, a Dubrovnik artist who had recently left Paris and settled in Zagreb. So in 1895 Medović left the Franciscan order {{and set up a}} studio in Zagreb. During his stay there (1895–1907) he painted many religious works in northern Croatian churches (Križevci, Požega, Nova Gradiška) and historical compositions based on Croatian history, most notably those in the Golden Hall (...) of the Institute of History in Zagreb. Medović also painted a series of portraits of Zagreb people using fragmented lines, soft contours and vibrant colours.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1863, Stephens {{informed}} {{his colleagues}} {{he wished to}} start a newspaper, with financial aid from O’Mahony and the Fenian Brotherhood in America. The offices were established at 12 Parliament Street, almost {{at the gates of}} Dublin Castle. The first number of the Irish People appeared on 28 November 1863. The staff [...] of the paper along with Kickham were Luby and Denis Dowling Mulcahy as the editorial staff. O’Donovan Rossa and James O’Connor had charge of the business office, with John Haltigan being the printer. John O'Leary was brought from London to take charge in the role of Editor. Shortly after the establishment of the paper, Stephens departed on an America tour, and to attend to organizational matters. Before leaving, he entrusted to Luby a document containing secret resolutions on the Committee of Organization or Executive of the IRB. Though Luby intimated its existence to O’Leary, he did not inform Kickham as there <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> necessity. This document would later form the basis of the prosecution against the staff of the Irish People. The document read: ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in Barclays World of Cricket (1986), former England captain Tony Lewis commented upon Botham's strength, {{enthusiasm and}} {{aggression}} [...] "which he took into every game". Lewis, however, {{pointed out that}} Botham's exuberance often reduced the efficiency of his play, in {{that he would take}} too many risks or refuse to give up on a bowling tactic despite ongoing heavy cost. He summarised Botham as an exciting cricketer who lacked self-discipline. Botham {{was in the middle of}} his career when the book was published but Lewis emphasised the speed at which Botham had achieved certain milestones such as 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. At that time, there <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> reason why Botham should not go on reaching milestones but he had already peaked and, in retrospect, his career had a meteoric aspect. His rival Imran Khan asserted this when he said: [...] "Botham was someone who I don't think ever did justice to his talent. When he started he could have done anything, but he declined very quickly. In a way our careers were the opposite of each other. I started quite slowly but got better, maximised my talent. He went the other way, I think".|$|E

2500|$|Both {{money and}} land, then, being provided, there <b>seemed</b> <b>no</b> {{reason why the}} work should not begin at once. Owing to various delays however, caused by {{disputes}} over the will, the sale of [...] Piddington, {{the transfer of the}} site, and for various other reasons, an actual start was not made until 1656, so that eight years elapsed after the Principal's death before the preliminaries were all finally settled and operations could commence. The interval was employed in collecting timber and other material; when once begun, work went steadily forward without intermission until the Chapel was close to complete. Preparations began soon after Principal Radcliffe's death, in 1651, when the selection and felling of timber in Mynchery Wood, the property of the College, was undertaken. The Bursar saw to this himself, and records his expenses: [...] "given [...] day when I went to viewe [...] tymber to [...] 2 woodmen for their care 4s. and to [...] 6 workmen to drink 3s." [...] Further items are given for felling and carting, and for sawing up at the College. By 9 July 1651 the last load of timber was drawn in, and all the carters received a [...] "dinar and beverage bringing home [...] last timber from [...] woods to [...] college". Workmen's compensation is not forgotten: [...] "to [...] poore man [...] had his leg broken in plucking down a tree 5s." [...] In addition to all this, £84 was paid to Sir George Stonehouse for timber bought outright from him.|$|E
