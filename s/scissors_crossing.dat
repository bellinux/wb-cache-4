Largely unknown, this large collection of collages reveal an artist finding caricature, both humorous and serious, in a vase of flowers (Still Life); animals (Elephant and The Hunt); loneliness (Brooding Young Girl); and dozens of other motifs.

40|$|We give {{a simple}} set of two tiles {{that can only}} tile aperiodically | that is no tiling with these tiles is {{invariant}} under any in nite cyclic group of isometries. Although general constructions for producing aperiodic sets of tiles are nally appearing, simple aperiodic sets are fairly rare. This set is among the smallest sets ever found. A tiling is non-periodic {{if there is no}} in nite cyclic group of isometries leaving the tiling invariant. In E 2, this is equivalent to requiring that no translation leaves the tiling invariant. A set of tiles is aperiodic if it is possible to completely tile the plane with comgruent copies of the tiles, but only non-periodically. For example, a pair of unit squares, one black and one white, is not an aperiodic set of tiles: it is possible to tile non-periodically with black and white squares but they can tile periodically as well. Here we give a new, simple example of a set of aperiodic tiles, the T (trilobite) and C (cross) (gure 1); in any tiling with these tiles, we will require that the &quot; of the tiles meet as pictured at right. (A local condition such as this is a rule&quot;). Two variations of the tiles are given {{at the end of this}} paper. These tiles are among the simplest ever found, and are related to a a family of aperiodic sets of 2 tiles in each E n, n 3 [10].

50|$|When two {{crossovers}} {{are present}} in opposite directions, one after the other, the four-switch configuration is called a double crossover. If the crossovers in different directions overlap to form an ×, it is dubbed a scissors crossover, <b>scissors</b> <b>crossing,</b> or just scissors; or, due to the diamond in the center, a diamond crossover. This makes for a very compact track layout {{at the expense of}} using a level junction.|$|E
50|$|To the southwest, an X-shaped {{crossing}} (<b>scissors</b> <b>crossing)</b> links both tracks {{before the}} two tracks separate, the westbound track leading to Plärrer's -2 Level and the eastbound track leading to Plärrer's -3 level. Consequently, the signals at the southwest platform end can show the aspect Hp2 (Proceed at 40 km/h) in addition to Hp0, Hp1 and Hp5 which is used when a train crosses from one track to the other via the X-shaped crossing.|$|E
50|$|Shelter Valley is an unincorporated {{community}} {{located in}} San Diego County in the U.S. state of California. The town is located along County Route S2, two {{miles south of}} its intersection with State Route 78 and 12 miles east of Julian, CA. (Known as <b>Scissors</b> <b>Crossing.)</b> It lies {{within the boundaries of}} the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and the geologic feature known as Earthquake Valley. The Pacific Crest Trail passes along the northern boundary of the community.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, the Cheltenham Loop, {{now known}} as 'the Gloucester {{avoiding}} line', was re-instated, primarily for goods traffic, but also for passengers from 1908. Between 1914 and 1920, the GWR station was expanded with a second long platform north of the running lines, two centre tracks for through movements and bay platforms. The two main platforms were also split in two with a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossing</b> in the middle. In 1951, the Western station was renamed Gloucester Central and the Midland station renamed Gloucester Eastgate to avoid confusion.|$|E
5000|$|Operation of the {{junction}} and {{the immediate vicinity}} through new multiple aspect colour light signalling, four aspect on the Midland [...] "fast" [...] lines and three aspect on the Midland [...] "slow" [...] and G.C. lines, was installed controlled from a new power-operated signal box set just {{to the north of}} the <b>scissors</b> <b>crossing.</b> The signal box closed in the late 1970s when the new Sheffield power box took over responsibilities for the area, however the building remained, firstly as an emergency facility due to its strategic location, and later as a staff building.|$|E
50|$|S2 from <b>Scissors</b> <b>Crossing</b> southward closely {{follows the}} Southern Emigrant Trail or Great Southern Overland Route, until about 3 mi beyond Agua Caliente Springs Road where Vallecito Creek turns {{away to the}} east. This was also {{the route of the}} San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line, Butterfield Overland Mail and later stage lines that ran from Southern California to Fort Yuma and on into what later became the states of Arizona and New Mexico. Nearby to the {{northwest}} of the crossing is the site of San Felipe Station, a division station for the desert section of the Butterfield Overland Mail to the east.|$|E
50|$|The highway {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with State Route 98 inOcotillo, California, and runs north through an interchange withInterstate 8. This part is also called Imperial Highway. The highway crosses into San Diego County and its name changes to Sweeney Pass Road. Farther north, {{the name of}} the highway changes to the Great Southern Overland Stage Route of 1849 at a remote junction. The highway then crosses State Route 78 at <b>Scissors</b> <b>Crossing</b> in a desert community now called Shelter Valley (formerly called Earthquake Valley), and its name changes to San Felipe Road. The highway ends at a junction with State Route 79 near the community of Warner Springs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are still}} major roadblocks while electrifying the track beyond Bhigwan. The focus is to first double the lines {{all the way}} till Mohol and also after Solapur towards Gulbarga. Electrification would follow that. One of the biggest {{challenges}} is to eliminate the <b>scissors</b> <b>crossing</b> at Pophlaj, Bablad and Hunsihadgil which have been weirdly built on elevated mud embankments - a result of bad planning. These scissors crossings tend to waste a lot of time for trains as they first enter a loop and then reverse {{to the far end of}} the loop and once the main line train crosses they are allowed to enter the main line - a sheer wastage of time. Doubling and electrification should eliminate all these technical issues.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this point}} the double track former Great Central Railway line from Sheffield Victoria to Mexborough (where it joined the South Yorkshire line to Doncaster) came within 50 yards of the four-track former North Midland Railway line from Leeds to Derby. The {{original}} junction was a double track cross-over (<b>scissors</b> <b>crossing)</b> taking traffic {{to and from the}} GC lines to the two [...] "slow" [...] lines of the North Midland in the direction of Leeds and to and from the [...] "slow" [...] lines of the North Midland to the GC, in the direction of Mexborough. Further cross-overs were installed to make possible a move from the [...] "slow" [...] to the [...] "fast" [...] lines (and vice versa) on the North Midland {{at each end of the}} junction.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{the station}} {{building}} at St. John's {{is still in}} place but now a private dwelling, similarly {{at the other end}} of the line the station is extant, but now forms part of a youth club for local children. The stanchions of the former viaduct also remain in place and there are still some rails visible in the road at the outer terminus. It is little known that the famous <b>Scissors</b> <b>crossing</b> behind the station is actually still in situ to this day, although unknown to most people as it was buried underneath a bank of hardcore from the mines(there are actually images which shows this happening). This possibly means that Foxdale has the distinction of being the station on the IoM's closed network which still has most of the original station trackwork surviving! ...|$|E
50|$|Earthquake Valley, {{then called}} the Valle de San Felipe, became {{the route of the}} Sonora Road into the coastal region of Southern California. The Sonora Road {{discovered}} by Mexican soldiers reestablished land communications between Alta California and Sonora, Mexico in the late 1820s. The valley was later the site of the Rancho Valle de San Felipe. From the time of the Mexican American War and the California Gold Rush the Sonora Road became the route of the Southern Immigrant Trail that passed through the valley from Blair Valley to Teofulio Summit, (formerly Warner Pass). This trail remained the major southern route into California from the eastern United States until the advent of the railroad at Yuma, Arizona in 1877 reduced its importance. From 1858 the important San Felipe Station of the Butterfield Overland Mail was located about a quarter mile north of <b>Scissors</b> <b>Crossing.</b> Stage lines continued to use the route until the railroad came to Yuma.|$|E
5000|$|An unusual arrangement, {{unique in}} Britain, was {{constructed}} at Grantham. Its location was [...] {{and it is}} shown on the 1963 edition of OS 1 inch to 1 mile sheet 113. It {{was built in the}} 1950s after the turntable at the locomotive shed failed and expenditure on a replacement was no longer justified. Locomotives requiring to be turned had to travel to Barkston Junction to traverse the triangular layout there (this was where Mallard with a dynamometer car attached was turned before starting out south on its record-breaking run on 3 July 1938). The journey to Barkston Junction and back was a time consuming business involving a round trip of some 8 mi along the busy East Coast Main Line. Eventually authority was given to construct a turning arrangement on a strip of spare land {{to the west of the}} main line, just south of Grantham station. There was insufficient space for a conventional triangle but this was overcome by constructing an 'inside-out' triangle whereby the approach tracks intersected in a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Anza Borrego Desert State Park {{acquired}} property {{to the north}} of the community in 1998, making Shelter Valley the second community (the first being nearby Borrego Springs) to be entirely landlocked by the park. The Sentenac Canyon and Cienega to the east of <b>Scissors</b> <b>crossing</b> were acquired in 1998. The state purchased parts of Rancho San Felipe to the west of Shelter Valley in 2004 that became part of the San Felipe Valley Wild Life Area and increased the contiguous extent of public lands surrounding the hamlet. In less than one year (2011 and 2012), multiple wildfires threatened the small community. The Banner Fire exited state park lands and entered the edge of the community, while the Vallecito Lightning Complex burned into the San Felipe Valley (connecting valley {{to the north of}} Earthquake Valley) after menacing the nearby town of Ranchita. All were successfully contained by CAL FIRE and the Shelter Valley Volunteer Fire Dept through the San Diego County Fire Authority and no structures were lost. Improvements to the Shelter Valley fire station were completed in 2012 to provide better quarters for the volunteers that provide protection for the surrounding region.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 27 June 1928, LNER B16 Class No. 2369, which formed part of the 9.30 pm up parcels train for York arrived at 10.45 pm - 11 minutes late. A short while after the station foreman {{instructed}} the signalman to allow the parcels train to move forward, beyond the <b>scissors</b> <b>crossing</b> {{at the south end}} of the platform. The engine moved forward to the south end of Platform 1 and waited. The shunter was then given instructions to take charge of the necessary shunting movements. During this time a train left No. 2 Bay line. The shunter passed instructions face-to-face with the driver whilst they waited for a fish train to pass. Once his signal was clear the shunter signalled the driver to start the movement. The shunter at this point riding on the last of the three carriage trucks, at this point the train had to move far enough forward to clear No. 53 points. Once these points were clear the signalman reversed the points and signalled to the shunter to begin the propelling movement. These movements were completed at approximately 11.02 pm. Whilst here, the shunter coupled up the necessary vehicles and connected the brakes. At 11.04pm the signalman in the Platform East signal box offered the parcels train to the signalman in the South Junction Signal Box. The train was accepted [...] "under caution". Up to this point all movements had been completed correctly and no errors had been made.|$|E
