40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the dynamic analysis of shell structures, {{with emphasis on}} application to steel and steel-concrete composite blast <b>resistant</b> <b>doors.</b> In view of the short duration and impulsive nature of the blast loading, an explicit integration method is adopted. This approach avoids time-consuming computations of structural stiffness matrix and solving of simultaneous nonlinear equations. Single-point quadrature shell elements are used, with numerical control to suppress spurious hourglass modes. Composite shells are handled by an appropriate integration rule across the thickness. Both material and geometric nonlinearities are accounted for in the formulation. Contact and gap problems are considered using bilinear spring elements in the finite element analysis. Numerical examples are presented for some benchmark problems and application study to blast <b>resistant</b> <b>doors.</b> Good correlation is generally obtained between the numerical results based on the software developed and the results obtained by other means including field blast tests...|$|R

The analysis was done using dynamic finite element method (fem) for time of the blast duration, and the maximum/minimum internal forces and displacement {{were taken from the}} time history output, in order to know the behavior under blast load and estimate the safety margin of the door. Results obtained from this research indicated that the maximum z-displacement is 1. 709 mm, while in the term of serviceability, the permitted is 25 mm. The maximum reaction force is 73, 960 N, while the maximum anchor capacity is 82, 069 N. On blast condition, the maximum frame stress is 71. 71 MPa, the maximum hinge shear stress is 45. 28 MPa.

Through the use of UV <b>resistant,</b> <b>sound</b> <b>resistant,</b> electric resistant acrylic the enclosure provides a simple means of guaranteeing better data acquisition without the requirement of complex protective mechanisms. The acrylic material used for the design resists UV wavelengths up to 500 nm. The design is also dependant on its adaptability and the ease of manufacturing and use. By machining 14 acrylic sheets and applying magnetic strips to the edges, as well as cutting 12 steel beams, 7 different enclosure sizes can be assemble. There is one smaller box that is 6 inches in height, 4 that are 12 inches in height and {{a wide variety of}} widths and lengths, and two that are 18 inches in height. Because of the design they can also be changed to a new size any point. The enclosure improves the performance of testing on the nanometer level because small influences on the experiment can greatly affect the data collected.

40|$|Blast-loaded {{structures}} are presently assessed and designed following a deterministic approach, where only {{a set of}} structural analyses under worst-case design scenarios are carried out in order to verify each limit state. As a rational alternative, a conditional probabilistic approach is introduced to offer comprehensive risk assessment and to allow the design with user-defined confidence in meeting performance targets in view of uncertainties. To simplify the probabilistic consideration of the uncertain parameters, {{the determination of the}} blast hazard and the structural response are decoupled into the evaluation of blast hazard curves and structural fragilities curves, respectively, by introducing a single conditioning intensity measure. This is chosen to be the impulse density, shown to be sufficient for impulsegoverned scenarios, achieving a reduction of the computational effort by several orders of magnitude without introducing bias. Furthermore a problem-specific safety factor formulation is introduced to incorporate the influence of uncertainties in a simple manner, akin to current engineering practice. As a proof-of-concept test, a steel built-up blast <b>resistant</b> <b>door</b> is subjected to an accidental detonation of mortar rounds in a military facility. The equivalent single degree of freedom model is adopted in order to conduct the structural analyses, while detailed finite element analyses are carried out for validation. Finally, the conditional approach risk analysis on the steel door is compared against the results obtained through the comprehensive (probabilistic) unconditional approach, showing the validity of both the proposed intensity measure and safety factor formulation...|$|R
5000|$|The model cottage was {{designed}} by Henry Roberts, who was honorary architect to the SICLC, and, like the Prince Consort, was interested in upgrading housing for the working class. The cottage demonstrated at the Great Exhibition was possibly conceived {{as a model for}} larger blocks of flats (designs for a three-storey version were prepared). It {{was designed}} to house four families, with two flats, or apartments, on each level. Roberts indicated that the design was aimed at “the class of mechanical and manufacturing operatives who usually reside in towns or in their immediate vicinity”. Each flat had a living room, with a built-in cupboard heated by the fireplace that was also [...] "well contrived equally to cook the family meals at midday and to warm the feet of the family group at eve", a kitchen/scullery, three bedrooms and a toilet.

50|$|This type of “shooting gallery” was dug {{to end in}} {{a spiral}} shape.

40|$|A {{failure of}} the {{security}} system of a community leads to a socio-economic instability and consequently to {{the decline of the}} community. Nowadays like in the past, a protective design against man-made attacks is important, especially considering that the Free World is constantly prone to destabilization by terrorism. A protective construction should principally guarantee the maximum reasonable survivability of the occupants. If the prevention strategies of defense fail (e. g. intelligence and police activities), the design for blast offers the only possibility to limit the consequences of an explosion. The resistance of a generic structure subjected to a blast load is measured in terms of collapse resistance, defined as the exceeding of a performance limit. The collapse resistance can be assessed directly by applying the blast demand to the structure (un-decomposed approach) or by decomposing the collapse resistance (decomposed approach) in three components: the hazard mitigation, the local resistance, and the global resistance. In this Thesis the decomposed approach is preferred and methods for a quantitative assessment of the collapse resistance’s components are proposed and applied to case-study structures. Concerning the hazard mitigation, deterministic computational fluid dynamic simulations are carried out for assessing the influence of three crucial parameters determining the severity of the blast load due to the deflagration of a gas cloud. The fragility analysis is carried out in the framework of the performance-based blast engineering, in order to quantify the local resistance of both precast concrete cladding wall panels and steel built-up blast <b>resistant</b> <b>doors.</b> Furthermore detailed finite element simulations are carried out for investigating the behavior of concrete slabs and insulated panels subjected to far-field and close-in detonations respectively. Finally, the global resistance is investigated by two methods that take into account the consequences of extreme loads on structures, focusing on the influence that the loss of primary elements has on the structural load bearing capacity...|$|R

40|$|Rubblization is an in-place {{rehabilitation}} technique that involves breaking the concrete pavement into pieces. This process {{results in a}} structurally <b>sound,</b> rut <b>resistant</b> base layer which prevents reflective cracking (by obliterating the existing concrete pavement distresses and joints) that can then be overlaid with Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA). The design of the structural overlay thickness for rubblized projects is difficult as the resulting structure is neither a true rigid pavement nor a true flexible pavement.

In the Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) design approach developed for the analysis and design of rubblized concrete pavements in Iowa, the tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} HMA layer (Îµt) is used to predict fatigue life using an HMA fatigue design algorithm and the vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade layer (Îµc) is used to consider subgrade rutting. In the current study, the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) -based structural models for predicting the critical strains based on FWD deflection data, is successfully demonstrated.

40|$|The University {{awarded a}} {{contract}} {{for the design of}} the Contained Firing Facility (CFF) to Parsons Infrastructure & Technology, Inc. of Pasadena, California. The Laboratory specified that the firing chamber be able to withstand repeated firings of 60 Kg of explosive located {{in the center of the}} chamber, 4 feet above the floor, and repeated firings of 35 Kg of explosive at the same height and located anywhere within 2 feet of the edge of a region on the floor called the anvil. Other requirements were that the chamber be able to accommodate the penetrations of the existing bullnose of the Bunker 801 flash X-ray machine and the roof of the underground camera room. For the sole purpose of calculating the explosive firing zones, it is assumed that the above requirements will be met by the completed facility. These requirements and provisions for blast <b>resistant</b> <b>doors</b> formed the essential basis for the design. The design efforts resulted in a steel-reinforced concrete structure measuring (on the inside) 55 x 51 feet by 30 feet high. The walls and ceiling are to be approximately 6 feet thick. Because the 60 Kg charge is not located in the geometric center of the volume and a 35 Kg charge could be located anywhere in a prescribed area, there will be different dynamic pressures and impulses on the various walls, floor, and ceiling depending upon the weights and locations of the charges. Parsons used the TM 5 - 1300 methods to calculate the loadings on the various firing chamber surfaces for the design criteria explosive weights and locations. At LLNL the same methods were then used to determine the firing zones for other weights and elevations that would give the same or lesser loadings. Although very laborious, a hand calculation of the various variables is possible and an example is given in Appendix C. A code called �SHOCK� is available to perform these calculations rapidly and a version runs on a personal computer. Parsons used the SHOCK code extensively as well as several single and multiple degree of freedom codes which were provided by the U. S. Corps of Engineers. In addition, Parsons based their analysis/design on procedures stipulated in the publication DOE/TIC- 11268, A Manual for the Prediction of Blast and Fragment Loadings on Structures. Loadings on structures in Reference 2 and in calculations performed with the SHOCK code are based on weights of explosives in pounds of TNT equivalent. The equivalency of an explosive (for its blast effects on structures) is calculated by the ratio of its heat to detonation to that of TNT. We intend to use C- 4 for testing the response of the firing chamber. Various values of the ratio for C- 4 are available, Reference 2 lists numbers leading to a ratio of 1. 15, while 1. 13 is the ratio calculated from numbers given in the LLNL Explosives Handbook, (Reference 3). Parsons used a ratio value of 1. 3 for generic high explosive to TNT equivalency. For design purposes, Reference 2 recommends a 20 % increase in explosive weight. Parsons adopted this recommendation. For calculational purposes, 60 Kg of generic high explosive was taken to be equivalent to 206. 3 pounds of TNT. Explosive firing zone maps are given for six elevations. The SHOCK code calculations for the 206. 3 Lb. charge of TNT are given for the floor and roof of the firing chamber to illustrate the technique and because this charge results in the highest loading on the respective surfaces. This is followed by calculations for the 120. 3 Lb. charge giving the maximum pressures on the East and West walls (no builnose accounted for). One of a series of code calculations is given to illustrate the reduced area feature of the code. In this case, a virtual blast door on the inside of the chamber wall is being considered. The two remaining plots are the calculated peak average pressures and impulses on the virtual door from charges of various weights as they are moved along a bisecting normal line to the door...|$|R

40|$|A new mean of {{assembling}} steel to aluminiumwas developed, following previouswork by Germanworkers [1]. In this newmethod, a laser-induced aluminium {{melt pool}} spreads and wets a solid steel, to generate, after solidification a <b>sound</b> and <b>resistant</b> interface layer. Joint properties were investigated, {{in terms of}} surface aspects, interface microstructures and mechanical resistances under tensile testing, for non-galvanized and galvanized DC 04 steels. Thermal and diffusional finite element (FE) simulations were also carried out to calculate temperature history at interfaces, and reaction layer thickness. The 2 – 20 m thick reaction layers formed all along the interface {{were found to be}} mostly composed of Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic compound with a high hardness (1200 HV) and rather low ductility (presence of solidification cracks). The presence of a 10 m thick Zn layer on the steel was shown to have a beneficial influence on the wetting characteristics of the joint, despite the formation of occluded pores in the melt pool due to Zn vaporisation. FE thermal modelling evidenced 760 – 1020 ◦C wetting temperatures at the interface between DC 04 low carbon steel and 6016 aluminium sheets, with time maintains of the melt pool in the 0. 2 – 0. 5 s range, resulting in high-speed reaction kinetics. Using these temperature data, diffusion calculations were shown to provide a rather good prediction of intermetallic thicknesses. Tensile tests were considered on aluminium–steel lap joints and evidenced higher mechanical resistances (220 N/mm linear tensile strength) on galvanized steels, provided that fluxing of the steel surfacewas carried out prior to welding to avoid zinc vaporisation. Comparatively, non-galvanized assemblies exhibited much lower mechanical resistances (170 N/mm resulting in a 90 MPa interfacial shear strength). It was concluded that the laser-induced wetting technique is a rather effective way for generating Al-steel joints without filler material, and that it should be considered as a competitive technique versus solid assembly modes (friction stir welding...) ...|$|R
40|$|Non-galvanized and 10 µm {{zinc-coated}} 1. 2 mm thick DC 04 steel {{was joined}} to 6016 -T 4 aluminium alloy by using three different laser processses : a key-hole welding mode, with a precise {{control of the}} aluminium – steel dilution, a reactive wetting mode where solid steel – liquid aluminium reaction occurred driving to a uniform Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic layer between the two overlapped sheets and a braze-welding mode involving direct fusion of aluminium and an Al- 12 Si filler wire on solid steel. For liquid aluminium to liquid steel interactions obtained by key-hole mode, rather <b>sound</b> and <b>resistant</b> assemblies were realized either on non-galvanized or galvanized steel provided steel was placed upon aluminium with penetration in aluminium limited to 0. 5 mm. The influence of galvanized layer was only detectable on the fusion zone of aluminium where occluded zinc bubbles were observed. Mechanical resistances of 150 N/mm were obtained for one joint assemblies and could be increased up to 250 N/mm making two joints per assembly. For liquid aluminium to solid steel interactions carried out by defocused laser, 180 N/mm transverse tensile strengths were obtained on non-galvanized steels by using a brazing flux. Due to a better wetting on non-galvanized steels, good assemblies could be obtained without using flux leading to lower mechanical resistances of up to 140 N/mm. However, using flux conduced to 220 N/mm maximal mechanical resistance. For this kind of interaction solid/liquid), using an Al- 12 Si filler wire allows to obtained also 180 N/mm mechanical strengths on non-galvanized steels using a brazing flux. Same characteristics are obtained in the reaction layers composition with a decrease in maximal layer thickness under 1 µm compared to the 2 - 40 µm thickness obtained without filler wire. Finally, comparisons are made between the three processes investigated focusing on the mechanical properties and the robustness of each process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn Tuesday April 28, 2009 {{a report}} for BBC {{displayed}} {{an interview with}} a Palestinian citizen rebuilt his destroyed house with mud brick and mentioned that, it is a shame to live in a mud house at this age. The researcher was struck by this interview which led to work on this research. Due to the siege, the Palestinians lost the hope to reconstruct their destroyed homes, public buildings and infrastructure. Building with mud bricks as a thermal insulation and environmentally friendly method, works as a fire <b>resistant,</b> <b>sound</b> proof and can be entirely chemical free. It is cheaper; 80 m 2 house made of cement would cost around 16, 000 dollars at least, but a mud one with local materials cost just 3, 000 dollars. Best of all, it can be made on site in any shape, color or size, made of a mixture of clay, mud, sand, and water mixed with a binding material such as rice husks or straw. Mud bricks fulfill the compressive strength and heat conductivity requirements. It also keeps indoor temperatures stationary during the summer and winter as a thermal insulation method. It is a traditional building material in much of the Middle East, India, North Africa and the majority of the Islamic cities buildings. Recently, there have been attempts to revive the use of mud brick through special projects such as those instigated by Hassan Fathy in Egypt, the beautiful Cob House on Mayne Island, Canada, etc. The mud bricks aim to save energy. The energy crisis experienced in the past have shifted the focus of the economical gain to energy saving. The research will display all the successful methods of building with mud bricks in order to extract different recommendations from it. this will be a guide for anyone who want to build his own house in a wonderful form, shape, style and colors. Besides different recommendations for the governmental institutions to encourage the citizens to reconstruct their homes by this method and construct models of mud houses to teach the citizens how to build their own homes? Finally, earthen structures are cheap, environmentally friendly and it is not a shame to live in a mud house but it is a global trend to preserve and to protect the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} {{explosion of}} an anti-ship missile or stored ammunition is a potentially catastrophic threat for a navy vessel. These events generally cause heavy blast loading and fragments to perforate the ship structure. As {{a solution to}} reduce the blast loading, the compartment can be filled with water mist prior to the explosion. TNO Defence, Security and Safety and Fluid Gravity Engineering (FGE) have teamed up to perform a combined theoretical analysis and experimental validation programme. The cooperation {{is part of the}} British and Netherlands MoD exchange programme BNCP/N/R 24. During development of the trial programme, FGE provided TNO with the required test design parameters through a one dimensional hydrodynamic analysis of the droplet distribution. It showed that the expected mitigating effect is largely independent of the initial droplet size. After that, TNO performed the trials and FGE simultaneously conducted 2 D and 3 D simulations in their codes EDEN and PIC 3 D without any access to the experimental data. Results of the experiments and numerics were compared afterwards. In total seven blast mitigation trials were performed on a realistic scale, the amount of water mist being varied between 0, 80 and 100 litres in the 225 m³ bunker. The water mist system was provided by Marioff. The trials have shown that the quasi static pressure from an explosion can be reduced by almost 50 % when the water mist system is designed properly. Peak pressure of the blast wave was reduced only marginally and the value varied from shot to shot. Measured impulse of the blast waves in the water mist filled bunker was 25 % lower compared to the dry reference trial. Note that the quasi static pressure {{is one of the main}} design drivers for the strength of blast <b>resistant</b> bulkheads and <b>doors.</b> Results from modelling by FGE are in fair agreement with experimental data. Such models can thus be used for further development and optimisation of system design for specific compartments. Because of the mitigating effect of the water mist, the ship can be constructed using less material (bulkhead thickness) to withstand an internal explosion, or the current bulkhead designs can provide protection against larger anti-ship missiles. Alternatively, such a system can be applied in high risk compartments like ammunition storage rooms. Future work includes the challenge of timing: having the right amount of water in the compartment will require very fast triggering and release systems if it is used as last resort, or will require different thinking of the ship crew and commander when used pre-emptively...|$|R
