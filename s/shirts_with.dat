5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped <b>shirts,</b> <b>with</b> white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink <b>shirts</b> <b>with</b> a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E
