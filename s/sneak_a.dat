25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} one of the most {{dramatic}} sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Baltimore Colts, a rival {{from the old}} AAFC, in its second preseason game. Scoring in the game, played in Cincinnati, began with an 18-yard passing {{touchdown}} from Graham to halfback Dub Jones in the first quarter. Baltimore's Billy Stone received the ensuing kickoff and ran it back 100 {{yards for a touchdown}} to tie the game at 7–7. Graham then led the team on a 75-yard drive composed mostly of passes to Lavelli that ended with a one-yard touchdown by Graham on a quarterback <b>sneak.</b> <b>A</b> short field goal by Groza gave the Browns a 17–7 lead at halftime. The Browns widened the lead with another Groza field goal in the third period and a touchdown set up by a 63-yard punt return by Ken Carpenter {{at the beginning of the}} fourth. Holding a 20-point lead, Brown rested his starters and sent in a squad composed entirely of rookies. The rookies managed another touchdown on a two-yard rush by Tom O'Malley that was set up by a Carpenter interception, giving Cleveland the 34–7 win. Cleveland's defense played well, allowing 42 net rushing yards and 86 passing yards.|$|E

Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to define it. The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E
25|$|Strauss and Trott built a {{partnership}} of 118 before the England captain edged to Michael Clarke at first slip {{just before the}} lunch break on day three. With the final ball of the morning session, Prior drove a ball from North to the off side and hit Ricky Ponting at silly point square in the jaw. The Australian captain, looked nonplussed, simply spat out some blood. After lunch, Prior was run out while attempting to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> run, despite hitting the ball straight to Katich, who threw down the stumps at the bowler's end. The next man in was Andrew Flintoff, playing in his final Test innings, and he added 22 off 18 before being caught on the long-on boundary. A lofted straight drive from England's most promising all-round prospect, Stuart Broad, brought up the 400 lead, but an attempted slog found his top edge and he was caught by Ponting off North for 29. Meanwhile, Trott progressed towards his maiden Test century, ably supported by Graeme Swann, who reached his half-century in just 44 balls. However, the England spinner was eventually caught behind, top-edging a pull shot off a bouncer from Hilfenhaus. Trott then became the 18th England cricketer to make a century on debut with a four off Hilfenhaus's next over, but he and Anderson only managed to add another 31 before Trott was caught by North at point off Stuart Clark, prompting a declaration from Andrew Strauss. England's score of 373/9 declared meant {{that in order to}} win the match Australia would need to make 546 runs in just over two days on a pitch that had not yet produced more than 400 {{over the course of the}} match. England, on the other hand, needed only to take 10 Australian wickets. The Australian openers managed to get to 80 without loss by the end of play.|$|E

[...] Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow, {{had begun}} {{an investigation of}} his own and discovered that for the past month Toft's husband, Joshua, had been buying young rabbits. [...] Convinced he had enough evidence to proceed, in a letter to physician Sir Hans Sloane he wrote that the affair had [...] "almost alarmed England" [...] and that he would soon publish his findings. [...] The same day, Thomas Howard, a porter at the bagnio, confessed to Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas Clarges that he had been bribed by Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret, to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> rabbit into Toft's chamber. [...] When arrested and questioned Mary denied the accusation, while Margaret, under Douglas's interrogation, claimed that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only.|$|E
500|$|In early 2000, Crash Holly {{joined the}} {{hardcore}} division. On the February 24 episode of SmackDown!, he defeated Test {{to begin his}} first of 22 Hardcore Championship reigns. He decreed that he must defend the championship twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, which later {{became known as the}} [...] "24/7 Rule". This meant that the title was permanently contested, not just in sanctioned matches, and could change hands anywhere, anytime anyone pinned the champion, so long as a WWF referee counted the fall. Holly was frequently attacked by other wrestlers in unlikely locations, including an airport, a funhouse, a circus, and his hotel room. Though he was often pinned, he usually immediately regained the title. His most common tactic was to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> pin, often after the champion had been beaten down by someone else, and quickly run backstage, away from possible challengers. This turned him into a crowd favorite and earned him the nickname [...] "The Houdini of Hardcore". He frequently defended the championship against non-wrestlers, including referees and road agents, like Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. He had a long feud with The Mean Street Posse (Pete Gas, Rodney and Joey Abs) over the title. He even lost, and quickly regained, the title against one of the Godfather's hos.|$|E

He offers to {{accompany}} Charlie on the tour, but Charlie explains how he was offered money for the ticket and intends to sell it. Grandpa George (David Morris) reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Upon meeting him {{on the day of the}} tour, the visitors find Wonka to be peculiar, lonely and acting odd at the mention of [...] "parents". The tour shows how the fantastical factory operates under the efforts of the short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up being caught in the factory workings and have to be safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in worse shape than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into a river of chocolate and is sucked up by a pipe before being rescued from the fudge processing center; Violet expands into an oversized blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum despite Wonka's warning; Veruca is thrown away as a [...] "bad nut" [...] by trained squirrels down the garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches in height after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. [...] During the tour, Wonka has flashbacks from his childhood where he remembers that he had a troubled relationship with his father, Wilbur. Due to his father being a dentist he was forbidden from candy consumption, but after managing to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> taste, he became hooked and later ran away from home to live his dream.

[...] The stakes were high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. [...] The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. [...] Cork were never really troubled {{over the course of the}} seventy minutes. [...] With thirteen minutes left Jimmy Barry-Murphy hit a low shot in towards the goal and it bounced in past goalkeeper Noel Skehan. [...] The goal turned out to be the deciding factor as Cork went on to win the game and a third All-Ireland title in-a-row.|$|E

Ismail managed to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> number of weapons captured from Indonesian military personnel into {{a meeting of the}} UN Security Council, greatly upsetting the Council's President, who asked him to remove them. Later, Ismail was a critic of Lee Kuan Yew, the Singaporean Prime Minister, for his attempt to de-emphasise race in Malaysian politics through the establishment of a non-racial political coalition, the Malaysian Solidarity Council (MSC). The resulting political controversy led to Singapore's separation from Malaysia; however, Ismail, like Toh Chin Chye, expressed his belief that Singapore and Malaysia would eventually merge once more, stating: [...] "It is better to wait for this to come because if they do not do so they will sink together instead of coming together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{claim that}} Jesus was married also {{undermines}} the theological {{metaphor of the}} Church being the [...] "Bride of Christ" [...] (found {{in the writings of}} the New Testament). Jimmy Akin, director of Apologetics and Evangelization at Catholic Answers, wrote: [...] "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about [...] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." [...] As for a possible [...] "son of Jesus," [...] he noted: [...] "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gavin Tomlin {{was to make}} {{an instant}} impact, scoring just five minutes into his debut in the home match against Shrewsbury. [...] It was {{a game in which}} the Gulls went on to win 5-0, a {{particularly}} impressive performance considering the Shrews were currently 4th in the table and had spent the majority of the season in the play-off positions. [...] Even that result was arguably bettered by Torquay’s trip to Gigg Lane three days later where they beat 2nd placed Bury 2-1 after coming back from a goal down. [...] Earlier in the month, Torquay had already claimed four points from two other play-off challengers, grabbing a 1-1 draw with Rotherham and a 2-0 victory against Stevenage. [...] In fact, Torquay seemed to be experiencing more problems against teams lower down in the division; the only defeat of the month came away to Aldershot and the Gulls only just managed to <b>sneak</b> <b>a</b> point with a 91st minute Guy Branston header to secure a 3-3 draw away at Macclesfield.|$|E
