5|$|Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E

5|$|The sterile diploid {{hybrid of}} A.montanum and A.platyneuron, which resembles A.bradleyi except for its {{abortive}} spores and smaller sori, was not collected until 1972, at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia. Even though the diploid hybrid is rarely collected, allozyme <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> A.bradleyi has multiple origins; that is, different populations of A.bradleyi have originated from the chromosome doubling of independently formed diploids.

5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis.

5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> most people systematically overestimate their own abilities.

5|$|Juveniles of some spiders in the {{families}} Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant nectar. Laboratory <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{they do so}} deliberately and over extended periods, and periodically clean themselves while feeding. These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water, which indicates that they are seeking nutrients. Since many spiders are nocturnal, the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been underestimated. Nectar contains amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars, and {{studies have shown that}} other spider species live longer when nectar is available. Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey, and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. <b>Studies</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E
