60|$|Daughter of Heaven and Earth, coy Spring, With sudden passion languishing, Maketh {{all things}} softly smile, Painteth {{pictures}} mile on mile, Holds a cup with cowslip-wreaths, Whence a smokeless incense breathes. Girls are peeling the <b>sweet</b> <b>willow,</b> Poplar white, and Gilead-tree, And troops of boys Shouting with whoop and hilloa, And hip, hip three times three. The air {{is full of}} whistlings bland; What was that I heard Out of the hazy land? Harp of the wind, or song of bird, Or clapping of shepherd's hands, Or vagrant booming of the air, Voice of a meteor lost in day? Such tidings of the starry sphere Can this elastic air convey. Or haply 't was the cannonade Of the pent and darkened lake, Cooled by the pendent mountain's shade, Whose deeps, till beams of noonday break, Afflicted moan, and latest hold Even unto May the iceberg cold. Was it a squirrel's pettish bark, Or clarionet of jay? or hark, Where yon wedged line the Nestor leads, Steering north with raucous cry Through tracts and provinces of sky, Every night alighting down In new landscapes of romance, Where darkling feed the clamorous clans By lonely lakes to men unknown. Come the tumult whence it will, Voice of sport, or rush of wings, It is a sound, it is a token That the marble sleep is broken, And a change has passed on things.|$|E

The mushroom grows in large brackets - some have been found that weigh over 45 kg (100 pounds).

40|$|Microbial {{degradation}} of chlorinated ethenes (CE) in rhizosphere soils was investigated at seepline areas impacted by CE plumes. Successful bioremediation of CE in rhizosphere soils {{is dependent on}} microbial activity, soil types, plant species, and groundwater CE concentrations. Seepline soils were exposed to trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) in the 10 - 50 ppb range. Greenhouse soils were exposed to 2 - 10 ppm TCE. Plants at the seepline were poplar and pine while the greenhouse contained <b>sweet</b> gum, <b>willow,</b> pine, and poplar. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses were performed to assess the microbial activity in rhizosphere soils. Biomass content was lowest in the nonvegetated control soil and highest in the Sweet Gum soil. Bacterial rhizhosphere densities, as measured by PLFA, were similar in different vegetated soils while fungi biomass was highly variable. The PLFA soil profiles showed diverse microbial communities primarily composed of Gram-negative bacteria. Adaptation of the microbial community to CE {{was determined by the}} ratio of {omega} 7 t/{omega} 7 c fatty acids. Ratios (16 : 1 {omega} 7 v 16 : 1 {omega} 7 c and 18 :l{omega} 7 t/ 18 : 1 {omega} 7 c) greater than 0. 1 were demonstrated in soils exposed to higher CE concentrations (10 - 50 ppm), indicating an adaptation to CE resulting in decreased membrane permeability. Ratios of cyclopropyl fatty acids showed that the vegetated control soil sample contained the fastest microbial turnover rate and least amount of environmental stress. PLFA results provide evidence that sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are active in these soils. Microcosm studies with these soils showed CE dechlorinating activity was occurring. This study demonstrates microbial adaptation to environmental contamination and supports the application of natural soil rhizosphere activity as a remedial strategy...|$|R
40|$|The Sudanese citrus {{industry}} is mainly based on oldline cultivars of grapefruit, <b>sweet</b> orange and <b>willow</b> leaf mandarin, grafted {{almost exclusively on}} sour orange. Infection with graft-transmissible agents, viroids in particular, may have deleterious effects on the productivity of these citrus species and, more importantly, limits the choice of rootstocks should sour orange be replaced by alternative rootstocks because of tristeza disease. Three cv. Foster pink grapefruit sources and one local selection of Nuri- 16, a local sweet orange selection, proved to be infected by several viroids, including Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), the causal agents of exocortis and cachexia, respectively. Cloning and sequencing of four HSVd isolates showed {{that in addition to}} the characteristic variants containing the “cachexia expression motif ” or the “non-cachexia expression motif”, other variants were also present. To secure additional information, samples from 24 citrus species and cultivars were collected in 2008 from several citrus-growing regions and analyzed for the presence of viroids. The results confirmed that CEVd, HSVd, Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd), Citrus dwarfing viroid (CDVd), and Citrus bark cracking viroid (CBCVd), but not Citrus viroid V (CVd-V), are widely spread throughout the surveyed areas. None of the collected samples was found to be viroid-free. The relationships between viroid infection and “gummy bark ” and “Kassala disease”, two affections of unknown etiology, but with cachexia-like gum impregnations in the bark, are discussed...|$|R
