5|$|On 22 October 1987, a fatal {{accident}} occurred {{when one of}} the old HkB 600units suffered a catastrophic failure of its braking system, and rolled down the Holmenkoll Line, finally tipping over at Midtstuen. One person was killed and four were seriously injured, leading to a <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> of the old teak cars used on the line; the HkB 600units were withdrawn from service, but were reintroduced after some refits.|$|E

25|$|Scarring (US: Scoring) {{can occur}} if brake pads are not changed {{promptly}} {{when they reach}} the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad's steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear directly upon the disc's wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In Pennsylvania, which {{has one of the most}} rigorous auto <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> if any scoring is deeper than , and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.|$|E

25|$|The ground itself {{changed little}} {{since the mid-1970s}} and was largely {{outdated}} {{and in need of}} urgent redevelopment, with the Blackfriars End failing a <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> in July 2009. The terraced end had fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years which steadily reduced the stadium capacity from nearly 9,000 to reportedly 7,100, although the capacity was officially confirmed as 7,700 in November 2007. Improvements were made in later years to ensure the ground met Football League standards; including new floodlights, dressing rooms and barriers on the terraces. The pitch itself was also completely relaid for the 2007–08 season, with a new sprinkler system installed for the 2008–09 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent by}} which Searsville Reservoir {{serves as a}} source for {{non-native}} species was illustrated when Stanford biologists studied the aquatic fauna found in the plunge pool below the Searsville dam spillway. The plunge pool was drained in 2013 to allow for a <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> of the base of the dam. Native species found when the plunge pool was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the dewatering process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Other non-native in the plunge pool included 500 bullfrogs and 150 Louisiana red swamp crayfish.|$|E

25|$|NASCAR {{conducts a}} {{complete}} technical inspection {{prior to the}} first practice session, before and after qualifying, and before the race. A quick <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> is also completed prior to each practice session after the first. Penalties for car violations are typically announced the Wednesday after a race, and can range from a simple fine to a suspension (typically a maximum of 12 races) and loss of points. After a race, the top 5 finishers, one other random car, and the first car failing to finish the race not due to an accident will have their cars inspected. The winner, random car, and first car out also have their cars and engines taken by NASCAR for further inspection at the NASCAR Research and Development Center. Further, there is one random race per year where NASCAR confiscates 15-20 engines and takes them to NASCAR's Research and Development Center for evaluation, comparison, and to help decide on future rule changes.|$|E

500|$|Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Transport Canada {{conducted}} {{investigations into}} the accident. The RCMP released its report on July 29, 2008. The report stated that the van would not have passed a <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> {{at the time of}} the accident because of rust in its body, worn all-season tires, and faulty brakes. None of these factors could be identified as the sole cause of the accident, but the report noted that [...] "together, they certainly contributed".
