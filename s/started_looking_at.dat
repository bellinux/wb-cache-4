5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Olympic {{football}} tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.|$|E
5|$|Finnair {{terminated}} {{their services}} to Kirkenes in 1975. At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need of subsidies. The proposals were either for a hike in the ticket prices or a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express. Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air. Norving filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and their routes were taken over by Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{rejected}} the location {{because of the}} environmental impact. These institutions instead proposed that the track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the possibility of constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about {{the environmental impact of}} a Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution. However, Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990.|$|E

5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of The Witness for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and Blow {{and his team}} <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. At the time of this decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn about the upcoming PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged that he has had difficulties working with Microsoft in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through with Microsoft to release his earlier game, Braid. The Witness had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that Blow and his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nordenfjelske <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{the supply}} of sulfate pulp, of which it needed an annual supply of 40,000 tonnes. Proposals called for a sulfate pulp mill at Fiborgtangen, but this was met by {{opposition}} locally due {{to the concerns of}} the smell. Ranheim Papirfabrik in Trondheim was at the time considering building a new pulp mill at Ranheim and proposed that it increase the output to 140,000 tonnes annually in order to also supply Fiborgtangen.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a group <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Kjevik as a {{suitable}} site, led by aviator Bernt Balchen, industrialist Rolf Petersen and Lawyer Hartmann. They presented detailed plans and agreed prices for purchase of lands. Based on this Kristiansand Municipal Council accepted on 5 August 1936 to reconsider Kjevik. Kjevik {{was passed in}} the council on 30 September 1937 with 34 against 26 votes. Construction commenced in November and was contracted to Høyer-Ellefsen. The same year the Norwegian Army Air Service used the fields at Kjevik for training.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{government}} <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> expanding the agency's role. While these commissions had technical competence, their transient nature {{caused them to}} not be sufficient methodological in their investigations. Creating a permanent staff and a larger specialist environment {{was seen as a}} way to allow for better investigation and reporting. Particularly two accidents were pinnacle to this move, the sinking of MS Sleipner and the Åsta accident, which killed 16 and 19 people, respectively. Although {{the government}} wanted to include all modes of transport, legal and practical reasons caused the railway sector {{to be the first to}} be included.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, only a {{few months}} later, the enigmatic Howard Hughes first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner {{prototype}} for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He became a believer, imagining TWA and National delivering passengers from New York City to vacation spots in Florida in half the time of the competition. He became desperate to buy 30 Jetliners, but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> US companies to build it for them; Convair proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its Orenda turbojet and CF-100 jet fighter programs.|$|E
25|$|A 1938 <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{possibilities}} for rerouting the Drammen Line {{so it would}} connect to Oslo East Station, rather than the smaller Oslo West Station. Two main concepts were explored, both which involved a branching off from near Skøyen. The one scenario called for a tunnel under the city center, the other as a ring line which would connect Skøyen with Grefsen Station. The final plans for the tunnel route were passed by Parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. When the Oslo Tunnel opened 30 May 1980, the Drammen Line branched off from its old course just east of Skøyen Station. The old part remained in use and became the Skøyen–Filipstad Line. From the same date the interlocking system at Skøyen has been remotely controlled from Oslo Central Station. Centralized traffic control became operational from 3 December 1992.|$|E

500|$|The {{first public}} {{transport}} in Bergen was the Bergen Tramway, which operated between 1897 and 1965. It {{was limited to}} the inner parts of the city and did not reach the suburbs. The city council therefore decided to close it, arguing that the future lay in private cars, [...] diesel buses and trolleybuses. In the 1960s, the removal on restriction on car sales created more traffic than the roads could handle and consequently both buses and cars began increasingly being stuck in rush-hour queues. The municipality and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> rectifying the situation by building a ring road around the city, and by alternative means of public transport.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{expressed}} a robust attitude to his situation: {{he refused to}} regard himself as disabled, and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more [...] "rewarding and challenging" [...] since {{he had lost his}} leg. His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of the disabled in society. Fox's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities, and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities, by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light. Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability. [...] "What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> things differently. They came away with huge pride", he wrote.|$|E
500|$|Peirce {{wanted to}} tell the story from Brandon's perspective.

People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E

The extended runway was completed in 1977. Construction of the initial auxiliary facilities started in 1978 and was concluded in 1985. Evenes Air Station became operative in January 1986. Construction continued with barracks, which were completed in 1991, aircraft shelters, administrative offices and storage facilities, which were concluded in 1995. No military aircraft have been permanently stationed at Evenes.|$|E

2500|$|Parliament {{decided that}} five Avinor {{airports}} {{would be allowed}} to issue ninety percent discount on take-off charges on international routes. This accounted in 2004 to NOK4,800 per flight for a Boeing 737-200. However, they still had to pay full terminal, security and air navigation service charges. This allowed Haugesund to establish itself as a [...] "low-cost" [...] airport for low-cost carriers. Ryanair <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Haugesund as a destination in 2002, hoping to serve both Rogaland and Hordaland from one airport. However, they demanded that the runway be lengthened if they were to use Karmøy. It launched its inaugural daily route to London Stansted Airport on 30 April 2003. By using the smaller Boeing 737-200 aircraft the airline could as an interim solution get by with the short runway—the shortest of any airport served by the airline.|$|E
