The empirical analysis gives no hint for an alteration of deficit policy after having joined EMU or after having breached the Pact in 2003. These results can be explained with the fact that the Pact was undermined from its beginning and only had a limited disciplining effect henceforth. Otherwise the breakout of the ongoing debt crisis would not have been possible. These results advocate a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> which cannot be influenced on a political level...|$|E

40|$|Even though small- and {{medium-sized}} firms (SMEs) were believed not to proceed beyond exporting in their internationalization routes, we can observe {{new types of}} co-operation intensive entrepreneurial firms – so-called “micromultinational enterprises” (mMNEs) – entering the global landscape. These firms face the challenge to manage and control a portfolio of national and international alliances simultaneously (ego network). The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide game theoretically consolidated conditions in order to analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of interorganizational <b>sanction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in an alliance portfolio setting. A game theoretical framework is developed over three stages with increasing complexity. Results show that two out of six analyzed <b>sanction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> do not fulfill the game theoretical condition for effectiveness. The efficiency analysis sensibilizes for discretionary elements in governance structures and demonstrates that not one single <b>sanction</b> <b>mechanism</b> but rather the right choice and combination of different types of <b>sanction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> leads to efficient results. We contribute to the international business, alliance, and network literature in several ways by focusing on alliance portfolios held by mMNEs. In doing so, we move beyond the dyadic level and analyze <b>sanction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> from an ego network perspective, a still widely under-emphasized topic in the literature. alliance portfolio, ego network, governance, sanctions, game theory...|$|R

Another measure to incentivize stable and long-term employment concerning the core workforce, evolved through voluntary corporate social benefits, comprising occupational pensions and company-owned apartments. However, the immediate eviction from the apartment was often used as a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism.</b> To reduce the impact of those ‘golden chains’, changes in tenancy law {{in the area of}} company-owned apartments allowed workers to stay in their apartments even after leaving the firm (Lutz 1987, p.  224).|$|E

40|$|Under a {{great variety}} of legally {{relevant}} circumstances, people have {{to decide whether or not}} to cooperate, when they face an incentive to defect. The law sometimes provides people with <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to enforce pro-social behavior. Experimental evidence on voluntary public good provision shows that the option to punish others substantially improves cooperation, even if punishment is costly. However, these studies focus on situations where there is no uncertainty about others' behavior. We investigate punishment in a world with “reasonable doubt” about others' contributions. Interestingly, people reveal a high willingness to punish even if their information about cooperation rates is inaccurate, or noisy. If there is some non-trivial degree of noise, unishment (1) cannot maintain high contributions and (2) reduces welfare even below the level of a setting without punishment. Our findings suggest that sufficient information accuracy about others' behavior is crucial for he efficiency of <b>sanction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> If a situation is characterized by low information accuracy, precluding sanctions can be optimal.

40|$|The treaty {{creating}} the WTO replaced the GATT dispute resolution system, which contained no formal sanctions for {{breach of agreement}} as a practical matter, with a system that results in centrally authorized sanctions against recalcitrant violators of WTO trade agreements. We examine the important features of the new system, and argue that the institutionalization of a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> was not motivated by a perceived need to increase the penalty for violations, but rather by a need to decrease the penalty. In particular, the GATT system relied on unilateral retaliation and reputation to police the bargain, and toward its end unilateral retaliation became excessive, interfering with opportunities for efficient breach. The WTO mechanism for arbitrating the magnitude of proposed sanctions is the major innovation under WTO law, and ensures that sanctions are not set too high...|$|E
40|$|Although {{member states}} {{are obliged to}} {{transpose}} directives into domestic law in a conformable manner and receive considerable time for their transposition activities, we identify three levels of transposition outcomes for EU directives: conformable, partially conformable and non-conformable. Compared with existing transposition models, which do not distinguish between different transposition outcomes, we examine the factors influencing each transposition process {{by means of a}} competing risk analysis. We find that preference-related factors, in particular the disagreement of a member state and the Commission regarding a directive’s outcome, play a much more strategic role than has to date acknowledged in the transposition literature. Whereas disagreement of a member state delays conformable transposition, it speeds up non-conformable transposition. Disagreement of the Commission only prolongs the transposition process. We therefore conclude that a stronger focus on an effective <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is warranted for safeguarding compliance with directives...|$|E

We designed two versions of a step-level public good game, with or without a centralized <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> (CSM). In a baseline treatment participants play 14 rounds of the non-CSM game. In an automatic removal (AR) treatment participants play 7 rounds with CSM plus 7 rounds without CSM. In voted removal (VR) participants play 7 rounds with CSM followed by a voting stage to decide whether to keep CSM. All VR groups removed CSM. Contributions in AR and VR after CSM removal are dramatically higher than in the baseline. Most groups with a CSM history managed to cooperate until the last round. We do not find more cooperation in VR than in AR. Copyright Springer Science + Business Media B. V. 2007 Public good, Step-level, Sanctioning institution, Cooperation, Education, Trust,...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a mechanism {{that can be}} used to drive interfaces from a description logic (DL) model of the domain. A simple layer with limited expressivity sits on top of the DL, with the interface behaviour described using a collection of application specific assertions.

This uses a mechanism called sanctioning, which is an integral part of GRAIL DL implementation [6]. As well as user interface generation, the GRAIL <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been used for a range of other purposes, in particular as an aid to knowledge modellers. Although suited to a number of applications, GRAIL provides a limited expressiveness and uses structural subsumption algorithms which are known to be incomplete.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{situation}} known as the Tragedy of the Commons, in which conicting individual and group interests result in overappropriation of a common- pool resource. It examines the setting focusing on theoretical models, combining the approaches of game theory and maximization. It analyzes the e_ects of dif- ferent aspects of the situation, such as game structure, game payoffs, repetitions and individual and group characteristics, first in the setting where no interactions among players are possible, {{and then in the}} situation in which players are allowed to communicate and decide on some kind of management of the resource. In accord with many recent studies, this thesis shows that state management of a resource is not the only solution to the dilemma. Moreover, when interactions among players are allowed, users may be able to design their own rules, thus avoiding the `tragic' outcome. Communication and the ability to design <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is shown to {{have a major impact on}} the success of these self-management rules...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the European Union's reactions to breaches of liberal democratic practices in Hungary and Romania during 2012 - 13 {{in order to}} assess its capacity to lock in democracy in the Member States. The article finds that a combination of partisan politics and weak normative consensus thwarted the EU's ability to use the <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Article 7. The effectiveness of alternative instruments that EU institutions used - social pressure, infringement procedures and issue linkage - varied across issues and countries. In Hungary, changes to illiberal practices generally remained limited, but differences in the EU's material leverage explain cross-issue variation. The EU's relative success in Romania suggests that it is not necessarily powerless against democratic backsliding. It might require a demanding constellation of favourable conditions for both social and material pressure, but there are grounds for a more optimistic interpretation that material leverage might be unnecessary if the conditions for social pressure are favourable...|$|E

40|$|The New Institutional Economics has {{established}} itself as widely accepted extension {{to the standard}} neoclassical paradigm.

40|$|We {{examine the}} role {{one-time}} threats of expulsion and punishment have on voluntary contributions {{in a public}} goods game. This paper extends the work of Cinyabuguma, Page, and Putterman (2005), who find {{that the threat of}} expulsion in every period raises contributions to near Pareto Optimal levels. In our experiments, participants played in 15 -round sessions where they were allowed to vote to remove other subjects only after round 5 and in one design also voted whether to punish the remaining subjects after round 10. We find that the additional threat of punishment not only increased the contributions of participants before the punishment vote, but also resulted in the expulsion of participants who had contributed more than in the no punishment treatment. Efficiency with expulsion is 58. 07 % without punishment, and 57. 13 % with punishment, including the cost for voting and punishment. Our findings indicate that the threat of expulsion as a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> may not be helpful for public good provision unless expulsion can occur in every period, the threat of costly punishment increases contributions with little impact on efficiency, and that standards for inclusion rise when later punishment is available. ...|$|E
