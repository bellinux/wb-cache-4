5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months {{unless there is a}} high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Lights: Each cave diver <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three {{independent}} {{sources of}} light. One {{is considered the}} primary and is intended for general use during the dive. The others are considered backup lights and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of the dive. If any diver loses light function so that they have fewer than three working lights, protocol requires that the dive is turned for {{all members of the}} dive team and exit started immediately.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{the minor}} orders were reformed; men {{preparing}} to be ordained as Catholic priests or deacons {{would no longer}} receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of lector and acolyte were retained, but redesignated as ministries. It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a ministry of exorcist if it seemed useful in that nation. Since then, Pope Benedict XVI mandated that each diocese in the world <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one active exorcist, and encouraged training of priests by the International Association of Exorcists in Rome.|$|E

25|$|Other {{criticisms of}} UK fire {{regulations}} voiced {{in the aftermath}} of the fire include the lack of external sprinklers, mandated in Dubai and Australia for example for buildings featuring combustible cladding, the lack of internal sprinklers, which could have contained the original fire, and a 1986 change in the law under the then Conservative government that abolished a requirement that external walls <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one hour's fire resistance to prevent blazes from re-entering a building and spreading to other apartments. Wales has required sprinklers to be installed in new houses and flats built since 2016. A BBC Breakfast investigation, focusing on half of the UK's council owned and housing association owned tower blocks, found that 2% of them have full sprinkler systems. Deaths were 87% lower when buildings with sprinklers caught fire. England, Wales and Scotland all require sprinklers in newly built tall buildings but this does not apply retrospectively to older buildings. The same investigation found that one tower block in three has more than one staircase where people can be evacuated. The London fire chief has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all social housing blocks.|$|E
25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} can learn to surf, but <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, {{he or she can}} be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E
25|$|All {{individuals}} with A-T <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one comprehensive immunologic evaluation that measures {{the number and}} type of lymphocytes in the blood (T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes), the levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and antibody responses to T-dependent (e.g., tetanus, Hemophilus influenzae b) and T-independent (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide) vaccines. For the most part, the pattern of immunodeficiency seen in an A-T patient early in life (by age five) {{will be the same}} pattern seen throughout the lifetime of that individual. Therefore, the tests need not be repeated unless that individual develops more problems with infection. Problems with immunity sometimes can be overcome by immunization. Vaccines against common bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Hemophilus influenzae, pneumococci and influenza virus (the “flu”) are commercially available and often help to boost antibody responses, even in {{individuals with}} low immunoglobulin levels. If the vaccines do not work and the patient continues to have problems with infections, gamma globulin therapy (IV or subcutaneous infusions of antibodies collected from normal individuals) may be of benefit. A small number of people with A-T develop an abnormality in which one or more types of immunoglobulin are increased far beyond the normal range. In a few cases, the immunoglobulin levels can be increased so much that the blood becomes thick and does not flow properly. Therapy for this problem must be tailored to the specific abnormality found and its severity.|$|E

[...] Overall, Keibler and Dovolani received four perfect scores. Keibler was eliminated in the final episode, coming in third to Jerry Rice, who placed second {{in the final round}} of the competition, and Drew Lachey, the winner of the season.

30|$|Estimated search {{costs are}} low. We {{estimate}} that, the search {{cost of a}} consumer who searches just once range from € 0.45, in Málga and € 0.61 in Madrid.

Similarly, for consumers who search twice the search costs <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been <b>at</b> least € 0.27 in Málaga and € 0.37 in Madrid.
