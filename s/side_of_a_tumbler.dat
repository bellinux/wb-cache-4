60|$|Care {{was taken}} that the seeds were {{thoroughly}} ripened before being gathered. Afterwards the crossed and self-fertilised seeds were {{in most cases}} placed on damp sand on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> glass <b>tumbler</b> covered by <b>a</b> glass plate, with a partition between the two lots; and the glass {{was placed on the}} chimney-piece in a warm room. I could thus observe the germination of the seeds. Sometimes a few would germinate on one side before any on the other, and these were thrown away. But as often as a pair germinated at the same time, they were planted on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pot, with a superficial partition between the two; and I thus proceeded until from half-a-dozen to a score or more seedlings of exactly the same age were planted on the opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> several pots. If one of the young seedlings became sickly or was in any way injured, it was pulled up and thrown away, as well as its antagonist on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the same pot.|$|R

50|$|The Slurpee {{machine has}} a {{separate}} spout for each flavor {{at the front}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tumbler</b> or freezer, where patrons pour their own Slurpees. When Slurpees were first introduced, the dispensing machine was located behind the counter, and the clerk was tasked with dispensing the product. Common flavors are frozen Cherry, Coke, and Mountain Dew. But new flavors are introduced regularly. In the Slurpee's early history, flavors rotated much more frequently than today. Slurpee flavors were given novelty names such as Pink Fink, Adults Only, Moonshine, Kissin' Cousin, Gully Washer, Sticky Icky, and Redeye.|$|R

By 8 July the temperature had reached over 50°C (123°F) in the shade in Baghdad and was several degrees higher in tents and dug-outs. The temperature in the direct sun was measured at 71°C (160°F). One observer noted that the Baghdadis called it [...] "the hottest season in the memory of man" [...] and commented that the extreme heat made most things too hot even to touch: [...] "The rim <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tumbler</b> burnt one's hand in a tent.

60|$|Under this process, the {{committee}} rather dwindled in importance; the Suffrage shrank; she vowed she would work harder at the Italian language; {{she thought she}} would take up the study of birds. But this program for a perfect life threatened to become so absurd that she very soon caught herself out in the evil habit, and was rehearsing her speech to {{the committee}} by the time the chestnut-colored bricks of Russell Square came in sight. Indeed, she never noticed them. She ran upstairs as usual, and was completely awakened to reality by the sight of Mrs. Seal, on the landing outside the office, inducing a very large dog to drink water out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tumbler.</b>|$|R

60|$|Rose at seven, dressed before eight, wrote letters, or did {{any little}} {{business}} till a quarter past nine. Then breakfast. Mr. Laidlaw comes from ten till one.

Then to dinner on a single plain dish and half <b>a</b> <b>tumbler,</b> or by'r lady three-fourths <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tumbler,</b> <b>of</b> whisky and water. Then sit till six o'clock, when enter Mr. Laidlaw again, and work commonly till eight. After this, work usually alone till half-past nine, then sup on porridge and milk, and so to bed. The work is half done. If any [one] asks what time I take to think on the composition, I might say, in one point of view, it was seldom five minutes {{out of my head}} the whole day. In another light, it was never the serious subject of consideration at all, for it never occupied my thoughts entirely for five minutes together, except when I was dictating to Mr. Laidlaw.|$|R

6000|$|Though it was rumoured {{all over}} London that the Duke of Omnium was dying, his Grace had been dressed and {{taken out of}} his bed-chamber into a sitting-room, when Madame Goesler was brought into his {{presence}} by Lady Glencora Palliser. He was reclining in a great arm-chair, with his legs propped up on cushions, and a respectable old lady in a black silk gown and a very smart cap was attending to his wants. The respectable old lady took her departure when the younger ladies entered the room, whispering <b>a</b> word <b>of</b> instruction to Lady Glencora as she went. [...] "His Grace should have his broth at half-past four, my lady, and a glass and <b>a</b> half <b>of</b> champagne.

50|$|Feed rate {{affects the}} {{screening}} {{performance of the}} tumbler screener as well. The amount of material presented to a screen for processing is called feed rate. It is often related to the amplitude and frequency of the vibration. When feeding to a screener in a high rate, {{the capacity of the}} screening will be pushed to a limit very fast, causing stratification. In this case, the intensity of the vibration needs to be increased to process more materials in <b>a</b> certain period <b>of</b> time. However, when feeding in a low feed rate, the efficiency of the screener will be at low state as well. The particles will stay in a loose state, which will decrease the effectiveness. Material input to <b>a</b> <b>tumbler</b> screening technique should be constant and uniform throughout the running. Otherwise, the particles will not be evenly distributed on the screen and it may cause fluctuation. And it will lead to <b>a</b> poor performance <b>of</b> the tumbler screening. Feed rate should be more constant and steady when dealing with finer particles. The common feed rate range <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tumbler</b> screening machine is 1 kg/h to 50 to/h.|$|R
60|$|The canoe {{was leaving}} the shore as he concluded, while Mabel went hurriedly and {{trembling}} to the rock that had been pointed out, talking to her companion of the danger her uncle so unnecessarily ran, while her eyes were riveted on the agile and vigorous form of Eau-douce, as he stood erect in {{the stern of the}} light boat, governing its movements. As soon, however, as she reached a point where she got <b>a</b> view <b>of</b> the fall, she gave an involuntary but suppressed scream, and covered her eyes. At the next instant, the latter were again free, and the entranced girl stood immovable as a statue, a scarcely breathing observer of all that passed. The two Indians seated themselves passively on a log, hardly looking towards the stream, while the wife of Arrowhead came near Mabel, and appeared to watch the motions of the canoe with some such interest as a child regards the leaps <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tumbler.</b>|$|R
