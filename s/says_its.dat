25|$|Other extant chronicles {{are even}} more limited in scope: they are mainly {{supplementary}} chronicles dealing with specific topics.

The surviving copy of Nidana is dated to the 18th century although the copy <b>says</b> <b>its</b> original manuscript was compiled in year 900 ME (1538/39 CE). Another chronicle called Gavampati, likely compiled between the 18th and 19th centuries, mainly covers the early (legendary) history, claiming its early monarchs' linkage to the Buddha. Another 18th century chronicle, Slatpat Rajawan Datow Smim Ron ("History of Kings"), written by a monk, was also a religion/legend-centric chronicle although it does cover secular history from Sri Ksetra and Pagan to Hanthawaddy periods. Like Gavampati, and Hmannan of the same period, Slatpat too linked its kings to the Buddha and Buddhist mythology.|$|E

[...] In Hage's opinion, [...] "'Glad Tidings' was a premonition of the future, as for the next four decades, Morrison would continue to use a song here and there to vent about the evils of the music industry and the world of celebrity." ...|$|E
