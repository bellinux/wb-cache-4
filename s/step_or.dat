5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking <b>step,</b> <b>or,</b> if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array slicing {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called <b>step</b> <b>or</b> stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the <b>step</b> <b>or</b> feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining <b>step</b> <b>or</b> intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each <b>step,</b> <b>or</b> to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E

50|$|In {{diatonic}} set theory, {{specific and}} generic intervals are distinguished. Specific intervals are the interval class or number of semitones between scale <b>steps</b> <b>or</b> collection members, and generic intervals are {{the number of}} diatonic scale <b>steps</b> (<b>or</b> staff positions) between notes of a collection or scale.|$|R
30|$|Regardless of {{the kind}} of {{scheduling}} that is employed, the number of time <b>steps</b> <b>or</b> unique discrete event times is usually independent of N. In other words, models are rarely run for more time <b>steps</b> <b>or</b> unique discrete event times because they have more agents. We thus assume that the length (i.e., time <b>steps</b> <b>or</b> slots) of each run is a constant relative to N, and therefore run length does not affect asymptotic time or space performance. We will briefly return to this assumption in a later section.|$|R
