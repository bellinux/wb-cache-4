In particular, we analyze five differential InSAR images of the Belridge Diatomite field, CA, between 11 / 98 and 12 / 99.

We have also compared the 1999 rate of surface displacement from the satellite images with the surface monument triangulations between 1942 and 1997. We have found that the maximum rate of surface subsidence has been steadily increasing from - 0. 8 ft/year in 1988 - 97 to - 1 ft/year in 1998 - 99.

40|$|The {{collapse}} {{accident of}} shallow tunnel occurred {{under construction in}} Japan, and landslides {{of the volume of}} about 6, 700 m 3 flowed into the tunnel. Geology of the collapse location is composed of 5 layers, and the upper side of the tunnel is used as field of rice. It is supposed that factors of this collapse accident were low earth covering, distribution of sandy soil layer and cohesive soil layer that are low-stiffness, and so on. However, its details are not clarified. In this paper, we try to clarify the mechanism of this collapse in modeling of ground composed of 5 layers using two dimensional DEM. In this analysis method, value of physical properties of simulation object is controlled by interparticle parameters. Then, in advance of simulation of excavation, we tried the simulation analysis of biaxial compression test by DEM, and examined the parameters that are expressible of the simulation object. Using this analytical condition, we tried to simulate excavation of the shallow tunnel, and to examine the differences of ground behavior by geological structures.

40|$|A {{computer}} software {{has been developed}} at the Faculty of Geoinformation Science and Engineering, UTM {{for the purpose of}} detecting <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> surface or manmade structure by using Visual Basic 6. 0 and FORTRAN computer languages. This software can be used for processing data from GPS and precise levelling methods. The software requires GPS baseline vectors (∆X, ∆Y, ∆Z). Relative ellipsoidal heights based on the WGS 84 ellipsoidal surface must be derived from these baseline vectors. The derived relative ellipsoidal heights are then adjusted using least square estimation method. The adjusted heights will be used for further subsidence analysis. Stransformation is used to transform results from least square estimation using minimum constraints to a selected datum. This paper examines the method of subsidence using the iterative weighted transformation. In this method, the stability of reference points must be checked through a single point test. Stable points will then be adjusted again together with object points. Lastly, the stability of object points will be determined. User of this software requires little knowledge on deformation monitoring processing, as the user needs to follow the procedure of inputting data required by the software.

40|$|What are	soluble	rocks?Soluble rocks {{dissolve}} {{leading to}} the formation of caves and cavities that may eventually collapse or act as holes into which overlying materials funnel, causing subsidence at the surface. The collapse mechanism can be natural or man-made and a major trigger is infiltration of water (e. g. by heavy rainfall, burst pipes or leaking drains). What are	the	hazards	from	soluble	rocks?One of the hazards from soluble rocks is collapse of the ground, which can range from gentle saucer-shaped depressions forming {{over a period of time}} (dolines) to sudden and catastrophic collapses (sinkholes) that may occur without warning. The largest recorded catastrophic collapses in the UK are up to 30 m across and tens of metres deep. Internationally, they can reach up to 160 m in diameter (Sierra de las Cotorras, Chiapas, Mexico) or more. Dissolution of soluble rocks can cause <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground,</b> buildings and roads plus damage to services such as water, gas and drainage. Dissolution can also cause poor ground conditions and engineering problems. The hazard can be triggered by water soaking into the ground, for example, by the presence of leaking drainage systems and soakaways. Severe subsidence can be caused by burst water mains and there is one case of subsidence being caused by the emptying of a swimming pool near to a house. The rapid transmission of water by soluble rocks means that karstic aquifers are very susceptible to pollution and contamination. What is	the	cost	to	the	UK	economy?The total cost to the UK economy from this hazard is difficult to estimate. However, based on a few reported incidents of subsidence, it is likely that damage due to soluble rocks costs in the order of 5 to 10 million pounds per year. Poor ground conditions probably cost a similar additional amount. In the Ripon area, the water-filled cave system in the thick gypsum that underlies much of the area is Overview • Soluble (or karstic) rocks in the UK host underground cavities with the potential for collapse, ranging from slight subsidence to dramatic sinkholes. • Poor foundation conditions and difficult mitigation of subsidence problems are commonly encountered in these soluble-rock areas. • Water ingress and changes in the local groundwater levels can trigger collapses in these areas. • Soluble rocks can strongly influence th...|$|E

The leveling began on benchmark NGS T- 361 located in Erath, Louisiana and the published elevation of 5. 271 feet was used for this survey. On this survey a new benchmark, HU- 18 was set on a concrete slab in the well site to observe the <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> surface. Also, benchmark No. 8 could not be found. A two hour search was made with no results. At this leveling {{it was noted that}} an error was made. A metric D. E. was used for the well head elevation instead of feet. This error has been corrected in this report...|$|R
50|$|For {{the main}} part seismically {{generated}} landslides usually do not differ in their morphology and internal processes from those generated under non-seismic conditions. However, {{they tend to be}} more widespread and sudden. The most abundant types of earthquake-induced landslides are rock falls and slides of rock fragments that form on steep slopes. However, almost every other type of landslide is possible, including highly disaggregated and fast-moving falls; more coherent and slower-moving slumps, block slides, and earth slides; and lateral spreads and flows that involve partly to completely liquefied material (Keefer, 1999). Rock falls, disrupted rock slides, and disrupted slides of earth and debris are the most abundant types of earthquake-induced landslides, whereas earth flows, debris flows, and avalanches of rock, earth, or debris typically transport material the farthest. There is one type of landslide that is essential uniquely limited to earthquakes - liquefaction failure, which can cause fissuring or <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ground.</b> Liquefaction involves the temporary loss of strength of sands and silts which behave as viscous fluids rather than as soils. This can have devastating effects during large earthquakes.|$|R
40|$|Basing on {{researches}} conducted from 1956 to 1958, theA. {{completed in}} May 1959 a comprehensive study about the phenomenaof subsidence occurring {{at the time}} in the region of the Po delta. In itsconclusion, the study indicated the prove necessity to close down thethousands of wells for the extraction of methaniferous waters, to whichnearly all the enormous <b>subsidences</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> observed in the Deltawere to be imputed. To substantiate his conclusions, the A. resumed &mdash;in two appendices &mdash; the course of two (among many) phenomena of abnormalsubsidences observed over the globe, and undoubtedly induced byanalogous causes. Now, nine years after their redaction and convinced of the soundnessand actuality of the conclusions reached, the A. esteemed appropriate tohave these studies published; he introduces them by a " premise " and addsa sequel drawing convenient comparisons, from which issues clearly thewarning against the consequences of proposed and, partly, already developing,indiscriminate extractions of water or natural gases in vast zones ofthe upper Adriatic. The latest course of events in the Venice regionconstitutes by itself a motivated alarm already...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the recent stage of the {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> surface in Tokyo, the heights of more than 300 bench-marks distributed in Tokyo were measured by level in 1942, and their vertical displacements during 1940 - 1942 were worked out. Comparing the recent results with those measured in 1940, it was noticed that the region where the ground surface had subsided conspicuously seemed to have migrated eastwards. The variation in the <b>subsidence</b> velocity <b>of</b> several bench-marks were also studied. The subsidence velocity seems to vary as given by a following simple expression u=u_ 0 c^ for t_ 0 >t, u=u_ 0 e^-h(t-t_ 0) > for t>t_ 0, rather than that as given by u=u_ 0 e^ which was adopted in the previous reports as an appropriate expression for the variation <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> velocity. The values of constants u_ 0 and h for various bench-marks were obtained. The expressions <b>of</b> the <b>subsidence</b> velocity as cited above are given tentatively for convenience's sake in estimating the amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidence.</b> The formal difference in the mathematical expressions {{between the two is}} not essential. In boring in Koto region, the percussion number for every lm decent of the boring head was counted which may represent approximately the compactness of the soil layers. This fact may lead {{to the conclusion that the}} measured vertical displacements are due to the integrated effect of the shrinkage of layers of soft soil intervening the layers of relatively hard soil...|$|R
40|$|An active {{sequence}} of earthquakes (foreshock, main-shock, and aftershocks) hit the Kumamoto area (Japan) in April 2016, resulting in 69 deaths and considerable economic loss. The earthquakes induced numerous ground failures and cascading geo-hazards, causing major damage to important infrastructures. The main damage patterns include: (a) surface rupture with widespread <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the surface <b>ground,</b> resulting in damage and disruption to transport infrastructure; (b) landslide and slope failure of mountains causing severe damage, collapse and near-collapse of bridges; and (c) liquefaction {{in some areas}} of Kumamoto City. Following the earthquakes, field surveys were conducted to study the damages and to understand the main cause of the observed failures. This technical note provides a summary of the geotechnical and infrastructural damage in Kumamoto and the lessons learnt and future research needs are also highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Published online 27 June 2006 Earth’s largest calderas form as {{the ground}} collapses during immense {{volcanic}} eruptions, when hundreds to thousands of cubic kilometres of magma are explosively withdrawn from the Earth’s crust {{over a period of}} days to weeks. Continuing long after such great eruptions, the resulting calderas often exhibit pronounced unrest, with frequent earthquakes, alternating uplift and <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ground,</b> and considerable heat and mass flux. Because many active and extinct calderas show evidence for repetition of large eruptions, such systems demand detailed scientific study and monitoring. Two calderas in North America, Yellowstone (Wyoming) and Long Valley (California), are in areas of youthful tectonic complexity. Scientists strive to understand the signals generated when tectonic, volcanic and hydrothermal (hot ground water) processes intersect. One obstacle to accurate forecasting of large volcanic events is humanity’s lack of familiarity with the signals leading up to the largest class of volcanic eruptions. Accordingly, {{it may be difficult to}} recognize the difference between smaller and larger eruptions. To prepare ourselves and society, scientists must scrutinize a spectrum of volcanic signals and assess the many factors contributing to unrest and toward diverse modes of eruption...|$|R
5000|$|The Winsford Flashes are the town's {{most notable}} {{geographical}} feature. In referring {{to them as}} the [...] "Cheshire Broads", a comparison is made with the better-known Norfolk Broads. [...] "Flash" [...] is an English dialect word for [...] "lake", with a regional distribution centred on the north-west counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. The Winsford Flashes (Top Flash, Middle Flash, and Bottom Flash, the largest) are three lakes along {{the course of the}} River Weaver, extending over some 200 acres (80 hectares). They formed in the 19th century (cartographical evidence dates their formation to between 1845 and 1872), due to the <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>ground</b> into underground voids. The voids were largely the result of brine extraction, in which rock salt deposits were dissolved and washed out by water. As the ground slumped into the voids, the River Weaver widened at each point, until lakes were made where arable land had once been. From the late 19th century, Winsford Flashes became popular with working class day-trippers from the nearby industrial centres of Manchester and the Staffordshire Potteries. Visitors came in large numbers for a day's leisure boating, picknicking, and sightseeing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{embankment}} was {{encircled by}} a tell-tale pattern of dips and hollows indicating a history <b>of</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Shaky <b>ground</b> had already caused concerns, requiring trains to be ‘slowed’ before crossing a nearby bridge. Extra ballasting had been necessary {{and the two}} main lines, as well as having normal crossways sleepers also rested on longitudinal baulks of timber. A field below the embankment had a 70 ft by 30 ft hollow nearly ten feet deep, and a nearby farmhouse had been abandoned because <b>of</b> <b>subsidence.</b> There were two levels of mine workings beneath the railway. The uppermost had not been used for some time, but miners in the lower level claimed they could hear trains above their heads and had already predicted a [...] "big spill" [...] someday.|$|R
