40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall {{introduce}} a new electronic payment concept based on the popular direct debit payment model, entitled periodical payments. The direct debit model currently in use online is neither secure nor flexible, and requires {{a leap of faith}} by the customer who must trust the merchant to behave honestly. Electronic direct debit request (DDR) forms are not signed by both parties in a binding manner, which means that merchants can change the terms of DDR agreements post-fact. Unsigned DDR agreements give the merchant unprecedented power over customer accounts with little recourse for dispute. In this paper we shall demonstrate how the use of restricted proxy certificates with cryptographic signatures can be adopted to support a new periodical payment model. A payment policy language is presented that is tailored towards specifying rules that govern precisely how and when merchants can access and transfer funds from customer accounts into their own. Using this model will ensure that mutually signed policies are instantly enforceable on every transaction within a payment period. There is a fundamental difference between this proposal and other electronic payment schemes. Most such schemes attempt to replicate the features of physical cash such as anonymity, and therefore focus on <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> that simulate cash changing hands. Since direct debit is a popular payment choice, our proposal provides significant improvement to this essentially paper-based payment model that currently does not integrate well in a purely electronic world...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new electronic payment framework {{that is based}} on the direct debit payment model currently used both of-line and via the Internet. The strength of the direct debit model is its fexibility in allowing customers to defer payments for goods and services until a later date. This fexibility also extends to merchants who can process consumer payments without any customer intervention thus making payment collections a faster and more effient business function. The current direct debit solutions used online are neither secure nor fexible and demand a "leap of faith" from customers who must trust merchants to behave honestly. Unlike its off-line counterparts that always use signed direct debit request (DDR) forms as legally binding contracts, online direct debit systems rarely require signatures (for example when using credit cards). As such, in most cases it is possible for merchants to change the terms of original debit agreements post-fact allowing them to arbitrarily charge customer accounts. Unsigned DDR agreements give merchants unprecedented power over customer accounts with little recourse for dispute. The aim of this thesis is to present a high-level architectural design and a first working prototype of a periodical payment application that addresses issues inherent in Internet direct debit payments. It takes a novel approach for securing electronic payments by using X. 509 restricted proxy certifcates over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation services. To assure success of this proposal only currently available, standards compliant and industry supported technologies were utilised with emphasis placed on Web Services and related technologies such as, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). The concept of electronic payments is hardly new and there is a signifcant amount of interest in improving its security model, most notably from Visa and MasterCard. Current applications, however, focus on <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> ignoring the growing trend favouring periodical payments. The framework presented in this thesis attempts to fill a niche by delivering signifcant improvements to an essentially paper-based direct debit payment model that currently does not integrate well into a purely electronic environment...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} based on an {{analysis}} of the practicability and the effect of different models for allocating costs of journal and other digital information licences between HEIs where journal collections or other information products have been licensed by a "bloc" of institutions for a single all-in price – the so-called "Big Deal". This type of transaction is contemplated for core resources that have widespread application in HE. It can operate at a national level, or on a regional basis, or for groups of academic libraries with a common interest in a particular discipline. The report draws on two studies: Activities, costs and funding flows in the scholarly communications system in the UK, Research information Network, London, 2008 (referred to as the ‘CEPA Report), and Review of the Costs and Benefits of <b>Single</b> <b>Payment</b> Arrangements for Jisc/NESLi 2 Licences, Jisc Collections, London, 2009, referred to as the ‘Single Payment Report’ Both reports point to the benefits of moving to a digital journal environment in which online-only journal lists are licensed from publishers (and print versions discontinued) and paid for in a <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> and in which significant reductions in library operating costs are achievable...|$|R
30|$|As {{stated in}} [5, 10], the {{integration}} of payments in SIP can suppose several advantages over AAA-based mechanisms. First, the use of simpler pricing models that avoid the complexity of AAA protocols [5, 10], which are less efficient for real-time and high available services [10]. Second, the support of different payment models. Third, scalability {{because there is no}} need to establish a direct trust-relationship between the client and the vendor. Furthermore, as there is no direct relationship, the risk can be an acceptable to the client, since the amount of money at risk is limited [5]. Finally, it overcomes the high costs of traditional payment mechanisms that may be suitable for a <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> during a <b>transaction</b> but not when low value payments have to be made or when the payment has to be made with a negligible delay.|$|R

40|$|With the {{conventional}} POS <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> method, vendors {{are bound to}} a payment institute in their region and can only use relatively expensive dedicated or slow dial-up lines to their financial institute. This paper report covers the work to produce an architecture and a prototype that supports Point of Sales terminal payments over the Internet through web services. With the use of web services for <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> vendors will get more freedom to choosing their provider and the services they take without having to throw away their legacy applications. Given the globalization of the economy, vendors can negotiate about services and fees with payment providers all over the world. Literature research and the prototype tests and evaluation in this project shows that transactions fees and performance of POS terminal <b>payments</b> <b>transactions</b> trough web services can be competitive to conventional <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> methods and create flexibility for vendors POS terminal application.

40|$|Performing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> {{over the}} Internet is {{becoming}} increasingly important. Whenever one interacts with others, he or she faces the problem of uncertainty because in interacting with others, one makes him or herself vulnerable, i. e. one can be betrayed. Thus, perceived risk and confidence are of fundamental importance in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> A higher risk leads to greater hesitance about entering into a business relationship {{with a high degree}} of uncertainty; and therefore, to an increased need for confidence. This paper has two objectives. First, it aims to introduce and test a theoretical model that predicts consumer and merchant acceptance of the Internet payment solution by explaining the complex set of relationships among the key factors influencing confidence in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> Second, the paper attempts to shed light on the complex interrelationship among confidence, control and perceived risk. An empirical study was conducted to test the proposed model using data from consumers and merchants in Slovenia. The results show how perceived risk dimensions and post-transaction control influence consumer’s and merchant’s confidence in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> and the impact of confidence on the adoption of mass-market on-line payment solutions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, NFC {{technology}} {{is used in}} contactless payment applications by offering the NFC payment functionality in credit/debit cards, smartphones and payment terminals. Thus, an NFC <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> is executed in a simple and practical way. EMV is the security protocol for both contact and contactless payment systems. However, during an EMV <b>payment</b> <b>transaction,</b> this standard does not ensure two main security constraints between a customer payment device and a payment terminal: (1) mutual authentication, (2) confidentiality of sensitive banking data exchanged. These weaknesses represent a major risk {{in the case of}} NFC <b>payment</b> because the <b>transaction</b> is performed using NFC radio waves in an open environment. The risk is reduced in the case of contact <b>payment</b> because the <b>transaction</b> is executed in a closed environment by inserting the card into the terminal. In this paper, we propose a new security protocol for NFC <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> based on a Cloud infrastructure.

40|$|V magistrskem delu sta predstavljena plačilni promet ter projekt SEPA v Evropi in Sloveniji. Opisane so celovite informacijske rešitve (ERP) in predstavljeno je razvojno okolje Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Kot glavni cilj magistrskega dela je bila izdelana programska rešitev za plačilni promet v Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Rešitev omogoča plačevanje ter izvoz in uvoz plačil, ki jih uporabljajo banke v Sloveniji in Evropi. Na osnovi testiranja izdelanega plačilnega modula je bila potrjena hipoteza, da Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 s privzetimi moduli ni primeren za izvajanje plačilnega prometa v Sloveniji, in zavrnjena hipoteza, da izdelana rešitev v Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, narejena za Slovenijo, ni primerna za izvajanje plačilnega prometa v drugih državah Evrope. Predstavljeni so rezultati SWOT-analize plačilnega prometa v starejši različici Microsoft Dynamics NAV 5. 00 in v različici Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, iz katerih je razvidno, da je plačilni promet v novi različici veliko bolj konkurenčen in cenovno bolj ugoden od prejšnje različice. V zaključku dela so opisani pogoji za njegovo uvedbo in možnosti za nadaljnje delo. This Master’s thesis {{presents}} <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> the SEPA project, and {{the implementation}} of SEPA in Slovenia.

The main goal of the thesis {{is to develop a}} software solution for executing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Such a solution enables payments, as well as the export and import of payments used by banks in Slovenia and Europe. The testing of the produced payment module confirmed the hypothesis claiming that Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 with its default modules is not suitable for executing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in Slovenia, and rejected the hypothesis that the solution produced in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, which is to be used in Slovenia, is not suitable for executing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in other European countries.
