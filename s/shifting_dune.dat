40|$|Abstract: The Ghadames Basin {{is a large}} intra-cratonic basin, {{covering}} {{portions of}} Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. The three countries are independently conducting petroleum exploration in their portions of the basin, using different play concepts and consequently obtaining dif-ferent exploration results. This paper presents the first published basin-wide view ofpetro-leum stratigraphy and play types. Some 700 exploratory wells have been drilled in the basin, resulting in the discovery of at least 150 oil pools with 9500 MMBO (million barrels of oil) in place. Most wells were located in the structurally higher parts of the basin, with deeper portions being less explored because of <b>shifting</b> <b>dune</b> conditions and an expectation of reservoir thinning into the basin centre. Silurian and Devonian source rocks occur across {{large parts of the}} basin and have generated volumes of hydrocarbon orders of magni-tude above those discovered. The numerous structural phases (Taconic, Caledonian, Hercy-nian and Austrian) that have affected the basin have had important implications for depocentre migration, structural style, and for patterns of trap formation, alteration and destruction. The erosion pattern and topography developed on the Hercynian unconformity is a key control on petroleum systems within the basin, controlling the preservation o...|$|E

40|$|Shrub shelterbelt is an {{important}} element of man-made oasis ecosystems in arid northwestern China, where the ecological environment is fragile and blown sand is a serious hazard (Evans and Thames 1981, Zhang 1999). In the most part of the Hexi Corridor of China, surface and ground-water resources are often either unavailable or too saline and brackish for irrigation. Precipitation is the major water source for plant growth. Annual precipitation in this region ranges from 183. 6 to 157. 3 mm, with 70 % falling between June and September. Water availability is a crucial factor in the establishment of oasis ecosystems (Evans and Thames 1981, Zhang 1999). Furthermore, most sandy soils in this region have low wa-ter- and nutrient-retention capacities (Tao and Ren 2004, Zhou et al. 2007). Loss of water and nutrients from soil also influences revegetation process (Guo et al. 2007). Caragana korshinskii is a drought resistant shrub widely used for vegetation rehabilitation in arid regions of China as: (i) it facilitates transi-tion from <b>shifting</b> <b>dune</b> to sandy grassland; (ii) it helps restore soil nutrients by fixing atmospheric nitrogen; (iii) it can form shrub shelterbelts for farmland or artificial grassland; and (iv) it can serve as a supplementary source for livestock (Hansson et al. 1995). Due to scarce precipitation and dry climate, the establishment and growth of C. korshinskii is often impaired by water short-age (Li et al. 2006).

40|$|We {{studied the}} spatial {{organisation}} of an ensemble (phylogenetically bounded {{group of species}} that use a similar set of resources within a community) of tenebrionid beetles in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune ecosystem in Southern Italy (Molise region). Within a transect from the seashore to the inner dune, we identified four biotopes defined by different vegetation types. We found a community dominated by few sand specialised and r-selected tenebrionid species. Overall tenebrionid abundance was lowest on the upper beach, highest on the embryonic <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> and then from there declined further inland. The embryonic <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> biotope showed the highest diversity and the lowest dominance. This pattern suggests that tenebrionid beetels are {{able to cope with}} the challenging salty and xerothermic conditions of the seaward margin. Although some species were too rare to assess their biotope preference, our data support that, at least some, were distributed with different abundance over the four dune biotopes. These differences are likely related to different preferences for different characteristics of substratum and detritus...|$|R
40|$|Cutandia maritima is a circum-Mediterranean {{species that}} inhabits sandy dunes {{along the coast}} line. It is fairly {{frequent}} on the western Adriatic coast but fairly rare and possibly even non-native in the east. In Croatia, it was discovered in 1990 in Crnika Bay {{on the island of}} Rab, which was considered until 2005 to be the only site on the eastern Adriatic coast from the Gulf of Trieste in the north to Corfu in the south. In 2009, the species was briefly reported for Velika plaža (Long Beach) in Ulcinj (Montenegro) but without details about the habitat type and synecology. The aim of this paper is thus to provide a deeper insight into the ecology and synecology of C. maritima in the eastern Adriatic part of the distribution area. On Velika plaža in Ulcinj, the species was found along the whole sea-inland gradient of sand dunes, in various types of vegetation: [1210] - annual vegetation of drift lines, [2110] - embryonic <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes,</b> [2120] - <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> with Ammophila arenaria (white dunes), [2220] - dunes with Euphorbia terracina, [2130 *] - fixed coastal dunes with herbaceous vegetation (grey dunes), and also [2190] - humid dune slacks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} the Atlantic and Mediterranean beach and foredune habitats of European interest, focusing on floristic, structural and ecological features. We selected two representative sites of Atlantic (The Netherlands) and Mediterranean (Italy) coastal dunes. From a georeferenced vegetation database, samples of: (a) annual vegetation on drift lines (European Union habitat type 1210), (b) embryonic <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> (2110), and (c) <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> {{along the shoreline}} with Ammophila arenaria (2120), were selected. Floristic representativity and comparability of plot sizes were considered. For each habitat, the frequency and the fidelity of the species, the life form frequency spectra and Ellenberg ecological indicator values were assessed. We found a consistent floristic differentiation between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coastal dune habitats and only a small set of shared species. The Italian and the Dutch annual vegetation of drift lines (1210) register a high structural similarity that strongly declines landwards. Floristic composition, life forms and Ellenberg indicator values show higher similarities among different foredune habitats of the same site than between homologous habitats of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The results confirm the current description and distribution of the habitat of European interest annual vegetation of drift lines (1210). On the other hand, the floristic, structural and ecological differences between the Atlantic and the Mediterranea...|$|R

40|$|Sandy beaches {{surrounding}} the Molise coast, facing to the Adriatic sea, are relatively well preserved {{if compared with}} other Italian littorals. In this study we present the results from a short term monitoring analyses of coastal habitats (six/eight-years) using permanent transects {{as part of the}} LTER network (Long Term Ecological Research-Italy). Vegetation monitoring was carried out along 4 belt transects along the beach-inland ecological gradient, following the coastal zonation and ranging from pioneer annual communities on the beach to Mediterranean scrubs on fixed dunes. Plant communities were sampled in contiguous 1 m x 1 m plots using a 1 - 10 ordinal transform scale to estimates the species' cover-abundance. All transects were conducted in sites subjected to a similar touristic pressure. Through cluster analysis we identified 5 Habitats of community interest: Annual vegetation of drift lines (Habitat 1210), Embryonic <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> (Habitat 2110), <b>Shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria (Habitat 2120), Malcolmietalia dune grasslands (Habitat 2230) and Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. (Habitat 2250). Main temporal changes were probably related to different erosion/accretion processes acting in each transect: two transects were relatively stable (without evident coastal erosion nor accretion processes), one suffered a strong retreat while the last transect showed a slight accretion process. Moreover, our study evidences that, as coastal plant communities are highly dynamic systems, even relatively short time periods could offer useful insights of annual vegetation trends...|$|R

50|$|In {{northern}} Jutland in the 16th and 17th centuries <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> were {{a problem}} for the population: huge dunes, some stretching up to 7 km (4 mi) inland, drove them back from the coastal areas, but in the 19th century the government acted to alleviate the problem. The Sand Drift Act of 1857 allowed the state to buy or expropriate areas of sand drift, and a further Act in 1857 allowed the purchase of areas adjacent to the drifts. Dune grasses and conifers were planted to stabilize the sands and these plantations became common after 1880. Although barren, the dune zone allowed limited sheep farming and some inshore fishing. By the 1950s the dune drifts were under control.|$|R
40|$|Aim Biogeographical {{patterns}} in metacommunities are still poorly understood, and different processes {{are expected to}} occur in different habitats. We analysed the regional plant metacommunities of coastal habitats to test whether (1) the influence of space and climate differs between two habitats differentiated along the seashore–inland gradient, and (2) regional variation in species composition of these habitats can be ascribed to different metacommunity paradigms. Location The entire coast of the Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe. Methods We collected data on the plant species composition of coastal sites on sand dunes across 3000 km of coastline. The sites were classified into two habitats corresponding to shifting and stable sand dunes, and divided into three distinct geographical regions: Cantabrian, Atlantic and Mediterranean. We assessed the geographical structure of the species composition using ordination, estimates of species turnover and spatial autocorrelation. We then used multivariate models and variation partitioning to test the influence of climatic and spatial effects. Analyses were conducted for the whole data set and the geographical subsets. Results Metacommunities from <b>shifting</b> and stable <b>dunes</b> showed similar spa- tial patterns, with the highest species turnover occurring in the Mediterranean region. Similarities between communities that were nearer each other (typically < 100 km) were weaker in shifting than in stable dunes, although the distance decay for sites that were further apart was similar in both habitats. Variation in species composition in <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> was mainly explained by distance and climate, while in stable dunes the effect of climate was clearly dominant. The observed differences were relatively consistent across geographical regions. Main conclusions Distinct processes structure the metacommunities in two dune habitats differentiated along the seashore–inland gradient. Communities of <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> seem to be structured by an interplay of neutral or patch-dynamic processes {{and to a lesser}} degree by species sorting. In contrast, communities of stable dunes are mainly governed by species sorting in response to climatic gradi- ents. These results highlight the importance of differentiating habitats according to local ecological factors when analysing regional {{patterns in}} metacommunities...|$|R

50|$|The {{soil of the}} Thar Desert in India remains dry {{for much}} of the year and is prone to wind erosion.

A permanent solution to this problem of <b>shifting</b> sand <b>dunes</b> can be provided by planting appropriate species on the dunes to prevent further shifting and planting windbreaks and shelterbelts.
