5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which {{was followed by}} a <b>short</b> <b>run.</b> On third down, Vick prepared to throw the ball, but he was hit by Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled. Following the turnover, Dantzler was stopped on a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> then threw two incomplete passes. Rather than again attempt to convert a fourth down, Bowden sent in kicker Aaron Hunt to attempt a 28-yard field goal. The kick soared through the uprights, and Clemson narrowed Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 5:45 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|A {{continuation}} for syndication premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as Super Sloppy Double Dare on January 22, 1989. The {{program also}} had a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> on Fox as Family Double Dare, airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued Family Double Dare, premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. A later revival, hosted by Jason Harris and titled Double Dare 2000, aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000.|$|E

50|$|As a result, rosters {{were often}} written with {{specific}} sets in mind; the VSH and FLH sets could be grouped into {{a fleet of}} five sets for the longer runs, and the FSH sets for the <b>shorter</b> <b>runs.</b> The SH sets were either run individually on the <b>shortest</b> <b>runs,</b> or in pairs on the longest.|$|R
5|$|Tech's offense {{took the}} field at their 20-yard line with 1:53 {{remaining}} in the game, two timeouts left (used to stop the clock as necessary), and needing at least a field goal to win the game. Tech picked up one first down via a pass, then another as the Hokies drove to their 44-yard line. Stopped short of midfield {{with less than a}} minute to play, Tech called its second timeout in order to stop the game clock from ticking down. In college football, the clock stops after a team earns a first down, and because Virginia Tech had not earned a first down on the <b>short</b> <b>run,</b> Tech was forced to call the timeout. Following the timeout, the Hokies ran for a first down, penetrating to the NC State 44-yard line. With 53seconds remaining, Chapman scrambled out of bounds on a <b>short</b> <b>run.</b> Another <b>short</b> <b>run</b> brought the Hokies to the State 36-yard line, and the Hokies called their final timeout to stop the clock. A few plays later, Tech ran a short running play that kept the clock running down. With just 33seconds remaining and no other way to stop the clock, Tech's Maurice Williams questionably stayed down with a leg cramp and the referees stopped the clock to allow the injured player to receive assistance from athletic trainers before the next play. Facing fourth down and needing three yards for drive-continuing first down, Chapman passed for a first down at the State 29-yard line with 15seconds remaining in the game. On the game's next play, Tech committed a holding penalty, which pushed the Hokies 10yards further away from the end zone, out of field goal range, with 11seconds remaining.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Bow Street changed after {{the construction of}} the nearby Covent Garden Theatre {{to the west of the}} street in 1809. Only a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> of buildings from No.35 to Russell Street remain on their original sites; the rest having been given up for large buildings. During the 19th century, Bow Street was a de facto extension of Covent Garden and its associated markets, selling then-exotic fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> up and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E

5|$|To {{counter the}} power of Saavedra, Moreno sought to modify the {{military}} balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, in the <b>short</b> <b>run</b> this measure worked against him, as it antagonised {{members of the military}} who got promoted precisely because of such rules.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Druckenmiller got Virginia Tech's drive {{started with}} a first-down pass to the Tech 42-yard line. After a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> by Edmonds, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, setting up a third-and-seven for Virginia Tech's offense. During the third-down play, wide receiver Bryan Still broke free of the Texas defense and caught a 55-yard pass from Druckenmiller for Tech's second offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and Tech took a 2110 lead with 12:28 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the <b>short</b> <b>run,</b> but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E

5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked {{to be released from}} the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively <b>short</b> <b>run</b> of nine months, {{for the first time in}} the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge â€“ a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the Tech kickoff {{and returned it}} to their 23-yard line. After an incomplete pass from Rix, Virginia Tech's defense was caught offsides, resulting in a five-yard gain for Florida State. A <b>short</b> <b>run</b> after the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's defense, and the Hokies began their second possession {{of the second half}} at the State 31-yard line. Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position, however. Noel threw an incomplete pass, was sacked, then threw a pass for a loss of yardage. Tech punted the ball, which was downed at the Florida State 12-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a first down at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a first down at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E
5000|$|In waterfalls, the run (also {{known as}} the runout) is the linear {{distance}} the stream flows {{from the brink of}} the waterfall to its base. Therefore, a steeper waterfall would have a <b>shorter</b> <b>run,</b> and a less inclined waterfall would have a longer run. As an example, rapids typically have longer runs, as their actual drop is usually much shorter than the distance they flow. Vertical waterfalls, such as Yosemite Falls, have <b>short</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled after only a <b>short</b> <b>run,</b> Newman took Hendry as the star, {{and some of the}} ethos of the programme, to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E
5|$|In July 1912, Barrymore went to Los Angeles, {{where he}} {{appeared}} in three short-running plays at the Belasco Theatre. He returned to New York in October, where he took the lead role in 72 performances of the comedy The Affairs of Anatol at the Little Theatre. Although the critical response was lukewarm, Barrymore's salary for the play was $600 a week. He began the following year by appearing in a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> of A Thief for a Night in McVicker's Theatre, Chicago, before returning to New York, and the Thirty-Ninth St. Theatre, for a two-month run in Believe Me Xantippe.|$|E

After a successful extra point the blue and orange extended their lead to 20â€“12. Alabama responded on their following possession with a 30-yard William Little touchdown run and Kyser extra point to cut the lead to 20â€“18. Thomas Daniels then scored Auburn's final two touchdowns on runs of one and 25 yards and also converted both extra points {{to give them a}} 32â€“18 lead. Smith scored the final points of the game late in the second half for Alabama on a <b>short</b> <b>run</b> that made the final score 32â€“22.|$|E

5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first downs and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another <b>short</b> <b>run,</b> however, he was tackled behind {{the line of scrimmage}} and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points of the game and gave Boston College a 70 lead with 4minutes remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its <b>short</b> <b>run,</b> it was {{broadcast}} on the Big Three television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while others found it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E
5|$|With 11:23 {{remaining}} in the first half, Florida State returned the kick to its 18-yard line and began its first full possession of the second quarter. After a running play was stopped for no gain, Florida State gained a first down on a short pass and a <b>short</b> <b>run.</b> After a 10-yard holding penalty against the Seminoles, Rix scrambled for eight yards and completed a 19-yard pass for a first down at the 50-yard line. After Rix gained five yards on another scramble, he threw two incomplete passes and the Seminoles punted. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Tech's offense began a drive at its 20-yard line with 7:43 {{remaining in}} the first quarter.|$|E
