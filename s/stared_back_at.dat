Layden verbally abused Strom so he could get ejected from the game. Strom knew {{what he was trying to}} do, and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, [...] "I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay out here and watch this shit, so do you". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, [...] "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring to the fact that the Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1. Strom <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Auerbach and said, [...] "Arnold, you're showing all the class I knew you always had." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{all stood}} looking {{at me as if}} they was waiting for something. I folded my arms--tight--and <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 'em.|$|E

50|$|O Zhang {{photographs}} small Chinese {{girls as}} they crouch down and <b>stare</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the camera. Dominating {{the frame and}} the spectator, Zhang's little subjects offer oddly sinister and uncomprehending expressions. The West's self-conscious fascination with contemporary China reverberates through Zhang’s portraits, which co-opt the brand-logo myth of childhood innocence and global harmony, making her endearing subjects alien, monstrous and threatening.|$|R
60|$|She panted up the hill, and as {{she went}} she paused ever and again, to rest her bundle and get her breath and <b>stare</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the little cottage beside the pine-wood below. And when at last, when she was near {{the crest of the}} hill, she saw afar off three several wasps {{dropping}} heavily westward, it helped her greatly on her way.|$|R

60|$|With {{her head}} bowed down, cowering like a sulky animal, {{she looked at}} him under her brows. He <b>stared</b> {{fiercely}} <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her, but beneath her steady, glowering gaze he shrank, then turned aside.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her, {{until his}} plump pink face was all consternation. He was {{extraordinarily}} distressed. It {{was as if}} a thousand unspoken things had been said between them.|$|E

The teaser showed Batman in his armored Batsuit atop a building one rainy night in Gotham. Batman removes a sheet to reveal the Bat-Signal and proceeds to turn it on. From there audience are shown the projected image of the Batman logo in the sky until a figure appears out of nowhere in its place. A close up on the figure reveals it is Superman glaring down at Batman readying his heat vision, as Batman <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the Man of Steel.|$|R
40|$|The causal {{powers that}} I have, {{such as the}} ability to go to the store for cold beer, for {{instance}} are the same causal powers as those had by the human animal closely associated with me. That is, the biological organism that invariably <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me, whenever I look in the mirror. Thus, if I want to avoid gratuitous causal overdetermination – i. e. if I want to avoid positing two separate individuals with identical, and thus redundant, causal powers – as I justifiably do, then I should adopt animalism. That is, the view that I have the same persistence conditions as those had by a biological organism...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} is Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous author {{in his early}} fifties who has recently been ennobled {{in honor of his}} artistic achievement (thus acquiring the aristocratic [...] "von" [...] in his name). He is a man dedicated to his art, disciplined and ascetic to the point of severity, who was widowed at a young age. As the story opens, he is strolling outside a cemetery and sees a coarse-looking red-haired foreigner who <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him belligerently. Aschenbach walks away, embarrassed but curiously stimulated. He has a vision of a primordial swamp-wilderness, fertile, exotic and full of lurking danger. Soon afterwards, he resolves to take a holiday.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{an end of}} Sharkey!" [...] {{cried the}} captain; and the crew took up the cry as they {{gathered}} in little knots upon the deck and <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the low, purple line of the vanishing land.|$|E
60|$|George and Edith came in, and {{she told}} them, hurling contemptuous sarcasms at her husband. He sat looking at them with his pained, unhappy eyes, while they <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{him as if he}} were some despicable, noxious beast.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] In {{a wonder}} greater than his own, Lord Willoughby <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. At last: [...] "I am {{alluding}} to His Majesty King William III--William of Orange--who, with Queen Mary, has been ruling England {{for two months}} and more." ...|$|E
50|$|A year later, Eve is {{a shining}} Broadway star headed for Hollywood. At an awards banquet, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd and Karen with {{characteristic}} effusion, while all four <b>stare</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her coldly. Eve skips {{a party in}} her honor, and returns home alone, where she encounters Phoebe (Barbara Bates)—a high-school-aged fan—who has slipped into her apartment and fallen asleep. The young girl professes her adoration and begins at once to insinuate herself into Eve's life, offering to pack Eve's trunk for Hollywood. While Eve rests in the other room, Phoebe dons Eve's elegant costume robe and poses {{in front of a}} multi-paned mirror, holding the award {{as if it were a}} crown.|$|R

[...] Harry replies that Annie is {{at the hospital and}} will be all right. Cooper gets up out of bed, announcing he needs to brush his teeth. In the bathroom, Cooper begins to put toothpaste on a brush, but then squeezes the tube's contents into the sink. He rams his head into the bathroom mirror. Bob <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him from the shattered mirror. Harry and Doc knock on the door, concerned. As blood drips from his forehead, Cooper repeats in a mocking tone, [...] "How's Annie?" [...] and laughs maniacally.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, Alice and Adam see {{one another}} again {{on either side}} of an {{escalator}} - she's going down and he's riding up. They both watch each other as they pass without saying anything. Adam stops at the top and turns to <b>stare</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Alice before walking away. The film ends with Alice's voiceover recalling the events in posterity and wondering what might have happened had fate not led her to Adam one morning. She wonders if the passion between them could ever have lasted, and if a [...] "flatlander" [...] like her could ever have stayed at such a high altitude [...] At least that's what she tells herself anyway.|$|R
60|$|Jean Coulois said nothing. Then {{very slowly}} {{from the inside}} pocket of his coat he drew a {{newspaper}} parcel. It was long and narrow, and in places there was a stain upon the paper. Selingman stared at it and <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Jean Coulois.|$|E
60|$|I {{pulled up}} my pony {{and stared at}} her, feeling very shy and {{not knowing what to}} say. For a while she <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me, being afflicted, presumably, with the same complaint, then spoke with an effort, in a voice that was very soft and pleasant.|$|E
60|$|As she spoke, Miss Plenty looked up, almost apprehensively, {{at one of}} the wooden-faced old portraits {{with which}} her room was hung, as if asking pardon of the severe-nosed matron who <b>stared</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her from under the sort of blue dish cover which formed her headgear.|$|E

Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her". Terrifying eyes <b>stare</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki says that this is because [...] "Freyja" [...] has not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.|$|R
