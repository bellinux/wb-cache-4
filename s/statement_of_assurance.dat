40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to gain some {{understanding}} of the way the European Court of Auditors (ECA) assesses European Union (EU) member states’ performances in managing EU finances. To this end the ECA's annual reports for 1996 – 2001 have been analysed. We find that the information provided in the ECA annual reports is somewhat unsystematic, which is the result of the ECA's approach to auditing and its working methods. A review of the literature, as well as our own empirical analysis, allows us to conclude that the ECA does not in fact live up to its own mission of providing relevant, objective reports. Our analysis suggests, for instance, that there is some ambiguity within the ECA due to differences in audit traditions within the EU. Improvements could be made by reducing the number of ECA members to three or five, by (further) integrating the traditional ECA audit and the audit within the framework of the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>assurance,</b> and by further integrating internal and external budgetary control within the EU. ...|$|E

After a short presentation of the Court's historical background, there is an examination of this institution's structure. Provisions regarding its Members, Personnel and Internal Organisation are analysed {{in an attempt to}} assess the Court’s structural framework An analysis of the Court's mission, namely to examine all the accounts (revenue/expenditure) of the Communities and of all bodies set up or simply financed by them, is next. The analysis focuses on the audit regarding the regularity/legality of the transactions and the soundness of the financial management. The method used for these audits, called the "systems based approach" is presented and explained. The reporting activities of the Court (Annual Report, <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assurance,</b> Special Reports), being of essential importance since they include the findings of the Court along with the replies of the audited institutions, are given much attention. Because of its competences the Court is {{a major player in the}} battle against fraud in the Communities and its role in that issue is also assessed. The thesis includes also an examination of the Court's auditing competences regarding expenditure for the second and third pillar of the European Union. The collaboration between the Court and the other institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council, European Investment Bank) is presented, focusing on the possibilities of improving it.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) assurance and firm value. This study contributes {{to the understanding of}} the economic benefits inherent in CSR assurance by investigating the incremental value added to firms by assurance. This study also explores CSR assurance quality in both Australia and New Zealand, two countries that are rarely examined. The research adopts a signalling theory view <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance,</b> where assurance acts as a signal of disclosure quality. The quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>statements</b> has been examined using a content analysis approach. Content analysis generates quality scores that enable quantitative analysis of the effects <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance</b> quality on firm value. The results show that CSR assurance is value-relevant, but assurance quality is not. Results remained true even after controlling for CSR performance, country and industry effects. The current study also finds that CSR assurance quality is lower when produced by an accountant, and that better governance mechanisms increase assurance statement quality. In addition to the CSR assurance quality score, scholars associate several other attributes with assurance quality. These attributes include the level <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> and the type <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> provider. The level <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> and the type <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> provider constitute signals about CSR assurance quality. These attributes are also examined to determine their effect on firm value. The results do not show any significant effect <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance</b> quality on firm value, either from the overall assurance quality score or from the attributes of quality. This research has implications for companies, standard setters and assurance providers. Companies may benefit from adopting CSR assurance. Since the quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> does not communicate any effective signal, it may be important for companies, standard setters and assurance providers to collaborate to improve assurance standards to achieve higher quality, in order to minimise the possibility of falsified signalling through substandard reporting and poor assurance quality. There are many opportunities for future research on the economic benefits <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance.</b> Future research should look into conducting a longitudinal study on CSR assurance quality. Future research should also examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> and its quality on firm value at different points of time and with various types of CSR disclosure...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{reporting}} aims {{to inform}} stakeholders of the companies’ activities within environmental, {{social and economic}} issues. The reporting is a tool to increase transparency and it shows the company’s effort to take responsibility and account for its actions. <b>Assurance</b> <b>of</b> sustainability reports is an increasing trend that strengthens {{the credibility of the}} reports. There is a risk, however, of management taking control over the assurance process. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the sustainability report and its usefulness for the stakeholders, reporting and assurance standards have evolved. The purpose of the study is to describe and analyse the <b>assurance</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> sustainability reports of public listed companies in Sweden. The findings allow the evaluation <b>of</b> how the <b>assurance</b> process influences accountability and transparency. The study is a content analysis <b>of</b> eleven <b>assurance</b> <b>statements</b> from 2010. The findings are categorized and analysed by assurance provider: accountants and consultants. The difference between the assurance statements were mainly due to the assurance standard used. The assurance statements provided by the consultants were more descriptive and stakeholder oriented compared to the accountants.
