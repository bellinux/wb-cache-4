A simple model that is consisted of five members is proposed {{in this paper}} instead of the prototype model of the torii-type frame {{with the aim of}} upgrading the analysis efficiency. The nonlinear analytical results showed that the proposed five-member model enables one to reasonably and effectively simulate the lateral behavior and collapse mechanism of the steel-scaffolding structures. The analytical results also indicated that the detailing of the linking rods play dominant role in preventing {{the scaffolding}} structures 2 ̆ 7 collapsing, and hence should be carefully designed...|$|E
40|$|This opening chapter {{explores the}} varied, and {{sometimes}} confused, interpretations of leadership for learning. As {{an introduction to}} this volume, it tries to lay some of the groundwork for navigating this complex territory, drawing on international studies which bring differing understandings of ‘learning’, ‘leadership’ and their interconnections. It {{suggests that there is}} important conceptual daylight between instructional leadership and leadership for learning, the key distinction {{to be found in the}} small but highly significant conjunction ‘for’. It concludes with an elaboration of five principles developed in a seven country study, suggesting that these may offer a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>frame</b> to bring to the wide-ranging discussions presented in the chapters contained in this book...|$|E

Factors {{that are considered}} in the design are loading condition, basic structural element, bracing, fonndation and ancillary fittings. Emphasis {{is given to the}} use of modular <b>frame</b> <b>scaffoldings</b> according to the standards in some countries. Finally, the result of system performance test on a typical modular <b>frame</b> <b>scaffolding</b> system produced locally is presented. The results shows that the frame system has high' buckling load capacity arid complies with the standard specification...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} achieve the look of Legend that he wanted, Scott scouted {{locations}} in the Sequoias of Yosemite National Park to see the grand scale of trees there. [...] "The whole environment is so stunning ... It was so impressive, but I didn't know how you would control it". [...] However, it would cost too much to shoot on location {{and he decided to}} build a forest set on the 007 Stage, named after and used for many James Bond films, at Pinewood Studios. The crew spent 14 weeks constructing the forest set, and Scott was worried that it would not look real enough. It was only days before the start of principal photography that it looked good enough to film. The trees were 60 feet high with trunks 30 feet in diameter and were sculpted out of polystyrene built onto tubular <b>scaffolding</b> <b>frames.</b> In addition, other sets were constructed on five huge soundstages.|$|R

The pity of it is that, between seizures, so much of Little Women's reality has been established. Allan Knee's script offers long passages of astutely condensed Alcott; Jason Howland's pleasant music, inventively orchestrated by Kim Scharnberg, pulls contemporary shapes out of period waltzes, polkas, and quadrilles, bumpily but gamely supported by Mindi Dickstein's uneven lyrics. And the cast, as always, offers many potential rescuers." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} adopted constrained k-prototypes algorithm {{to analyze}} the database that contains 294 cases of fatal falls between the years 2003 and 2010 within the Taiwanese construction industry. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the circumstances of the fatal falls. The results of the analysis indicate that the primary circumstances under which the accidents occurred include the professional category of other specialized construction businesses; hazardous mediums such as <b>scaffolding,</b> support <b>frame,</b> stairs, stairways, and the openings, etc.; the time period between 9 : 00 am and 11 : 00 am; the falling height between 0 and 10 meters. Meanwhile, not adopting safe construction methods is a major indirect factor that contributes to the accidents. The fundamental factors contributing to the accidents include not clearly informing the subcontractors of the conditions of the work environment, risk factors, labor health and safety regulations as well as the necessary measures to ensure the health and safety prior to the project commences...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on second}} and foreign {{language}} learning strategies has mushroomed {{over the last three}} decades and some very valuable studies have been conducted. Most, however examine strategies from a cognitive perspective, with fewer studies examining the emergence of learning strategies from a sociocultural perspective. In particular, the role of sociocultural mediation has not been specifically investigated as a solution for (English as a Foreign Language) EFL learners’ difficulties by Iranian researchers. This study investigates the role of mediation in Iranian EFL learners’ strategy development and use by reconfiguring the culture of the EFL listening-speaking classroom through teacher’s <b>scaffolding</b> techniques. <b>Framed</b> by sociocultural theory and activity theory the study collects data using the learner-diary, observation field notes and student and teacher interviews. The findings indicated that the participants’ activities are mediated to a considerable extent by the opportunities provided through the teacher’s scaffolding. The findings suggest that teachers should utilize different forms of mediation in their teaching to help learners harness the advantage of the efficacy of communicative classrooms...|$|R

Hazard identification and risk assessment used as prevention for accident when operating scaffolding. This study was an observational study with cross sectional design and analyzed descriptively. The design used for the study carried out by observing cause and effect within {{a period of time}} and space. Objects of this study were <b>frame</b> <b>scaffolding</b> and scaffolding PCH, while subjects of this study were SHE Officer, SHE supervisor, workers section structure, finishing, plumbing hydrant, and mechanical engineering. Results of hazard identification using JSA method founds 43 potential hazards originating from 4 different types of work in this project. The results of the risk assessment of 43 potential hazards have been found that 1 hazard have low risk, 40 hazards have moderate risk, and high risk hazard are 2. The dominant risk from the operation of the scaffolding was 40 potential hazards or 93 % of the total potential hazards and high-risk hazard eventhough only 5 % of all potential hazards remains a top priority and should be controlled soon to reduce the high and medium risk becomes low risk. The likelihood-based control is more possible to reduce risk level than severity-based control...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} quasi {{experimental}} research involving an experimental and a control group was {{to answer the question}} whether a course in the Socratic Dialogue in Nelson-Heckmann tradition would have any effects on content area student teachers’ beliefs and interactional behaviour with second language pupils. We consider the question partly positively answered. The course did not seem to have any effects on the teachers’ beliefs about communication as measured by a teacher belief survey, but it did have effects on their interactional behaviour. However, {{the first half of the}} answer can further be nuanced by the answer to the specific question regarding the effects of the course in the Socratic Dialogue on the student teachers’ statements on learning. As it is, after the course, the spontaneous statements on learning were more participation oriented. Regarding the nature of the effects on the student teachers’ interactional behaviour with second language pupils, the teachers asked more open-ended questions, slowed down the pace of the dialogue, explicitly invited the pupils to contribute and allowed them more time to express themselves. Also, they paid more attention to language. The microanalysis of the interaction in the teacher-pupil learning dialogues where the teacher’s interactional behaviour had changed, displayed change patterns pointing to an increase in interactional space for the pupil and in open question sequences containing a greater variety and frequency of metalinguistic sequences. In the course of the research, three instruments were developed. The first was the Socratic Dialogue assessment form. It may be considered a successful attempt at defining the Socratic Dialogue and its main features. It was developed in the cooperation with four experienced Socratic Dialogue facilitators and one Socratic Dialogue theoretician. Its inter-observer reliability was good. The second instrument was a teacher belief survey. Drawing on two metaphors for learning (Sfard, 1998) it comprised the two corresponding scales along which teachers’ beliefs about communication in general and in learning and instructions in particular were measured. Its reliability was satisfactory as was its construct validity. The third instrument was the teacher-pupil-learning-dialogue scoring scheme which captured the teacher’s scaffolding behaviour on 8 features. The instrument was found reliable for two observers. Each of the three instruments could be seen as presenting a theoretical contribution to the study of the Socratic Dialogue, teacher beliefs and interactional <b>scaffolding</b> by <b>framing</b> one or more of their respective aspects...|$|R
40|$|When {{farmed fish}} escape from farms, they may compete with wild {{individuals}} {{for a number}} of resources, such as food, spawning sites, and mates. As a part of a larger study on genetic impact from farmed fish on wild populations, the spawning behaviour of released farmed brown trout was observed. A 6 by 4 m net enclosure with a steel <b>frame</b> (<b>scaffolding)</b> was placed {{in the middle of the}} spawning area of wild brown trout in River Øyreselv, and secured well to resist flows and strong currents. The lower part of the net was kept tight to the river bed by a steel chain and lead weights. A Seametrix underwater video camera with remote-controlled focus and tilt was set up in the middle of the enclosure, about 15 cm above the bottom. The camera was connected to a monitor and the behavioural sequences were recorded on a Thomson U-matic portable videocassette recorder. Five male and five female mature farmed brown trout were released within the enclosure together with wild spawners. Both wild and farmed fish were also studied outside the enclosure. The spawning behaviour of farmed trout is described and compared to the behaviour of wild brown trout. The farmed trout displayed basically normal spawning behaviour, though this was less vigorous than that of wild trout. The different behavioural patterns previously reported for spawning brown trout, such as courting and quivering, testing of the spawning substrate, digging, gaping, and release of milt were observed in the farmed brown trout. Aggressive behaviour and sneaking behaviour by small wild males were also recorded. Finally, viable offspring of farmed trout were collected...|$|R
40|$|Este artigo tem como objetivo mostrar como o desenvolvimentismo e o pragmatismo, dois pensamentos de natureza distinta, contribuem, cada um à sua maneira, para fundamentar uma política de reconstrução nacional nos anos 1950, em {{particular}} no âmbito do Ministério da Educação e Cultura - MEC. A idéia central é que, por circularem nos mesmos espaços institucionais, esses dois pensamentos acabam por interagir um com o outro, de tal modo que a ideologia desenvolvimentista se transforma em um solo fértil para a retomada e expansão do pragmatismo. Para explicar esse fenômeno, recorda-se que ambos se ancoram em uma concepção de cunho prático baseada na política. Chama-se a atenção para a maneira como o Instituto Superior de Estudos Brasileiros - Iseb - e o Instituto Nacional de Estudos Pedagógicos - Inep -, dois órgãos do MEC responsáveis por fomentar um pensamento nacional, se apropriam desses ideários para a formulação e a implementação de políticas de reconstrução nacional. This paper aims {{to discuss}} how two distinct definitional concepts - developmentism and pragmatism - contributed, in their own particular ways, to the underlying foundations upon which a national reconstruction policy was implemented in the 1950 's. Special consideration shall {{be given to the}} fact that their unruffled co-existence within the very same institution - the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) - turned the developmentist ideology into a fertile ground for the rebirth and growth of pragmatism. Upon such consideration, this paper shall highlight (1) the fact that both concepts are based upon an eminently practical political mindset and (2) the means employed by ISEB (Higher Institute of Brazilian Studies) and INEP (National Institute of Pedagogical Studies) to develop and implement national reconstruction policies. These institutions were institutions within MEC whose think-tank board members aimed at <b>scaffolding</b> the national <b>frame</b> of thinking...|$|R
