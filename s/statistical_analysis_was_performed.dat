50|$|In {{an attempt}} to clarify what was exposed in Test Unit Two, Test Unit Six was chosen to excavate. Unfortunately, Test Unit Six {{excavations}} revealed disturbed stratigraphy similar to Test Unit Two, so Test Unit Seven had to be excavated as well. Thompson’s trench was then located and the team {{was finally able to}} place their newer ideas into the previous framework created by Thompson for the site. 1805 lithic pieces were excavated and <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> on the flakes to determine use area location during the most intense occupation period in the rockshelter. This, and the hearths in Test Unit Three, led the team to determine the spatial segregation of the rockshelter into various activity areas. The lithic artifacts found in Test Unit Three also demonstrated the different stages of production in stone tool making; for example, Test Unit Three lithics were determined to be of a later stage than Test Unit Four.|$|E
