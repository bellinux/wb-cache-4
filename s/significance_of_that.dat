5|$|One of {{the most}} {{discussed}} potential nominees is Paul Henderson, who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. This {{is one of the}} best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history. While there is little question of the historical <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> goal, Henderson's NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.|$|E

This was because the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E

2500|$|The {{passing of}} 1975 without {{incident}} left the Watch Tower Society {{open to new}} claims of prophetic failure. Instead of maintaining the prophetic <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year, however, the group's leaders embarked on a lengthy period of denial and purge, blaming rank and file membership for misreading the organization's interpretations. The Watchtower initially explained {{that the reason for}} the failure of Armageddon's arrival was due to the time lapse between the creation of Adam and Eve. Although the Society had earlier argued that the gap was [...] "weeks or months, not years", it now decided the time lapse could, after all, be years. The following year the magazine repeated its explanation, but declared the Witnesses themselves were to blame for their eager expectations about 1975 because they had misread the Bible. [...] "It was not the word of God that failed or deceived [...] and brought disappointment, but ... his own understanding was based on wrong premises." [...] In talks at conventions four years later, leading members of the Society finally acknowledged their error in the initial formulation of the prophecy, and in the March 15, 1980 Watchtower the Society said its claims about 1975 were regretted. It assigned no different interpretation to the date and demanded that its members recognize that there never was an explicit prophecy.|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
