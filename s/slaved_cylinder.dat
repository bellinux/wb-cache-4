There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric <b>slave</b> <b>cylinder</b> that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric <b>slave</b> <b>cylinder</b> allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R

50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper.

A rear-mounted load sensing valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic brakes {{transfer}} {{energy to}} stop an object, normally a rotating axle. In {{a very simple}} brake system, with just two cylinders and a disc brake, the cylinders could be connected via tubes, with a piston inside the cylinders. The cylinders and tubes are filled with incompressible oil. The two cylinders have the same volume, but different diameters, and thus different cross-section areas. The cylinder that the operator uses is called the master cylinder. The spinning disc brake will be adjacent to the piston with the larger cross-section. Suppose {{the diameter of the}} master cylinder is half the diameter of the <b>slave</b> <b>cylinder,</b> so the master cylinder has a cross-section four times smaller. Now, if the piston in the master cylinder is pushed down 40 mm, the slave piston will move 10 mm. If 10 newtons (N) of force are applied to the master piston, the slave piston will press with a force of 40 N.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the cross-slide, change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide actuating cylinder is metered into either a storage tank or <b>slave</b> <b>cylinders</b> in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the <b>slave</b> <b>cylinders,</b> are programmed to inform the Logic System when the machine slide has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start signal, programme channel number 1 of each selector unit is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using plug board, punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the cross-slide may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{synchronous}} system of hydraulic lifting mechanism always {{could not get}} enough synchronous precision because of load imbalance and two-cylinder size discrepancies. The paper uses MATLAB/simulink toolbox to create simulative model of the system, and applies fuzzy control to improve synchronous precision. Simulative {{results show that the}} system adopted the fuzzy control enables further improved synchronous precision to 0. 09 mm, and the <b>slave</b> <b>cylinder</b> speed can follow the active cylinder speed well. The average peak speed is 20. 5 mm/s and 20 mm/s. So for this {{synchronous system}} it has a good control effect. Principles of a New Hydraulic Synchronous Control System Hydraulic synchronous system is a hydraulic circuit which realizes many actuators to move with the same displacement, force or speed. The evaluation index of synchronous circuit is synchronous precision, which is indicated by position error or divert flows error into the cylinder. With the development of aerospace technology and modern machinery processing industry, high-precision synchronous driven technology has become even more urgent in the metal processing equipment, metallurgical machinery, engineering machinery, aerospace aviation-driven devices and so on. All of these devices, because of nonlinear friction of the actuator, leakage of the hydraulic system...|$|R
2500|$|The 1986 Fiero {{arrived on}} 12 September 1986, however, the GT model was not listed. The {{previous}} year's GT became the 1986 SE. The 1986 GT was delayed until 3 January 1987. This {{was the first}} time the fastback roofline was offered, sometimes referred to as a [...] "1986½" [...] model, as the new fastback body restyle was not yet ready for release at the start of the model year.

50|$|The {{most common}} vehicle uses of master {{cylinders}} are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside of brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders {{may be called}} wheel <b>cylinders</b> or <b>slave</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and they push the brake pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum, or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, {{for their ability to}} withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).|$|R

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and <b>slave</b> <b>cylinder</b> from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R
