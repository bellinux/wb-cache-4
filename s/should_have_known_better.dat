In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And then you look 25 years later and you go: 'OK, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better.</b> The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Stars on 45" [...] {{is a song}} {{issued in}} January 1981 by the studio group Stars on 45. In some countries, {{including}} the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and the medley itself was named [...] "Stars on 45".

2500|$|Tucker {{was born}} in Alexandria, Virginia on June 18, 1913. His father, Samuel A. Tucker, {{a real estate agent}} and NAACP member, and teacher mother saw to his formal and {{informal}} education. Tucker later said: [...] "I got involved {{in the civil rights movement}} on June 18, 1913, in Alexandria. I was born black." [...] Although Alexandria was less segregated that Richmond and Norfolk, it provided no high school for black children, so after graduating from 8th grade, he had to [...] "bootleg" [...] a high school education across the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. at Armstrong High School. Black Virginia children commuted by streetcar. In June 1927, when Tucker was 14, he, 2 brothers and a friend refused to leave their seats after a streetcar crossed the river into Alexandria, despite the request of a white woman who believed one of the seats was designated only for whites. She swore out a warrant charging them with disorderly conduct and abusive language, and the police levied no fine upon the 11 year old Otto Tucker, but fined Samuel Tucker $5 plus court costs and his older brother George $50 plus court costs, claiming that as eldest he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better.</b> However, on appeal, an all-white jury found the young men not guilty.|$|E

40|$|The arm’s length {{principle}} {{has a new}} function. When used by the European Union (EU) Commission for State aid control purposes, it {{is aimed}} at protecting {{a level playing field}} for all economic operators in the internal market, i. e. at protecting free competition, rather than at tax base protection or prevention of double taxation. In that function, it is part of competition law, rather than of tax law. It may, therefore, deviate from the traditional Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) understanding of that principle. The case law on which the Commission relies, is not very explicit, and {{it remains to be seen}} whether the EU Courts will endorse the Commission’s approach, but from a competition law perspective, that approach makes sense. Both from the Belgian excess profits scheme case and the Apple case, it transpires that the Commission is of the opinion that a company cannot have stateless income. A branch State cannot suffice by saying ‘not in my yard’ if that implies that real income is allocated into a tax void, disappearing for tax purposes into a physically non-existent head office. Whether or not the EU Courts, if they accept the Commission’s approach, will also accept recovery ten years back with interest, will most likely depend on the question of whether, even if the Commission’s approach may be novel, the companies and the Member States involved <b>should</b> anyway <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better...</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{still his}} mind was changed,--was {{altogether}} changed by the coming of his sister. Till she had come all had been a blank with him, in which no light had been possible. He could see no life before him but {{one in which he}} should be constantly condemned by his fellow-men because of his cruelty to his young wife. Men would not stop to ask whether he had been right or wrong, but would declare him at any rate to have been stern and cruel. And then he had been torn to the heart by his memory of those passages of love which had been so sweet to him. He had married her to be the joy of his life, and she had become so to his entire satisfaction when in his passion he had sent her away. He already <b>knew</b> that he <b>had</b> made a great mistake. Angry as he <b>had</b> been, he <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> thus sought to avenge himself. He <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> himself <b>better</b> than to think that because she had been in fault he could therefore live without her. He had owned to himself when his sister had come to him that he must use her services in getting his wife once again. Was she not the one human being that suited him at all points? But still,--but still his honour must be saved. If she in truth desired to come back to him, she would not hesitate to own that she had been in fault.|$|R
2500|$|As Arduengo's {{involvement}} in the automotive coatings program came to an end, he submitted a proposal to the management in CR to isolate these apparently stable carbenes and study their chemistry. The proposal was soundly declined with the admonition that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> certainly <b>known</b> <b>better</b> than {{to make such a}} suggestion in light of the long history of carbene chemistry that firmly established them as reactive intermediates that could not be isolated as stable entities. However, Arduengo (already well-aware of the history) had the starting materials on hand for the chemistry and decided to proceed with the experiments. [...] "Arduengo's gamble paid off. In 1991, more than 150 years after the first attempt ..." [...] a stable crystalline carbene was isolated and characterized in laboratories at DuPont. After the first successful reaction to produce a stable carbene, Arduengo won the support of DuPont management and research in this area continued. Carbenes bearing a variety of substituent groups were prepared and characterized. The saturated imidazolin-2-ylidenes that were extensively investigated by Hans-Werner Wanzlick thirty years earlier (without isolation) were now also shown to be stable enough to isolate with appropriate substituents at nitrogen. An air-stable carbene was produced. The chemistry was extended to include thiazol-2-ylidenes (conjectured to exist in 1957 as a reactive intermediate in the vitamin B1 catalytic cycle, but not isolated for 40 years). The imidazol-2-ylidenes were extensively characterized by their NMR properties, photo-electron spectroscopy, and exact experimental electron density mapping by X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques.|$|R

6000|$|This distinction, {{though by}} no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior {{so-called}} d'Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition <b>should</b> <b>have</b> made him <b>know</b> <b>better.</b> A knowledge of his career having come to the ears of Mr Clare, when he was {{in that part of the}} country preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state. Though he was a stranger, occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and took for his text the words from St Luke: [...] "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee!" [...] The young man much resented this directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without respect for his gray hairs.|$|R

He did not choose, as he declared, that any young man should order whatever he might think necessary for his house. Then Mrs. Tappitt made it worse.

[...] "A present to the girls? I tell you I won't have such presents. And if it was so, I think he has been very impertinent,--very impertinent indeed. I shall tell him so,--and I shall insist on paying for the wine. And I must say, you ought not to have taken it." ...|$|R
60|$|When it was {{publicly}} {{known that}} the Duke of Omnium had stepped into Mr. Bonteen's shoes, the general opinion certainly coincided with that given by the Duke of St. Bungay.

If the present arrangement was good, why <b>should</b> it not <b>have</b> been made independently of Mr. Bonteen?

He himself felt that he did not stand so high with his colleagues as when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer; not even so high as when he held the Privy Seal. In the printed lists of those who attended the Cabinets his name generally was placed last, and an opponent on one occasion thought, or pretended to think, that he was no more than Postmaster-General. He determined to bear all this without wincing,--but he did wince. He would not own to himself that he had been wrong, but he was sore,--as a man is sore who doubts about his own conduct; and he was not the less so because he strove to bear his wife's sarcasms without showing that they pained him.|$|R
