40|$|Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited {{bacterium}} {{in plant}} hosts and causes Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevines, which differ in susceptibility {{according to the}} Vitis species (spp.). In this work we compared X. fastidiosa biofilm formation and population dynamics when cultured in xylem <b>saps</b> <b>from</b> PD-susceptible and -resistant Vitis spp. under different conditions. Behaviors in a closed-culture system were compared to those in different sap-renewal cultures that would more closely mimic the physicochemical environment encountered in planta. Significant differences in biofilm formation and growth in <b>saps</b> <b>from</b> PD-susceptible and -resistant spp. were only observed using sap renewal culture. Compared to <b>saps</b> <b>from</b> susceptible V. vinifera, those from PD-resistant V. aestivalis supported lower titers of X. fastidiosa and less biofilm and V. champinii suppressed both growth and biofilm formation, behaviors which are correlated with disease susceptibility. Furthermore, in microfluidic chambers X. fastidiosa formed thick mature biofilm with three-dimensional (3 -D) structures, such as pillars and mounds, in <b>saps</b> <b>from</b> all susceptible spp. In contrast, only small aggregates of various shapes were formed in <b>saps</b> <b>from</b> {{four out of five}} of the resistant spp.; <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> the resistant spp. V. mustangensis was an exception in that it also supported thick lawns of biofilm but not the above described 3 -D structures typically seen in a mature biofilm <b>from</b> the susceptible <b>saps.</b> Our findings provide not only critical technical information for future bioassays, but also suggest further understanding of PD susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Date palm sap (Phoenix dactylifera L.), {{also known}} as “legmi”, is a fresh juice {{extracted}} from date palm trees. The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of collection time (at {{the beginning of the}} tapping period and after seven days of collection) on the amino acid profile and physico-chemical properties of date palm <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> both male and female trees. Dry matter, protein, amino acid, and sugar profiles were determined using the Kjeldahl method, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD), respectively. Date palm <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> both male and female trees contained high levels of carbohydrates. HPLC analysis showed that this fraction was dominated by sucrose in the <b>sap</b> sample <b>from</b> female trees compared to that from male trees. Male date palm sap was noted to exhibit lower dry matter content than female date palm sap but higher protein, total polyphenol, ash, and amino acid contents. While the major essential amino acids in the <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> male trees consisted of valine and threonine, they were represented by lysine and phenylalanine in <b>sap</b> samples <b>from</b> female trees. Further, Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed the presence of a proteinic band of 30 kDa only for the <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> male trees. Taken together, the <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> both male and female date palm trees had a number of properties that are highly valued by the functional food industry...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To report {{clinical}} findings after accidental instillation {{into the}} eye of <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> Angel's trumpet (Datura suaveolens). METHODS: We report findings on seven patients who developed sudden onset of unilateral mydriasis. At least three of them also had ipsilateral cycloplegia and one developed transient tachycardia. RESULTS: The symptoms evolved after ocular exposure to <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> Angel's trumpet, a plant containing natural alkaloids with parasympatholytic properties. Six patients were initially unaware of the cause of their symptoms. In these cases, patient history revealed recent contact with Angel's trumpet. CONCLUSION: Accidental ocular instillation of <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> Angel's trumpet should be noted {{as a cause of}} sudden onset of mydriasis in otherwise unaffected patients and also of general symptoms like tachycardia...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Rods of {{variable}} lengths occurred in <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> plants infected with tobacco mosaic, cucumber mosaic, potato X, potato Y, henbane mosaic, tobacco etch, and cabbage blackring viruses; {{the first two}} were about 15 mp. wide and appeared rigid, the others were about 10 mp. wide and apparently flexible. <b>Sap</b> <b>from</b> plants infected with tomato bushy stunt, tobacco ringspot and two tobacco necrosis viruses contained spherical particles about 26 mp. in diameter; two particles, one about 18 mp. and the other about 37 mp. in diameter occurred in <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> plants infected with a third tobacco necrosis virus. No specific particles were identified in <b>sap</b> <b>from</b> plants infected with tomato spotted wilt, potato leaf roll, cauliflower mosaic, tomato aspermy, sugar beet mosaic and sugar beet yellows viruses. Serologically related strains of any one virus were morphologically indistinguishable, but this has little diagnostic value because so also were some unrelated viruses.
