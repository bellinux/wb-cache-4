They {{are built}} with thick and strong plant material in emergent vegetation, such as hard stem bulrush, cattails and sedges, over or near standing water. [...] Redheads to not defend their territory or home range and are actually very social while in their breeding ground. This {{is thought to}} occur because some younger, inexperienced redhead females parasitize other pochards. Some redheads lay their eggs in other pochards’ nests, including the canvasback, ring-necked duck and greater and lesser <b>scaups</b> and this social parasitism by redheads reduces the hatching success of other pochards’ eggs, especially those of the canvasback. In contrast, because of the parasitic relationship between the redhead and other pochards, redhead hybrids with the ring-necked duck, canvasback and the greater and lesser <b>scaups</b> have been found. [...] Canvasback x redhead hybrids can be fertile. [...] Brood sizes range from 5-7 young, with the mother abandoning the chicks at 8 weeks old, before {{they are capable of}} flying.

50|$|Greater <b>scaup</b> {{are rated}} {{as a species}} of least concern by the IUCN Redlist. During aerial {{population}} surveys greater and lesser <b>scaup</b> are counted together, because they look almost identical from the air. It was estimated that the greater <b>scaup</b> made up about 11% of the continental <b>scaup</b> population. Since the 1980s, <b>scaup</b> populations have been steadily decreasing. Some of the primary factors contributing to this decline are habitat loss, contaminants, changes in breeding habitat, and a lower female survival rate. The 2010 American <b>scaup</b> population survey was 4.2 million <b>scaup,</b> however, the worldwide greater <b>scaup</b> population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature greater <b>scaup.</b> Along with the aerial population surveys, there is a banding program for the greater <b>scaup.</b> Metal leg bands are placed on them, so that if the <b>scaup</b> is killed by a hunter {{or if it is}} captured by another banding group, the number on the band can be reported to biologists and wildlife organizations.

Lesser <b>scaup</b> females and immatures tend to have less white around the bill, but this too varies considerably between individual birds. The bill may give a hint; in the lesser <b>scaup</b> it has a stronger curve on the upperside than in the greater, resulting in a distal part that looks somewhat flattened and wide in the lesser scaup—hence the vernacular name [...] "broadbill".

40|$|Mattamuskeet, Pea Island, and Swanquarter [...] {{two on the}} {{mainland}} {{and one on the}} outermost barrier beach [...] are three National Wildlife Refuges in North Carolina that provide winter food and shelter for more than 100, 000 waterfowl. Ducks, geese, and swans that in summer scatter across the northern rim of the world from Greenland to Alaska come down the sky lanes in the fall and in these refuges find the conditions they need to survive the hard months of winter. At Mattamuskeet you can see one of the largest assemblages of Canada geese on the Atlantic seaboard and more of that giant white bird, the whistling swan, than the average person is likely to see in a lifetime. Pea Island is a winter haven for thousands of snow geese, Canada geese, and such ducks as goldeneyes, pintails, and mallards. At Swanquarter the diving ducks like buffleheads and <b>scaups</b> find the salt waters and the submerged aquatic plants that they need to tide them over winter. These refuges lie within the Atlantic flyway of the waterfowl. There are four such flyways in the United States, the others being the Mississippi, the Central, and the Pacific. The Atlantic flyway has extensive breeding grounds, scattered from the eastern border of the continent to the western, but its winter range is only a narrow strip on the Atlantic coast of the United States, an area that is also densely settled and developed for agriculture and industry. Waterfowl refuges are especially needed in this flyway to provide plenty of food and shelter for the birds during the critical winter period. This booklet tells the story of Mattamuskeet, which is the largest of the three refuges in North Carolina and the most accessible to visitors, and which in some respects is unique among all wildlife refuges. It also includes brief accounts of Swanquarter and Pea Island. MATTAMUSKEET—the rhythmic softness of the Indian name recalls the days when tribes of the Algonquin roamed the flat plains of the coast and hunted game in deep forests of cypress and pine. The Indians are gone, leaving few traces upon the land they once knew. Much of the forest as the Indians knew it is gone, too, but even today some of the wildest country of the Atlantic coast {{is to be found in}} this easternmost part of the Carolina mainland-the area bounded by Albemarle Sound on the north and Pamlico Sound on the east and south. Here, in this coastal region, are dense woods of pine, cypress, and gum; here are wide, silent spaces where the wind blows over seas of marsh grass and the only living things are the birds and the small, unseen inhabitants of the marshes. The Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge includes about 50, 000 acres of land and water in this Carolina coastal country, in the county of Hyde. The dominant geographic feature of the refuge is Lake Mattamuskeet [...] a shallow, sluggish body of water more than 15 miles long, 5 or 6 miles across, and some 30, 000 acres in extent. Being little more than 3 feet deep anywhere, the lake is stirred deeply by the winds and its waters are usually muddy. Silt-filled waters support little plant life, and so the best feeding grounds for the waterfowl are not in the open lake but in its surrounding marshes. Cypress trees form most of the northern border of the lake, but its eastern and southern shores pass into low swamplands. Try to learn the origins of this vast inland lake and at once you stumble upon a collection of local legends in which it is hard to separate fact from fiction. Of all the stories of the genesis of Mattamuskeet, local opinion divides its support between two. According to one story, the Indians long ago set fires in the peat bogs, fires that burned so long and deeply that a huge, saucer-like depression was formed. This caught the rains and the drainage water, creating a lake. The other story has it that a shower of giant meteors once struck the Carolina coastal plain, the impact of the largest ones digging out the beds of Lake Mattamuskeet and the smaller, but otherwise similar, Lakes Alligator, Pungo, and Phelps that lie northwest of Mattamuskeet. The modern history of Mattamuskeet, although less stirring to the imagination, has been a troubled one. The flat plain between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds is an agricultural country that yields crops of soy beans, cotton, collards, and grain. On the whole it has too much, rather than too little water. About 1914, people conceived the idea of draining Lake Mattamuskeet and converting its shallow bottom to farm land. Being patterned after similar projects in Holland, this community was named 2 ̆ 2 New Holland. 2 ̆ 2 The history of this attempt is too long to tell here-the digging of a network of canals, the building of pumping plants and a community of cottages, the spending of millions of dollars, the bankruptcy of one company after another, and the eventual abandonment of the scheme as impractical and impossibly expensive. In 1934 the land was acquired by the United States Government and a waterfowl sanctuary was established. The Civilian Conservation Corps converted the former pumping plant into a refuge office and. store rooms, combined with a modem, comfortably furnished lodge for visitors. A circular staircase was built into the former smoke stack of the pumping plant, turning it into an observation tower. This 120 -foot tower affords a magnificent view of the entire refuge and the surrounding country, with thousands of geese and swans often in sight at one time...|$|R

It is colloquially known as the little bluebill or broadbill because of its {{distinctive}} blue bill. The origin of the name <b>scaup</b> may stem from the bird's preference for feeding on scalp—the Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels; however, some credit it to the female's discordant <b>scaup</b> call as the name's source. It is apparently a very close relative of the Holarctic greater <b>scaup</b> or [...] "bluebill" [...] (A. marila), with which it forms a superspecies. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek aithuia an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin, affinis [...] "related to", from its resemblance to the greater <b>scaup.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{the lesser}} <b>scaup</b> {{has the largest}} {{population}} of any species of diving duck in North America, their population has been steadily declining since the mid-1980s, and reached an all-time low in the early 21sh century. During breeding bird surveys, lesser and greater <b>scaup</b> are counted together due to the impossibility of identifying the species unequivocally when large numbers of birds are involved. Lesser <b>scaup</b> are thought to comprise slightly less than nine-tenths of the <b>scaup</b> population of North America. In the 1970s, the lesser <b>scaup</b> population was estimated at 6.9 million birds on average; in the 1990s it had declined to about half that number, and by the late 2000s it is estimated at 3 million individuals or less. Due to the wide breeding range {{and the fact that}} the rate of decline, though remarkable, is still not threatening in respect to the enormous overall numbers, the lesser <b>scaup</b> is classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. An increase of the decline is liable to result in an uplisting to Near Threatened or even Vulnerable status.|$|E
50|$|Greater <b>scaup</b> are {{a popular}} game bird in North America and Europe. They are hunted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and {{commercial}} reasons. Greater <b>scaup</b> are hunted with shotguns because {{they must be}} shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to 121 km/h. Greater <b>scaup</b> are hunted from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of greater <b>scaup</b> and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land. In most countries where greater <b>scaup</b> are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal hunting licences that are required to pursue other game.

5000|$|... lesser <b>scaup</b> females {{show the}} {{characteristic}} darker iris (bright yellow in greater <b>scaup</b> males and females) at closer distances. Lesser <b>scaup</b> drakes in nuptial plumage are often {{said to be}} recognizable by the purple instead of green sheen {{of the head and}} a darker back. But this is unreliable because it varies according to light conditions, and these birds are often too far away from the observer to make out any sheen at all. The best trait—if the primary remiges are not visible—is the shape of the head: in the greater <b>scaup</b> drake, the forehead is usually quite massive, whereas the nape presents a smooth shallow curve and may appear almost straightly sloping. The lesser <b>scaup</b> drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. When the birds raise their heads, these differences are most easy to spot, and after observing the two species in direct comparison it usually becomes easy to recognize. In fact, in alternate plumage the lesser <b>scaup</b> drake may appear identical in shape and size to a drake of the ring-necked duck (A. collaris); the black back and wings of that species are hard to confuse with the light ones of the lesser <b>scaup</b> male though.|$|E
