25|$|According to {{the early}} {{official}} version, one of the bombs had been insecurely attached with adhesive tape, falling and then exploding. However, no one {{is reported to have}} seen this happen. Aushev said that an initial explosion was set off by a hostage-taker accidentally tripping over a wire. As a result, armed civilians, some of them apparently fathers of the hostages, started shooting. Aushev said no security forces or captors were shooting at this point, but the gunfire led the militants to believe that the school was being stormed. In a similar version, Igor Senin, president of the association of Alfa veterans, said that <b>somebody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school building set off a hand grenade, probably by accident, after which the militants decided they were being attacked and opened fire.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance <b>somebody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

500|$|A few mounted militiamen on {{the road}} would dismount, fire muskets at the {{approaching}} regulars, then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic.

[...] Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units, directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars. [...] Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia. [...] Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics. [...] Percy wrote of the colonial tactics, [...] "The rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body.

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} anthrax attacks, White House {{officials}} repeatedly pressured FBI Director Robert Mueller {{to prove that}} they were a second-wave assault by al-Qaeda following the September 11 attacks. During the president's morning intelligence briefings, Mueller was [...] "beaten up" [...] for not producing proof that the killer spores were the handiwork of terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden, according to a former aide. [...] "They really wanted to blame <b>somebody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East," [...] the retired senior FBI official stated. The FBI knew early on that the anthrax used was of a consistency requiring sophisticated equipment and was unlikely to have been produced in some [...] "cave". At the same time, both President Bush and Vice President Cheney in public statements speculated {{about the possibility of a}} link between the anthrax attacks and Al Qaeda. The Guardian reported in early October that American scientists had implicated Iraq as the source of the anthrax, and the next day the Wall St. Journal editorialized that Al Qaeda perpetrated the mailings, with Iraq the source of the anthrax. A few days later, John McCain suggested on the Late Show with David Letterman that the anthrax may have come from Iraq, and the next week ABC News did a series of reports stating that three or four (depending on the report) sources had identified bentonite as an ingredient in the anthrax preparations, implicating Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that <b>somebody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of [...] "Under My Thumb". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. [...] After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage [...] where, according to Gimme Shelter producer Porter Bibb, Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and so high he could barely walk. Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, [...] "I saw what he was looking at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent.
