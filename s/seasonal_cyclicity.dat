40|$|Summary. Seasonal, diurnal and episodic {{patterns}} of LH and tests-sterone secretion in sexually mature male New Zealand rabbits were studied. Blood samples {{were obtained from}} the central ear artery by puncture or through an indwelling catheter, and were assayed for hormones using radioimmunoassay. Testosterone values appeared to be lower in the summer months while LH showed no <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity.</b> There were no significant fluctuations when samples were taken at 10 -min intervals, but specimens taken every hour for 24 or 36 hr revealed an episodic pattern of release. Peaks of both hormones occurred every 4 to 5 hr in most animals. Testosterone levels ranged from 0 =. to 10 ng/ml and LH from 15 to 200 ng/ml of WP 360 A standard. In general, a rise in LH preceded or coincided with an increase in testosterone. No specific diurnal rhythm could be demonstrated and the patterns appeared to be unrelated to external stimuli...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{composed}} of two parts. In the first part, it was emphasized that numerical analysis of relationships or networks was essential in {{the scientific study of}} group structure. Graph theory, especially the theory of directed graph, was introduced to the analysis of group structure, and basic concepts and definitions, such as adjacency matrix, reachability matrix, distance matrix, connectedness matrix, and clique, were explained briefly. Thereafter, procedures and techniques of matrix algebra and condensation of graph were shown by using data in hypothetical grooming network. In the second part, grooming interactions among free-ranging Japanese monkeys (Macaco fuscata) tabulated on matrices are analyzed by graph theoretical techniques. The structure of grooming networks among adult monkeys exhibited <b>seasonal</b> changes and <b>cyclicity</b> according to reproductive state...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which social living {{arrangements}} influenced seasonal changes in physiology and behavior was examined in adult squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Data were collected over 20 months (encompassing two breeding seasons) from animals that were housed in three mixed-sex social configurations that varied {{in the number of}} heterosexual and isosexual social partners. For both sexes, the presence of multiple females was found to facilitate reproduction. Females housed with other females were more likely to exhibit <b>seasonal</b> ovarian <b>cyclicity</b> and tended to have higher conception rates. Social facilitation of reproduction was particularly prominent for subordinate females. The presence of same-sex companions also resulted in reduced adrenocortical output in females during the first nonbreeding season. In males, the availability of multiple females increased plasma testosterone levels, except in the presence of more dominant males. Seasonal increases in male weight coincided with increased cortisol levels and were most prominent in social groups containing multiple females. The influence of multiple females on male seasonality occurred despite the finding that male-female interactions were infrequent and, in fact, occurred less frequently when isosexual partners were available. Unexpectedly, affiliative social interactions between same-sex and opposite-sex partners occurred less frequently during the breeding season. As expected, behaviors associated with sex tended to increase during the breeding season. Very little agonism was observed {{during the course of the}} study and there was no evidence of interanimal competition for mates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In nonmammalian vertebrates, photic cues that {{regulate}} {{the timing of}} <b>seasonal</b> reproductive <b>cyclicity</b> are detected by nonretinal, nonpineal deep brain photoreceptors. It has long been assumed that the underlying mechanism involves the transmission of photic information from the photoreceptor to a cir-cadian system, and thence to the reproductive axis. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} direct communication between the brain photoreceptor and the reproductive axis. In the present study, light and confocal microscopy reveal that gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and processes are scattered among photoreceptor cells (identified by their opsin-immunoreactivity) in the lateral septum (SL). In the median eminence (ME), opsin and GnRH immuno-reactive fibers overlap extensively. Single and double label ultrastructural immunocytochemistry indicate that in the SL and preoptic area (POA), opsin positive terminals form axo-dendritic synapses onto GnRH dendrites. In the ME, opsin and GnRH terminals lie adjacent to each other, make contact with tanycytes, or terminate on the hypophyseal portal capillaries. These results reveal that brain photoreceptors communicate directly with GnRH-neurons; this represents a means by which photoperiodic information reaches the reproductive axis. Key words circadian, avian, brain photoreceptor, GnRH, median eminence, opsin, VIP It is well established that photic stimuli associated with changing day length regulate seasonal cycles of reproduction. In mammals, light cues are transmitted from the retina to the circadian system of the supra-chiasmatic nuclei (SCN), ultimately reaching the pineal gland where the duration of melatonin secre-tion determines the timing of seasonal endocrine secretions (Bartness et al., 1993). In birds, {{there is no evidence that}} melatonin secretion controls reproduc-tive cycles, though there is a reduction in the ampli-tude of melatonin in midsummer and midwinter in some high-latitude birds (reviewed in Gwinner et al. ...|$|R

Large intra-tooth variations in the oxygen isotopic composition (up to 90 / 00) were observed in the enamel of herbivores from the Neanderthal fossil site of Payre, consistent with preservation of <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity.</b> The range of isotopic compositions observed in Neanderthal tooth enamel was much smaller (32 ̆ 6), possibly the result of a longer enamel maturation time averaging out variability. An archaeological otolith from a Preceramic site in Northern Peru exhibited marked changes in d 18 O over life, due either to the fish occasionally migrating from the sea to a lower salinity habitat, or to short-lived rises in sea water temperature. A fish otolith from Australia’s Willandra Lakes World Heritage Area showed clear seasonal variations, but also a general trend towards isotopically heavier and more saline water, as indicated by higher ᵹ 18 O and Sr/Ca values resulting from increased evaporation. The results of these case studies are compared to results of oxygen isotope analysis using more conventional methods and demonstrate the ability of the SHRIMP II to provide precise high spatial resolution in-situ oxygen isotope analyses of a variety of biogenic materials. This approach has major advantages over conventional methods. It can provide rapid, micro-scale isotopic analyses of sub-permil precision without the need for chemical preparation of the sample...|$|E

Late spontaneous descent occurred in 464 cases (75. 7 %), while 149 (24. 3 %) were still cryptorchid. The incidence of C at 12 months from the expected date of delivery, after survival curve calculation, in term and pre-term infants, was 1. 53 and 7. 31 %, respectively, in the period 1978 - 1987, and 1. 22 and 3. 13 % respectively, in the 2 (nd) decade (1988 - 1997).

40|$|Recent {{publication}} by Deshmukh et al provided important data on {{the prevalence}} of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) in the Unites States. Such data are particularly relevant since they refer to more than 6, 800 cases, whereas a recent systematic review of 19 available studies, investigating the occurrence of TTC, accounted for 391 cases only. Among the others, Deshmukh et al found a highest peak in July, and a lowest in January. Such observation is in agreement with previous data, but not with other reports. It has to been stressed, however, that all these studies focused on peaks and troughs of TTC, but did not search for possible repeatability. As for this aspect, data from the Takotsubo Italian Network, elaborated through a validated chronobiological software, first reported a <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> in TTC occurrence, characterized by a peak in July and a trough in January, independent of age. Again, the same Italian authors reported also a weekly pattern, characterized by a peak of onset on Monday, not replicated by others. On one hand, Summer seems to be confirmed as a risk period for TTC. On the other, given the great relevance of the population studied by Deshmukh et al, it should {{be very interesting to}} test the hypothesis of a cyclical chronobiological pattern by day-of-week. The demonstration of temporal windows at enhanced risk of occurrence may have implications for possible prevention, to try to ensure maximal benefit during vulnerable periods...|$|E
40|$|The {{palaeoceanography}} {{and climate}} {{history of the}} East Antarctic Margin (EAM) are less well understood than those of West Antarctica. Yet, the EAM {{plays an important role}} in deep ocean circulation and the global ocean system and has likely done so in the past. Deglacial-age marine sediments from the EAM provide clues about its past role during this critical period of rapid climate change. Several deep basins across the EAM such as Iceberg Alley (∼ 67 °S, 63 °E) on the Mac. Robertson Shelf (MRS) accommodate thick marine sequences that archive the deglaciation in the form of diatom-rich, continuously laminated (varved) sediments. These laminated sediments are pristinely preserved and contain seasonal and long-term information on the cryospheric and palaeoceanographic changes associated with the rapid retreat of the glacial ice sheet across the MRS. We present results of microfabric analysis of the lower ∼ 2 m of deglacial varves from jumbo piston core JPC 43 B (Iceberg Alley). Backscattered electron imagery (BSEI) of polished thin sections and scanning electron microscope secondary electron imagery (SEI) of lamina-parallel fracture surfaces are used to analyze the varves. One hundred and ninety-two laminations are investigated and their nature and temporal significance are discussed in terms of <b>seasonal</b> deposition and <b>cyclicity</b> of diatom species. Our high-resolution palaeodata record exceptionally high diatom production and silica flux associated with the retreat of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, and seasonal sea-ice changes along the EAM. This information is invaluable for assessing cryospheric-oceanographic variation and, therefore, the local and regional response to this period of rapid climate change. Varves are made up of lamina couplets comprising (i) thickly laminated to thinly bedded orange/orange-brown very pure diatom ooze dominated by Hyalochaete Chaetoceros spp. vegetative cells and resting spores, and (ii) brown/blue-grey terrigenous angular quartz sand, silt and clay with an abundant mixed diatom flora. The colour variation between these two types of lamination is striking. Using floristic and textural information we interpret the diatom oozes as spring flux and the terrigenous laminae as summer flux. Each couplet pair represents one annual cycle and reflects seasonal changes in nutrient availability and stratification associated with the cyclical advance and retreat of seasonal sea-ice. The diatom oozes can reach up to ∼ 7. 5 cm in thickness indicating enormous silica flux to the sea floor associated with ice sheet retreat...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic foraminifera {{preserved}} in marine sediments archive {{the physical and}} chemical conditions under which they built their shells. To interpret the paleoceanographic information contained in fossil foraminifera, the proxy signals have to {{be attributed to the}} habitat of individual species. Much of our knowledge on habitat depth is based on indirect methods, which reconstruct the depth at which the largest portion of the shell has been calcified. However, habitat depth can be best studied by direct observations in stratified plankton nets. Here we present a synthesis of living planktonic foraminifera abundance data in vertically resolved plankton net hauls taken in the eastern North Atlantic during twelve oceanographic campaigns between 1995 and 2012. Live (cytoplasm-bearing) specimens were counted for each depth interval and the vertical habitat at each station was expressed as average living depth (ALD). This allows us to differentiate species showing an ALD consistently above 100 m (e. g. Globigerinoides ruber white and pink), indicating a shallow habitat; species occurring from the surface to the subsurface (e. g. Globigerina bulloides, Globorotalia inflata, Globorotalia truncatulinoides); and species inhabiting the subsurface (e. g. Globorotalia scitula and Globorotalia hirsuta). For 17 species with variable ALD, we assessed whether their depth habitat at a given station could be predicted by mixed layer (ML) depth, temperature in the ML and chlorophyll a concentration in the ML. The influence of seasonal and lunar cycle on the depth habitat was also tested using periodic regression. In 11 out of the 17 tested species, ALD variation appears to have a predictable component. All of the tested parameters were significant at least in one case, with both <b>seasonal</b> and lunar <b>cyclicity</b> as well as the environmental parameters being able to explain up to > 50 % of the variance. Whereas G. truncatulinoides, G. hirsuta and G. scitula appear to deepen their living depth towards the summer, populations of Trilobatus sacculifer appear to descend in the water column towards the new moon. In all other species, properties of the mixed layer explained more of the observed variance. Chlorophyll a concentration seems least important for ALD, whilst shoaling of the habitat with deepening of the ML is observed most frequently. We observe both shoaling and deepening of species habitat with increasing temperature. Further, we observe that temperature and seawater density at the depth of the ALD were not equally variable among the studied species, and their variability showed no consistent relationship with depth habitat. According to our results, depth habitat of individual species changes in response to different environmental and ontogenetic factors and consequently planktonic foraminifera exhibit not only species-specific mean habitat depths but also species-specific changes in habitat depth...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Inclined heterolithic {{stratification}} (interbedded {{sand and}} mud with depositional dip; IHS) is developed on an in-channel {{bar in the}} tide-influenced, fluvially dominated (brackish water) reach of the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. The vertical bar succession {{is characterized by a}} fining-upward profile with an increase in mud content and mud-bed thickness from the shallow subtidal zone to the upper intertidal zone. There is also {{an increase in the number}} and lateral continuity of mud beds from the upstream side to the downstream side of the bar. Sand beds are dominated by current ripples in the intertidal zone, and by current ripples and trough cross-beds in the shallow subtidal zone. The channel base is mantled by downstream (ebb) -oriented dune-scale bedforms. Mud beds are dominantly parallel laminated, although current ripples may develop in silt-rich and sand-rich mud beds. Current-generated bedforms are predominantly ebb-oriented. Sediment deposition is seasonally controlled. Sand deposition occurs during periods of high discharge (snowmelt-induced freshet), and mud is deposited during waning freshet flow and low discharge (base flow). In mud-dominated deposits, current ripples may develop in sand-rich mud beds deposited during the freshet. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> in sediment deposition is also recorded in the ichnological characteristics of the IHS. Bioturbation is significantly more common in base-flow deposits (mud beds) than freshet deposits (sand beds). Burrows in sand beds typically subtend from overlying mud beds. Diminutive, vertical burrows dominate the trace suite, reflecting a very low diversity of infauna. Bioturbation is more common on the downstream side of the bar, associated with the thicker and more laterally contiguous mud beds...|$|E

Furthermore, human infections resulting from direct contact with infected birds/poultry pose a serious public health threat. From November 2003 to March 2007, a total of 3345 H 5 N 1 outbreaks were reported worldwide. Spatial and temporal patterns can provide clues in understanding the dynamics of disease spread. However, little {{has been done to}} explore these patterns of H 5 N 1 outbreaks during this period at the global scale. The objective of this research is to detect spatial, temporal and space-time clustering using geostatistical methods. Data from histological confirmed cases of H 5 N 1 were obtained from a Dutch web site and a Google earth data. Kernel estimation, G and F functions were used to test the first-order and the second-order spatial clustering respectively. An autocorrelation function and a periodogram were used to detect the temporal clustering. In addition, Knox’s test, space-time K-function and space-time scan statistics were used to explore the space-time clustering. The Monte Carlo simulation was used to test the significance of the clustering. Examination of spatial and temporal patterns indicates significant spatial clustering and <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity.</b> The Monte Carlo test revealed strong evidence for space-time clustering of H 5 N 1 cases and the location of significant space-time clusters were detected.

40|$|Magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios {{exhibit a}} strong {{temperature}} dependence in foraminifera and corals, {{but not in}} bivalve mollusks. Various studies have reported Mg/Ca-temperature relationships with R 2 values ranging from 0. 8 to 0. 3, and significantly different relationships for bivalves growing at different salinities were reported. However, this poor temperature correlation does not render Mg/Ca data useless. A weak temperature dependence would allow time (seasons and years) to be determined along the growth axis of shells. This would provide information about age, growth rate and also allow other proxies to be aligned with time. Previous {{studies have shown that}} Mg/Ca ratios can indeed be used for this purpose in a gastropod and pen shell (Pinna); these studies hand drilled powders from the shells and analyzed them using wet chemistry, which is relatively time consuming. Line scans using laser ablation systems can cover several centimeters of shell in a few minutes. If line scans could be used to put calendar dates on shell material it would allow very rapid assessment of the aforementioned variables. We test this method on the resilifer of two oyster species (Crassostrea gigas and C. virginica) using a CETAC LSX 213 laser ablation system coupled to a PE Elan 6000 DRC ICP-MS. Shells of both species exhibit annual cyclicity in Mg/Ca ratios using spot and line scan laser sampling, which matches the <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> determined using stable oxygen isotopes.

The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognised as {{an important component of}} catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity.

Four adult specimens were collected live from Stetson Bank {{in the northwestern}} Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2003. Shells were sampled along axes of growth to produce time-series profiles spanning up to 8 years. δ 18 O and Sr/Ca profiles show <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> modified by fast summer and slow winter shell growth. The profiles were combined to estimate paleosalinity. This yields variable results that overestimate salinity range; nevertheless, annual salinity minima and maxima are still evident. The overestimates are attributed to interspecimen Sr/Ca variability and error in the δ 18 Osw-salinity regression. Profiles of δ 13 C show seasonal variation superimposed on a decreasing ontogenetic trend, the latter ascribed to decreasing metabolic efficiency also reflected by an ontogenetic increase in Sr/Ca. Seasonal δ 13 C variation reflects changes in the δ 13 C of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 CDIC). Salinity and δ 13 CDIC at Stetson Bank strongly correlate (R 2 = 0. 80, p < 0. 0001), and shell δ 13 C minima coincide with local salinity minima following times of peak river discharge. These δ 13 C minima terminate during annual shelf current reversals. Low-salinity waters directly account for less than half the variability in shell δ 13 C but enhance summer stratification and trap respired CO 2 from sediment pore waters.

Re-evaluating the geochemical data in light of this density anomaly reveals, with few exceptions, little difference between the typical modern growth and the relatively high density period between 1940 and 1970.

40|$|The newly {{introduced}} temperature proxy, the tetraether {{index of}} archaeal lipids with 86 carbon atoms (TEX 86), {{is based on}} the number of cyclopentane moieties in the glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids of marine Crenarchaeota. The composition of sedimentary GDGTs used for TEX 86 paleothermometry is thought to reflect sea surface temperature (SST). However, marine Crenarchaeota occur ubiquitously in the world oceans over the entire depth range and not just in surface waters. We analyzed the GDGT distribution in settling particulate organic matter collected in sediment traps from the northeastern Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Sea to investigate the seasonal and spatial distribution of the fluxes of crenarchaeotal GDGTs and the origin of the TEX 86 signal transported to the sediment. In both settings the TEX 86 measured at all trap deployment depths reflects SST. In the Arabian Sea, analysis of an annual time series showed that the SST estimate based on TEX 86 in the shallowest trap at 500 m followed the in situ SST with a 1 to 3 week time delay, likely caused by the relatively low settling speed of sinking particles. This revealed that the GDGT signal that reaches deeper water is derived from the upper water column rather than in situ production of GDGTs. The GDGT temperature signal in deeper traps at 1500 m and 3000 m did not show a <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> observed in the 500 m trap but rather reflected the annual mean SST.

At Solfatara the station is operative since July 2004 and acquires scenes of the SE inner slope of Solfatara where are located the major fumaroles at an average distance of about 300 m from the IR camera. The camera at Pisciarelli is operative since October 2006 and acquires scenes of the outer eastern flank of the Solfatara tuff-cone (average distance of fumaroles is about 130 m), corresponding to an area characterized by heavy water vapor and CO 2 emissions. To obtain {{as much as possible}} accurate temperature values which can be representative of surface temperatures of fumaroles fields, time series of raw IR scenes has been processed with integrated methodologies. Briefly these methodologies are based on Standard Deviation filtering (as SD represents a quality parameter), background correction of the temperature values and periodicities removal using Matlab tools. The data representation, using an average moving window, show a pattern without evidence of the major <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity,</b> although it still contains minor cyclicity probably due to endogenous factors and, particularly at Pisciarelli, it evidences significant temperature peak values on August 2009 and a gradual increase of temperatures from November 2010 till now. In order to strengthen the significance of data from IR thermal analysis, a comparison with deformational pattern has been carried out using both High-Resolution Spotlight TerraSAR-X data, processed using the Small Baseline Subset algorithm (SBAS) implemented on the DLR’s operational InSAR software GENESIS, and data from continuous GPS stations operated by the INGV – Osservatorio Vesuviano. The comparison has shown similar patterns from InSAR and GPS time series and IR temperature time series, suggesting as ground deformations and surface temperatures of fumaroles fields likely represent comparable responses to volcanic processes of the Campi Flegrei area...|$|E
40|$|Core {{samples were}} {{collected}} in September 1995 from live coral heads of Montastraea annularis at Bird Key reef in the Dry Tortugas, Florida (24 degrees 55 minutes N, 82 degrees 92 minutes W). Four 4 mm-thick coral slabs from two cores were continuously sampled at 12 samples per year (0. 025 cm per sample for Core 31, 0. 023 cm per sample for Core 35). Visual inspection of X-radiographs indicates an average skeletal extension rate of about 3 mm per year in Bird Key corals. The goal {{of this study was}} to perform a replication test in Montastraea annularis by using elemental and stable isotopes from four coral slabs from two different coral heads to address the following questions: 1) how well do geochemical signals replicate within a single coral head, 2) how well do geochemical signals replicate from two different cores from the same coral head, 3) how well do geochemical signals replicate from two coral heads from the same general area, and 4) do growth effects influence the geochemistry of slow-growing corals at the Dry Tortugas? Geochemical variations versus depth and time of all coral records show strong <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity.</b> Variations in d 18 O in the suite of Bird Key coral records replicate the best; d 13 C and Sr/Ca variations replicate less well. For example, differences in the mean Sr/Ca record from two different coral heads are large (0. 179 mmol/mol for BK 31 B-BK 35 CC; 0. 196 mmol/mol for BK 31 C-BK 35 CC; ~ 4 degrees C) and nearly 4 times greater than analytical precision. Therefore, caution must be exercised in interpreting Sr/Ca-SST records in Montastraea annularis. Mean differences in coral d 18 O for all records, on the other hand, are within analytical precision and translate to temperature differences of less than 0. 5 degrees C. Robust d 18 O values among cores that co-vary with a significant level of agreement further point to this proxy being more reliable than Sr/Ca. Because of its skeletal complexity, drilling difficulty, and large bio-geological error for Sr/Ca, Montastraea annularis seems poorly suited for coral-based Sr/Ca-SST studies. However, the species must be studied to understand tropical Atlantic interannual-decadal scale variability, so further assessment is warranted...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the composition of the demersal fish fauna in coastal marine waters in temperate Australia changes markedly with increasing water depth and distance from the shore and whether the composition of the fish fauna in water depths of 5 to 35 m undergoes cyclic, seasonal changes. Samples of demersal fishes were therefore collected by trawling over the predominantly sandy substrate at nine sites located in water depths of 5 to 15 m or 20 to 35 m and within 20 km of the shore in four regions along ~ 200 km on the lower west coast of Australia. The sampling regime involved trawling for fishes at each site at night in seven consecutive seasons between the summer of 1990 / 1991 and winter of 1992. A total of 72 435 fishes, representing 77 families, 143 genera and 172 species was caught. The compositions of the fish faunas in offshore waters with depths of 5 to 35 m were shown to differ markedly from those previously recorded for nearshore marine waters in the same regions. However, as some species; such as Sillago burrus, S. vittata, S. bassensis and Rhabdosargus sarba, increase in size, they move out from their nursery areas in nearshore waters into deeper and more offshore waters, where spawning occurs. Ordination showed that, in each of the four regions, the composition of the fish fauna in depths of 5 to 15 m differs from that in depths of 20 to 35 m. This difference is attributable to the fact that some species, such as S. burrus, S. vittata and Upeneichthys lineatus, are far more abundant in depths of 5 to 15 m, whereas other species, such as S. robusta, U. stotti and Lepidotrigla modesta, occur predominantly in depths of 20 to 35 m. However, the samples collected from the single site that was inshore but in deeper water demonstrate that the composition of the fish fauna is influenced by distance from shore as well as by water depth. The compositions of the fish faunas differed with latitude, largely due to the fact that some subtropical species, such as Polyspina piosae, S. burrus and S. robusta, did not extend down into the more southern regions. Ordination also showed that the composition of the fish faunas at all but one of the nine sites underwent pronounced and consistent cyclic, seasonal changes. This <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> at the different sites was attributable to sequential patterns of immigrations and emigrations by a number of fish species during the course of the year. These seasonal migrations involved, inter alia (1) movements of certain species from their nursery areas into these deeper waters, e. g. S. bassensis and Scobinichthys granulatus; (2) migrations into and off the sandy areas of the inner continental shelf, e. g. Arnoglossus muelleri; (3) migrations to spawning areas, e. g. Sillago robusta; and (4) movements into areas where detached macrophytes accumulate in winter, e. g. Cnidoglanis macrocephalus and Apogon rueppellii...|$|E
40|$|In mammals sex {{chromosomes}} {{direct and}} initiate {{the development of}} male and female gonads and subsequently secondary sex characteristics. In most vertebrates each individual is pre-destined to either become male or female. The process by which this genetic decision is carried out takes place during the embryonic development and involves a wide range of genes. The fushi tarazu factor- 1 (FTZ-F 1) is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor, which in mammals has proven to be essential for gonad development and directs the differentiation of testicular Sertoli cells. A mammalian FTZ-F 1 homologue subtype, steroidogenic factor- 1 (SF- 1), {{is a member of the}} nuclear receptor 5 A 1 (NR 5 A 1) group and regulate several enzymes involved in steroid hormone synthesis. It also regulates the expression of the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor GnRHr and the β-subunit of the luteinizing hormone (LH), indicating that it functions at all levels of the reproductive axis. Another mammalian FTZ-F 1 subtype, NR 5 A 2, is in contrast to SF- 1, not linked to steroidogenesis or sex determination. Rather, NR 5 A 2 is involved in cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis in liver. Hormones and environmental factors such as temperature and pH can influence teleost development and reproductive traits, rendering them vulnerable to pollutants and climate changes. Very little is known about teleost FTZ-F 1 expression, regulation and function. In this thesis, expression patterns of four zebrafish FTZ-F 1 genes (ff 1 a, b, c and d) and two Arctic char genes (acFF 1 α and β) were studied during development, displaying complex embryonic expression patterns. Ff 1 a expression was in part congruent with expression of both mammalian NR 5 A 1 and NR 5 A 2 genes but also displayed novel expression domains. The complexity of the expression pattern of ff 1 a led to the conclusion that the gene may be involved in several developmental processes, including gonad development, which also was indicated by its transcriptional regulation via Sox 9 a. Two ff 1 a homologues were also cloned in Arctic char and were shown to be involved in the reproductive cycle, as the expression displayed <b>seasonal</b> <b>cyclicity</b> and preceded that of the down stream steroidogenic genes StAR and CYP 11 A. High levels were correlated to elevated plasma levels of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT) in males and 17 β-estradiol (E 2) in females respectively. Treatment with 11 KT did not affect FTZ-F 1 expression directly but was indicated to alter expression of CYP 11 A and 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. E 2 treatment was indicated to down-regulate the expression of testicular FTZ-F 1, which may contribute to the feminising effect previously observed in E 2 treated salmonids. Ff 1 d is a novel FTZ-F 1 gene, expressed in pituitary and interrenal cells during development, suggesting steroidogenic functions. In adult testis and ovary ff 1 d was co-expressed with anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), a gene connected to sex determination in mammals and previously not characterised in teleost fish. The co-expression between ff 1 d and AMH was found in Sertoli and granulosa cells, which is congruent with the co-expression of mammalian SF- 1 and AMH. This suggests that ff 1 d and AMH may have similar functions in teleost sex differentiation and reproduction, as their mammalian homologues. In conclusion, this study present data that connects members of the teleost FTZ-F 1 family to reproduction, cholesterol metabolism and sex determination and differentiation...|$|E
