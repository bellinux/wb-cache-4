40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical case study using the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) technique in retrofitting the large cabinet fans and airflow channels in malt processing air-conditioning systems {{in order to get}} uniform airflow field, to increase fan capacity and reduce energy consumption. <b>Site</b> <b>measurements</b> were used to validate the models before they were used. CFD simulation results were used to evaluate and optimise the design and construction of splitter vanes in the airflow channels and scrolls of the fans. Simulation tests showed that the fan capacity (maximum total air flow rate delivered at full fan speed) could be increased by 8. 3 - 20 % using different shapes of scroll, and 30 - 34 % by adding splitter vanes further in the airflow channels. After retrofitting the fans and airflow channels, <b>site</b> <b>measurements</b> showed that the fan capacity increased 21 - 24 and 28 - 29 %, respectively in the two buildings validated. The approach of using the CFD technique in the retrofitting, the simulation results, and the <b>site</b> <b>measurements</b> before and after fan retrofitting are presented and compared in this paper.

MethodsCBCT reformatted images of five skulls were obtained using 40, 20 and 7 s exposure protocols. From these protocols, edentulous ridge dimensions were recorded by two observers and compared with measurements recorded directly from the bone. The measurement errors and intra- and inter-examiner reliability were calculated for each exposure protocol and compared with each other. ResultsThe mean absolute errors from the 40, 20 and 7 s protocols were 0. 50, 0. 46, and 0. 51 mm, respectively. The intra-examiner reliability scores were 0. 996, 0. 995 and 0. 998, respectively. The inter-examiner reliability scores were 0. 993, 0. 998 and 0. 994, respectively. There {{was no significant difference}} in accuracy or reliability between the three protocols.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to construct dynamic models for large industrial and commercial facilities commonly {{connected to power}} transmission systems.

40|$|The {{need for}} precise {{predictions}} of acoustic isolation is increasingly growing {{due to the}} application of current regulations, focused on guaranteeing a certain comfort (or health) level for final users.

40|$|Galahad is {{an ongoing}} Specific Targeted Research Project {{developed}} within the EU 6 th Framework Programme ¿ Priority 1. 1. 6. 3. The objective is to retrieve, {{through the use of}} improved GB-SAR and TLS technologies, field parameters {{that can be used in}} prediction algorithms of landslides, avalanches and glaciers related hazards. The landslide study area is located in the ski resort of Formigal, central Pyrenees (province of Huesca, Spain). The excavation of a parking area in the summer of 2004 reactivated a complex paleolandslide creating new sliding surfaces. The movement extends over an area of 0. 25 km 2 and experienced displacements as large as 0. 5 cm/day during the period 2004 ¿ 2005. Stabilization engineering solutions were carried out reducing maximum observed displacement to 0. 2 cm/day at the end of 2005. Within Galahad performed activities consisted in the collection of data on the landslide useful for its detailed characterization and the execution of a series of <b>site</b> <b>measurement</b> campaigns with GB-SAR, TLS and Differential GPS (D-GPS). The monitoring activities started in May 2006 completing a series of four campaigns with Total Station and D-GPS, a continuous two month data acquisition with GB-SAR and several TLS scans during two different periods from three points of view over the landslide. In this paper data obtained by GB-SAR and TLS are compared with D-GPS data, and a good agreement has been found between data sets. The project is still in progress and new <b>site</b> <b>measurement</b> campaigns with GB-SAR, TLS and D-GPS in 2007 will provide further insight into landslide forecasting models. JRC.
