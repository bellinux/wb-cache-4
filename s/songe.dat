25|$|With Jean Cocteau, whom he {{had first}} met in 1915, Satie started work on {{incidental}} music for a production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, resulting in the Cinq grimaces pour Le <b>songe</b> d'une nuit d'été. From 1916, he and Cocteau worked on the ballet Parade, which was premiered in 1917 by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, with sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide Massine. Through Picasso, Satie also became acquainted with other cubists, such as Georges Braque, with whom he would work on other, aborted, projects.|$|E
25|$|His {{first serious}} work was a {{translation}} or {{adaptation of the}} Eunuchus of Terence (1654). At this time the patron of French writing was the Superintendent Fouquet, to whom La Fontaine was introduced by Jacques Jannart, a connection of his wife's. Few people who paid their court to Fouquet went away empty-handed, and La Fontaine soon received a pension of 1000 livres (1659), on the easy terms of a copy of verses for each quarters receipt. He also began a medley of prose and poetry, entitled Le <b>Songe</b> de Vaux, on Fouquet's famous country house.|$|E
25|$|The first {{complete}} English metrical psalter and {{the first}} to include musical notation was The Psalter of Dauid newely translated into Englysh metre in such sort that it maye the more decently, and wyth more delyte of the mynde, be reade and <b>songe</b> of al men. Printed in 1549, it was the work of Robert Crowley and was printed by him, Richard Grafton and/or Stephen Mierdman. Crowley's psalter is a rare example of two-color printing (red and black on the first four leaves) in this era, which makes it visually resemble medieval manuscript psalters. (Christopher Tye and Francis Seager later included musical notation in their psalters, and the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter eventually incorporated a basic tune with the Anglo-Genevan edition of 1556. John Day's The Whole Book of Psalmes (1562) contained sixty-five psalm tunes.) Crowley also included a calendar for calculating feast days as in the Book of Common Prayer, to which Crowley's psalter appears to be intended as a supplement.|$|E

500|$|On 10 July 1914, Helgoland {{left the}} Jade Estuary {{to take part}} in the annual summer {{training}} cruise to Norway. The fleet, along with several German U-boats, assembled at Skagen on 12 July to practice torpedo boat attacks, individual ship maneuvers, and searchlight techniques. The fleet arrived at the Fjord of <b>Songe</b> by 18 July, but Helgoland had to wait until after midnight for a harbor pilot to guide her into the confined waters of the fjord. Helgoland joined , the light cruiser , and the Kaiser's yacht [...] in Balholm. That same day, Helgoland took on 1250tons of coal from a Norwegian collier. The following morning Helgoland was joined by her sister , and the two ships sailed back to Germany, arriving on the morning of 22 July. On the evening of 1 August, the captain announced to the crew that the Kaiser had ordered the navy to prepare for hostilities with the Russian Navy.|$|E
500|$|Rumors that Isabeau and Orléans were lovers {{began to}} circulate, a {{relationship}} that was considered incestuous. Whether the two were intimate has been questioned by contemporary historians, including Gibbons who believes the rumor may have been planted as propaganda against Isabeau as retaliation against tax increases she and Orléans ordered in 1405. An Augustinian friar, Jacques Legrand, preached a long sermon to the court denouncing excess and depravity, in particular mentioning Isabeau and her fashions—with exposed necks, shoulders and décolletage. The monk presented his sermon as allegory {{so as not to}} offend Isabeau overtly, but he cast her and her ladies-in-waiting as [...] "furious, vengeful characters". He said to Isabeau, [...] "If you don't believe me, go out into the city disguised as a poor woman, and you will hear what everyone is saying." [...] Thus he accused Isabeau as having lost touch with the commoners and the court with its subjects. At about the same time a satirical political pamphlet, <b>Songe</b> Veritable, now considered by historians to be pro-Burgundian propaganda, was released and widely distributed in Paris. The pamphlet hinted at the Queen's relations with Orléans.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long before}} Saint-Léon's death, Petipa was named Premier Maître de Ballet of the St. Peterbsurg Imperial Theatres. Petipa then staged {{a new version}} of his Don Quixote for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, and for this {{production}} Minkus completely reworked and expanded his score. This staging of Don Quixote premiered on , and instantly became a classic, earning Minkus great acclaim for his effective music. With the death of Cesare Pugni in January 1870 the official post of ballet composer was left vacant. With the success of his score for Petipa's Don Quixote, Minkus was now named Ballet Composer of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, which marked the beginning of a long and productive collaboration between him and Petipa. They would go on to produce La Camargo in 1872, an expanded four-act production of [...] Jacques Offenbach's Le Papillon in 1874, Les Brigands (The Bandits) in 1875, Les Aventures de Pélée (The Adventures of Peleus), Le <b>Songe</b> d’une nuit d’été (A Midsummer Night's Dream, based on Felix Mendelssohn's incidental music) in 1876, and finally La Bayadère in 1877, which would prove to be Petipa and Minkus's most enduring and well preserved work.|$|E
