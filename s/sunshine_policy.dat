5|$|There {{are many}} North Korean tobacco companies, making some 30 {{different}} types of cigarettes, with the biggest tobacco company being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation. Some companies export tobacco to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the Taedong River Tobacco Company and the Rason Shinhung Tobacco Company, both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin Tobacco. British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, {{during the years of}} the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy,</b> high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> was {{questioned}} by American newspaper The Village Voice, which cited the money transfers and the coverup of atrocities in the North.|$|E
25|$|During the 1998-2007 <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> era, North Korea and South Korea symbolically marched as {{one team}} at the opening ceremonies of the 2000 and 2004 Olympics; but competed separately.|$|E
30|$|The {{relatively}} short period of <b>sunshine</b> <b>policies</b> in South Korea following the German example by Kim Dae-Jung (1998 - 2003) and his (Kim 1994), tragically ended successor Roh Moo-Hyun (2003 - 2008) could not change the basic political structures, as could be seen by the two successive presidential elections (Song and Werning 2012).|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{the tour}} visited Asia {{for the first}} time for the Dubai Desert Classic. By 1990, there were 38 events on the schedule, {{including}} 37 in Europe, and {{the start of the season}} had moved up to February. A first visit to East Asia for the Tour occurred at the 1992 Johnnie Walker Classic in Bangkok. This has since proven to be one of the most notable initiatives in the history of the tour, as East Asia is becoming almost its second home. Shortly afterwards the tour also made its debut in the former Soviet Bloc at the 1994 Czech Open, but much less has come of this development as participation in golf in the former Soviet region remains low and sponsors there are unable to compete financially with their Western European rivals for the limited number of slots available on the main tour each summer. However, the second-tier Challenge Tour has visited Central and Eastern Europe somewhat more frequently. In 1995, the European Tour began a policy of co-sanctioning tournaments with other PGA Tours, by endorsing the South African PGA Championship on the Southern African Tour (now the <b>Sunshine</b> Tour). This <b>policy</b> was extended to the PGA Tour of Australasia in 1996, and most extensively to the Asian Tour.|$|R
25|$|North Korean {{efforts to}} build nuclear weapons were halted under the Agreed Framework, {{negotiated}} with U.S. president Bill Clinton and signed in 1994. Building on Nordpolitik, South Korea began to engage with the North {{as part of its}} <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{continuation}} of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> under the Roh administration, it was eventually declared a failure by the Ministry of Unification in November 2010 over issues of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, stymied further negotiations, and newly strained relations between the two Koreas.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} environment {{changed with the}} election of U.S. president George W. Bush in 2001. His administration rejected South Korea's <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> and the Agreed Framework. The U.S. government treated North Korea as a rogue state, while they subsequently redoubled their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons {{in order to avoid the}} fate of Iraq. On 9 October 2006, North Korea announced it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test.|$|E
25|$|The ascendency of the Korean People's Army {{concerns}} South Korea, {{and ties}} {{into the debate}} over the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy,</b> its most recent vision of Korean reunification. Given North Korea's insistence that songun will facilitate reunification, it is difficult to tell what they expect in the future from South Korea, whose government is not at all supportive of songun policies, {{going so far as to}} outlaw websites within South Korea that promote North Korea's military-first ideas.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{stance of}} both the South and North Korean governments has been against the continuing balloon drops. However, the South Korean government has been hesitant {{to intervene in the}} launches by activists due to concerns about freedom of expression. However, some actions by officials, like banning the use of boats in balloon launches, have greatly reduced the amount of leaflets flying into North Korea. In recent years, there have been few cases of official leaflet droppings by either state. However, government organized psychological warfare between the Korean states largely disappeared {{in the aftermath of the}} <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy,</b> regardless of renewed tensions since.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> {{argue that}} {{dialogue}} and trade with North Korea {{did nothing to}} improve prospects for peaceful reunification, despite the transfer of large funds to the North Korean government by President Kim Dae-jung, and only allowed the North Korean government to retain its hold on power. Others, such as the Saenuri Party, believe South Korea should remain prepared for {{the event of a}} North Korean attack. Hardline policy supporters also argue that the continued and maximised isolation of the North will lead to the country's collapse, after which the territory could be absorbed by force into the Republic of Korea.|$|E
25|$|Balloon drops were {{organized}} by the South Korean state {{until the beginning of}} the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> under the Kim Dae-jung administration. Both Koreas halted psychological warfare for the duration of 2004–2010; in addition to balloons, this prohibited radio broadcasts, billboards and loudspeakers on the DMZ. The North Korean state had originally demanded that as a precondition for the first Inter-Korean summit in 2000, and the request was later accepted by the Kim Dae-jung administration. After the Yeonpyeong incident in 2010, balloon drops {{were organized}} by the defense ministry in late 2010 for some time, but they have since been suspended again after having lasted for a year.|$|E
25|$|Emory's {{diversity}} and academic reputation flourished {{under the leadership}} of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961-1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on {{to play a major role}} in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the 8th President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy.</b> Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009.|$|E
25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{primarily}} {{engages in}} information warfare rather than overt actions {{to topple the}} government. They smuggle information {{in and out of}} North Korea. This includes participating in balloon drops. Balloon drops— containing candy, pornographic pictures and propaganda leaflets— were previously performed by the South Korean government, but since the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> under the Kim Dae-jung administration, the balloon drops have been done only unofficially under human rights and defector groups. While releasing balloons is not illegal, the South Korean government often tries to stop balloon releases. Other activities of the North Korean People's Liberation Front include firing squad stage performances of the Kim family members, and smuggling various kinds of media across the North Korean border through China. For instance, in 2014 they sent 6,000 laptops to North Korea, and in early 2015, they smuggled 800 copies of The Interview into North Korea across the border. In 2010, they uncovered a plan by the North Korean National Security Council to disrupt the G20 summit in Seoul.|$|E
2500|$|Kim {{called for}} {{restraint}} against the North Koreans for detonating {{a nuclear weapon}} and defended the continued <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> towards Pyongyang to defuse the crisis, but there is ongoing debate about whether the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> facilitated Pyongyang's nuclear programs. He also received an honorary doctorate at the University of Portland on 17 April 2008 where he delivered his speech, [...] "Challenge, Response, and God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roh dubbed his {{administration}} the [...] "Participatory Government," [...] and entered office intent on introducing an ambitious new agenda. Policy {{goals for the}} Roh administration included the continuance of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> of engagement towards North Korea, the establishment of Korea as a business hub in Northeast Asia, the expansion of social welfare, the pursuit of [...] "balanced national development" [...] to help underdeveloped areas, the eradication of corruption, reform of education and tax systems, reform of labor-management relations, reform of mass media, and a recasting of {{the relationship with the}} United States and Japan.|$|E
2500|$|In diplomacy, Kim Dae-jung {{pursued the}} [...] "Sunshine Policy", {{a series of}} efforts to {{reconcile}} with North Korea. This culminated in reunions of the separated families of the Korean War and a summit talk with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. For these efforts, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000. However, between a lack of peaceful cooperation from North Korea and {{the terrorist attacks on}} the United States on September 11, 2001, changing the view of the U.S. on North Korea, the efficacy of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> was brought into question. With added allegations of corruption, support waned in the later years of the administration.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced by the Millennium Democratic Party under President Kim Dae-jung, {{as part of}} a {{campaign}} pledge to [...] "actively pursue reconciliation and cooperation" [...] with North Korea, the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> was intended to create conditions of economic assistance and cooperation for reunification, rather than sanctions and military threats. The plan was divided into three parts: increased cooperation through inter-Korean organizations (while maintaining separate systems in the North and South), national unification with two autonomous regional governments, and finally the creation of a central national government. In 1998, Kim approved large shipments of food aid to the North Korean government, lifted limits on business deals between North Korean and South Korean firms, and even called for a stop to the American economic embargo against the North. In June 2000, the leaders of North and South Korea met in Pyongyang and shook hands {{for the first time since}} the division of Korea.|$|E
2500|$|His {{policy of}} {{engagement}} with North Korea has been termed the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy.</b> He moved to begin détente with the communist government in North Korea, which culminated in a historic summit meeting in 2000 in Pyongyang with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. This marked a critical juncture in inter-Korean relations, and the two Koreas have had direct {{contact with each other}} since. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts. However, the historic event was tainted significantly by allegations that at least several hundred million dollars had been paid to Pyongyang. His Chief of Staff, Park Ji-Won, was sentenced to twelve years in prison in 2003 for, among other charges, his role in the Hyundai payment to North Korea for the North–South summit. Also in order to persuade North Korea to attend the summit, several [...] "unconverted long-term prisoners" [...] kept by South Korea were released and returned to North Korea.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung {{initiated}} the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> which aimed to foster better {{relations with the}} North. However, in the aftermath the September 11 attacks, U.S. President George W Bush {{did not support the}} policy and in 2002 branded North Korea as a member of an [...] "Axis of Evil". The <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> was formally abandoned by South Korean President Lee Myung-bak after his election in 2007.|$|E

50|$|The Republic of Korea's 1980s {{policy of}} Nordpolitik was named in allusion to Ostpolitik; a similar concept is <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy,</b> the {{successor}} to Nordpolitik.|$|E
50|$|US President George W Bush, however, did {{not support}} the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> and in 2002 branded North Korea as a member of an Axis of Evil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> instituted by South Korean {{president}} Kim Dae-jung in 1998 was {{a watershed}} in inter-Korean relations. It encouraged {{other countries to}} engage with the North, which allowed Pyongyang to normalize relations {{with a number of}} European Union states and contributed to the establishment of joint North-South economic projects. The culmination of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> was the 2000 Inter-Korean Summit, when Kim Dae-jung visited Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. On 4 October 2007, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Jong-il signed an eight-point peace agreement.|$|E
5000|$|Kim {{called for}} {{restraint}} against the North Koreans for detonating {{a nuclear weapon}} and defended the continued <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> towards Pyongyang to defuse the crisis. He promised all Koreans {{that he would take}} active responsibility if North Korea ever tried to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, but there is ongoing debate about whether the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> facilitated Pyongyang's nuclear programs. He also received an honorary doctorate at the University of Portland on 17 April 2008 where he delivered his speech, [...] "Challenge, Response, and God." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite {{both the}} {{positive}} and negative reactions and criticism about the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> there is still debates going on even today about the effectiveness of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy.</b> Even the antagonists of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> were in an agreement that the humanitarian emergency aid that was released from the international community as well as South Korea contributed to the relief of North Korea’s great famine {{during the time of the}} late 1990s. The fact of the matter was though that the ensuing cooperation policies produced a backlash to goodwill argument stating that the government guided economic assistance and also direct investment instead saved or even brought back the hyper militarized North Korean regime. Which because of this delays the inevitable economic reforms, which in turn consequently stalled the nuclear crisis. This debate now had entered a very decisive combination. The latest supposedly alleged hydrogen bomb test seemed to very much falsify the effectiveness and also the ability to produce a desired result of positive inducement policies based on the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy.</b> The Idea was, was that South Korean economics assistance could succeed in persuading North Korea’s post communist reform and opening. Which would hopefully promote peace between North Korea and South Korea. Even with all this effort and good intentions that were put into the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy,</b> the policy itself began to fall apart and would soon be no more. The South Korean government officially acknowledged the reverse effects of both the current and existing inducement approaches. The President of Korea at the time President Park Geun hye even stated during this time “Gone are the days when we caved into the North’s provocations and unconditionally pumped aid into the North” This statement was given as an address to the National Assembly in South Korea. Because of this critical reappraisal this led to the complete shutdown of the Kaeseong Industrial Complex. The Kaeseong Industrial Complex was the very last symbol of the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy.</b> The building was eventually closed on February 11th 2016. One of the reasons it is thought to believe that the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> failed was because of North Korea itself. It was believed that North Korea was a difficult aid partner. Another reason was that there existed a lack of international unity or teamwork if you will among the donor’s policy goals. This decreased the effectiveness of the aid which also seemed to make the problem of politicized aid even worse than it already was.|$|E
50|$|The North Korean {{foreign policy}} is still {{dominated}} by this original document, {{which has led to}} better relations with South Korea, beginning with Kim Dae-jung's <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy,</b> and in the June 15th North-South Joint Declaration.|$|E
50|$|In November 2010, Unification Ministry officially {{declared}} the <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> a failure, thus bringing the policy to an end. On November 23, 2010, North Korean artillery shelled Yeonpyeong {{with dozens of}} rounds at Yeonpyeong-ri and the surrounding area.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, South Korea's <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Policy</b> towards North Korea was {{abolished}} as {{tensions between the}} two countries continued to increase. As a result, Psy was questioned by the media on several occasions regarding his views on North Korea.|$|E
