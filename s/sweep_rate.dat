40|$|The {{dynamics}} of magnetic hysteresis, including the training effect {{and the field}} <b>sweep</b> <b>rate</b> dependence of the exchange bias, is experimentally investigated in exchange-coupled potassium split graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We find that, at low field <b>sweep</b> <b>rate,</b> the pronounced absolute training effect is present over {{a large number of}} cycles. This is reflected in a gradual decrease of the exchange bias with the sequential field cycling. However, at high field <b>sweep</b> <b>rate</b> above 0. 5 T/min, the training effect is not prominent. With the increase in field <b>sweep</b> <b>rate,</b> the average value of exchange bias field grows and is found to follow power law behavior. The response of the exchange bias field to the field <b>sweep</b> <b>rate</b> variation is linked to the difference {{in the time it takes}} to perform a hysteresis loop measurement compared with the relaxation time of the anti-ferromagnetically aligned spins.
