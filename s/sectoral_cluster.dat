The benefits generated by increased <b>sectoral</b> <b>clustering,</b> though positive and highly significant are modest and geographically very limited.

Article 11 provided the legal framework for the establishment of ten (10) <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Cluster</b> Committees as key operational mechanisms of ECOSOCC to formulate opinions and provide inputs into the policies and programmes of the African Union. Article 11(c) then spells out the core areas of the mandate of the Infrastructure and Energy Cluster as including Energy, Transport, Communication, Infrastructure and Tourism etc.As such, we have also embraced the need for us to be conscious of the environmental impact of Infrastructure Development on Climate Change and factors propagating it. Thus, our efforts are to be in promotion of ensuring that these developments are implemented {{in the spirit of the}} African Common Position on Climate Change. This will be manifested in the formulation of policies on key infrastructure issues such as the production of an Africa Sustainable Transport Policy etc. b) The Committee also recognized the need for its programmes and workplan to give priority to programs on forging partnerships with Continental Stakeholders, Air Access and transport, Climate Change, Renewable Energy and Tourism. Agenda 2063 was the guiding document throughout deliberations for the work plan.II. On Structure and Category of MembershipThe Cluster devised a generic framework for <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Cluster</b> Committees and proposed the same to be adopted by other clusters to ensure homogeneity in cluster composition and operations.

40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{development}} prospects of the Russian economy and the economy of its individual branches in the regions is highly relevant {{in terms of the}} increasing crises and economic development challenges. The scope of the study is a garment industry of the Siberian Federal District, which includes 12 subjects, and only six of them develop the garment industry actively. There are the regions of Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai and the Republic of Khakassia. The subject matter of the research is the state and prospects of the garment industry of the Siberian Federal District. It also includes the assessment of the garment industry as one of the sub-sectors of the light industry in terms of its competitiveness in the domestic market. The purpose of the comprehensive study is to determine the conditions and factors affecting the development of the industry, as well as to identify its development reserves and competitiveness on the basis of industrial cluster’s generation. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} in the Siberian Federal District, there are a need and reserves to create a cluster of the garment industry. The main methods of the study are the comparative analysis, the expert assessment of the sector in certain regions of the Siberian Federal District, as well as the assessment of possible formation of the industrial cluster in the region. The results of the study are the evaluation of the competitiveness and prospects of the garment industry in Russia and the Siberian Federal District (a low level of development and competitiveness); the evaluation of the development level of the garment industry in the Federal District, which have showed the demand for apparel products from the population and enterprises, as well as the conditions for the provision of clothing manufacture with natural fabrics and synthetic materials, labor resources and research and development achievements; also the justification of the existing potential for development of a <b>sectoral</b> <b>cluster</b> by means of pooling together the productions and economic communications of the Novosibirsk and Omsk regions at the initial stage. The obtained results should be used to strengthen works for the development of regional industrial cluster (with a creation of a working group at the regional governments, the garment industry development programs, and practical measures for its realization), as well as a creation of conditions for stimulation of investment activity of entrepreneurs. The research has confirmed the hypothesis, that in the Siberian Federal District, there are a need and reserves to create a cluster of the garment industry...|$|E

Regional innovation system initiatives which aim at increasing the innovative capacity regions have been implemented in the West for a long time. Examining the successful cases and defining the success factors of past experiences will shed light on new efforts on establishing regional innovation systems. In Turkey, efforts of building regional innovation systems have recently increased. This study aims to provide several policy recommendations on the successful formation and implementation of regional innovation systems with the help of Western experiences. In the study, the concept of regional innovation system is examined in detail in terms of its emergence, elements, success conditions and policies. As a result of the study, it is concluded that four factor became prominent in building regional innovation system and gaining regional competitive advantage. These factors are (i) region-specific <b>sectoral</b> <b>clusters,</b> (ii) local and global networks, (iii) education/science infrastructure and links with university, and (iv) entrepreneurship supporting policies. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} concentration and sectoral specialisation of local enterprises (LEs) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Ireland.

Correlation coefficients are calculated to estimate the co-location patterns of LEs and MNEs, allowing {{an investigation of the}} overall impact of stated industrial and regional policy goals on the Irish manufacturing sector. The pattern of spatial changes found suggests that market forces were already driving enterprises out of more concentrated locations prior to the introduction of policies to promote greater spatial dispersion in the late 1990 s. MNEs have become more sectorally specialised over the period, which is not surprising as policy is deliberately selective in attracting MNEs to key high tech manufacturing sectors. The less concentrated sectoral pattern amongst LEs enterprises is consistent with general restructuring in Irish manufacturing from lower- to higher-tech sectors, and the high sectoral correlation for high-tech MNEs and LEs suggests that LEs are following MNEs into the same sectors. geographic concentration, sectoral specialisation, entropy indices, MNEs, LEs, public policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper contextualizes how place {{branding}} {{and image}} influence {{the development of}} Dubai’s key <b>sectoral</b> <b>clusters,</b> including the key determinants of growth and success under the impression of Porter’s cluster theory. The approach is exploratory and of a qualitative inductive nature. Data was collected through conducting 21 semi-structured interviews with Dubai’s marketing/communication managers and stakeholders. Findings suggest that Dubai’s traditional clusters, namely, trading, tourism and logistics that have strong place branding and image show strong signs of success owing to Dubai’s geographical location (i. e., physical conditions). Among the new clusters, the financial sector is also benefitting from place branding. The {{results suggest that the}} success of traditional clusters have a positive spill over effect on the new clusters, in particular on construction and real estate. For policy makers it is worth to note that the recent success of the financial services cluster in Dubai will have positive impact on both, the traditional as well new clusters. The marketing and brand communication managers must consider the correlation and interplay of strength of activities amongst trading, tourism and logistics clusters and its implication while undertaking place branding for clients in their sector...|$|R
40|$|In the article, {{the effect}} of {{interaction}} between the development level of regional innovative capacity and its innovative and institutional infrastructure is traced. The research objective is to prove the hypothesis of the essential impact of the regional institutional and information environment on its innovative capacity, the identification of {{the effect of}} their systemsupplementing interaction. From the standpoint of the methodology of system-structural research its components are allocated within the innovative capacity of the regional innovative system (RIS), they are presented by a corporate sector, the structures of small and medium business, and also by the subjects of ethnic economy. The use of essential-analytical and functional approaches has revealed the leading role of intangible assets of the corporate sector of the economy in region’s innovative development. The correlation and regression analysis has confirmed the essential dependence of the innovative activity of the region on the systemic completeness of the development of its institutional and infrastructure environment. The results of the research have shown that to ensure the system-supplementing effect of the interaction between innovative capacity and the factors of its activation in the sphere of institutional infrastructure, it is necessary to consistently develop its operational base — the institutions of RIS. The recommendations reasoned in the article may be used for the development of regional innovation strategies, the formation of innovation clusters. The three-component structure of the innovation cluster of the region is offered; its integrating function in relation to the innovative components of the regional <b>sectoral</b> <b>clusters</b> is determined. The factors constraining the growth of innovation activity of the regional economic subjects are revealed and the recommendations {{on the development of the}} institutional and infrastructural environment of the Rostov region are substantiated...|$|R

This region was created by a {{co-operation}} project 10 years ago, and also functions today including Vienna and other Austrian provinces such as Lower Austria and Burgenland, the region of South-Moravia in the Czech Republic, the region of Bratislava and Trnava in Slovakia, Győr-Moson-Sopron and Vas counties in Hungary, and cities of Eisenstadt, St. Pölten, Brno, Bratislava and Trnava. The main objective {{of this study is}} to examine the implementing sectoral co-operation projects of R&D and tertiary education activities between the higher education institutions of the region and the intensity of these relations. Furthermore, we also concentrate on the depth of regional integration and networking from the point of view of the relationships in higher education, particularly the strength and the weaknesses of bilateral and multilateral relations, and also the absence of co-operation in different areas. Recent mobility surveys found that the rate of student mobility is low between the institutions in the region and there are no mutual exchange programs. The language barriers and the deficiency of the institutions' attractiveness were defined as the main reasons of the low mobility besides the lack of frequent relations. Although <b>sectoral</b> <b>clusters</b> were established inside the region with the membership of higher education institutions, the demand of regional co-operation in the institutions' strategies is unknown, and there are no available pieces of information about data sharing and long-term co-operation between the institutions in the functioning clusters (i. e. automotive industry). It must be examined what the main criteria are in the election of partners for current projects and how extended is the mutual partnership in the projects of the regional institutions. It is an essential analysis viewpoint whether there is a difference between higher education institutions with regard to the above depending on the location of the institution (including the relationships between the HEI's in own countries) and how this affects cross-border regional relationships. To sum up, the study is intended to provide answers to how and in what areas sectoral co-operation exists in the region between the higher education institutions and what the rate of these projects is comparing all projects of the institution, as well as to define the leading sectors of the co-operations...|$|R

Alternatively, the community structure, which is specified by complex properties based on the sector, geography and other economic attributes, constitutes the most suitable way to represent clusters of suppliers and customers. In this manuscript, our contribution is to understand the forces behind the formation of ties based on the community structure rather than on <b>sectoral</b> or geographical <b>clusters</b> as in the previous literature. Our main finding is that some attributes, such as reciprocity, location homophily and bank homophily, are common drivers of the formation of ties within communities, whereas the effects of some other attributes, such as transitivity and sector homophily, are heterogeneous among different communities.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{a longitudinal}} series of Ankara apartment houses using space syntax methodology {{to uncover the}} underlying genotype and its transformation over time. The results indicate that transition-space-centred organization is the underlying spatial structure for 20 th-century Ankara apartments. Diachronic examination of the sample in terms of <b>sectoral</b> differentiation—that is, <b>clustering</b> of spaces based on functional and social requirements, and {{in relation to the}} exterior—has identified three groups: (a)  the houses from the 1920 s with no sector differentiation and one entrance; (b)  the houses from the 1930 s, 1940 s, 1950 s, and 1960 s with different sectors and multiple entrances; (c)  the houses from the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s with different sectors and one entrance.

40|$|This paper applies multivariate {{analysis}} {{to a rich}} data set on technological innovation, {{in order to identify}} typical patterns of technological change. To single out the dominant forms of technological behaviour, twelve variables have been selected approximating firms' technological sources and innovation results. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify six main clusters or dominant technological profiles. Each cluster was then interpreted {{on the basis of a}} larger set of variables concerning firms' technological and economic performance. The results confirm recent emphasis placed by scholars of technical change on variety of bchaviour in technical change and industrial organization and, more specifically, Pavitt's seminal attempt at a classification of this variety. However, our clusters are somewhat more numerous than Pavitt's, thus showing a more complex combination of technological input and output. Moreover, representative industries of each cluster are less easily recognized as a less marked <b>sectoral</b> characterization of <b>clusters</b> emerges. The latter result seems to imply that variety in technological change is also shown by the existence of different technological trajectories and strategies within the same sector. We suggest that the diffuse nature of recent technical change has given firms greater freedom of strategic choice among different technological strategies...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{economic}} policy faces {{the challenge of}} two competing policy goals - reducing regional economic disparities vs. promoting economic growth. The allocation of public funds has to weigh these goals particularly under the restriction of scarce financial re- sources. If, however, some region {{turns out to be}} a regional growth pole with positive spillovers to its disadvantaged periphery, regional policies could be designed to recon- cile the conflicting targets. In this case, peripheral regions could indirectly participate in the economic development of their growing cores. We start our investigation by defining and identifying such growth poles among German regions on the NUTS 3 administrative level based on spatial and <b>sectoral</b> effects. Using <b>cluster</b> analysis, we determine significant characteristics for the general identification of growth poles. Patterns in the sectoral change are identified by means of the change in the employment. Finally, we analyze whether and to what extent these growth poles ex- ert spatial spillover effects on neighbouring regions and thus mitigate contradictory in- terests in regional public policy. For this purpose, we apply a Spatial-Cross-Regressive- Model (SCR-Model) including the change in the secondary sector which allows to con- sider functional economic relations on the administrative level chosen (NUTS 3). size and spatial distributions of regional economic activity, cross-sectional models, spatial models, treatment effect models, regional analyses, urban analyses, rural analyses...|$|R
40|$|Not {{only are}} low income states {{performing}} poorly {{in terms of}} indicators of human wellbeing but they perform equally abysmally in terms of indicators of technology. Table 1 : The technological divide between high- and low-income countries. Table I demonstrates just how much technological indicators mirror the poor performance and endorsement at the human resource level. In most instances the final column {{on the right of}} the table demonstrates that indicators for developing states are a fraction, often a tiny fraction, of those for developed states. Whilst the importance of specific indicators may be disputed as may the absolute gaps, the general message is indisputable ? resources, infrastructure and support in developing states are inadequate (and frequently inappropriate) for fostering innovative systems. The enormous technological divide between high and low-income countries is also reflected in a marked discrepancy between the research agendas and the research needs of the developing world. Over the years, efforts to harness the potential of S&T for the transformation of low income states have been hampered by the usual suspects identified in the development literature, namely lack of an enabling environment and inadequate priority research and development. The latter allocation problem is evident from a cursory scan of the data. Recent work points to the low priority accorded to S&T as a major source of the problem. A CTA commissioned review by University of Maastricht, for example, suggests that S&T plans in ACP states little, if any, mention of S&T let alone cite it as a priority. This omission is also a reflection of shifting priorities which is evident among the donor group. Additionally, there has been a steady decline in both agricultural research and ACP technology development through the 1980 s and 1990 s. This is the case although agriculture has been recognized as worthy of being crucial in any of attempt {{to come to grips with}} food security and endemic famine in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This lack of interest in S&T has been partly the result of disillusionment with returns on previous investments in S&T as well as ideological shifts which have redefined the role of the state in favour of sponsoring free market and private sector primacy. In the case of the low income states, however, the expected benefits of the market liberalisation and international trade in particular, have failed to materialize either in terms of improved levels of income and welfare or in terms of spawning innovation systems. The universal agreement on the redefined role of the state in low income states remains elusive and this is reflected in a need to establish consistent development priorities and to provide for both state and private sector development by establishing an appropriate enabling environment. Latterly for most regional and international organisations, ?knowledge as the key to socio-economic development? is now firmly ensconced in their policy agendas and work programmes. For example, the New Partnership for Africa?s Development (NEPAD) recently created the African Forum on Science and Technology for Development (AFSTD) to provide African leaders with advice on science and technology issues. This Forum is intended to be a platform for facilitating multi-stakeholder policy dialogue and for identifying strategies for harnessing science and technology to alleviate poverty and achieve economic growth. Moving from such grand visions to operational projects is not an easy task. In so far as information policy is concerned some of the main causes of failed S&T policy implementation have been insufficient ownership of plans/programmes as well as with inadequate networking and dialogue. Another consequence of inadequate consultation in policy preparation is the fashioning of incomplete/inappropriate policies. In recognition of this, CTA has been directing its energies to encouraging and facilitating demand-driven (participatory) approaches to S&T and especially efforts to make the process of S&T plan-formulation inclusive. In this context, it means involving farmers/representatives and other agri-food actors and stakeholders, scientists/researchers and policy makers in the process. For ACP countries, developing national S&T policy agendas in collaboration with all stakeholders is a challenge. National S&T policies and plans will undoubtedly enhance the ability of ACP countries to pay greater attention to S&T in their agricultural sector policies and programmes. Cotonou requires multi-stakeholder participation and dialogue in the process of preparing Country Strategy Papers. Without properly enunciated and inclusive country strategy plans, support for S&T capacity building programmes under the Cotonou Agreement would be elusive. With the aid of its platforms for dialogue, the Centre can facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences as an important part of the process of defining priorities. It can help to identify the stakeholders in the agricultural sector who may be in a position to contribute and participate in the dialogue. Two useful assets of the CTA in this context are its extensive contacts data base and its established role as an honest broker between agriculture professionals and between the ACP and the EU. The ACP includes numerous small states in terms of both physical and population size as well as GNP. For such states it is very difficult to exploit the economies of scale associated with most research and technology activities. ACP states have long recognised the value of regional integration in such circumstances. An additional consideration emerging from research on enterprise clusters is the finding that the grouping of enterprises into <b>sectoral</b> and geographic <b>clusters</b> gives rise to synergies, enhances efficiency and competitiveness and fosters industrialisation. In the light of this, contiguous states would be well advised to spare no effort to ensure complementarity in their research programmes since there could be invaluable spill-over benefits and externalities from such complementarity. On this front, CTA?s efforts can facilitate the sharing of national experiences and enhance the extent and depth of intra-ACP, ACP-EU and ACP 3 rd party dialogue and exchange of experience. The CTA?s mission as set out in Cotonou requires the Centre to lend its support to national efforts to improve policy-making capacity in Information Communications Management (ICM) and in tackling poverty. For all of these reasons the CTA has been following with keen interest, efforts at national and supra-national levels to redress the neglect of S&T in agriculture. The Centre?s programme on S&T is intended to provide support to ACP states and actors by raising awareness of the importance of S&T to enhancing productivity in agriculture, in particular. As a complement to such efforts, the Centre has also been supporting an initiative to diagnose the experience of previous national efforts and to highlight and apply the lessons where appropriate. Against this backdrop, CTA has launched its S&T programme. That programme will provide policy assistance to ACP countries in developing their national agricultural S&T policies, programmes and strategies. CTA aims to provide information services on, S&T issues; raise the awareness of S&T and its potential, facilitate dialogue and foster closer collaboration among the ACP scientific community and between the ACP and European Research areas. Wageningen, 15 November 2003. The widely publicized revolution in technology, particularly in the areas of information communications and bio-technology, has rekindled interest in the potential of Science and Technology (S&T) to raise the rate of economic and social development and transformation of low income states.
