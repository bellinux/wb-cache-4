40|$|This work {{presents}} a feasibility study for steering delaminations through {{the thickness of}} composite laminates. The mechanism relies {{on the fact that}} delaminations tend not to migrate through plies with fibres oriented in the propagation direction. In this study, plies with fibres oriented in the propagation direction are angled through the thickness in order to steer delamination migration. Both <b>static</b> <b>tests</b> (<b>mode</b> I) and fatigue tests (skin-stiffener debond specimen) have shown the feasibility of this mechanism.

40|$|The damage {{tolerance}} of safety-critical aerospace structures is {{of paramount importance}} to ensure the airworthiness and safe operation of an aircraft. The ongoing transition from metallic to composite airframes requires a change in design philosophy to accommodate the fundamentally different behavior of composite structures in the event of damage, if future designs are not to be constrained or compromised, resulting in an inability to fully exploit the significant potential offered by composites. This work presents a feasibility study for an innovative method by which delaminations (a fundamental damage mechanism) can be steered through the thickness of a composite laminate. Plies with fibers oriented in the propagation direction are angled through the thickness in order to guide delamination migration. <b>Static</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>mode</b> 1) has shown the viability of this mechanism. In addition, a significant increase in fracture toughness, ranging from 88 to 269 % (depending on the configuration), is observed due to delamination branching and steering away from the preferential propagation plane. Tensile and flexural testing have been performed in order to quantify the effect of this innovative architecture on the global mechanical properties. A significant knockdown in longitudinal tensile strength by up to 57 % has been observed, whereas the effect on stiffness and flexural properties seems to be less significant. In addition, the potential of applying the steering mechanism in skin-stiffener debond specimens under fatigue loading has been successfully demonstrated. Similar stiffness decay as for the baseline configuration was observed over 40, 000 cycles. The work in this study illustrates the potential for tailored fiber architectures, with a through-thickness feature, to provide a viable mechanism for steering critical damage into designated regions that are nonstructural or contain added functionality to mitigate that damage...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{through-thickness}} reinforcement method {{proposed by}} S. Kravchenko et al., has been <b>static</b> <b>tested</b> under <b>mode</b> II loading using end notched flexure (ENF), unidirectional laminate specimens {{to determine the}} impact on the apparent critical fracture toughness (GIIc) for the material tested. Both experimental and numerical methods have been employed in an attempt to characterize and model these effects. Testing and analysis were conducted on two different specimen thickness, 2. 34 mm and 3. 54 mm nominally. ASTM D 7905 / 7905 M – 14 was followed during the experimental portion of the thick specimens. Multiple reinforcing configurations using the proposed technique were experimentally tested including single, double, and quadruple rows of orthogonal, pultruded carbon/epoxy pins located within the crack and ahead of the crack (pristine material) to determine the effect on the apparent critical fracture toughness for each configuration. Both pre-cracked and no pre-cracked specimens were evaluated. The results {{of this study indicate that}} specimens pinned in the crack experienced the highest supportable reaction force such that the crack was completely arrested and most of the specimens failed in flexure. Pre-cracked specimens that were pinned in the body exhibited stable crack growth as well as a shadowing phenomenon. Both pins and the crack surface topography due to this phenomenon are attributed to the increased apparent fracture toughness for these specimens. Similar outcomes were observed through numerical simulations for the models simulated in this study. ...|$|R

In the present work, several rheological tests were carried out at 20 °C, by using the stress controlled rheometer AR 2000, on the fresh cement pastes incorporating 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of MK. Effect of metakaolin on the rheological behaviour of cement pastes were discussed. Rheological parameters such as viscosity, compliance, loss and storage shear modulus are evaluated by means of rheological techniques of both flow and creep/recovery <b>tests</b> (<b>static</b> <b>mode)</b> and oscillatory <b>test</b> (dynamic <b>mode).</b> Shear moduli allow to give information {{on the evolution of}} the paste structure related to practically interesting problems such as workability. The results obtained have shown that MK improves the flowability and exhibits viscous rheological behaviour of cement pastes over elastic behaviour of control paste (0 %MK). Moreover, the creep/recovery test show that the addition of MK exhibits a behaviour of viscoelastic liquid of cement pastes compared to a viscoelastic solid behaviour of control paste.
