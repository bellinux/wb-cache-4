50|$|In June 2015 Montagu Private Equity {{sold the}} {{university}} to Global University Systems (GUS) for an undisclosed <b>sum.</b> Former <b>UK</b> Education and Employment Secretary and Home Secretary David Blunkett, {{at the time a}} visiting lecturer at the London School of Business and Finance (also owned by Global University Systems), was named Chairman of the Board. GUS began a programme of restructuring its UK holdings with the intention of making the University of Law the company's sole provider of academic qualifications and professional qualifications, including the master's degrees previously offered by the London School of Business and Finance. The University of Law announced the launch of its De Broc School of Business in July 2015 but had to defer the first intake of students (originally planned for September of that year) due to low student recruitment.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012, Cleveland Police {{admitted}} liability for [...] "malicious prosecution" [...] and {{were ordered to}} pay out over £841,000, {{one of the largest}} compensation <b>sums</b> in <b>UK</b> police history. The court was told former PC Sultan Alam was [...] "stitched up" [...] by fellow officers after he launched industrial tribunal proceedings in 1993, complaining of racial discrimination following a series of incidents that included a Ku Klux Klan poster being left on his desk. Cleveland Police admitted that officers suppressed evidence that lead to Mr Alam being wrongfully imprisoned for conspiracy to steal motor parts and enduring a 17-year battle to clear his name. Mr Alam, who is considering a position in public office, does not believe that the force had improved and stated that racism had gone [...] "underground", with ethnic minorities being denied the same opportunities as their white colleagues.|$|R

30|$|Studies of past {{space weather}} {{events in the}} United Kingdom (UK), such as McKay (2003) and Turnbull (2010, 2011), have {{modelled}} the impacts on simplified versions of the high-voltage transmission system in the UK, using basic representations of the conductivity structure {{of the land and}} bathymetry of the offshore continental shelf (Beamish et al. 2002). These models were able to reproduce GIC values measured in Scotland during the October 2003 storm (Thomson et al. 2005). Measured GIC (three phases <b>summed)</b> in the <b>UK</b> during the October 2003 event reached a peak of 40 A in one high-voltage node.|$|R

30|$|The overall {{conclusion}} [38] {{was that the}} UK Foresight Programme achieved its objectives of identifying ways in which future science and technology could address future challenges for society, and identifying potential opportunities. All projects were successful in mobilising diverse groups of specialists (senior policymakers, scientists, business representatives) {{to work in a}} multidisciplinary framework and across disciplinary boundaries. In the evaluation report, it was stated that such mobilisation could probably not have been achieved by conventional research programmes. With regard to the cost-effectiveness, it was underlined that the approach adopted in the overall process was “fit-for-purpose,” and it delivered high quality outputs and offered good value for money. However, at the same time, it was emphasised that some projects were moderately under-resourced, and, as a result, the most costly ones had the greatest impact. According to the evaluation team, the management structure also needed improvement. There was an imbalance between the supply of projects and the demand resulting in the under-exploitation of foresight potential. A modest expansion was recommended, with one more project undertaken each year, with a commensurate expansion of management and executive resources. To <b>sum</b> up, <b>UK</b> Foresight created a process for original thinking in government and particularly for the application of science based evidence and foresight techniques to policy issues.|$|R
3000|$|For the {{purposes}} of the analysis, the five study samples were merged. To avoid biasing estimates toward the studies with a larger sample size, we assigned a study weight to each individual such that the sum of weights for each study would be the same. For example, each participant from the UK with valid data for the first analysis (n =  15, 835) was assigned a weight of 1000 / 15, 835, or [...]. 0632, so that the <b>sum</b> of <b>UK</b> participants’ weights equals 1000, while each participant from the USA for the same analysis (n =  1249) was assigned a weight of 1000 / 1249, or [...]. 8006, so that the sum of USA participants’ weights equals 1000 as well. We did not use the studies’ sampling weights (which generally account for sampling procedure, acceptance, and attrition), because not all studies were constructed to be representative of the population (please see Table  2 for more detail about representativeness of each sample). The analyses are “complete cases” analyses, that is, only participants with non-missing data on both the outcome and the 6 predictors were included. Although we recognize that this may introduce a certain level of bias, it was not feasible, given the scope of the project (integrating the data from 5 separate longitudinal studies) to use accepted methods to deal with missing data, such as multiple imputation.|$|R
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial <b>sum</b> in the <b>UK</b> paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|R
40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{are very important}} corporate events for both acquirers and targets, {{and the quality of}} public accounting information has a significant role in mergers {{and acquisitions}} decisions. Acting on the shareholders’ behalf or pursuing their self-interests, targets’ managers have strong incentives to manipulate reported earnings prior to a deal in order to boost the stock price and generate higher gains for shareholders and themselves. Consistent with this view, researchers have dedicated much effort to examining whether acquirers and targets undertake earnings manipulation around takeovers. The objective of this thesis is to examine whether UK publicly listed targets engage in accruals and real-activity earnings management prior to M&A, and the consequences this has on targets’ shareholder wealth, in particular deal premium and stock return. Earnings management can occur through two main channels: accruals earnings management and real-activity earnings management. These two main earnings management tactics differ in their opacity, cost and the effect they cause to stock price performance prior to M&A (Roychowdhury et al., 2012). Most of the previous studies on this subject have focused exclusively on accruals earnings management, however, the evidence shows that opportunistic accruals earnings management is not a common practice among targets in M&A. More recent research on earnings management provides evidence that firms use multiple earnings manipulation strategies based on accruals and real-activities (e. g., Graham et al., 2005; Roychowdhury, 2006; Cohen and Zarowin, 2010; Zang, 2011), and managers prefer real-activities manipulation over accruals earnings manipulation as a way to increase reported earnings (Graham et al., 2005). The first empirical study of this thesis examines whether UK publicly listed targets attempt to manipulate earnings via accruals prior to a deal, and further, investigates the relationship between the deal premium and the targets’ earnings management behaviour. The results of the accruals tests under the cross-sectional modified-Jones model and performance-matched model, and using either the balance-sheet approach or the cash-flow approach, indicate that, on average, targets do not manage earnings upward prior to mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, the analysis of the relationship between earnings management and deal premium provides evidence that the deal premium and the targets’ abnormal accruals are negatively related, which is consistent with the view that acquirers take into consideration the quality of targets’ earnings in making takeover decisions (e. g., Anilowski et al., 2009; Raman et al., 2013). The evidence in this study also suggests that the deal premium constrains targets’ accruals earnings management and acts as a strong disincentive to manipulate earnings. Consequently, the cost of detection explanation for the lack of earnings management by UK targets appears capable of explaining this relationship between the deal premium and the abnormal accruals of targets. The second empirical study builds on the results of the previous research, which finds no evidence of accruals manipulation by UK targets in M&A, and explores a potential explanation of this phenomenon. Specifically, this study examines whether firm diversification has an impact on earnings management by targets in M&A. An explicit distinction between industrial and geographical diversification is made in this study. Prior research provides evidence that the mode of diversification, such as industrial vs. geographical, can explain the difference in the correlation between discretionary accruals and diversification due to {{whether or not they are}} in different industry segments and/or whether business units are located in different countries (Kim and Kim, 2001). Using a panel data framework for a sample of publicly listed targets, the results of this empirical study suggest that industrial diversification mitigates earnings management prior to mergers and acquisitions. In addition, the results also show that a combination of industrial and geographical diversification alleviates earnings management. However, there is no clear empirical evidence that geographical diversification facilitates or mitigates earnings management. These results are consistent with those reported in Jiraporn et al. (2008) and El Mehdi and Seboui (2011), who find that industrial diversification decreases earnings management by US firms. Finally, the third empirical study investigates the earnings management behaviour of UK targets in M&A, in particular combined and simple strategies based on accruals and real-activities, and the impact of earnings management on targets’ stock overvaluation at the time of a deal. Prior literature provides evidence that at times of heightened scrutiny, such as M&A, earnings management via accruals is unlikely to be a dominant source of overvaluation (e. g., Cohen and Zarowin, 2010; Roychowdhury et al., 2012). Consistent with this view, the results of this study, which were derived from a panel data regression analysis, show that if targets engage in income-increasing earnings management, they are more likely to use combined strategies of earnings management via both accruals and real-activities simultaneously rather than simple strategies based solely on either accruals or real-activities. Furthermore, managers’ propensity to engage in combined strategies of earnings management prior to M&A is significantly higher than the propensity for accruals earnings management, despite the high and long-term costs of this earnings management method. Furthermore, the stock return tests performed in this study provide evidence that firms which exhibit evidence of combined earnings management strategies tend to be the most overvalued targets prior to M&A which is consistent with those results reported by Roychowdhury et al. (2012). To <b>sum</b> up, <b>UK</b> publicly listed targets are more likely to utilise combined earnings management strategies based on accruals and real-activities prior to a takeover, and these targets’ shareholders appear to gain the most if they sell their shares before the deal announcement. However, accruals earnings management as a sole method of earnings manipulation is not a widespread practice in UK mergers and acquisitions, and the deal premium constrains the targets’ accruals earnings management behaviour. If earnings manipulation by targets is detected, acquirers might adapt their takeover strategies by adjusting the deal price downward. Finally, industrial diversification mitigates earnings management by UK targets prior to mergers and acquisitions. Given the significant negative wealth consequences of both accruals and real-activity earnings manipulation, the findings of this thesis emphasise the fact that targets’ shareholders, board of directors and auditors, as well as financial advisors need to be alert to managers attempting to engage in earnings management via accruals, but also carefully monitor real-activities. Furthermore, investors, acquirers and financial analysts should be fully aware of the existence and severity of targets’ stock overvaluation when they make or facilitate important investment decisions. ...|$|R
