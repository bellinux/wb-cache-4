By comparing in each case the values of the horizon area and Wald's entropy, we discuss the validity of such relation in the presence of higher derivative corrections for extremal black holes in many different contexts: in the presence of electric and magnetic charges, for nonsupersymmetric and supersymmetric black holes, in d= 4 and d= 5 dimensions. The examples we consider seem to indicate that this relation is not verified in the presence of α' corrections in general, although being valid in some specific cases (electrically charged maximally supersymmetric black holes in d= 5).

Faced with this scenario, electricity utilities naturally opt to optimise existing RoW with the consequence that distances between transmission lines in the same RoW are being pushed to the limits. The concern however, for transmission lines located in close proximity with each other is that at non-dc frequency, they will influence each other through electromagnetic <b>coupling.</b> <b>Of</b> interest also is the effect, if any at all, <b>of</b> the resulting <b>coupling</b> on the protection system <b>of</b> the <b>coupled</b> circuit. Svenska Kraftnät (SvK), the Swedish National Grid company, is currently working to expand the existing monopolar 400 kV, 600 MW Fenno-Skan HVDC link between Sweden and Finland into a bipolar ± 500 kV, 1400 MW link. As one consequence of this expansion, two <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> mutually <b>coupled</b> overhead lines will be created; one <b>coupled</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> about 53 km will be formed between the second pole (new pole) of the ± 500 kV HVDC link and an existing 400 kV HVAC line and another coupled section between the same pole of the HVDC link with an existing 220 kV HVAC line of about 7. 5 km. The coupled sections arise since the first 70 km of the second pole of the HVDC link will be constructed as an overhead line mainly within existing RoWs before transforming into an undersea cable en-route to Finland. In this thesis, the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> transients to the HVAC lines that could arise due to a pole-toground fault occurring on the HVDC line has been studied in respect of the above mentioned coupled line <b>sections.</b> Furthermore, assessement <b>of</b> the impact <b>of</b> the <b>coupling</b> phenomenon on the ground protection of the HVAC lines {{has been carried out}}. The study has been carried out using models developed in PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB. The PSCAD/EMTDC model is detailed, taking the form of a full system representation. The MATLAB model is more of a conceptual model, based on solving a system <b>of</b> <b>coupled</b> transmission line travelling wave equations. Good agreement between results from the two models has been achieved. The conclusions of the study are that the coupling phenomenon is mainly due to coupling in zero seuqence networks. Peak values for the RMS <b>coupled</b> zero-sequence currents <b>of</b> 1200 A and 700 A for total and fundamental currents respectively can be expected. These currents are transient in nature and they decay to zero within about 60 - 80 ms.
