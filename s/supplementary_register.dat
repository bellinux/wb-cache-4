50|$|In TICA outcrossing has mainly {{been with}} the {{domestic}} short-haired cat and domestic long-haired cat, although registration rules do allow other breeds to be used and bred down from towards the F3 generation which is eligible for entry in TICA cat shows. When undertaking outcross matings to non-pedigrees, reputable breeders seek out cats closely resembling the correct LaPerm body type with coats which are not overly thick. This practice continues {{the use of the}} kind of cats which composed much of the original foundation stock for the breed and helps to maintain genetic health by using the widest gene pool available. However, in some countries, such as the UK, it is illegal to sell the kittens from such matings as pedigrees because of the Trades Description Act 1968 through which it has been established that the legal definition of a pedigree cat in the UK is one with a fully recorded three-generation pedigree. After outcrossing to a cat of unknown parentage, at least three generations must be bred to establish a full pedigree record. In Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) breeders used the Ocicat for a two-year period, terminating on 1 May 2002; LaPerms registered during this period were permitted to have an Ocicat parent, and by extension, one or two Abyssinian grandparents, as the Abyssinian is an approved outcross of the Ocicat. Currently CFA breeders may only use non-pedigree domestic cats and after 2020 no outcrosses will be permitted in CFA. However, CFA accepts LaPerms for both breeding and showing with other breeds in their pedigrees if they are imported from another registry.The GCCF has the most strict of the registration policies and only LaPerms with a full three generation pedigree (i.e. parents, grandparents and great-grandparents) of only LaPerm to LaPerm breeding are permitted on the full register. Only LaPerms or cats from a list of approved breeds are permmitted in the 4th and 5th generations. Cats with non-approved breeds anywhere within their five-generation pedigrees, particularly those with other rex genes or non-pedigree cats with unknown genotype, cannot be registered as LaPerms. In order not to cause any damaging restriction to the breed's genepool a <b>supplementary</b> <b>register</b> also exists for the registration of LaPerms bred as part of an outcross breeding program. LaPerms can only be registered on the <b>supplementary</b> <b>register</b> if within their five generation pedigrees only LaPerms and cats from the approved outcross list are present. In the GCCF this list comprises the Somali/Abyssinian, Asian/Tiffanie/(European)Burmese, Ocicat and Tonkinese. Domestic Shorthairs and Domestic Longhairs can be used in outcrossing but certain restrictions apply and the initial offspring are placed on the reference register and cannot be shown. There was also a rather small amount of use of the Old Style Siamese/Balinese/Oriental during the initial development phase of the UK breeding program, and a cutoff date for use of these breeds was built into the breeding and registration policies. In other registries the approved list (with some slight variations) is used for outcrossing and cats of unknown parentage are not permitted. In FIFe, which has its most active LaPerm breeders in Sweden and the Netherlands, outcrossing is done on a case by case basis. In antipodean countries, Somalis, Tiffanies and Orientals have also been used, but Domestic Shorthairs and Domestic Longhairs are now the preferred choice of outcross.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} form of an {{investigation}} into the lack of progress towards the professionalisation of mental nurses during the period 1850 to 1950 and concentrates on their failure to become a professional sub-group within nursing. The proposal is put forward that their relative failure to advance was {{due to the fact that}} mental nurses were controlled and dominated by other more powerful health care groups with their own agendas. These were the asylum doctors in the (Royal) Medico-Psychological Association ((R) MPA), and the doctors and general trained nurses in the General Nursing Council (GNC). During the 1850 s the (R) MPA's main concern was to raise the status of asylum doctors. The association aimed to achieve this by developing the care and treatment of the insane into another recognised speciality of medicine. To do this they needed to hospitalise the asylums, a process which would include transforming asylum attendants into qualified mental nurses. To this end a mental nursing textbook was published by the (R) MPA in 1885. This was followed by the inauguration of a national training scheme with certification for successful candidates. In order to advance the goal of hospitalisation, female nurses were introduced into male wards in many asylums. It was also asserted that the care of insane male patients was improved, a claim which led to conflicts with the trade unions, which were totally opposed to female nurses on male wards. The impact of unionisation of mental nurses will also be discussed in relationship to the struggle for professionalisation. Even when the Nurses' Registration Act 1919 was passed, mental nurses were caught in the middle of an internecine conflict over who controlled them: on one side was the GNC with its new <b>supplementary</b> <b>register</b> for mental nurses; on the other stood the (R) MPA, reluctant to give up their training and examination scheme under the conditions offered by the GNC. So a dual system of registration continued to exist until the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948. Even then mental nursing was still controlled by the general trained dominated GNC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The database {{was developed in the}} first instance as a resource for undergraduate teaching and subsequently for historical and genealogical research. The teaching aspect was {{in the context of the}} pioneering Computing for Historians programme developed at Leicester between 1988 and 2002. This required all history students to undertake database work as a core element in their degree, involving an assigned quota of data input into one of a range of departmental databases and culminating in a finals project on their designated database. From a research point of view, work on the Shelter database received an important stimulus with the discovery that a substantial proportion of the migrants recorded in the database were bound for South Africa. This discovery attracted funding from the Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town, to help speed up the input by employing three postgraduates, and it led to the mounting of a partial online version of the database in Cape Town as part of a project there to research the development of South Africa's early Jewish community at the beginning of the twentieth century. The database has subsequently been drawn on by two postgraduate theses and a number of publications. Main Topics : Between 1886 and the outbreak of war in 1914, the Poor Jews' Temporary Shelter in London provided a transitory refuge for tens of thousands of migrants arriving from Eastern Europe in search of a better life in the West. The database contains a transcription of the personal and travel details of these migrants as recorded in the Shelter's surviving registers for the period 1896 to 1914, amounting to almost 60, 000 records. Besides their name, age, place of birth, occupation, marital status, and number of children (but unfortunately not for the most part their sex), the records also indicate the migrant's date of arrival and usually of departure, the amount of money they had with them, the place they were last from and sometimes the ship on which they arrived, and a London address at which they were staying or a destination for which they were bound elsewhere. For migrants travelling on to other countries, the ship on which they left is often given, particularly for those bound for South Africa, where the database makes clear the Shelter's important links with the Union and Castle shipping lines. There are also sometimes miscellaneous notes recording individual circumstances, such as a relative to whom the migrant was going. Derived columns have been added to the database to help identify migrants travelling together in family groups, and to link records in cases where a migrant's arrival was entered in both a main and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>register...</b>|$|E

Eight hundred and ninety-one (65 %) respondents worked in primary care, and 333 (24 · 3 %) worked in secondary care. Three quarters of the sample had more than 5 -year clinical experience in the area in which they prescribed prior to entering the prescribing programme. One thousand one hundred and seven (87 %) participants had used nurse independent prescribing and 568 (44 · 6 %) nurse supplementary prescribing. Restriction of local arrangements, implementation of the Clinical Management Plan and access to doctors hampered or prevented prescribing. Conclusion. The adoption of prescribing by nurses in the United Kingdom has increased patient choice with regard to access to medicines.

40|$|Standard X-ray imaging {{techniques}} using CCDs require {{the integration of}} thousands of X-ray photons into a single image frame. Through {{the addition of a}} scintillating layer to the CCD it is possible to greatly increase the X-ray detection efficiency at high energies. Using standard {{imaging techniques}} with the inclusion of the scintillating layer does, however, leave serious limitations on the spatial resolution achievable due to the spreading of the light generated in the scintillator. The Electron-Multiplying CCD (EM-CCD) shares much of the common architecture of the standard CCD but for the inclusion of a <b>supplementary</b> readout <b>register.</b> This additional high-voltage register allows the signal electrons to be `multiplied' before reaching the readout node of the CCD, increasing the signal before any significant noise is introduced. The increase in the signal-to-noise ratio allows very low signals to be extracted above the noise floor, leading to the common use of EM-CCDs in night-vision and security applications. Through the coupling of a scintillator to an EM-CCD it is possible to resolve individual X-ray photon interactions in the scintillator above the noise floor. Without this extra gain these low signals would be lost beneath the noise floor. Using various centroiding techniques it is possible to locate the interaction position of the incident X-ray photon in the scintillator to the sub-pixel level, with measurements here at 59. 5 keV giving an initial FWHM of the line spread function of 31 μm. This high-resolution, hard X-ray imager has many potential applications in medical and biological imaging, where energy discrimination at a high resolution is desired. Further applications include synchrotron-based research, an area in which high-resolution imaging is essential...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Virtual autopsy is a noninvasive imaging {{technique}} which allows {{a quick and}} accurate observation of internal and external body evidences. Dental identification is mainly performed by comparing ante-mortem (AM) and post-mortem (PM) identifiers such as unique characteristics of the dentition and previous treatments. These dental identifiers are registered PM through visual, photographic, and radiological examinations. Aim: To detect which dental identifiers can be observed PM on full-body Computed Tomography (CT) images. Material and methods: Retrospectively, a sample of 100 full-body CT images from deceased victims, judicially examined at the mortuary of the University Hospitals KU Leuven, was collected. An additional validation sample of 3 individuals, which were examined both clinically and on CT images, was included in order to validate the virtual findings. The bodies were scanned in a Siemens Definition Flash CT Scanner (128 -slices) with thickness of 1 mm, kV = 120, mAs = 200, collimation of 128 x 0. 6 mm, in approximately 25 seconds. The obtained images were analyzed on a Siemens Multi Modality Workplace (MMWP). InSpace® (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) software was used for 3 D reconstructions and generated axial, coronal and sagittal slices. The images were analyzed both on 8 -bit and on 12 -bit quality, using the toggle bar for higher resolution. The dental identifiers were charted on PM Interpol forms (F 1, F 2 – Pink), using the related codes. On all full body CTs a search for oral identifiers not listed in the Interpol coding was performed. Results: The full-body CTs allowed dental charting on Interpol forms. Optimal dental charting was obtained combining analyses of 3 D image reconstructions and axial, coronal and sagittal slices. Examination of the validation sample confirmed that differentiation between types of dental restoration materials was not feasible on the full body CT’s. The toggle bar for 12 -bit resolution, enabled the collection of detailed evidences such as endodontic treatments and small restorations. Several dental identifiers, not coded for in the dental Interpol forms, were registered based on the full body CT images. More specific 3 D morphology of maxillofacial structures and tooth crown, root and pulp, location of mandibular foramina, periodontal anatomy and peri-apical pathologies could be observed. Discussion: The inability to differentiate between distinct types of dental restoration materials {{could be related to}} the image resolution used in current research protocol, also to the density of restoration materials and the presence of imaging artifacts. These disadvantages could be partially settled by implementing a higher imaging resolution, making more accurate the differentiation between restoration materials. During dental identification, full body CT images allow a quick dental overview justifying an immediate search for AM dental data. Nowadays, due to the increased importance of preventive treatments, the incidence of restorative dental treatment is decreasing. Consequently, the impact of typical dental restorations on identifications of individuals will become more important. In this context, the morphological registrations of dental identifiers based on full body CT’s provide an excellent new tool for dental identification. Conclusion: PM full-body CT’s can be considered as a new tool for dental identifications, <b>registering</b> <b>supplementary</b> morphological identifiers. status: submitte...|$|R
