5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here <b>since</b> <b>we</b> established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

25|$|Whatever is {{contained}} in a clear and distinct idea of a thing must be predicated of that thing; but a clear and distinct idea of an absolutely perfect Being contains the idea of actual existence; therefore <b>since</b> <b>we</b> have {{the idea of an}} absolutely perfect Being such a Being must really exist.|$|E
25|$|Transferrin can {{instead be}} removed by size {{exclusion}} chromatography. This method {{is one of}} the more reliable chromatography techniques. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low elution times.|$|E
25|$|A {{very simple}} {{example of this}} type is an {{algorithm}} that cuts a string in half, then cuts the right half in half, and so on.

25|$|Using the Gauss {{algorithm}} {{for years}} prior to 1583 is historically pointless since the Gregorian calendar was not utilised for determining Easter before that year. Using the algorithm {{far into the future}} is questionable, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> know nothing about how different churches will define Easter that far ahead. Easter calculations are based on agreements and conventions, not on the actual celestial movements nor on indisputable facts of history.|$|E
25|$|When {{the scope}} of the physics is widened to include gravity, the {{interpretation}} of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently no compelling explanation as to why it should not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should.|$|E

25|$|Other albums {{included}} The Tokyo Concert (1973); <b>Since</b> <b>We</b> Met (1974); and But Beautiful (1974), {{featuring the}} trio plus saxophonist Stan Getz in live performances from the Netherlands and Belgium. Morell was an energetic, straight-ahead drummer, {{unlike many of}} the trio's former percussionists, and many critics feel {{that this was a}} period of little growth for Evans. After Morell left, Evans and Gómez recorded two duo albums, Intuition and Montreux III.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>we</b> {{started from}} an {{arbitrary}} partition {{and ended up}} {{as close as we}} wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann integrable.

25|$|A {{symmetric}} operator A {{is always}} closable; that is, {{the closure of}} the graph of A is the graph of an operator. A symmetric operator is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure of A is self-adjoint. Equivalently, A is essentially self-adjoint if it has a unique self-adjoint extension. In practical terms, having an essentially self-adjoint operator is almost as good as having a self-adjoint operator, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> merely need to take the closure to obtain self-adjoint operator.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve the}} problem, {{start from the}} evening {{position}} (A on the map) and treat {{the distance between the}} ship and the landmark (length AB) as the intended course, and the actual route of the ship (NW) as a deviation. To figure out the distance of the landmark from the ship's position in the morning (C) is a matter of treating the distance BC as the calculated ritorno. <b>Since</b> <b>we</b> need to know the alargar to calculate the ritorno, this is a two-step procedure.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the name}} Gentius or Genthius {{does not help}} {{to solve the problem}} <b>since</b> <b>we</b> have two Illyrian forms Genthius and Zanatis.
