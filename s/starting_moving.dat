The angle and distance {{from the center of the}} two wheels to the center of marker are also obtained using these two cameras. We propose five movement patterns for AGVs to guarantee smooth performance during path tracking: <b>starting,</b> <b>moving</b> straight, pre-turning, left/right turning, and stopping.

Since mid- 2002, Voyager 1 {{has been moving}} outward with the shock, which reached its maximum distance in mid- 2004 and <b>starting</b> <b>moving</b> back in as the solar wind pressure declined. On December 15, 2004, the intensity of low energy ions increased rapidly as the termination shock approached Voyager, and plasma waves excited by electrons streaming along the magnetic field indicated the shock was nearby. Voyager 1 crossed the inward moving shock on December 16 at 94 AU, observing the enhanced magnetic field as expected in the subsonic flow in the heliosheath. The lowest energy particles also abruptly increased with a low energy spectral slope of approximately - 1. 5, corresponding to a shock strength of 2. 5. In distinction to the upstream ions which were highly variable and strongly beamed along the magnetic field, in the heliosheath the energetic ion intensity is much less variable and more nearly isotropic, indicating a stable shock source and steady conditions for diffusive propagation. However, the low energy anomalous cosmic rays were not observed at the shock, indicating that their source region is remote from the location of Voyager 1. Continuing observations should reveal new aspects of this final frontier of the heliosphere...|$|E
40|$|Undesired air {{entrainment}} in bottom outlet conduits of dams may cause pressure transients, leading to conduit vibrations, blowback, discharge pulsation and even cavitation, and jeopardize the operational safety. Due to design limitations or construction costs, {{it is impossible}} to create an air free environment in a pressurized pipe. Therefore, it is essential to understand the air transport in enclosed pipes in order to provide guidance in bottom outlet design and operation. The commonly used criterion of the air-pocket movement in pipe flow is the water flow velocity for <b>starting</b> <b>moving</b> an air pocket, the so-called critical velocity. In this thesis, the classical Volume of Fluid (VOF) model combined with the k-ε turbulence model is adopted for the computation of the critical velocity of a 150 -mm pipe. The computed critical velocities are compared with the experimental results. The governing parameters investigated in this study include pipe slope and diameter, wall shear stress and air-pocket volume. Meanwhile, the carrying capacity (air-pocket velocity/ flow velocity) at all pipe slopes are analyzed. The simulation results of air pockets with different volumes in the bottom outlet conduit of Letten Dam in Sweden are presented in this study. Moreover, experimental study was conducted to measure the critical velocity for a 240 -mm Plexiglas pipe. The results are in agreement with the experiments performed by HR Wallingford (HRW) in 2003 in terms of the effects of pipe slope and air-pocket volume; however, the critical Froude pipe number is slightly smaller in this study. In rough pipes, a larger critical velocity is required compared with that in the smooth pipe. The removal mechanism in the rough pipe involves the successive loss of air caused by turbulence. This explains that the air-pocket size, with the dimensionless air-pocket volume n <  0. 015, has little impact on the critical velocity for the rough pipe. In addition, roughness has little impact on the air-pocket velocity when it moves upstream in the downward inclined pipe. The trapped air bubbles most likely remain permanently in the rough pipe.

40|$|Background: Child Abuse and Neglect (CAN) {{represents}} a relatively young {{theme in the}} world of research. However, more than 50 000 manuscripts dealing with it have been published since its birth, classically considered the Kempe’s paper, “The battered child syndrome”, published in 1962. Such an amount of papers has allowed the blooming of knowledge, and more and more people got involved in understanding the phenomenon. In the last few years, a decrease is observed in the interest this issue is able to evoke in the scientific community (measurable in the progressively lower number of manuscripts published). Identification of model contributors and estimation of prevalence of group and corporate authorship could represent a good tool to understand how to enhance the number of publications, considered as the currency of academic research. Objective: Aim of the present study is to draw an identikit of the model researcher involved in investigating the issue of child abuse and neglect. Method: A retrospective bibliometric analysis was carried out, utilizing the search engine of NIH, PubMed. The last 10 -year literature (1995 - 2004) was explored and the quoted phrase “Child Abuse” was searched in all available manuscripts. Starting from retrieved papers, information on authors was collected. Particular attention was paid to affiliation, country of origin, preferences shown on country of publication, tendency to publish in groups or corporate authorships. Starting from the Web of Science, 50 most prolific investigators were studied for the number of citation they showed. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results: The bibliographic research retrieved 7369 articles, with a total “horde” of 19075 authors. The main characteristic of average investigator is utilizing English as language of transmission of his/her knowledge (92. 4 %) and write alone (38 % of manuscripts have a single author; mean 2. 6 authors per paper, range 0 - 26; SD of 2). Moreover, the model researcher seems to look for journals published in English speaking countries. In fact, top five countries of publication are the US, the UK, Germany, Australia and Canada (85. 8 % English speaking, 2. 9 % German speaking). The trend is to choose traditional journals (or traditional plus e-publishing journals), instead of stand-alone e-publications (99. 9 % vs 0. 1 %). Authors show another clear tendency, i. e. to publish in their own homeland, or in a country with whom there is an historical of geographical cooperation (for example Canada and the US, India and England or Japan and Australia). Looking to the most prolific authors, the 1 st one have published, during the considered interval period, 41 manuscripts creating his own CV <b>starting</b> <b>moving</b> on the “chessboard” of author’s position during years: 1 st author in 10 manuscripts with 60 % after 2001, and 2 nd author in 23 manuscripts with 50 % published after 2001. Further result on most cited authors will follow. Conclusion: CAN seems to be an hot topic for single-author: in fact the at-a-glance picture of the published manuscripts in the considered interval period strongly highlight the scarce frequency of corporate authorships, and much more than multidisciplinary teams. A number of reflections on most prolific authors and leading investigators working-in-the-field can be drawn. The study has pointed out that both being able to speak in English and coming form the US increase the probability to be able to publish a paper on CAN. Is it a choice of authors or a protectionist policy of publishers...|$|E
