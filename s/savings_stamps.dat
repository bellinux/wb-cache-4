25|$|Women’s {{participation}} on {{the home}} front was essential to the war effort. Leading into the Second World War, the ‘breadwinner model’ indicated that married women belonged in the home, with men working. Men were supposed to work and play in the public domain with the private realm supposedly being the domain of women. The outbreak of World War II forced society to rethink women’s role outside of the home. The largest contribution by the majority of Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, through their domestic abilities and skills; women were able to support the nation and the war effort. The government called upon women to participate in volunteer programs. Women began collecting recycled items such as paper, metal, fat, bones, rags, rubber, and glass. Clothing was also collected by Canadian women for free distribution overseas. They also prepared care packages to send to the men and women overseas. Canadian women were responsible for maintaining the morale of the nation. All over Canada, women responded to demands made upon them by not only selling war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> and certificates but purchasing them as well, and collecting money to by bombers and mobile canteens. If you were a young unattached woman in 1939, the war offered unprecedented opportunities {{on the home}} front. Young women were given a chance to move away from home, go to parties and dances in the name of patriotic duty.|$|E

[...] The release noted Franklin's reputation for thrift, and expressed hope that the half dollar {{would serve as a}} reminder that spare cash should be used to purchase savings bonds and <b>savings</b> <b>stamps.</b> [...] Franklin became the fifth person and first non-president to be honored by the issuance of a regular-issue US coin, after Lincoln, Roosevelt, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.|$|E

2500|$|Morgenthau {{sought the}} aid of Peter Odegard, a {{political}} scientist specialised in propaganda, in drawing up the goals for the bond program. On the advice of Odegard the Treasury began marketing the previously successful baby bonds as [...] "defense bonds". Three new series of bond notes, Series E, F and G, would be introduced, of which Series E would be targeted at individuals as [...] "defense bonds". Like the baby bonds, they were sold {{for as little as}} $18.75 and matured in ten years, at which time the United States government paid the bondholder $25. Large denominations of between $50 and $1000 were also made available, all of which, unlike the Liberty Bonds of the First World War, were non-negotiable bonds. For those that found it difficult to purchase an entire bond at once, 10 cent <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> could be purchased and collected in Treasury approved stamp albums until the recipient had accumulated enough stamps for a bond purchase. The name of the bonds was eventually changed to War Bonds after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which resulted in the United States entering the war.|$|E
2500|$|Personal {{income was}} {{at an all-time high}}, and more dollars were chasing fewer goods to purchase. This was a recipe for {{economic}} disaster that was largely avoided because Americans—cajoled daily by their government to do so—were also saving money at an all-time high rate, mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies. Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in war bonds that would mature after the war. Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction; children collected <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> until they had enough to buy a bond. Bond rallies were held throughout the U.S. with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges—an astonishing amount in 1943. The public paid ¾ of the face value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set number of years. This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar, and allowed over 40% of GDP to go to military spending, with moderate inflation. Americans were challenged to put [...] "at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds". Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special [...] "Minuteman" [...] flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the [...] "Ten Percent Club". There were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their goals.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States Postal <b>Savings</b> <b>Stamps</b> were {{introduced}} in 1911 [...] and War <b>Savings</b> <b>Stamps</b> were issued during both World Wars. <b>Savings</b> <b>stamps</b> are worth their face amounts; the denominations are $0.10, $0.25, $0.50, $1, and $5. The sale of <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> was discontinued June 30, 1970.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} War <b>Savings</b> Certificate <b>stamps,</b> the Treasury also issued {{a set of}} 25-cent Thrift stamps, which bore no interest. The purpose of the Thrift stamps was to allow {{individuals}} without the means to purchase a War <b>Savings</b> Certificate <b>stamp</b> outright to gradually accumulate enough Thrift stamps to exchange for one later. The Treasury supplied Thrift cards, to which a total of sixteen Thrift stamps could be affixed. A full Thrift card was worth four dollars and could be combined with the appropriate number of cents to purchase a War <b>Savings</b> Certificate <b>stamp.</b>|$|R

50|$|War <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> {{were issued}} by the United States Treasury Department to help fund {{participation}} in World War I and World War II. Although these stamps were distinct from the postal <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> {{issued by the}} United States Post Office Department, the Post Office nevertheless {{played a major role}} in promoting and distributing war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps.</b> In contrast to Liberty Bonds, which were purchased primarily by financial institutions, war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> were principally aimed at common citizens. During World War I, 25-cent Thrift stamps were offered to allow individuals to accumulate enough over time to purchase the standard 5-dollar War Savings Certificate stamp. When the Treasury began issuing war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> during World War II, the lowest denomination was a 10-cent stamp, enabling ordinary citizens to purchase them. In many cases, collections of war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> could be redeemed for Treasury Certificates or War Bonds.|$|E
50|$|Promotion of war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> pervaded American culture during World War I. The Treasury Department {{established}} the War Savings Organization {{in order to}} coordinate marketing efforts throughout the nation. A wide variety of posters were produced to promote war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps,</b> often invoking a sense of patriotic duty to purchase them to support war efforts. President Woodrow Wilson called upon “every man, woman and child” to save for the war and designated June 28, 1918 as National War Savings Day. Governors, mayors, and other political leaders led by example by purchasing war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> and encouraged their constituents to do the same. The Four Minute Men organization, authorized by President Wilson, also developed a series of speech outlines related to war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> for its volunteers to deliver.|$|E

5000|$|The wuppies became {{extremely}} {{popular in the}} summer of 1981. Twenty-five years later, they made a come-back in the Netherlands. In June 2006 the Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn re-introduced the wuppies in a new campaign connected to the FIFA World Cup 2006 under the motto Wup Holland Wup, a variation of Hup Holland Hup (Go Holland Go), a Dutch patriotic song. The wuppies, produced in orange, red, white and blue were used as a kind of <b>saving</b> <b>stamp.</b> Three <b>saving</b> <b>stamps</b> together with 2,49 euros could be exchanged for one mega wup. Albert Heijns wuppie campaign with the World Cup Wuppie Song (With a Wup we will win the World Cup) proved to be immensely popular, especially the [...] "Mega Wups". Dutch media reported that cars which had a Mega Wup on their dashboards were broken into. A classroom of an elementary school in The Hague was burglarized which had a lot of wuppies exposed in the classroom. Wuppies were often given out as a prize from 1-900 numbers in the 80s.|$|R
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of [...] "Stadt des KdF-Wagens" [...] (modern-day Wolfsburg), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers. This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939. None were actually delivered to any holder of the completed <b>saving</b> <b>stamp</b> books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1944 (his 55th birthday).|$|R
50|$|The United States Treasury Department {{issued its}} first war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> in late 1917 {{in order to}} help pay for the costs {{incurred}} through involvement in World War I. The estimated cost of World War I for the United States was approximately $32 billion, and by the end of the war, the United States government had issued a total of $26.4 billion in debt. Although national campaigns had aimed to sell $2 billion in war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps,</b> they ultimately accounted for about $0.93 billion, or 3.5 percent, of the total debt issued. Despite the low proportion of total debt purchased as war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps,</b> they represented real additional savings whereas other issues were at least partly monetized already. In addition, government and society leaders utilized the war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> program as a vehicle to teach the importance of saving and thrift.|$|E
50|$|Support for war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> {{also came}} {{from a variety of}} non-government sources. Advertisements were often donated by local {{newspapers}} in order to inform people of how war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps</b> worked and to encourage their purchase. War savings societies formed within communities across the country to promote the value of thrift and to collect funds for war <b>savings</b> <b>stamps.</b> Children were also recruited to the war saving efforts primarily through their schools. Children received school kits, which included penny and nickel savings booklets so that children could save up for a 25-cent Thrift stamp a few cents at a time.|$|E
