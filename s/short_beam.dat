50|$|A {{head yoke}} fits onto {{the head of}} the oxen. It usually fits behind the horns, and has carved-out {{sections}} into which the horns fit; it may be a single beam attached to both oxen, or each ox may have a separate <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> (see picture). The yoke is then strapped to the horns of the oxen with yoke straps. Some types fit instead onto the front of the head, again strapped to the horns, and ox pads are then used for cushioning the forehead of the ox. A tug pole is held {{to the bottom of the}} yoke using yoke irons and chains. The tug pole can either be a short pole with a chain attached for hauling, or a long pole with a hook on the end that has no chain at all. Sometimes the pole is attached to a wagon and the oxen are simply backed over this pole, the pole is then raised between them and a backing bolt is dropped into the chains on the yoke irons in order to haul the wagon.|$|E
40|$|The shear {{behavior}} of six high ductile fiber reinforced concrete (HDC) beams is studied {{to investigate the}} influence of shear-span ratio and HDC mechanical property on {{the improvement of the}} shear failure mode and shear capacity of <b>short</b> <b>beams.</b> Four steel-reinforced high ductile concrete beams (SHDC) beams with different shear span ratios are tested under concentrated load at midspan. To study the effect of stirrups and steel on the shear capacity of <b>short</b> <b>beams,</b> two additional specimens without steel but one including stirrups are investigated. The main aspects of SHDC beams are discussed in detail, such as failure mode, deformability, and shear capacity. Test results show that the SHDC <b>short</b> <b>beams</b> keep high residual bearing capacity and great integrity when suffering from large deformation. It is revealed that HDC increased the shear ductility and improved the shear failure mode of <b>short</b> <b>beams.</b> A comparison with the shear equations of Chinese YB 9082 - 2006 shows that the Chinese Code equation provides conservative estimation for HDC beams. This study proposes modifications to the equation for predicting the shear capacity of HDC beams...|$|R

The following parameters were varied: fiber used (curaua or sisal), fiber washing or surface chemical treatment with sodium hydroxide/sodium borohydride, fiber length (from 5 to 60 mm), hybridization with glass fiber and the pre-processing of the polyester resin. The overall fiber volume fraction was kept constant (30 vol. %). In all configurations, the composites containing curaua fiber obtained higher <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> strength {{than those with}} sisal. An increase in fiber length yielded higher <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> strength. The optical and electronic micrographs showed mostly horizontal cracks, typical of shear failure.

Three of the load carrying members were analyzed; the gusset supports, the hinge supports, and the hinge pins.

The long beams will not be affected by this modification because there is no change in the length of their moment arms.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{modified}} <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> {{shear test}} was proposed to measure {{interlaminar shear strength}} (ILSS) of fiber reinforced carbon-carbon composites (CCC). The direct loading in the <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear (SBS) test is replaced by an indirect loading through a rubber pad and an aluminum seat. This loading reduced flexure stresses to less than one fourth of the SBS test and eliminated transverse shear stress concentration under the load point. Both beam and contact finite element {{analyses were conducted to}} validate the proposed method. The finite element analysis showed that the ILSS calculated from beam equation overestimates the strength by 5 % for shear flexible composites. This reduction was found to be the same for both polymeric and carbon matrix composites. The test data confirmed the interlaminar shear failure and very low data scatter in measured strength. The measured ILSS of T 300 CCC was 2. 68 ksi and {{it is one of the}} highest values reported in literature.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of structural}} fibre composite sandwich beams {{made up of}} glass fibre composite skins and phenolic core material was investigated under three-point <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> and asymmetrical beam shear tests. The effect of the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/D) was examined on the strength and failure behaviour of the composite sandwich beams. The results showed that with increasing a/D ratio, the failure load of the sandwich beam is decreasing. On the contrary, the coupling effect of flexural stresses increases with increasing a/D ratio. Noticeably, the fibre composite sandwich beams tested under asymmetrical beam shear exhibited higher failure load compared to beams tested under <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear. Analysis showed that the shear stress in the core is more dominant than flexural stress when the a/D ratio is 1 for the sandwich beams under <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> test and 1 to 3 for the sandwich beams tested under asymmetrical beams shear test. The proposed prediction equation which accounts for the combined effect of shear and flexural stresses due to the changing a/D ratio showed that it can reasonably estimate the failure load of structural fibre composite sandwich beams.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Microballoons (hollow particles) of {{the same}} outer radius but with five {{different}} inner radius values are used to fabricate five types of syntactic foam slabs. These five types of slabs are used as the core material to fabricate sandwich composites. Three- and four-point bending and <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear strength tests are carried out to characterize the flexural behavior of syntactic foam core sandwich composites. The effect of change in microballoon radius ratio (ratio of the inner to the outer radius) on the flexural properties of the sandwich composites is also studied. The results show that in three- and four-point bending tests, the failure is governed by tensile properties of the foam core and the strength is not affected by the microballoon radius ratio. Shear failure takes place in <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear tests, which makes the microballoon radius ratio {{an important factor in}} determining the strength of the sandwich composite...|$|E

Rheological properties from ESR were further used in designing the cure cycles to study the evolution of mechanical properties. Five panels were cured at different cure stages using the designed cure cycles and coupons were tested for <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear and combined loading compression properties at different cure stages. To correlate the mechanical properties with its respective glass transition temperature, Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) was used to obtain the glass transition temperature for the coupons obtained from the respective panels. Statistical results showed significant difference in <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear and combined loading compression properties up to vitrification, however, no significant difference was observed on these mechanical properties after vitrification. The observed linear trend between degree of cure (DOC) and glass transition temperature (Tg) was validated using Dibenedetto relation. Linearly increasing trend between degree of cure (DOC) and glass transition temperature (Tg) for different cure states suggests that both DOC and Tg can be used interchangeably to define the state of material.

40|$|Abstract. Steel moment {{frames are}} common systems in {{multi-storey}} buildings. Even {{the relatively low}} stiffness of the system limits the applicability, they remain popular in seismic applications due to the good dissipation capacity. Considered deemed-to-comply in seismic applications, welded beam to column connections experienced serious damages and even failures during strong seismic earthquakes. These failures included fractures of the beam flange-to-column flange groove welds, cracks in beam flanges, and cracks through the column section. To {{reduce the risk of}} brittle failure of welded connections, beam weakening near the ends became popular. To assure the desired behavior, i. e. the development of plastic deformations in the reduced beam section zones rather than at the face of the column, proper detailing and sizing is necessary. Today design provisions are limited to long beams, where the effect of shear stresses may be neglected. The application of the same rules for <b>short</b> <b>beams</b> might be non-conservative, and therefore qualification testing is necessary. The study presents the qualification testing of reduced beam sections welded connections of <b>short</b> <b>beams.</b> Both monotonic and cyclic tests were performed and numerical models were validated based on the test data...|$|R

The fiber-matrix adhesion was varied by using carbon fibers with different surface treatments. <b>Short</b> <b>beam</b> shear tests were used to quantify the interfacial shear strength afforded by the use of the different fiber surface treatments. The results of the <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear tests definitely showed that, for aging times up to 1000 hr, the aging process caused no observable changes in the bulk of the three composite materials that [...] -would degrade the shear properties of the material. Comparisons between the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) measured by the <b>short</b> <b>beam</b> shear tests and the GII c test results, as measured by the ENF test, indicated that the differences in the surface treatments significantly affected the fracture properties while the effect of the aging process was probably limited to changes at the starter crack tip. The fracture properties changed due to a shift in the fracture from an interfacial failure to a failure within the matrix when the fiber was changed from AU- 4 to AS- 4 or AS- 4 G. There appears to be an effect of the fiber/matrix bonding on the thermo-oxidative stability of the composites that were tested.
