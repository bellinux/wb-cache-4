25|$|Stirling {{is renowned}} as the Gateway to the Highlands and is {{generally}} regarded as occupying a strategic position {{at the point where}} the flatter, largely undulating Scottish Lowlands meet the rugged slopes of the Highlands along the Highland Boundary Fault. The <b>starkness</b> of this contrast is evidenced by the many hills and mountains of the lower Highlands such as Ben Vorlich and Ben Ledi which can be seen to the northwest of the city. On the other hand, the Carse of Stirling, stretching to the west and east of the city, is one of the flattest and most agriculturally productive expanses of land in the whole of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|In late 1967, Dylan left {{to record}} his next album, John Wesley Harding (1967). After {{recording}} the basic tracks, Dylan asked Robertson and Garth Hudson about {{playing on the}} album {{to fill out the}} sound. However, when Robertson heard the tracks, he liked the <b>starkness</b> of the sound and recommended that Dylan leave the songs as they were. Dylan worked with the members of the Hawks once again when they appeared as his backup band at two Woody Guthrie memorial concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York City in January 1968. Three of these performances were later released by Columbia Records on the LP A Tribute to Woody Guthrie, Vol. 1 (1972).|$|E
25|$|Standing at the North Kamloops station, {{the train}} is {{actually}} facing north and will be travelling north, {{at least in a}} northerly direction, for about the next six hours. The train follows the North Thompson River for much of the way, crossing it several times. The scenery changes gradually from the dry, rolling plateau – though miles of irrigation soften the <b>starkness</b> – to the lusher, evergreen forests farther north. Narrow valleys bordered by mountains on both sides feature farmlands, pastures, forests, logging camps, and small communities. Clearwater and Blue River are two such communities where the Canadian has flag stops. Near Clearwater, the train crosses the Clearwater River. The Monashee Mountains lie to the east for much of the way to Valemount.|$|E
500|$|Arulpragasam {{cites the}} radio {{broadcasts}} she heard emanating from her neighbours' flats {{in the late}} 1980s as some of her first exposures to her earliest musical influences. From there, she developed an interest in hip-hop and dancehall, identifying with [...] "the <b>starkness</b> of the sound" [...] in records by Public Enemy, MC Shan and Ultramagnetic MCs; and the [...] "weird, distinct style" [...] of acts such as Silver Bullet and London Posse. In college she developed an affinity for punk and the emerging sounds of Britpop and electroclash. M.I.A. cites The Slits, Malcolm McLaren and The Clash as major influences.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, praising it for its {{energetic}} musical numbers {{and said the}} car chases were [...] "incredible" [...] if so over-the-top that they finally became numbing. Ebert further noted [...] "Belushi and Aykroyd come over as hard-boiled city guys, total cynics with a world-view of sublime simplicity, and that all fits perfectly with the movie's other parts. There's even room, {{in the midst of}} the carnage and mayhem, for a surprising amount of grace, humor, and whimsy." [...] In his review for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold criticized Landis for engorging [...] "the frail plot of The Blues Brothers with car chases and crack-ups, filmed with such avid, humorless <b>starkness</b> on the streets of Chicago that comic sensations are virtually obliterated". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The Blues Brothers is a demolition symphony that works with the cold efficiency of a Moog synthesizer gone sadistic".|$|E
500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of those moments when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its <b>starkness.</b> We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Foremost of the disorienting effects, {{to critics}} and scholars, is Whedon's use {{of sound and}} silence. While Buffy {{performs}} CPR, she cracks one of Joyce's ribs with a startling snap. After Buffy vomits on the floor, she stands in the back doorway listening to life carrying on: children playing, someone practicing a trumpet, and birds singing. Long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as the characters {{try to think of}} what to say, made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter. The transition between the Christmas dinner scene and the living room scene is abrupt, and the sound of Buffy and Joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on the floor carries over into the silence of Joyce's lifeless face and Buffy standing alone in the living room. This effect is also used when shifting between Buffy's alternate version of her mother being [...] "good as new" [...] in the hospital and the paramedics trying to revive her. In the car on the way to Willow's dormitory, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front bumper, separated from the audience by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them speak and only the sound of the car can be heard. Joyce Millman at Salon.com writes of the sound issues, [...] "The effect was almost Bergmanesque in its <b>starkness.</b> The spooky stillness and the long, spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to articulate their feelings exaggerated the sense of time elongating and standing still." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Contemporary Literary Criticism, {{the editors}} state that [...] "Frost's best work explores {{fundamental}} questions of existence, depicting with chilling <b>starkness</b> {{the loneliness of}} the individual in an indifferent universe." [...] The critic T. K. Whipple focused on this bleakness in Frost's work, stating that [...] "in much of his work, particularly in North of Boston, his harshest book, he emphasizes the dark background of life in rural New England, with its degeneration often sinking into total madness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Voyage (1992), with a {{libretto}} by David Henry Hwang, {{was commissioned}} by the Metropolitan Opera for the 500th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} America by Christopher Columbus; and White Raven (1991), about Vasco da Gama, a collaboration with Robert Wilson and composed for the closure of the 1998 World Fair in Lisbon. Especially in The Voyage, the composer [...] "explore new territory", with its [...] "newly arching lyricism", [...] "Sibelian <b>starkness</b> and sweep", and [...] "dark, brooding tone (...) a reflection of its increasingly chromatic (and dissonant) palette", as one commentator put it.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow (1999) [...] "borrowed" [...] {{some of the}} film's imagery, {{particularly}} in {{a scene in which}} Lisa Marie's face is punctured by an iron maiden. Burton has explicitly cited Bava's film as an inspiration, noting, [...] "One of the movies that remain with me probably stronger than anything is Black Sunday..There's a lot of old films – [...] in particular – where the vibe and the feeling is what it's about... he feeling's a mixture of eroticism, of sex, of horror and <b>starkness</b> of image, and to me, that is more real than what most people would consider realism in films..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in the 1980s {{the band}} Frankie Goes to Hollywood {{released}} a political pop protest song Two Tribes a relentless bass driven track depicting the futility and <b>starkness</b> {{of nuclear weapons}} and the Cold War. The video for the song depicted a wrestling match between then-President Ronald Reagan and then-Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko for the benefit of group members and an eagerly belligerent assembly of representatives from the world's nations, the event ultimately degenerating into complete global destruction. This video was played several times at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Due to some violent scenes ("Reagan" [...] biting [...] "Chernenko"'s ear, etc.), the unedited video could not be shown on MTV, and an edited version was substituted. The single quickly hit the number one spot in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of the album's reissues on compact disc in the 1990s and 2000s, Drake's fame and {{critical}} standing had improved considerably, and legacy reviews of the album were overwhelmingly favourable. Qs review of the 1990 reissue noted that [...] "the mood is even more remote [...] with—finally—a defeated strain in both throat and words, but several of his most elegant melodies". The review of the 2000 reissue in the same magazine was more positive still, claiming that [...] "many hold up Pink Moon as Nick Drake's best album" [...] and saying, [...] "The motivation of success had evaporated and Drake made a record so singular and uncompromising that, superficially, it beggars belief... The truth is that Pink Moons excellence shines through, irrespective of the endless speculation [...] Few records have ever sounded so intimate, or embodied the eternal human ailment known as Melancholy with such grace and assurance." [...] Mojo claimed that [...] "Pink Moon is his masterpiece and the Robert Johnson comparisons are fully deserved". Reviewing the 2003 North American reissue, Rolling Stone said, [...] "The album unleashes a dramatic <b>starkness</b> and some breathtakingly pretty music".|$|E
2500|$|Five {{years after}} the {{publication}} of Out of Africa, Blixen published {{a collection of short stories}} called Winter's Tales (1942; [...] ). A departure from her previous Gothic works, the stories reflect the <b>starkness</b> of the times, occupation tinged with courage and pride, and hope for the future. The stories do not reflect resistance, but resilience, and explore the interdependence of opposites. She examines shame versus pride in [...] "The Heroine", cowardice and courage in [...] "The Pearls", master and servant in [...] "The Invincible Slave-Owners", and life versus death as well as freedom versus imprisonment in [...] "Peter and Rosa". [...] In [...] "Sorrow-acre", the best-known story of the collection, Blixen explores victimization and oppression. Because of the war, she had to be creative about getting the manuscript published, travelling to Stockholm and meeting with employees at both the American and British embassies. The Americans were unable to ship personal items, but the British embassy agreed, shipping the document to her publisher in the United States. Blixen did not receive further communication about Winter's Tales until after the war ended, when she received correspondence praising the stories from American troops who had read them in the Armed Services Editions during the conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Slant Magazine writer Jeremy Winograd called Skeleton Tree [...] "Cave's darkest, most emotionally devastating work to date" [...] {{and said}} that {{although}} it [...] "may not be Cave's most accessible album, owing both to the experimental nature {{of much of the}} music and the fact that its level of emotional rawness makes it a legitimately uncomfortable listen in places, it may very well be his best"; Wingrod rated the album four-and-a-half-out-of-five stars. Clash gave Skeleton Tree a nine-out-of-ten rating, with reviewer Josh Gray praising Cave and Ellis' songwriting and arrangements and summarising the album as [...] "a stark, beautiful rendering of deep, profound pain." [...] Paula Mejia wrote in Paste that [...] "Skeleton Tree strips down embellishments and brings to the forefront sinister bass lines and a synthesizer that will widen the tear in your heart a little more with every note"; Mejia concluded that [...] "there's something to be said about Skeleton Tree and its <b>starkness,</b> which is as familiar as life and death, an elegy, and a hell of a thing to forget", rating the album nine out of ten. Pitchfork gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating and selected it as the week's [...] "Best New Music"; [...] "I Need You" [...] was also selected as the week's [...] "Best New Track" [...] and was described as [...] "the stirring core of the Bad Seeds' devastating new album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{said that}} Tatsumi's art style and {{character}} designs reinforce {{the stories and}} that they linger in the reader's mind long after being read. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network found [...] "greater depth and variety" [...] than in The Push Man and Other Stories due to the larger amount of pages available, complimenting their simple layouts and executions, but disliked the endings {{as well as the}} repetitive character designs. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics praised Tatsumi's characterization and found the stories to be memorable, but found fault in the same look of the characters. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly called the stories [...] "a bit more ambitious and sure-footed" [...] than those in The Push Man and Other Stories. Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast felt that the longer stories in the manga allowed for more development than Tatsumi's earlier stories. Ng Suat Tong of The Hooded Utilitarian was critical of Tatsumi—feeling that the stories marked his transition into a rigorous artist, but disliking his repetitive themes and characters, concluding: [...] "These tales are neither close enough, true enough, sad enough nor vile enough to shock us from our modern stupor". In , Jason Thompson did not find the collection as powerful as The Push Man and Other Stories, but remarked that [...] "Tatsumi is a great storyteller and his pessimism is profound." [...] Dan Polley of Manga Life noted a departure by Tatsumi from his previous stories in The Push Man and Other Stories and called the stories [...] "Abandon the Old in Tokyo" [...] and [...] "Beloved Monkey" [...] the [...] "shining stars of the volume", concluding that his stories are timeless and have substance. Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the manga as [...] "remarkable, amazing", adding that [...] "the style is spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power". Austin Ramzy of Time Magazine noted that the manga remains relevant, calling it [...] "a revealing time capsule and a strangely moving portrait of survival in a land where everything is changing". Kirkus Reviews felt that the strong illustrations made the manga relatable and that it did not feel dated. Gordon Flagg of Booklist said that Tatsumi's [...] "powerful drawing style depicts the characters with a <b>starkness</b> and simplicity that matches what is presented of their lives and conjures a convincing urban milieu through detailed backdrops".|$|E

6000|$|A GOVERNOR it was proclaimed this time, [...] When all {{who would}} come seeking in New Hampshire [...] Ancestral {{memories}} might come together. [...] And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow, [...] A rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off, [...] And sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone. [...] Someone had literally run to earth [...] In an old cellar hole in a by-road [...] The origin of all the family there. [...] Thence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe [...] That now not all the houses left in town [...] Made shift to shelter them without the help [...] Of {{here and there a}} tent in grove and orchard. [...] They were at Bow, but that was not enough: [...] Nothing would do but they must fix a day [...] To stand together on the crater's verge [...] That turned them on the world, and try to fathom [...] The past and get some strangeness out of it. [...] But rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain, [...] With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted. [...] The young folk held some hope out to each other [...] Till well toward noon when the storm settled down [...] With a swish in the grass. [...] "What if the others [...] Are there," [...] they said. [...] "It isn't going to rain." [...] Only one from a farm not far away [...] Strolled thither, not expecting he would find [...] Anyone else, but out of idleness. [...] One, and one other, yes, for there were two. [...] The second round the curving hillside road [...] Was a girl; and she halted some way off [...] To reconnoitre, and then made up her mind [...] At least to pass by and see who he was, [...] And perhaps hear some word about the weather. [...] This was some Stark she didn't know. He nodded. [...] "No fête to-day," [...] he said. [...] "It looks that way." [...] She swept the heavens, turning on her heel. [...] "I only idled down." [...] "I idled down." [...] Provision there had been for just such meeting [...] Of stranger cousins, in a family tree [...] Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch [...] Of the one bearing it done in detail-- [...] Some zealous one's laborious device. [...] She made a sudden movement toward her bodice, [...] As one who clasps her heart. They laughed together. [...] "Stark?" [...] he inquired. [...] "No matter for the proof." [...] "Yes, Stark. And you?" [...] "I'm Stark." [...] He drew his passport. [...] "You know we might not be and still be cousins: [...] The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys, [...] All claiming some priority in <b>Starkness.</b> [...] My mother was a Lane, yet might have married [...] Anyone upon earth and still her children [...] Would have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day." [...] "You riddle with your genealogy [...] Like a Viola. I don't follow you." [...] "I only mean my mother was a Stark [...] Several times over, and by marrying father [...] No more than brought us back into the name." [...] "One ought not to be thrown into confusion [...] By a plain statement of relationship, [...] But I own what you say makes my head spin. [...] You take my card--you seem so good at such things-- [...] And see if you can reckon our cousinship. [...] Why not take seats here on the cellar wall [...] And dangle feet among the raspberry vines?" [...] "Under the shelter of the family tree." [...] "Just so--that ought to be enough protection." [...] "Not from the rain. I think it's going to rain." [...] "It's raining." [...] "No, it's misting; let's be fair. [...] Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?" [...] The situation was like this: the road [...] Bowed outward on the mountain half-way up, [...] And disappeared and ended not far off. [...] No one went home that way. The only house [...] Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod. [...] And below roared a brook hidden in trees, [...] The sound of which was silence for the place. [...] This he sat listening to till she gave judgment. [...] "On father's side, it seems, we're--let me see----" [...] "Don't be too technical.--You have three cards." [...] "Four cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch [...] Of the Stark family I'm a member of." [...] "D'you know a person so related to herself [...] Is supposed to be mad." [...] "I may be mad." [...] "You look so, sitting out here in the rain [...] Studying genealogy with me [...] You never saw before. What will we come to [...] With all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees? [...] I think we're all mad. Tell me why we're here [...] Drawn into town about this cellar hole [...] Like wild geese on a lake before a storm? [...] What do we see in such a hole, I wonder." [...] "The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc, [...] Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of. [...] This is the pit from which we Starks were digged." [...] "You must be learned. That's what you see in it?" [...] "And what do you see?" [...] "Yes, what do I see? [...] First let me look. I see raspberry vines----" [...] "Oh, if you're going to use your eyes, just hear [...] What I see. It's a little, little boy, [...] As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun; [...] He's groping in the cellar after jam, [...] He thinks it's dark and it's flooded with daylight." [...] "He's nothing. Listen. When I lean like this [...] I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,-- [...] With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug-- [...] Bless you, it isn't Grandsir Stark, it's Granny, [...] But the pipe's there and smoking and the jug. [...] She's after cider, the old girl, she's thirsty; [...] Here's hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely." [...] "Tell me about her. Does she look like me?" [...] "She should, shouldn't she, you're so many times [...] Over descended from her. I believe [...] She does look like you. Stay the way you are. [...] The nose is just the same, and so's the chin-- [...] Making allowance, making due allowance." [...] "You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!" [...] "See that you get her greatness right. Don't stint her." [...] "Yes, it's important, though you think it isn't. [...] I won't be teased. But see how wet I am." [...] "Yes, you must go; we can't stay here for ever. [...] But wait until I give you a hand up. [...] A bead of silver water more or less [...] Strung on your hair won't hurt your summer looks. [...] I wanted to try something with the noise [...] That the brook raises in the empty valley. [...] We have seen visions--now consult the voices. [...] Something I must have learned riding in trains [...] When I was young. I used the roar [...] To set the voices speaking out of it, [...] Speaking or singing, and the band-music playing. [...] Perhaps you have the art of what I mean. [...] I've never listened in among the sounds [...] That a brook makes in such a wild descent. [...] It ought to give a purer oracle."

[...] "Then I don't know. It must be strange enough. [...] I wonder if it's not your make-believe. [...] What do you think you're like to hear to-day?" [...] "From the sense of our having been together-- [...] But why take time for what I'm like to hear? [...] I'll tell you what the voices really say. [...] You will do very well right where you are [...] A little longer. I mustn't feel too hurried, [...] Or I can't give myself to hear the voices." [...] "Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?" [...] "You must be very still; you mustn't talk." [...] "I'll hardly breathe." [...] "The voices seem to say----" [...] "I'm waiting." [...] "Don't! The voices seem to say: [...] Call her Nausicaa, the unafraid [...] Of an acquaintance made adventurously." [...] "I let you say that--on consideration." [...] "I don't see very well how you can help it. [...] You want the truth. I speak but by the voices. [...] You see they know I haven't had your name, [...] Though what a name should matter between us----" [...] "I shall suspect----" [...] "Be good. The voices say: [...] Call her Nausicaa, and take a timber [...] That you shall find lies in the cellar charred [...] Among the raspberries, and hew and shape it [...] For a door-sill or other corner piece [...] In a new cottage on the ancient spot. [...] The life is not yet all gone out of it. [...] And come and make your summer dwelling here, [...] And perhaps she will come, still unafraid, [...] And sit before you in the open door [...] With flowers in her lap until they fade, [...] But not come in across the sacred sill----" [...] "I wonder where your oracle is tending. [...] You can see that there's something wrong with it, [...] Or it would speak in dialect. Whose voice [...] Does it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir's [...] Nor Granny's, surely. Call up one of them. [...] They have best right to be heard in this place." [...] "You seem so partial to our great-grandmother [...] (Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.) [...] You will be likely to regard as sacred [...] Anything she may say. But let me warn you, [...] Folks in her day were given to plain speaking. [...] You think you'd best tempt her at such a time?" [...] "It rests with us always to cut her off." [...] "Well then, it's Granny speaking: 'I dunnow! [...] Mebbe I'm wrong to take it as I do. [...] There ain't no names quite like the old ones though, [...] Nor never will be to my way of thinking. [...] One mustn't bear too hard on the new comers, [...] But there's a dite too many of them for comfort. [...] I should feel easier if I could see [...] More of the salt wherewith they're to be salted. [...] Son, you do as you're told! You take the timber-- [...] It's as sound as the day when it was cut-- [...] And begin over----' There, she'd better stop. [...] You can see what is troubling Granny, though. [...] But don't you think we sometimes make too much [...] Of the old stock? What counts is the ideals, [...] And those will bear some keeping still about." [...] "I can see {{we are going to be}} good friends." [...] "I like your 'going to be.' You said just now [...] It's going to rain." [...] "I know, and it was raining. [...] I let you say all that.
