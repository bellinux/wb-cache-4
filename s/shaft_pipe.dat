40|$|In hydrogeologically impermeable-covered {{region of}} USCB, where Morcinek coal mine is situated, the isolative {{overburden}} protects the surface from the emission of gasses compressed {{by the water}} rebound in the flooded coal mines. Potential gas hazard therefore can only arise in the regions where the shafts break through the overburden. Basing on mining and geological conditions, {{the volume of the}} Morcinek coal mine reservoir as well as the course of flooding it have been estimated. Subsequently, using the results of hydrogeological analyses changes of reservoir pressure have been assessed.

Several methods have been proposed, but most of the developed methodologies are incapable of modelling bed evolutions, while at the same time, compute sediment flushing efficiency. In this study a two-dimensional bed evolution model is proposed to estimate sediment distribution, bed evolution and sediment flushing efficiency of reservoirs. A-Gong-Dian reservoir, in southern Taiwan, is used as an illustrative example. Typhoon events were used to verify the proposed model. Simulations were conducted for one and two-day storm events under return periods, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 -year. The results indicated that the average sediment flushing efficiency of the shaft spillway under one and two-day storms were close, 58. 50 % and 59. 39 %, respectively. These results were similar to observed laboratory tests experiments, where an efficiency of 65. 34 % was obtained.

40|$|After air {{and water}} mixing, the process of gas {{compression}} in the downcomer <b>shaft</b> or <b>pipe</b> of a hydraulic air compressor is considered nearly isothermal due to (i) the mass {{flow rate of water}} being typically of three orders higher than that of the gas it compresses, (ii) water having a heat capacity approximately four times that of air, and (iii) the intimate contact and large heat transfer area between the gas phase and the liquid phase of the bubbly flow. A formulation for estimation of the efficiency of a closed-or open-loop hydraulic air compressor, expressed in terms of the principal hydraulic air compressor design variables, is presented. The influence of a hitherto underappreciated factor affecting the performance of these installations, such as the solubility of the gas being compressed in the water, is explored. A procedure for estimating the yield of compressed gas, accounting for these solubility losses, is explained and used to determine the mechanical efficiency of historical hydraulic air compressor installations from reported performance data. The result is a significant downward revision of hydraulic air compressor efficiency by approximately 20 % points in comparison to most reported efficiencies. However, through manipulation of cosolute concentrations in the water, and the temperature of the water (through regulation of the ejection of compression heat), the mechanical efficiency can be increased to the formerly reported levels. The thermoeconomic implication of these efficiency determinations is that in a modern context, hydraulic air compressors may be able to outperform conventional mechanical gas compression equipment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new simulation tool for a hybrid system emulator facility built by Thermochemical Power Group (TPG) at the University of Genoa, Italy. This work was based on a collaboration between the University of Manchester, UK and the University of Genoa, Italy. The experimental facility is composed of a Turbec T 100 micro gas turbine package modified for the fuel cell emulator connection, a set of pipes designed for by-pass, measurement or bleed reasons, and a high temperature volume designed for the stack dimension physical emulation. In this project, a real-time transient simulation tool of this rig was developed within Matlab-Simulink environment on component-oriented basis. With this modelling approach, the tool is flexible and user-friendly for different plant operational modes. The component models of the compressor and turbine, combustor, recuperator, generator, <b>shaft</b> and <b>pipes</b> were integrated with a plenum model for capturing the transient performance of the hybrid system emulator rig. This transient model was validated based on the results from the experimental data from the laboratory by TPG.

Moreover, the model also contributed to a clearer understanding of performance prediction for the entire plant. A further validation activity of the machine control system was carried out, obtaining a good agreement for the rotational speed between the calculated results and the experimental data. Future calculations will be carried out with this model to study machine coupling for pressure increase (e. g. a booster system) as requested for fuel cell performance increase...|$|R

40|$|Water {{recycling}} to {{the landfill}} body today is tested or already applied {{on a large}} scale in order to control and to accelerate the biodegradation processes within the reactor “landfill“. Targeted water recycling to the landfill body aims at accelerated decomposition of all degradable material within short foreseeable periods. For this purpose various methods are applied, {{such as the use of}} existing gas wells as sink <b>shafts</b> or of <b>pipe</b> systems installed under the sealing and the installation of lances. The results first revealed that discharge of pollutants via the gas phase directly depends on the water quantity recycled. Examining the discharge of pollutants via the leachate, the situation was completely different. The results from the leachate emissions showed that a water quantity of 2 mm/d is not sufficient to effect optimal accelerated pollutant discharge from the landfill body. With this water quantity recycled on the landfill body no dosage response could be stated. Therefore it was assumed that only a water quantity recycled of 4 - 8 mm/d leads to optimum accelerated discharge of pollutants via the water phase of the landfill body. A model was developed to prognosticate the gas production and the leachate emissions under the influence of water recycling. These new approaches for the prognosis of gas and water emission served to develop models which in future will allow to assess the emissions of a reactor landfill to be expected under the influence of water recycling.

30|$|The {{square shaft}} helical pile {{is a deep}} {{foundation}} used for new foundations and underpins existing foundations. Favorable performance history and economic viability have made it a standard of practice {{in many parts of}} the United States where it is considered a long side its deep foundation cousins: the drilled cast in place concrete pier, the driven pile and the micro piles. In addition to underpinning light structures, today it is used for new foundations and to underpin multiple stories heavily loaded commercial and industrial structures. Problem soil sites with expansive clays, collapsible soils or high ground water conditions are especially well suited for the square shaft helical screw pile [7]. The use of square shaft helical pile foundations in swelling soils is a standard of practice in Colorado. Since 1986 it is estimated approximately 130, 000 square shaft helical piles have been installed for both remedial repair and foundations for new construction in swelling soils, including the high expansive steeply dipping bedrock areas. There are no documented failures or adverse performance of correctly specified and installed square shaft helical piles [1]. Helical piles represent an efficient deep foundation system used in a wide range applications varying from anchors for transmission towers to foundations for bridges and large industrial installations. Helical piles are made of a steel shaft either a solid square <b>shaft</b> or circular <b>pipe</b> with one or multiple helices attached to it. They are installed by employing rotational force applied through a drive head. The piles could be installed to any depth and at any angle provided that the soil conditions are tolerable and the pile is designed to withstand the applied torque from a suitable drive head [2].|$|R
