5000|$|Two {{important}} effects {{necessary to}} understand the true stress are the effects of strain rate susceptibility and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening</b> upon the true stress. Time is often neglected in the initial stress-strain curve relations, but at higher strain rates, higher stresses will occur according to the relationship σT=kἕTm where m is the strain rate susceptibility. To account for the resistance to necking, the relationship σT=kεTn must also be considered, where n is the strain hardening coefficient and is typically between 0.02 and 0.50, depending upon the material. By combining these two relationships, a relationship of σT=kεTnἕTm can be found. However, as real stresses and strains do not occur uniaxially, considerations for multiaxial stresses must be added to this relationship to model real stresses.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{prevailing}} bonding {{theory in}} cold spraying {{is attributed to}} [...] "adiabatic shear instability" [...] which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate {{from the point of}} contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over work strain and <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening,</b> which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in viscous flow of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to melting temperature of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in explosive welding of materials.|$|E

A minimum of the curve exists at the intercept with the major strain axis or close thereby, the plane strain forming limit. With {{the definition of the}} onset of local necking (e. g. membrane force reaches an extreme value) and the assumption of a hardening law according to Hollomon (σ = K εn) it can be shown that the corresponding theoretical plane strain forming limit is identical with the strain hardening coefficient, n. There is no thickness effect. Taking into account the strain rate sensitivity of the material, which is obvious in steel, along with the sheet thickness, the fact can be explained that practical forming limits, obtained by the use of the above described method, lie well above theoretical forming limits. Thus the basic influence parameters for the forming limits are, the strain hardening exponent, n, the initial sheet thickness, t0 and the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening</b> coefficient, m. The lankford coefficient, r, which defines the plastic anisotropy of the material, has two effects on the forming limit curve.

40|$|Natural {{materials}} such as nacre, bone, collagen, or spider silk boast unusual combinations of stiffness, strength, and toughness. Behind this performance is the staggered microstructure, which consists of stiff and elongated inclusions embedded in a softer and more deformable matrix. The micromechanics of deformation and failure associated with this microstructure are now well understood at the “unit cell” level, the smallest representative volume {{for this type of}} material. However, these mechanisms only translate to high performance if they propagate throughout large volumes, an important condition which is often overlooked. Here we present, for the first time, a model which captures the conditions for delocalization in staggered composites, and which determines whether the material is brittle or deformable at the macroscale. The macroscopic failure strain for the material is derived as function of the viscoplastic properties of the interfaces and the severity of the defect. As expected, larger strain can be achieved with smaller defects or with more strain hardening at the interface. The model also shows that <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening</b> is a powerful source of delocalization for the material, a result we confirmed and validated with tensile experiments on glass-PDMS nacre-like staggered composites. An important implication is that natural materials, largely made of rate-dependent materials, may rely on <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening</b> to tolerate initial defects and damage to maintain their structural integrity. <b>Strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening</b> should also be harnessed and optimized in bio-inspired composites to maximize their overall performance...|$|E

Unlike the overstress based models, the elasto-viscoplastic model proposed meets the consistency condition, and allows smooth transition from rate-independent elastoplasticity to rate-dependent viscoplasticity. In the model proposed, the yield function {{is defined as a}} function of strain and strain rate parameters.

Two solutions, i. e. analytical and numerical are proposed for the derivation of viscoplastic multiplier with relevant assumptions in order to obtain the relationship between stresses and viscoplastic strains. A non-associated flow rule is used to generalise application of the model to all types of soils.

Side impact analysis has been carried out based on the condition in FMVSS 214. The numerical simulation has been performed with LS-DYNA 3 D in order to investigate the effect of TRIP steel on the dynamic response in side impact as well as the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>hardening</b> effect...|$|E
40|$|The stress–strain {{behaviour}} and microstructural {{evolution of}} the Ti– 6 Cr– 5 Mo– 5 V– 4 Al (Ti 6554) alloy was systematically investigated using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) tests {{over a wide range}} of <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> from 1000 s− 1 to 10, 000 s− 1 and initial temperatures from 293 K to 1173 K. Dislocation slip is the main deformation mechanism for plastic flow of the Ti 6554 alloy at high <b>strain</b> <b>rates.</b> The flow stress increases with increasing <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> and decreasing temperature. Also the flow stress is more sensitive to temperature than to <b>strain</b> <b>rate.</b> For high <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> deformations, the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> is found to be negative at 293 K and increases with increasing temperatures. Flow softening observed at 293 K is potentially caused by adiabatic heating. The increment in the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> with increasing temperatures {{may be the result of}} interactions between thermally activated solute Cr atoms and mobile dislocations. When the temperature is raised to 873 K, a novel α precipitate morphology consisting of globular α aligned in strings was observed in specimens deformed at <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> of 4000 and 10, 000 s− 1. It has hardening effects on the β matrix and is purported to nucleate on dislocations introduced by the high <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> deformation. Adiabatic shear bands were observed in specimens deformed at higher temperatures (873 K). The microstructure inside the shear bands is harder than that outside of the shear bands in the Ti 6554 alloy...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic tensile {{behaviour}} {{of a type}} of twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steel was experimentally investigated over a {{wide range}} of <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> from 0. 001 to 400 s 1, with an emphasis on the intermediate <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> (1 - 400 s 1). It has been found that the TWIP steel has moderate yield stress and remarkable elongation, which was believed {{to be related to the}} twinning. The ultimate tensile strength of the TWIP steel slightly decreased at <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> from 0. 001 to 0. 01 s 1 and increased from 0. 01 to 400 s 1. Remarkable work hardening was observed in that the TWIP steel had a high working <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately 1500 MPa over a true strain of 0. 1 - 0. 5. Moreover, the working <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> had an increasing trend with <b>strain</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> effect for the TWIP steel could be described by Johnson-Cook hardening model. The high speciﬁc energy absorption of the TWIP steel was related to <b>strain</b> <b>rate,</b> high <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> exponent and large fracture elongation...|$|R
