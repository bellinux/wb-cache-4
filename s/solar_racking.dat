40|$|Wind load {{governs the}} design of {{supporting}} structures of solar panels and constitutes approximately {{fifty percent of the}} total cost. There are various test scale related issues while testing solar panels (small structures) in boundary layer wind tunnel laboratories meant for tall buildings (large structures). Emergence of large testing facilities, however, is enabling testing full-scale solar panels. In this thesis an extensive experimental program is conducted at WindEEE Dome using full-scale solar panels and finite element modeling. The experimental program includes: (i) high resolution pressure tests to understand the sensitivity of pressure taps density and distribution; (ii) force balance test to determine the reactions of the solar panel under wind loading accounting for aeroelastic effects and validate pressure test results; (iii) finite element modeling to assess the internal stress of the <b>solar</b> <b>rack</b> elements and improvement of the rack cross section. Study of pressure tap layout and resolution illustrated that a fairly high density resolution is required to capture all the aerodynamic features of pressure on the solar panel surfaces. It is found that the uplift force obtained from the force balance tests are larger compared to the pressure taps as result of the dynamic effects of wind loading. The finite element analysis of <b>solar</b> <b>racks</b> was performed using the experimentally established wind loading data, which includes all dynamic features of the forces obtained from the force balances. It is concluded that the <b>solar</b> <b>rack</b> cross sections can be structurally optimized and there is a possibility to save in aluminum elements up to 40 %...|$|R

40|$|Solar panels {{have been}} used to {{generate}} and supply electricity in various applications such as residential and commercial buildings. Therefore, a need for a quicker approach to installation as well as the need to reduce workmanship to speed up the process is needed. <b>Solar</b> <b>racks</b> are developed through the use of automated equipment to “preassemble the racking hardware, pre-install the solar modules, and drive helical anchors into the ground rapidly”. So instead of installing one panel at a time, AP Alternatives has created a new method that uses machines to make the process easier. This new automation of the installation reduces the labor required on-site as well as the time needed to complete installation on-site, which provides cost, and time savings...|$|R

50|$|Modules are {{assembled}} into arrays on {{some kind}} of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used. <b>Solar</b> panel <b>racks</b> mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.|$|R

30|$|For {{the first}} time, {{low-cost}} open-source 3 -D printing provides {{the potential for}} distributed manufacturing at the household scale of customized, high-value, and complex products. To explore the potential {{of this type of}} ultra-distributed manufacturing, which has been shown to reduce environmental impact compared to conventional manufacturing, this paper presents a case study of a 3 -D printable parametric design for recreational vehicle (RV) <b>solar</b> photovoltaic (PV) <b>racking</b> systems. The design is a four-corner mounting device with the ability to customize the tilt angle and height of the standoff. This enables performance optimization of the PV system for a given latitude, which is variable as RVs are geographically mobile. The open-source 3 -D printable designs are fabricated and analyzed for print time, print electricity consumption, mechanical properties, and economic costs. The preliminary results show distributed manufacturing of the case study product results in an order of magnitude reduction in economic cost for equivalent products. In addition, these cost savings are maintained while improving the functionality of the racking system. The additional electrical output for a case study RV PV system with improved tilt angle functionality in three representative locations in the U.S. was found to be on average over 20 % higher than that for conventional mass-manufactured racking systems. The preliminary results make it clear that distributed manufacturing - even at the household level - with open-source 3 -D printers is technically viable and economically beneficial. Further research is needed to expand the results of this preliminary study to other types of products.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>solar</b> drier is {{one example}} of useful {{utilization}} of solar energy, but has not widely used by the public, yet. Using this solar drier we can dry our fish and agricultural products without fossil fuels. Solar dryer works by absorbing sunlight by four blackened flat collectors, and the heat generated by the collectors was transferred by air flow to the plenum chamber and drying chamber consisting of shelves. The solar dryer used in this experiment has dimension of 4, 66 m length by 4, 66 m width and by 1, 95 m height. The dryer has a capacity of around 50 kg materials that can be dried during 20 hours. Based on our testing it was observed that the decrease in water level was not uniform among the shelves position. The final moisture content was highest in the top shelves, followed by middle shelves and bottom shelves. The average final moisture content was 16, 95 %. The time required for drying was 20 hours, with an average moisture load of 10, 46 kg H 2 O. The average drying rate was 0, 5228 kg H 2 O/jam or 2, 10 % wet basis per hour. In this experiment intensity of solar radiation was measured to be 634, 88 Watt/m 2, and electric power of 12, 83 Watt was used to run small fan in order to exhaust moist air. The average energy used (Qe) for drying banana chips was 37124, 58 kJ per each drying process and the average energy input used during the drying process (Qrs) was 147. 227, 87 kJ. This meant that average drying efficiency was 27, 07 %. Technically, it can be concluded that solar dryer can be used as an alternative to drying agricultural commodities...|$|R
40|$|Soliant Energy is a venture-capital-backed startup {{focused on}} {{bringing}} advanced concentrating solar panels to market. Our fundamental innovation {{is that we}} are the first company to develop a <b>racking</b> <b>solar</b> concentrator specifically for commercial rooftop applications, resulting in the lowest LCOE for rooftop electricity generation. Today, the commercial rooftop segment is the largest and fastest-growing market in the solar industry. Our concentrating panels can make a major contribution to the SAI's objectives: reducing the cost of solar electricity and rapidly deploying capacity. Our commercialization focus was re-shaped in 2009, shifting from an emphasis solely on panel efficiency to LCOE. Since the inception of the SAI program, LCOE has become the de facto standard for comparing commercial photovoltaic systems. While estimation and prediction models still differ, the emergence of performance-based incentive (PBI) and feed-in tariff (FIT) systems, as well as power purchase agreement (PPA) financing structures make LCOE the natural metric for photovoltaic systems. Soliant Energy has designed and demonstrated lower-cost, higher-power solar panels that consists of 6 (500 X) PV module assemblies utilizing multi-junction cells and an integrated two-axis tracker. In addition, we have designed and demonstrated a prototype 1000 X panel assembly with 8. Cost reductions relative to conventional flat panel PV systems were realized by (1) reducing the amount of costly semiconductor material and (2) developing strategies and processes to reduce the manufacturing costs of the entire system. Performance gains against conventional benchmarks were realized with (1) two-axis tracking and (2) higher-efficiency multi-junction PV cells capable of operating at a solar concentration ratio of 1000 X (1000 kW/m 2). The program objectives are: (1) Develop a tracking/concentrating solar module that has the same geometric form factor as a conventional flat, roof mounted photovoltaic (PV) panel - the Soliant module will produce more power and cost less than conventional panels of the same size; (2) Target LCOE: $ 0. 079 /kWh in 2010; (3) Target efficiency - 26 % in 2010 (22 % for 2008 prototype, 24 % for 2009 pilot); and (4) Target performance - equivalent to 650 Wp in 2010 (490 W for 2008 prototype, 540 W for 2009 pilot) ...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the embodied energy of transportation {{for a wide range}} of products can have an appreciable percentage of the environmental impact of a product over its life cycle (Zhu and Sarkis 2006; Pearce et al. 2007; Cholette and Venkat 2009; Meisterling et al. 2009; Winnebeck 2011). Life cycle analysis indicates that ultra-distributed manufacturing with 3 -D printers by prosumers (producer/consumers) would be beneficial from an environmental impact viewpoint (Kreiger and Pearce 2013 a, b). This is the case if conventional manufacturing of equivalent products is avoided by printing them. These savings are in part due to reductions in transportation embodied energy (Kreiger and Pearce 2013 a, b). Recent developments in 3 -D printing (an additive manufacturing technique, which intrinsically reduces material waste) have made distributed manufacturing of high-value products for household use both technically and economically viable, enabling individuals to fabricate an exponentially growing list of products to meet their own needs (Pearce et al. 2010; Wittbrodt et al. 2013). Sales figures indicate that personalized or desktop manufacturing with 3 -D printers is a growing trend (Blua 2013; Economist 2012; Make 2013; Wohlers 2013). A wide range of products can now be produced by low-cost 3 -D printers (Pearce et al. 2010; Martens et al. 2011; Wittbrodt et al. 2013), and open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (or RepRaps) enable particularly fast scaling. RepRaps can manufacture over 50 % of their own components (excluding fasteners) creating a low-cost and easily repairable 3 -D printer that can be used for both upgrades and fabricating replacement parts for low costs (Jones et al. 2011). To create the desired part, RepRaps sequentially deposit 100 - to 400 -micron layers of polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and a wide range of other feedstock materials (Baechler et al. 2013; Kreiger et al. 2014; Mireles et al. 2013). Open-source 3 -D printers have already demonstrated usefulness for developing engineering prototypes (Sells et al. 2010), customizing scientific equipment (Pearce 2012; Pearce 2014; Zhang et al. 2013), creating electronic sensors (Leigh et al. 2012; Anzalone et al. 2013), education (Gonzalez-Gomez et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013), co-creative product realization (Redlich et al. 2008), personal manufacturing (Devor et al. 2012), wire embedding (Bayless et al. 2010), modular robotics (Moses et al. 2009), tissue engineering (Miller et al. 2012), and appropriate technology for sustainable development (Pearce et al. 2010). This paper investigates the ability of the RepRap to be used in manufacturing directly following the open-source paradigm and uses a case study of a <b>solar</b> photovoltaic (PV) <b>racking</b> technology.|$|R
