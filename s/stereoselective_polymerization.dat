We report herein our observations on the catalytically nature of 2, 4 -dimethylpentadienyl rare earth metal complexes. Under standard conditions the complexes are catalytically inactive. In order to successfully activate the coordinatively saturated complexes aluminium trialkyls AlMe 3, AlEt 3, and Al(i-Bu) 3, aluminoxanes methylaluminoxane (MAO), hexaisobuthylaluminoxane (HiBAO) and modified methylaluminoxane with an Al(i-Bu) 3 additive (MMAO) and diethylaluminium bromide were employed as cocatalysts.

The formation of large-sized, well-oriented lamellar nanostructures of BCPs composed of a crystallizable sPP block linked to an amorphous rubbery block EP (sPP-b-EP) was successfully achieved by using epitaxial crystallization 2 with p-terphenyl as substrates. TEM bright field images and electron diffraction patterns of gold decorated nanostructures reveals the presence of well oriented crystalline lamellae ordered over large area alternated to amorphous layers. Crystalline-crystalline block copolymers (sPP-b-PE) epitaxially crystallized onto crystals of p-terphenyl show a more complex lamellar morphology. For BCPs with high volume fraction of sPP block only one lamellar orientation can be observed. In this case sPP crystallize first. For sPP-PE BCPs with similar block lengths, TEM images show regions characterized by double orientation of PE lamellae due to the epitaxial relationship of PE with p-terphenyl. In these regions PE crystallize first. They alternate with regions presenting a single lamellar orientation of sPP according to the epitaxial relationship with p-terphenyl. In these regions sPP crystallize first. In other words the block that crystallize first determines the local morphology.

Within the present RE series, the complex of the largest ion (Dy 3 +) exhibits the highest activity, achieving a high turnover frequency of 390 min- 1, and also produces the highly isotactic polymer PβMMBL (mm = 91. 0 %). This stereoregular polymer is thermally robust, with a high glass-transition temperature of 280 C, and is resistant to all common organic solvents. Other half-sandwich RE catalysts of the series are also highly active and produce polymers with a similarly high isotacticity. Intriguingly, even simple homoleptic hydrocarbyl RE complexes, RE(CH 2 SiMe 3) 3 (THF) 2 (RE = Sc, Y, Dy, Lu), also afford highly isotactic polymer PβMMBL, despite their much lower polymerization activity, except for the Lu complex, which maintains its high activity for both types of complexes. Computational studies of both half-sandwich and simple hydrocarbyl yttrium complexes have revealed a stereocontrol mechanism that well explains the observed high stereoselectivity of βMMBL polymerization by both types of catalysts. Specifically, the experimental stereoselectivity can be well rationalized with a monometallic propagation mechanism through predominantly chain-end stereocontrol in the coordination-addition polymerization. In this mechanism, formation of an isotactic polymer chiefly originates from interactions between the methyl groups on the chiral β-C atom of the five-membered ring of both the coordinated monomer and the last inserted βMMBL unit of the chain, and the auxiliary ligand on the metal makes a negligible contribution to the stereocontrol of the polymerization. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, the more {{relevant}} catalysts for <b>stereoselective</b> olefin <b>polymerization</b> have been discovered by high throughput screening techniques (HTS) [1, 2]. The catalyst discovery workflow using the HTS infrastructure reached such a level [3] that the “familiar” concept of “catalyst ligand design” by basic principles [4] seems to play a marginal role at the present stage. By using this approach {{a greater number of}} pyridyl-amine ligands with enhanced structural diversity were synthesized (see Figure 1). In designing the expanded ligand array, three convenient positions for structural amplification were identified, labeled in the Figure as R 1, R 2 and the presence of unusual reactivity of metal-aryl bond (see Hf-CAryl and Hf-CAlkyl bonds in system 3 of Figure 1). However, the stereoselectivity mechanism of propene polymerization promoted by such systems is still unknown [1, 2]. In this communication, by means of computational methods, we investigated the enantioselectivity of propene insertion for systems 1 - 3 reported in Figure 1. Surprisingly, the generally accepted model of "chiral growing chain orientation" [5] was ineffective for this class of catalysts and a new model for the propene enantioselectivity has been sorted out. Despite the computational results tuned by DFT methods combined with dispersion and solvent corrections [6], there are two aspects that we would like to stress: a) our model is able to explain the subtle interplay between the steric and electronic effects as well as the reactivity of metal-aryl bond; b) it appears a general model, able after 35 years to reconnect the Ziegler-Natta catalysis to the more general asymmetric catalysis [7]. Let us make a final comment: we are well aware that discoveries of such systems were possible thanks to experimental HTS technologies because of the huge number of variables involved; nevertheless, we are still convinced that a rational catalysts design is not over the game as soon as new models are developed...|$|R

The development of synthetic pathways and catalyst/initiator systems to produce pre-designed polylactides, {{as well as}} the fundamental understanding of the polymerization reactions, has continuously been an important topic. Here, we will address the recent advances in the ring-opening polymerization of lactides, with an emphasis on the highly versatile in situ generated initiator systems and single-site stereoselective initiators. The in situ generated initiators including in situ formed yttrium, calcium and zinc alkoxides all have been shown to bring about a rapid and living polymerization of lactides under mild conditions, which facilitated the preparation of a variety of advanced lactide-based biomaterials. For example, well-defined di- and tri-block copolymers consisting of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) blocks and hydrophobic polyester blocks, which form novel biodegradable polymersomes or biodegradable thermosensitive hydrogels, have been prepared.

40|$|A {{degenerative}} transfer (DT) living Ziegler-Natta polymerization {{system based}} on the cyclopentadienyl amidinate zirconium complex, (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe 2 [N(t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ] (19), has been studied in detail. Compound 19 is an active pre-catalyst for the living and stereospecific polymerization of a-olefins, upon activation by a stoichiometric amount of [PhNHMe 2][B(C 6 F 5) 4] (18). With a substoichiometric amount of 18, degenerative transfer living Ziegler-Natta polymerization occurs. The extremely fast interconversion between an active cationic species and a dormant neutral species via a methyl (MeDeT) or chloride (ChloDeT) group is essential for degenerative transfer to occur (Rex>>Rp). Under MeDeT conditions, atactic polyolefins are produced due to the configurational instability of the amidinate ligand in its dormant state, with the rate of epimerization being much faster than the rate of propagation (Repi >>Rp). The configurational stability of all the zirconium species involved in ChloDeT ensures that this degenerative transfer living polymerization is stereospecific. Methylating reagents (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe 2 [N(t-Bu) C(t-Bu) N(Et) ] (34) and (h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe 2 [NCH 2 (t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ] (39) were synthesized to provide {{a means by which}} a fully activated polymerization system could be brought under degenerative transfer conditions. Adding 18 and 34 or 39 alternatively to a living polymerization system produces well-defined atactic-isotactic stereoblock polyolefins. This allows, for the first time, the production of stereoblock polyolefins with controlled block length, block tacticity and block placement within a polymer backbone. Living <b>stereoselective</b> propylene <b>polymerizations</b> were carried out by {(h 5 -C 5 Me 5) ZrMe[N(t-Bu) C(Me) N(Et) ]}[B(C 6 F 5) 4] (32).

Using the developed methodology, a family of different atactic-isotactic stereoblock polypropylene (sb-PP) was synthesized with controlled block length, block tacticity for the first time. Preliminary data shows excellent elastomeric properties for the sb-PPs that are synthesized.

40|$|The {{importance}} of β-H elimination {{as a possible}} mechanism to induce chain termination/transfer and/or the formation of stereodefects in the Rh(diene) -mediated oligomerization and polymerization of carbenes has been studied by means of different approaches. As a remarkable feature, this reaction is associated with low initiation efficiencies (~ 5 %) and a clear incubation time, during which the selectivity of the catalyst drastically changes from predominant dimerization and oligomerization activity to almost fully selective polymerization. In an attempt to shine more light on these observations, we performed a full computational study using a simplified and unmodified Rh(cod) model, wherein {{we looked at the}} relative barriers for chain propagation versus chain transfer via β-H elimination. These DFT calculations indicate that the energy of the transition state (TS) for β-H elimination and complete dissociation of the elimination product are considerably lower in free energy than the TS for chain propagation, thus partially explaining the experimentally observed change of the selectivity during the incubation time. Furthermore, we discuss the {{importance of}} β-H elimination as a probable mechanism to introduce stereoerrors (thus explaining the experimental formation of atactic oligomers {{at the beginning of the}} reaction). We also explored its importance experimentally, by investigating the influence of deuteration of the diazo substrate and addition of competing olefins. All experiments indicate that β-H elimination does not play a major role regarding chain transfer in the case of our catalyst−substrate combination, and probably generally, if α-carbonyl-substituted diazo compounds are used. The most likely explanation for the combined experimental and computational data is that the Rh(diene) precatalyst gets modified under the applied catalytic conditions in order to form new active species for which apparently β-H elimination is slowed down (leading to nonstereospecific oligomerization activity) and eventually even completely absent (leading to <b>stereoselective</b> <b>polymerization</b> activity) ...|$|E
