In this companion paper we report two further large examples of this development. In the first example we solve the twisted vertex operator equations in an abelian limit to obtain the twisted vertex operators and correlators of a large class of abelian orbifolds.

40|$|A twist is a datum {{playing a}} role of a local system for topological $K$-theory. In equivariant <b>setting,</b> <b>twists</b> are {{classified}} into four types according to how they are realized geometrically. This paper lists the possible types of twists for the torus with {{the actions of the}} point groups of all the 2 -dimensional space groups (crystallographic groups), or equivalently, the torus with the actions of all the possible finite subgroups in its mapping class group. This is carried out by computing Borel's equivariant cohomology and the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. As a byproduct, the equivariant cohomology up to degree three is determined in all cases. The equivariant cohomology with certain local coefficients is also considered in relation to the twists of the Freed-Moore $K$-theory...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{computing}} the <b>set</b> of <b>twists</b> of a non-singular projective curve defined over an arbitrary (perfect) field k. The method {{is based on a}} correspondence between twists and solutions to a Galois embedding problem. When in addition, this curve is non-hyperelliptic we show how to compute equations for the twists. If k = Fq the method then becomes an algorithm, since in this case, it is known how to solve the Galois embedding problems that appear. As an example we compute the <b>set</b> of <b>twists</b> of the non-hyperelliptic genus 6 curve x(7) - y(3) - 1 = 0 when we consider it defined over a number field such that [k(zeta(21)) : k] = 12.

40|$|AbstractLet k be a {{commutative}} ring, let H be a k-Hopf algebra, and let A be a right H-comodule algebra.

If A/AcoH is Galois and H is finitely generated projective, then the twistings that map to the trivial measuring can be described as a <b>set</b> of invertible <b>twisted</b> cocycles: ϕ: H⊗H→A.

40|$|Recently the {{operator}} algebra, including the twisted affine primary fields, and a <b>set</b> of <b>twisted</b> KZ equations were {{given for the}} WZW permutation orbifolds. In {{the first part of}} this paper we extend this operator algebra to include the so-called orbifold Virasoro algebra of each WZW permutation orbifold. These algebras generalize the orbifold Virasoro algebras (twisted Virasoro operators) found some years ago in the cyclic permutation orbifolds. In the second part, we discuss the reducibility of the twisted affine primary fields of the WZW permutation orbifolds, obtaining a simpler <b>set</b> of single-cycle <b>twisted</b> KZ equations. Finally we combine the orbifold Virasoro algebra and the single-cycle twisted KZ equations to investigate the spectrum of each orbifold, identifying the analogues of the principal primary states and fields also seen earlier in cyclic permutation orbifolds.

40|$|The {{range and}} {{variability}} of flow velocities in which horizontal axis tidal stream turbines operate introduces {{the requirement for}} a power regulation method in the system. Overspeed power regulation (OSPR) {{has the potential to}} improve the structural robustness and decrease the complexity associated with active pitch power regulation methods, while removing the difficulties of operating in stalled flow. This paper presents the development of a methodology for the design of blades to be used in such systems. The method requires a site depth, maximum flow velocity and rated power or flow speed as input parameters. The pitch <b>setting,</b> <b>twist</b> and chord distribution were set as input parameters, variable through the use of alteration functions. Rotor performance has been broken down into OSPR performance metrics which consider coefficients of power and thrust, and cavitation inception. Three visual-numerical tools have been developed: the OSPR performance metrics were used in conjunction with a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis approach to develop a design space; cavitation inception analyses gave plots of converging cavitation and pressure terms for each blade section; the local angle of attack and torque distribution across the blade designs were plotted at key turbine operation states. Alterations to pitch <b>setting</b> and <b>twist</b> distribution are shown to have most impact upon the design requirement of increased gradient in the rotor speed-efficiency relationship in the overspeed region; coupled with such alterations, targeted changes to the chord distribution have been shown to increase the maximum efficiency. The prevention of cavitation has been highlighted as a driver for speed-limiting design alterations. While facilitating blade design, the methodology also produces experiential knowledge which can be stored, and shared in graphical format...|$|R
