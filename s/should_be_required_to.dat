5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving for a certain period of time, which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E

25|$|When the {{underlying}} cause of sleep problems is not immediately obvious, behavioral treatments are usually the first suggested. These range from patient education about sleep hygiene to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Studies of both younger and older adults have compared CBT to medication and found that CBT {{should be considered a}} first-line and cost-effective intervention for chronic insomnia, not least because gains may be maintained at long-term follow-up. Sleep physicians and psychologists, at least in the US, are not in agreement about who should perform CBT nor whether sleep centers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> have psychologists on staff. In the UK the number of CBT-trained therapists is limited so CBT is not widely available on the NHS.|$|E

It {{is the only}} militia regiment {{known to have been}} called up during the war for a specific mission. Confederate and State authorities became increasingly concerned about a shadowy organization in north-central Arkansas known as the Peace Society. The Peace Societies were largely union sympathizers who felt that the large slaveholding planters of southern Arkansas and the deep South had caused the war; they felt that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> bear the burden of the conflict.

25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E

500|$|Jeremy R. Jehangiri {{criticized the}} Court's ruling {{for failing to}} account for {{psychological}} pressures inherent in the [...] "perceived legitimacy of the [...] authority". Jehangiri argued that police <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> inform citizens that consent is voluntary, and {{that this kind of}} [...] "prophylactic warning would serve as a natural corollary to a Miranda warning mandated by the Fifth Amendment". Likewise, Marissa Reich also argued that passengers feel significant [...] "psychological pressures" [...] to cooperate with police searches on buses, and police should therefore warn passengers that consent is voluntary. Joshua Fitch also criticized the Court for ignoring the impact of [...] "racial disparagement" [...] with respect to an individual's ability to walk away from encounters with police. He argued that [...] "iven the historical treatment of black males by members of law enforcement, it is entirely possible that Drayton and Brown feared refusing the officers' requests because they feared violent consequences". Fitch also argued that police should provide warnings similar to Miranda warnings that [...] "inform citizens of their right to refuse consent", and that decisions like Drayton [...] "consistently [...] rules that require citizens to fend for themselves when it comes to constitutional rights".|$|E
500|$|Although {{he noted}} that {{his support for the}} majority's opinion was [...] "unqualified", Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of solitary confinement. Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989, Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement. Although the conditions of Ayala's confinement were not established in the record, Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "it is likely [...] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone". Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators" [...] and that solitary confinement [...] "bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy". Justice Kennedy conceded that [...] "in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates", but that courts should ultimately determine [...] "whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> adopt them".|$|E
500|$|In monasteries, {{the basic}} {{structure}} of the diet was laid down by the Rule of Saint Benedict in the 7th century and tightened by Pope Benedict XII in 1336, but (as mentioned above) monks were adept at [...] "working around" [...] these rules. Wine was restricted to about [...] per day, but there was no corresponding limit on beer, and, at Westminster Abbey, each monk was given an allowance of [...] of beer per day. Meat of [...] "four-footed animals" [...] was prohibited altogether, year-round, for everyone but the very weak and the sick. This was circumvented in part by declaring that offal, and various processed foods such as bacon, were not meat. Secondly, Benedictine monasteries contained a room called the misericord, where the Rule of Saint Benedict did not apply, and where a large number of monks ate. Each monk would be regularly sent either to the misericord or to the refectory. When Pope Benedict XII ruled that at least half of all monks <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> eat in the refectory on any given day, monks responded by excluding the sick and those invited to the abbot's table from the reckoning. Overall, a monk at Westminster Abbey in the late 15th century would have been allowed [...] of bread per day; 5 eggs per day, except on Fridays and in Lent; [...] of meat per day, 4 days/week (excluding Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday), except in Advent and Lent; and [...] of fish per day, 3 days/week and every day during Advent and Lent. This caloric structure partly reflected the high-class status of late Medieval monasteries in England, and partly that of Westminster Abbey, {{which was one of the}} richest monasteries in the country; diets of monks in other monasteries may have been more modest.|$|E
40|$|The {{papers in}} this special {{thematic}} issue of HEC Forum critically and carefully explore key issues {{at the intersection of}} patient privacy and commodification. For example, <b>should</b> hospitals <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> secure a person’s consent to any possible uses to which his discarded body parts might be put after his treatment or <b>should</b> it only <b>be</b> concerned with securing his informed consent to his treatment? <b>Should</b> a hospital <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> raise the possibility of the commodification of such (patient-discarded) body parts, or <b>should</b> it only <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> address this issue if the patient asks about it? <b>Should</b> persons <b>be</b> paid to engage in medical research, or <b>should</b> they only <b>be</b> compensated for their time, on the grounds, perhaps, that such payment would be coercive or exploitative, for it might move some persons to agree to participate in research who otherwise would not have done?

Generalizing from this, they argued that for a group to qualify as a PSG for the purpose of refugee status, it must be either a characteristic one cannot change or a characteristic one <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> change.
