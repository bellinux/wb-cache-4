5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a <b>single</b> <b>weft</b> yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{continuous}} processing {{technology of}} wool slenderizing integrated with biologic enzyme modification is introduced in this paper. Fiber fineness is obviously reduced by this technology, {{at the same}} time, wool scales are efficiently removed. Thus, wool quality is also largely enhanced. This provides favorable raw materials {{for the development of}} high added value products. Demand bloom of slenderized wool With the development of wool fabrics and knitting garments towards frivolity, the yarn count of wool tends to be thinning. In 2006 ”Weierjia CUP ” appraisal through comparison of excellent new product, yarn counts of worsted fabrics equal to or under 11. 11 tex account for 46 % in total. And the weight of worsted wool fabrics 6. 25 tex/ 2 is under 130 g/m 2. Furthermore, the independently developed 12. 5 tex single warp and <b>single</b> <b>weft</b> products are only 69 g/m 2 in weight. Yarn counts of wollen fabrics are mainly fine count wollen yarns of 45. 45 tex. The light and thin products enhance the demand of fine count wools. Fine count wools mainly come from Australia. In recent years, China becomes the main importer of Australia on fine count wools (19 µm and even thinner) and super fine count wools (15. 6 - 18. 5 µm). Between 1999 and 2005, the amount China imported increased surprisingly by averagely 30 % annually. In 2004 / 2005, Chin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cotton fiber {{is a type}} {{of natural}} fibers. Using natural fibers to {{fabricate}} textile can not only decrease the consumption of synthetic fibers, but also reduce the environmental pollution. This study aims to fabricate elastic knitted fabrics and evaluate their properties. Polyester (PET) filaments and rubber threads serve as the warp while cotton yarn serves as the weft for warp knitting. A crochet machine makes the warp and weft into warp knits with desirable stretchability, during which the amount (single/double) and the ply number (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -ply) of the weft are further varied. The resulting warp knits are evaluated for water absorption, air permeability, and mechanical properties. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the warp knits with <b>single</b> 1 -ply <b>weft</b> (S 1) yield an optimal air permeability of 224. 6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s and stiffness along the warp direction of 4. 74 cm. The warp knits with <b>single</b> 2 -ply <b>weft</b> (S 2) display an optimal tearing strength of 86 N while the warp knits with double 3 -ply weft (D 3 / 3) has an optimal tensile strength of 708 N...|$|R
40|$|Model {{sandwich}} laminates were {{manufactured by}} orienting the knitted cloth {{at a range}} of angles to the loading direction using a <b>single</b> Milano <b>weft</b> knitted layer sandwiched between outer plies of unidirectional glass reinforced epoxy resin {{in order to be}} able to observe progressive damage accumulation along the sample. By this way, the relationship between fibre architecture and damage accumulation under tensile loading, as well as the sequence of damage accumulation has been investigated. Damage has been found to initiate at the loop cross-over points of the knitted fabric structure for all orientations, although the further development of the damage depends on the orientation of the fabric to the applied load. The resultant transparent laminates provide a novel method of monitoring the damage development in a knitted-fabric composite as a function of increasing strain by allowing direct observation of the sequence of damage...|$|R

40|$|Crime {{increases}} {{year after}} year. Aggressions using knives, other cut and puncture elements are increasing greatly {{leading to a}} real need for security personnel protection, whether public or private, as weapons used are often improvised and can cause damage in various human body parts or even death. This work {{is focused on the}} study of fibrous materials to be used in cut protection clothing. Different knitted fabrics were produced in <b>single</b> jersey based <b>weft</b> knitted with yarns of different compositions, including ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, para-aramid, high tenacity polyester, high tenacity polyamide and high tenacity polypropylene. Tests have been conducted to analyse the cutting performance index according to the EN 388 standard that defines the material performance according to a scale from 0 to 5. The number of cycles required for a material to be cut determines the performance index, which is subsequently converted to the referred scale, where 0 refers to a material that presents no resistance to cut and 5 the material with greater resistance. From the results obtained it was possible to verify that the jersey structure produced with the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene presents the best performance (4 in the above mentioned scale) and the worst performance is from the jersey structure produced with high tenacity polypropylene yarns that obtained the classification of 1...|$|R
