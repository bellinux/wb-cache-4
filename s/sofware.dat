40|$|This study investgated the {{challenges}} students face when learning chemical reactons in a frst-year chemistry {{course and the}} efectveness of a curriculum and <b>sofware</b> implementaton {{that was used to}} teach and assess student understanding of chemical reactons and equatons. This study took place over a two year period in a public suburban high-school, in southwestern USA. Two advanced placement (AP) chemistry classes partcipated, referred to here as study group A (year 1), N = 14; and study group B (year 2), N = 21. The curriculum for a frst-year chemistry course (group A) was revised to include instructon on reacton-types. The second year of the study involved the creaton and implementaton of a <b>sofware</b> soluton which promoted mastery learning of reacton-types. Students in both groups benefted from the reacton-type curriculum and achieved profciency in chemical reactons and equatons. The fndings suggest there was an added learning beneft to using the reacton-type <b>sofware</b> soluton. This study also found that reacton knowledge was a moderate to strong predictor of chemistry achievement. Based on regression analysis, reacton knowledge signifcantly predicted chemistry achievement for both groups...|$|E

To do that the engineering process needs to be as cost efficient as possible. Since time is money smartly designed systems make full use of already implemented <b>sofware</b> to save time and money with new development. The usage of services have become a well used strategy for the re-usage of software within as well as between businesses. Loose coupling has long been an architectural strategy for achieving modifiability. The loose coupling between services within a system has lately also been a subject of discussion, since there may be several advatages of using the principles regarding loose coupling and high cohesion within and between services.
