50|$|Ion-exchange {{chromatography}} separates molecules {{based on}} their respective charged groups. Ion-exchange chromatography retains analyte molecules on the column based on coulombic (ionic) interactions. Essentially, molecules undergo electrostatic interactions with opposite charges on the stationary phase matrix. The stationary phase consists of an immobile matrix that contains charged ionizable functional groups or ligands. The stationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups (R-X) that interact with analyte ions of opposite charge. To achieve electroneutrality, these inert charges couple with exchangeable counterions in the solution. Ionizable molecules {{that are to be}} purified compete with these exchangeable counterions for binding to the immobilized charges on the stationary phase. These ionizable molecules are retained or eluted {{based on their}} charge. Initially, molecules that do not bind or bind weakly to the stationary phase are first to wash away. Altered conditions are needed for the elution of the molecules that bind to the stationary phase. The concentration of the exchangeable counterions, which competes with the molecules for binding, can be increased or the pH can be changed. A change in pH affects the charge on the particular molecules and, therefore, alters binding. The molecules then start eluting out based on the changes in their charges from the adjustments. Further such adjustments can be used to release the protein of interest. Additionally, concentration of counterions can be gradually varied to separate ionized molecules. This type of elution is called gradient elution. On the other hand, <b>step</b> <b>elution</b> can be used in which the concentration of counterions are varied in one step. This type of chromatography is further subdivided into cation exchange chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. Positively charged molecules bind to anion exchange resins while negatively charged molecules bind to cation exchange resins. The ionic compound consisting of the cationic species M+ and the anionic species B- can be retained by the stationary phase.|$|E

Twenty-eight positions {{have been subjected to}} mutagenesis to yield 335 Sav isoforms, which can be expressed in 24 -deep-well plates using autoinduction medium. The resulting cell-free extracts (CFEs) typically contain > 1 mg of soluble Sav. Two straightforward alternatives are presented, which allow the screening of ArMs using CFEs containing Sav. To produce an artificial transfer hydrogenase, Sav is coupled to a biotinylated three-legged iridium pianostool complex Cp*Ir(Biot-p-L) Cl (the cofactor). To screen Sav variants for this application, you would determine the number of free binding sites, treat them with diamide, incubate them with the cofactor and then perform the reaction with your test compound (the example used in this protocol is 1 -phenyl- 3, 4 -dihydroisoquinoline).

IgG with a native hydrodynamic diameter of 11. 5 nm began to elute at pH 6. 0 {{with a size}} of 9. 4 nm. IgG size continued to decrease across the peak, reaching a minimum of 2. 2 nm at pH 3. 9. Secondary structure of early eluting IgG was only mildly affected but later eluting fractions became increasingly non-native with the 2. 2 nm population exhibiting the highest proportion of β-sheet and lowest random coil of all conformations. Size reduction and structural change of IgG through {{this portion of the}} elution peak were attributed dominantly to a pre-existing tendency of highly concentrated IgG to adopt reduced size conformations at low pH and conductivity, facilitated by the known conformational relaxation of IgG by its interaction with protein A. IgG size increased to 10. 4 nm as elution pH approached 3. 5 across the tailing fractions. Major loss of β-sheet and increase of α-helix and random coil were observed in parallel. Late elution of this population was attributed to it being eluted from interactions with 2 distinct protein A domains, one bound to each side of the Fc region, creating a higher dissociation constant than single-site Fc-protein A interactions, and requiring more severely disruptive conditions for elution.

This process ends {{with a certain amount of}} residual ethanol because of complication in separation process for ethanol and water makes an azeotropic binary system. The results showed that adsorption capacity of an alcoholic solution with 10 % ethanol content is better than aqueous solution which contained no ethanol. In dynamic studies, the adsorption and desorption experiments were carried out on a glass column packed with XAD 7 HP resin. The flow velocity 122 cm/h operated as a fixed bed while operation was in an expanded bed mode at 367 cm/h and 611 cm/h, respectively. The effectiveness of the packed bed adsorption and the fluidized bed adsorption were compared. The results show the breakthrough occurred earlier when the feed flow velocity increased. In the elution <b>step,</b> <b>elution</b> program with 2, 000 ml for 0 %, 4, 000 ml for 40 % and 3, 000 ml for 90 % aqueous ethanol was used to achieve an efficient separation. Total phenol content and antioxidant capacity of olive leaf crude extract and effluent fractions were analyzed in order to find the difference between before and after separation. Consequently, fluidized bed adsorption is a promising alternative for the packed bed adsorption in order to isolate oleuropein and rutin from the olive leaf extract...|$|E
40|$|Effected Directed Analysis (EDA) {{approach}} aims {{to identify}} adverse pollutants {{by reducing the}} complexcity of environmental matrices. Single hyperfractionation combined to bioassays is usefull to isolate known active chemicals and to direct chemical analyses to these "classical'pollutants. However, although the emergence of promising chemical tools (e. g. Orbitrap), identification of unknown active chemicals is still time and cost consuming due {{to the complexity of}} each active fraction (e. g. mixture effect). Hence, further fractionation steps are often needed. The aims {{of this study was to}} develop and to test the use of a first pre-fractionation step on SPE that will be followed by a RP-HPLC fractionation. First the separation of 12 EDCs have been evaluated with several elution conditions. Silica cartridges with 4 <b>step</b> <b>elution</b> - heptane, heptane/dichloromethane (50 / 50, v/v), ethyl-acetate and methanol/water (50 / 50, v/v) - allowing the best and reproductible isolation of chemicals, have been chosen for further investigations. For these conditions, recoveries were assessed for the mixture alone and for a blank sediment extract spiked with this mixture. Finally, a natural sediment known to exert estrogenic, PXR-like, anti-androgenic and dioxin-like activity was fractionated following these conditions. Good mixture recoveries (74 - 110 %), were obtained. The fractionation F 1 contained only the PCBs and the PAHs, while 4 -tert-octylphenol, triphenyl phosphate and fenofibrate were detected only in F 2. Finally, steroids, bisphenol A and clotrimazole were found in F 3 while F 4 contained more polar chemicals. Fractionation on natural sediment allows isolation of TCDD-like activity in F 1 and F 2 while PAH like activity was detected in F 1, F 2 and in F 3. Then estrogenic compounds were only detected in F 2 and F 3. Interestingly, the sum of the estrogenic activity found in these 2 fractions is higher than the activity found in the crude extract, sugggesting the occurrence of anti-estrogenic chemicals. Finally, PXR-like activity was mainly detected in F 3. this pre-fractionation protocol allows, in the present case study, the isolation of several biological activities. Based on this first isolation directed hyperfractionation has then been undergone, RPHPLC hyperfractionation on C 18 has been calibrated for the separation of 35 EDCs with broad range of chemical properties and will be readly used for the isolation of active chemicals in the polar and semi-polar pre-fractions...|$|E
40|$|The Pak Pa-Nang River Basin {{is located}} in {{southern}} Thailand. Its environmental degradation has been arising because its catchment is mineralized with substantial deposits of tin forming part of the SE Asian Tin Belt, {{with the presence of}} arsenopyrite gives rise to high arsenic concentrations, mobilized during past mining activity. Suitable techniques have been developed, for the extraction of arsenic species in a variety of environmental and biological samples. Trypsin and cellulase enzymatic extraction procedures were used to extract arsenic species from fish and plant samples, respectively. Arsenic species in sediments were determined following 1 M H 3 P 04 extraction in an open focused microwave system. An anion-exchange HPLC system employing a <b>step</b> <b>elution,</b> with sulphate and phosphate solution as the mobile phase coupled with ICP-MS was used for separation and detection of the important arsenic species, e. g. AsB, DMA, MMA, and inorganic arsenic in fish and plant samples. And species of AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA were determined in sediment samples. A nitric acid microwave digestion procedure, followed by carrier gas nitrogen addition (N 2) -ICP-MS analysis, to overcome argon chloride (40 Ar 35 Cl+) interference, was used to measure total arsenic. Validation for these procedures was carried out using certified reference materials and real samples, mussel, cockle, green seaweed, brown seaweed and sediment collected from the Tamar Estuary, UK. Fish samples from the Pak Pa-Nang Estuary showed a range for total arsenic concentration, up to 17 µg gˉ¹ dry mass. The highest total arsenic found in plant samples was 189 µg gˉ¹ (dry mass), in the root of rice plants. The major species of arsenic in all fish samples was AsB, together with smaller quantities of DMA and, more importantly, inorganic arsenic. The major species found in plant was MMA, together with inorganic arsenic at various levels, ranging from minor to trace, dependent upon the part of the plant. Total concentrations of arsenic in the sediments covered a range up to 285 µg gˉ¹, and showed a steep decreasing concentration gradient downstream from the upper mined areas to the estuary. AsV was the major species found in the sediment samples with smaller quantities of AsIII and MMA. The presence of the more toxic inorganic forms of arsenic in water, sediments and biota samples has implications for human health, particularly as they are readily 'available'. Considering the dynamic conditions found in the river basin between the dry and wet (monsoon) season, the supply of these highly toxic arsenic species to humans and environment is likely to continue. This may be for many years, particularly when the levels of arsenic stored in river sediments are considered. Higher rainfall could remobilize arsenic from the various main and intermediate sources and could be carried on SPM, especially on fine particulate matter, to the Pak Pa-Nang Estuary and also the Gulf of Thailand. From this study, the implications of arsenic transport within the water management system for the Pak Pa-Nang River Basin are highlighted.

After cation exchange chromatography on Mono S, the final steps were performed using a reverse phase RP 8 -e column. For these steps, radioreceptor assays were utilized to detect VIP and PHI. We confirmed that the VIP sequence of rabbit was identical to that of porcine VIP. The PHI sequence was also found identical to that of porcine PHI; By contrast, rabbit secretin was highly original, differing from porcine secretin in having Leu, Arg and Leu-NH 2 residues instead of Phe, Ser and Val-NH 2 in, respectively, position 6, 16 and 27.
