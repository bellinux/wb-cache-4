40|$|Several {{procedures}} for casting 100 μm ultrathin immobilized pH gradients are described. When acrylate/glass molding cassettes (Pascali et al., Electrophoresis 1987, 8, 371 – 373) are used two main problems are encountered: (i) a tendency of polymerization solutions, {{at the beginning}} of delivery, to spread across the glass surfaces with troublesome effects on the gradient stratification, and (ii) the raising of steep menisci at both extremities of the pH intervals, originating from capillarity phenomena and resulting in nonuniform gradients with bowed electrophoretic patterns. The first shortcoming was acceptably solved by increasing the density of sucrose gradients, and pouring them into prewarmed molding cassettes. The detrimental effect of menisci could be overcome by using a ‘squeezing-sealing mold’ technique. A molding cassette was endowed with a continuous, squared <b>spacer</b> <b>frame,</b> the upper side being open by inserting a wedged clip. A slight excess of polymerization solution was first dispensed into the cassette and squeezed away on removal of the clip. By completely excluding air from the molding cassette, uniform and well reproducible ultrathin gels could be cast. A major advantage of ultrathin immobilized pH gradient gels is the drastically shorter focusing time...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} small, lightweight micro Sun sensor (MSS) {{has been}} flight qualified {{as part of}} the attitude-determination system of a spacecraft or for Mars surface operations. The MSS has previously been reported at a very early stage of development in NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 1 (January 2004). An MSS is essentially a miniature multiple-pinhole electronic camera combined with digital processing electronics that functions analogously to a sundial. A micromachined mask containing a number of microscopic pinholes is mounted in front of an active-pixel sensor (APS). Electronic circuits for controlling the operation of the APS, readout from the pixel photodetectors, and analog-to-digital conversion are all integrated onto the same chip along with the APS. The digital processing includes computation of the centroids of the pinhole Sun images on the APS. The spacecraft computer has the task of converting the Sun centroids into Sun angles utilizing a calibration polynomial. The micromachined mask comprises a 500 -micron-thick silicon wafer, onto which is deposited a 57 -nm-thick chromium adhesion- promotion layer followed by a 200 -nm-thick gold light-absorption layer. The pinholes, 50 microns in diameter, are formed in the gold layer by photolithography. The chromium layer is thin enough to be penetrable by an amount of Sunlight adequate to form measurable pinhole images. A <b>spacer</b> <b>frame</b> between the mask and the APS maintains a gap of. 1 mm between the pinhole plane and the photodetector plane of the APS. To minimize data volume, mass, and power consumption, the digital processing of the APS readouts takes place in a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The particular FPGA is a radiation- tolerant unit that contains. 32, 000 gates. No external memory is used so the FPGA calculates the centroids in real time as pixels are read off the APS with minimal internal memory. To enable the MSS to fit into a small package, the APS, the FPGA, and other components are mounted on a single two-sided board following chip-on-board design practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{last several}} years have {{produced}} {{a wide variety of}} new window products aimed at reducing the energy impacts associated with residential windows. Improvements have focused on reducing the rate at which heat flows through the total window product by conduction/convection and thermal radiation (quantified by the U-factor) as well as in controlling solar heat gain (measured by the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) or Shading Coefficient (SC)). Significant improvements in window performance have been made with low-E coated glazings, gas fills in multiple pane windows and with changes in <b>spacer</b> and <b>frame</b> materials and designs. These improvements have been changes to existing design concepts. They have pushed the limits of the individual features and revealed weaknesses. The next generation of windows will have to incorporate new materials and ideas, like recessed night insulation, seasonal sun shades and structural window frames, into the design, manufacturing and construction process, to produce an integrated window system that will be an energy and comfort asset...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{examples}} of sextants made with wood, however most are made from brass. In order to ensure the frame was stiff, instrument makers used thicker frames. This had a drawback in making the instrument heavier, which could influence the accuracy due to hand-shaking as the navigator worked against its weight. In order to avoid this problem, the frames were modified. Edward Troughton patented the double-framed sextant in 1788. [...] This used two frames held in parallel with <b>spacers.</b> The two <b>frames</b> were about a centimetre apart. This significantly increased the stiffness of the frame. An earlier version had a second frame that only covered {{the upper part of}} the instrument, securing the mirrors and telescope. Later versions used two full <b>frames.</b> Since the <b>spacers</b> looked like little pillars, these were also called pillar sextants. Troughton also experimented with alternative materials. The scales were plated with silver, gold or platinum. Gold and platinum both minimized corrosion problems. The platinum-plated instruments were expensive, due to the scarcity of the metal, though less expensive than gold. Troughton knew William Hyde Wollaston through the Royal Society and this gave him access to the precious metal. [...] Instruments from Troughton's company that used platinum can be easily identified by the word Platina engraved on the frame. These instruments remain highly valued as collector's items and are as accurate today as when they were constructed.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{addresses}} {{the effect that}} the physical properties of window elements have on the light and heat currents passing through the opening. The first part of the thesis describes all the component elements of a window that affect the coefficients of heat transfer, the transmission of solar radiation and the transmission of light. Using various glazing materials, <b>frames,</b> <b>spacers</b> and the air space between the window panes, we made a selection of elements for calculating the coefficients of heat transfer, the transmission of solar radiation and the transmission of light. We performed the calculations using the WINDOW 5. 0 computer program for different window combinations and sizes. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we performed comparisons of the coefficient calculations based on set criteria. We performed the comparisons according to four different sets using a different component element of a window as a variable in every set. In this way we discovered the effect of an individual element on the entire window system. Alongside all these comparisons, we also presented the results for the reference window, for which we selected a window with such elements that it just fulfilled the conditions for use in heated buildings laid down in the Rules on Thermal Insulation and Efficient Energy Use in Buildings. For all the comparisons made, we presented the results of the coefficients in a table and a graph. At the end of each set of comparisons we wrote an in-depth commentary on the comparisons performed including the essential findings on the effect of the various types of window component elements on the quality of the living space. In addition to the four sets of comparisons, we also prepared another two comparisons, in which we compared windows with very different types of individual component elements, thus showing to what extent the composition of window elements affects the coefficients calculated...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} findings of a market and research review related to state-of-the-art highly insulating window frames. The market review focuses on window frames that satisfy the Passivhaus requirements (window U-value less or equal to 0. 8 W/m{sup 2 }K), while other examples are also given in order to show the variety of materials and solutions that may be used for constructing window frames with a low thermal transmittance (U-value). The market search shows that several combinations of materials are used in order to obtain window frames with a low U-value. The most common insulating material seems to be Polyurethane (PUR), which is used together with most of the common structural materials such as wood, aluminum, and PVC. The frame research review also shows examples of window frames developed in order to increase the energy efficiency of the frames and the glazings which the frames are to be used together with. The authors find that two main tracks are used in searching for better solutions. The first one is to minimize the heat losses through the frame itself. The result is that conductive materials are replaced by highly thermal insulating materials and air cavities. The other option is to reduce the window frame area to a minimum, which is done by focusing on the net energy gain by the entire window (<b>frame,</b> <b>spacer</b> and glazing). Literature shows that a window with a higher U-value may give a net energy gain to a building that is higher than a window with a smaller U-value. The net energy gain is calculated by subtracting the transmission losses through the window from the solar energy passing through the windows. The net energy gain depends on frame versus glazing area, solar factor, solar irradiance, calculation period and U-value. The frame research review also discusses heat transfer modeling issues related to window frames. Thermal performance increasing measures, surface modeling, and frame cavity modeling are among the topics discussed. The review shows that the current knowledge gives the basis for improving the calculation procedures in the calculation standards. At the same time it is room for improvement within some areas, e. g. to fully understand the natural convection effects inside irregular vertical frame cavities (jambs) and ventilated frame cavities...|$|R
