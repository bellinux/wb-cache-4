50|$|Fluorescence {{excitation}} {{is accomplished}} using various kind of light sources. Halogen lamps {{have the advantage}} of delivering high power for a relatively low cost. Using different band-pass filters, the same source can be used to produce several excitation channels from the UV to the near infrared. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become very popular for low cost broad band illumination and narrow band excitation in FGS. Because of their characteristic light emission spectrum, a narrow range of wavelengths that matches the absorption spectrum of a given fluorophore can be selected without using a filter, further reducing the complexity of the optical system. Both halogen lamps and LEDs are suitable for white light illumination of the <b>sample.</b> <b>Excitation</b> can also be performed using laser diodes, particularly when high power over a short wavelength range (typically 5-10 nm) is needed. In this case the system has to account for the limits of exposure to laser radiation.|$|E

Scaling NOM structural factors, which affect the transport and immobilization of HOC, is rather involved due to the complexity of the NOM materials. Sorption properties of hydrophobically modified polyacrylic (HMPA) polymers as NOM model substances for pyrene were investigated and discussed with regard to reported NOM results. Emission fluorescence spectroscopic properties of pyrene and potentiometric titrations were used to characterize the hydrophobic and acidic properties of HMPA <b>samples.</b> <b>Excitation</b> fluorescence spectroscopy allowed a speciation of pyrene molecules. Overall complexation constants, beta(1) and beta(2) of pyrene with hydrophobic moieties (-C 8 H 17) and (-C 16 H 33) were calculated depending on the pH and electrolyte cation nature at an ionic strength of 10 mM, typical of soil solution conditions. Aggregation of HMPA molecules was detected by photon correlation spectroscopy. Normalized sorption constant K-oc values for pyrene with HMPA samples similar to reported values with NOM support recent observations on the contribution of aliphatic moieties to the binding of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).

40|$|The goal of {{our study}} {{is to develop a}} setup that {{combines}} multi-trapping and manipulation with micro Raman spectroscopy of microns size particles. Multiple trapping, in 2 D or 3 D (two or three dimensional) configurations, is obtained in an inverted microscope scheme by shaping the trapping beam (1064 nm) with diffractive optical elements implemented on a spatial light modulator (SLM). Manipulation of multiple particles, directly trapped by the beam, can be achieved using the dynamic displaying of the SLM. Indirect trapping and manipulation of the sample can be obtained surrounding it with trapped micro beads that are manipulated by the optical tweezers. Laser light is not directly focused on the sample but is distributed on the beads and therefore the photo-induced damaging of biological samples is reduced.
