40|$|The {{influence}} of palm oil replacement with a monoglyceride-palm oil-water gel (hydrogel) on physical properties and acrylamide {{content of a}} low fat <b>short</b> dough <b>pastry</b> was studied. The effect of the incorporation of the hydrogel was monitored during storage by assessing moisture, firmness, proton density/mobility using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and acrylamide content. The use of hydrogel allowed the lipid content of pastries to be reduced without affecting their moisture and crumb firmness. However, the hydrogel containing pastries showed a more crunchy crust, higher acrylamide content and a higher tendency to staling. As assessed by MRI, these results were ascribable {{to the development of}} a peculiar system morphology promoted by hydrogel incorporation in the food matrix...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to assess {{the current state of}} risk {{analysis}} and of the critical points system HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) in a food processing business of the PETA Bohemia limited company. On the basis of the latest findings the new optimal HACCP system, which is based on scientific data, systematically identifies specific risks and measures for their control so as to ensure food safety. A food business operator is obliged to create a critical points system by Regulation (EC) No 852 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, Article 5 ``Hazard analysis and critical control points``, paragraph 1 : ``Food business operators shall put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on the HACCP principles. `` The introductory part contains a short literature retrieval on the development of management methods and on the control of food products by means of the HACCP system. These systems are generally considered as a useful tool for food business operators serving to control risks which can occur in food. They are science-based and systematic, they identify specific risks and measures for control in order to ensure food safety. They are a tool for risk assessment and setting up of control systems which do not depend on testing of the final product but focus mainly on prevention. All HACCP systems can be accomodated to changes such as progress in external adaptation of equipment, process of manufacturing or technological development. The practical part describes in detail the technological process of producing pastry products, especially <b>short</b> <b>pastry.</b> The production is applied into a small bakery of the PETA Bohemia limited company which was founded in Soběslav in 1991. On the base of interviews and provided background information it was possible to view the food business in a complex manner and to get an insight into the current, as well as the past situation of the company and its goals. The risk analysis of the technological process of <b>short</b> <b>pastry</b> production enabled to determine a critical control point, its attributes and values of critical limits, to define the system of managed state monitoring and to determine corrective measures. A manual of the HACCP elaborated in this manner fulfills all legislative requirements. By its implentation the Peta BOHEMIA company gains a risk management system of high quality leading in its final effect towards production of high quality healthy food. The system focused mainly on practical and expert knowledge of the staff connected with sensoric knowledge of final pastry products puts emphasis on encreasing their personal responsibility and understanding of the problem...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of a food}} {{material is}} an essential physical property in mathematical modelling and computer simulation of thermal processing. Effective thermal conductivity of non-homogeneous materials, such as food matrices, can be determined experimentally or mathematically. The aim of the following research was to compare the thermal conductivity of <b>short</b> <b>pastry</b> biscuits, at different baking stages (60 - 160 min), measured by a line heat source thermal conductivity probe and estimated {{through the use of}} thermo-physical models. The measures were carried out on whole biscuits and on powdered biscuits compressed into cylindrical cases. Thermal conductivity of the compacted material, at different baking times (and, consequently at different moisture content), was then used to feed parallel, series, Krischer and Maxwell-Eucken models. The results showed that the application of the hot wire method for the determination of thermal conductivity is not fully feasible if applied directly to whole materials due to mechanical changes applied to the structure and the high presence of fats. The method works best if applied to the biscuit component phases separately. The best model is the Krischer one for its adaptability. In this case the value of biscuit thermal conductivity, for high baking time, varies from 0. 15 to 0. 19 Wm – 1 K – 1, while the minimum, for low baking time, varies from 0. 11 to 0. 12 Wm – 1 K – 1. These values are close to that reported in literature for similar products...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{the quality}} of New Zealand wheat and flour is ever ongoing. A further {{catalyst}} to interest in the topic was the announcement that New Zealand farmgate wheat prices would be directly linked with world prices as from the 1981 harvest. This greater exposure of the wheat industry to international market forces has caused wheat millers and flour bakers to advocate more forcefully for quality improvements. Quality is the set of attributes which the different sectors of the market look for in wheat based products. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the market quality demands with the existing quality supplies of New Zealand grown wheat and flour, in order to suggest management changes that would bring quality supplies closer to quality demands. The market for wheat and flour is segmented, and centres around that required for milling (300, 000 tonnes), animal foods (60, 000 tonnes) and seed (13, 000 tonnes). For every 100 tonnes of wheat milled approximately 78 tonnes of flour is extracted for human consumption and industrial use, whilst the remaining 22 tonnes becomes bran and pollard byproducts for animal use. The resultant flour is sold mainly to bakers for the production of bread. Other flour buyers include householders, starch and gluten manufacturers, biscuit makers, cake makers and pasta manufacturers. Wheat for milling needs to have a low screenings content, low moisture content, low sprout index, freedom from insect and bug damage, and heavy grain weight. Millers also require to know grain hardness, protein content and dough strength. Animal feed wheats need to have desirable nutritional qualities primarily in the form of high total energy yield. The seed wheat market requires varieties that are profitable to growers, and multiply into grain that meets the quality requirements of the market to which it is destined (i. e. milling grade or animal feed). Milling grade wheat products and associated quality requirements are varied. The breakfast cereal market often requires health promoting products that are high in both fibre and protein. Good bread flour comes from high protein, relatively hard wheats exhibiting strong dough characteristics. Other products requiring this flour type are cracker biscuits, fruit cakes and puff pastry. Biscuit flour needs a lower protein, softer wheat exhibiting weaker dough characteristics. Products requiring this flour type are sweet biscuits, plain cakes and <b>short</b> <b>pastry.</b> Pasta flour is best made from certain hard wheat varieties. Starch flour needs a high protein content and a high paste viscosity potential. Quality is affected by management applied at various points along the distribution chain. An organisation that exercises considerable control over this management is the New Zealand Wheat Board. Important quality management aspects include breeding, farm pricing and segregation. This latter topic includes the segregation of milling grade wheat, the segregation and blending of the resultant flour, plus the associated storage and transport. Suggestions that would bring existing standards closer to the qualities required in the market include the introduction of: (i) Milling grade protein payments to growers (ii) Animal feed contracts (iii) An industrial flour category (iv) A lower flour extraction rate (v) A minimum grain weight for defining milling grade wheat. The institution that has the power to implement and coordinate these suggestions is the New Zealand Wheat Board, because it is the single authority responsible for marketing New Zealand wheat and flour. Further research needed, to establish how best to implement some of these suggestions, is also discussed...|$|E
