However, the limitation of the specificity and efficiency of the <b>synthetic</b> tumor <b>vaccines</b> need further improvements. To overcome these difficulties, additional tumor-associated targets need to be identified, and optimized structural designs of vaccines need to be elaborated.

40|$|Although {{vaccines}} {{have been}} used {{for a long time and}} different types of vaccines have been developed, as yet no fully <b>synthetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> have been produced. The production of fully <b>synthetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> has probably not been realized so far due to the structural limitations of linear synthetic peptides to mimic the native shape of protein fragments which is often needed to induce protective antibodies. In this report we used the Bordetella pertussis protein pertactin as a model and show that a novel synthetic scaffold can be used to mimic structurally defined epitopes by confined presentation of several different peptide arms. Guided by modelling a construct was synthesized that induced protective antibodies directed towards a discontinuous epitope. This approach opens up the possibility to the design of new and fully <b>synthetic</b> <b>vaccines</b> that can induce protective antibodies...|$|R

40|$|The major outer {{membrane}} protein of Chlamydia trachomatis {{has been extensively}} studied and is still {{considered one of the}} most promising candidates for development of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Neutralizing epitopes in variable domains I, II, and IV have already been reported. In variable domain I, residues 69 to 78 have been identified as a neutralizing epitope for some of the C- and C-related complex serovars (A, C, I, J, L 3, and K). It is not known whether epitopes located at the same position in B-complex serovars are neutralizing. To clarify this point, rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the peptide 69 TTTGNAVAPS 78 from the B serovar were produced. Rabbit antisera were further rendered peptide specific by purification on a peptide-bovine serum albumin-Sepharose affinity column. Peptide-specific rabbit immunoglobulin reacted with five of the B-complex serovars (B, Ba, E, L 1, and L 2) by immunoblot and by direct-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, this peptide-specific rabbit immunoglobulin neutralized the chlamydial infectivity of both serovars B and E for HaK cells in a complement-independent in vitro assay. The importance of these results stems from the fact that peptide 69 TTTGNAVAPS 78 was able to induce an antibody response directed against B- and B-related complex serovars, including serovar E, which is responsible for a high proportion of genital infections. This peptide could therefore be considered for the construction of a multivalent <b>synthetic</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E

40|$|Bartonella bacilliformis is the {{etiologic}} agent of Carrión’s disease or Oroya fever. B. bacilliformis infection represents an interesting model of human host specificity. The notable differences in clinical presentations of Carrión’s disease suggest complex adaptations by the bacterium {{to the human}} host, with the overall objectives of persistence, maintenance of a reservoir state for vectorial transmission, and immune evasion. These events include a multitude of biochemical and genetic mechanisms involving both bacterial and host proteins. This review focuses on proteins involved in interactions between B. bacilliformis and the human host.

40|$|Using native {{chemical}} ligation, we synthesized a group A streptococcal.

We also synthesized a lipid core peptide (LCP) construct containing the same three peptides.

40|$|The {{development}} of selective anticancer vaccines that provide enhanced protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis {{has been the}} subject of intense research in the scientific community.

However, many of these vaccine prototypes suffer from an inherent low immunogenicity and are susceptible to rapid in vivo degradation. To overcome these drawbacks, novel fluorinated MUC 1 glycopeptide-BSA/TTox conjugate vaccines have been prepared. Immunization of mice with the 4 ’F-TF-MUC 1 -TTox conjugate resulted in strong immune responses overriding the natural tolerance against MUC 1 and producing selective IgG antibodies that are cross-reactive with native MUC 1 epitopes on MCF- 7 human cancer cells...|$|E
