The dependences of the spin <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltages</b> on magnetic fields and temperature are analyzed by a magnon spin current theory. The numerical calculation of spin <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltages</b> using magnetic parameters of α-Cu_ 2 V_ 2 O_ 7 determined by previous neutron scattering studies reveals that the magnetic-field and temperature dependences of the spin <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltages</b> for α-Cu_ 2 V_ 2 O_ 7 |Pt are governed by the changes in magnon lifetimes with magnetic fields and temperature...|$|R

A plethora of new phenomena has been discovered that promises, e. g., to make wasted heat in electronic devices useable or to provide new read-out mechanisms for information. However, only few materials have been studied so far with <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltages</b> of only some μV, which hampers applications. Here, we demonstrate that half-metallic Heusler compounds are hot candidates for enhancing spin-dependent thermoelectric effects. This becomes evident when considering the asymmetry of the spin-split density of electronic states around the Fermi level that determines the spin-dependent thermoelectric transport in magnetic tunnel junctions. We identify Co_ 2 FeAl and Co_ 2 FeSi Heusler compounds as ideal due to their energy gaps in the minority density of states, and demonstrate devices with substantially larger <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltages</b> and tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect ratios than the commonly used Co-Fe-B based junctions.

30|$|The {{composite}} material NaTaO 3 –Fe 2 O 3 shows a large <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltage</b> of − 300  mV at a temperature gradient of ∆T =  650  K with linear temperature dependence [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and is stable up to 1, 623  K [12, 15]. Yet its large resistivity {{has to be}} lowered for increasing the power factor and figure-of-merit. We have reported previous results on spark plasma sintering (SPS) experiments [15], where a remarkable increase in electric conductivity was achieved, but the <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltage</b> has dropped. The conclusion was that either the interface structure or the microstructure has changed due to the high-temperature plasma, the vacuum, diffusion from the carbon crucible, or during the subsequent fast cooling and {{are responsible for the}} decrease of the Seebeck coefficient. Further findings were that composites processed from Fe 2 O 3 and NaTaO 3, or additions of NaFeO 3 deteriorate the electric conductivity and yield to an insulator. The reason for the good performance of this {{composite material}} is the interface between Fe 2 O 3 and NaTaO 3 with perovskite structure. The largest <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltage</b> was measured when the second phase Fe 2 O 3 reaches an amount of 50  mol% [10], which is just the percolation limit when the second phase starts to surround the perovskite phase NaTaO 3.

Based on the results of preflight and real-time computations, several well-defined thruster firing events were programmed to occur at specific times during the experiment. In particular, we simulated the effects of the thruster firings on melt and crystal composition in a directionally solidifying Sn-Bi alloy. The relative accelerations produced by the firings were simulated by impulsive accelerations of the same magnitude, duration and orientation as the requested firings. A comparison of the simulation results with the Seebeck signal indicates that there is a good agreement between the two.

Nanowire networks are grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition on non-single crystalline surfaces leading to highly interconnected networks of nanowires capable of long-range three-dimensional transport while retaining many of the unique properties of highly conned nanowire structures and displayingadvantageous and unique properties such as mechanical flexibility. Growth of semiconducting nanowire networks is discussed in depth, especially relating {{to the role of the}} non-single crystalline surfaces from which they grow and morphological changes associated with doping. Finite element simulations suggest that the physical intersectionspresent within a nanowire network are found to play a complex and potentially useful role in thermal transport and in electrical transport through experiment, demonstrating quantized conductance for the first time at room temperature. Electrical transport over distances far in excess of the dimensions of the individual nanowires is also studied experimentally by applying surface photovoltage techniques for the first time to nanowire networks.

40|$|A {{multi-directional}} {{airflow sensor}} has been realized. The {{essential part of}} the considered sensor is a thermopile configuration, which enables the measurement of flow speed and flow direction. The thermopile is a series arrangement of eight thermocouples. A thermocouple converts a difference in temperature into an electrical signal, by means of the Seebeck effect. The thermocouples are made of aluminum-N-type polysilicon junctions. The incoming flow is heated and the degree of heat transfer by convection to the flow, depends on the speed of the flow; the faster the flow the smaller the heat transfer, which leads to a smaller (<b>Seebeck)</b> output <b>voltage</b> of the thermopiles. After signal conditioning - i. e., filtering and amplification by means of an amplification system - the electrical output signals of the thermopiles are further signal-processed by applying analog-to-digital signal conversion, so that finally the flow speed and the flow direction can be properly displayed on a computer screen. The measured values of the Seebeck coefficient or thermopower (S) were in the range of: 0. 43 to 0. 68 mV/K which are in good agreement with the values found in the literature: 0. 5 to 0. 7 mV/K.

40|$|Thin {{films of}} PbBiSrCaCuO {{superconductor}} {{have been produced}} by means of single target magnetron rf sputtering followed by a heat treatment. The effects of deposition and post-annealing parameters on film properties were investigated. It was found that film thickness decreases near the discharge center, possibly due to the preferential ion bombardment of the film during deposition. Superconducting films with the high Tc 2223 phase could be obtained after a heat treatment as short as 60 min. A structural transition from the semiconducting phase to the low T c 2212 phase {{took place in the}} film during the preannealing in O 2 (20 min). During the subsequent annealing in air (40 min), a gradual structural transition from the 2212 phase to 2223 phase occurred when the annealing temperature and duration were increased. The resulting films showed Tc ~ 107 K and Jc exceeding 8 x 103 A/cm 2 at 79 K. For all stages of the transition, the phases revealed in the temperature characteristics of electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility are consistent with those identified in the XRD spectra of the film. Heat treatments of shorter duration or at lower temperatures resulted in films with mixed 2212 and 2223 phases, in which a superconducting percolation path could still be established at temperatures as high as 100 K. The evolution of film compositions with annealing time suggested that Pb is a precursor of the chemical reactions behind the accelerated formation of the 2223 phase. The photoresponse of PbBiSrCaCuO film was investigated at temperatures below, around, and beyond Tc. Consistency was found between photoresponse and temperature derivative of film resistivity near Tc, suggesting that the photoresponse is bolometric in origin. Other bolometric signatures include the long recovery time and linear dependence of photoresponse with supplied current. Below Tc, a fast response appeared when the power density of optical excitation exceeded a certain threshold. The effect of bias temperature on transient structure, magnitude, and time delay of the fast response showed that this response is also bolometric. A bolometric model was developed using the solutions of the problem of linear heat flow in a solid bounded by a pair of parallel planes. The photoresponses predicted by this model were in good agreement with those obtained experimentally. Beyond T c, it was found that a nonbolometric photoresponse coexists with the bolometric counterpart in electrically biased films. These components superimpose linearly and can be extracted from the responses measured with forward and reverse bias currents. The nonbolometric component also manifested itself as the response of electrically unbiased films. Its behavior was consistent with prediction of a model based on the Seebeck effect. In this model the film was depicted as a number of parallel layers having different thermopowers and forming a tilt angle to the substrate surface. Such a structure {{can be seen as the}} equivalent of a number of thermocouples connected in series along the length of the film. Upon thermal heating of the film, the temperature gradient in the individual thermocouples results in <b>Seebeck</b> <b>voltages</b> that add up to the transverse nonbolometric voltage...|$|R

We calculate the thermally induced charge and spin current {{as well as}} the thermoelectric <b>voltage</b> (<b>Seebeck</b> effect) in the linear and nonlinear regimes. Our calculation revealed that due to the electron-hole symmetry, the charge Seebeck coefficient is, for an undoped magnetic graphene, an odd function of chemical potential while the spin Seebeck coefficient is an even function regardless of the temperature gradient and junction length. We have also found with an accurate tuning external parameter, namely the exchange filed and gate voltage, the temperature gradient across the junction drives a pure spin current without accompanying the charge current. Another important characteristic of thermoelectric transport, thermally induced current in the nonlinear regime, is examined.
