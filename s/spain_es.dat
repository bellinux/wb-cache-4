40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} explore {{clinical}} and care-related 'factors associated with fulfilling cancer patients' preference for home death across four countries: Belgium (BE), the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), and <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES).</b> Methods: A mortality follow-back study was undertaken from 2009 to 2011 via representative networks of general practitioners (GPs). The study included all patients aged 18 and over who had died of cancer and whose home death preference and place of death were known by the GP. Factors associated with meeting home death preference were tested using multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among 2, 048 deceased patients, preferred and actual place of death was known in 42. 6 percent of cases. Home death preference met ranged from 65. 5 to 90. 9 percent. Country-specific factors included older age in BE, and decision-making capacity and being female in the NL. GPs' provision of palliative care was positively associated with meeting home death preference. Odds ratios (ORs) were: BE: 9. 9 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 3. 7 - 26. 6); NL: 9. 7 (2. 4 - 39. 9); and IT: 2. 6 (1. 2 - 5. 5).

In this context, the paper introduces the presentation layer of OO-HMethod, an extension of the OO-Method conceptual modeling approach that is devoted to the specification of this kind of interfaces. The OO-HMethod presentation approach is based on the concept of templates. Each page template may fall into a set of categories, which together cover the di#erent presentation perspectives captured in the model. In order to better define the page template structure, a new diagram is introduced: the Abstract Presentation Diagram (APD). The APD {{does not need to be}} drawn from scratch: the navigation structure previously defined in the Navigation Access Diagram (NAD) of OO-HMethod provides the information needed to automatically generate a default APD.

40|$|P>Background Peristomal skin {{problems}} are common and are treated {{by a variety}} of health professionals. Clear and consistent communication among these professionals is therefore particularly important. The Ostomy Skin Tool (OST) is a new assessment instrument for the extent and severity of peristomal skin conditions. Formal tests of reliability and validity are necessary for its use in clinical practice, research, and education. Objectives To estimate inter- and intra nurse assessment variability of the OST and validity by comparison to a 'gold standard' (GS) defined by an expert panel. Methods Thirty photographs of peristomal skin were presented twice to 20 ostomy care nurses - 10 from Denmark (DK) and 10 from <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES)</b> - to determine intra- and inter nurse assessment variability. The same photographs were presented to an international group of experts (dermatologist and ostomy care nurses), to establish a GS for comparison and validation of the results. Results A high intra-nurse assessment agreement, kappa = 0 center dot 84, was found with no differences in the intra-nurse assessments from the two groups of nurses (DK and ES). The inter-nurse assessment agreement was 'moderate to good', kappa = 0 center dot 54, with the agreement between the experts higher, kappa = 0 center dot 70. A high correlation between the scores from the nurses and the GS were seen in {{the lower part of the}} two scales [Discoloration, Erosion, Tissue overgrowth (DET) score < 7) ].

40|$|Early {{nutrition}} programming as an {{origin of}} obesity is well acknowledged, {{but to what}} extent is this concept communicated to parents? In five European countries, UK, Finland (FI), Germany (DE), Hungary (HU) and <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES),</b> a total of 130 stand alone leaflets and 161 articles from parenting magazines providing information on feeding of healthy infants aged 0 - 12 months were identified and screened for nutrition programming statements. Obesity was mentioned in 8. 5 % (54 / 638) of the statements, and was the fourth most frequent outcome after allergy (20. 7 %), risk of infections (15. 5 %) and growth and development (11. 4 %). A temporal prognosis was given in 39 % of obesity related statements, 6 % referring to short- (15 years) duration of effects. So advice on obesity focuses oil the intrinsic long-term perspective of programming in contrary to other surveyed health-outcomes where only 8 % considered a lifelong approach. The major programming related behaviour concerned breast-feeding compared to formula and complementary feeding with meaningful differences concerning the recommended duration: for ES and HU the predominant advice was for exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months, for DE exclusive breast-feeding for 4 - 6 months and for UK and FI breast-feeding without further specification. In summary, statements relating to the programming of later obesity have been partially integrated into feeding information in five European countries. These Countries have slightly different breastfeeding recommendations, but consistently refer to the preventive potential of breastfeeding in general.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Follicular {{lymphoma}} (FL) is {{the second}} most common type of lymphoid cancer in Western Europe. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the cost utility of rituximab-bendamustine treatment compared with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) treatment as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced FL in Spain. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of rituximab-bendamustine compared with R-CHOP as first-line treatment for patients with advanced FL in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Transitions between health states (progression-free, including induction and maintenance; first relapse; second relapse; and death) were allowed for the patient cohort in 4 -week-long cycles. Clinical data for the extrapolation of progression-free survival curves were obtained from randomized trials. Mortality rates and utilities were obtained from the literature. Outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs (€, 2013) included drug costs (ex-factory prices with mandatory deductions), disease management costs and adverse event-associated costs. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3 % annual rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using 10, 000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess the model robustness. RESULTS: Treatment and administration costs during the induction phase were higher for rituximab-bendamustine (€ 17, 671) than for R-CHOP (€ 11, 850). At the end of the 25 -year period, the rituximab-bendamustine first-line strategy had a total cost of € 68, 357 compared with € 69, 528 for R-CHOP. Health benefits were higher for rituximab-bendamustine treatment (10. 31 QALYs) than for R-CHOP treatment (9. 82 QALYs). In the probabilistic analysis, rituximab-bendamustine was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP in 53. 4 % of the simulations. CONCLUSION: First-line therapy with rituximab-bendamustine in FL patients was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP; it showed cost savings and higher health benefits for the Spanish NHS.

Methods: For T 2 DM patients from the Netherlands (NL), Italy (IT), <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES)</b> (2007 - 2011) and United Kingdom (UK) (2008 - 2012) antidiabetic drug prescription/dispensing records and patient characteristics were obtained from electronic health-care records. Oral monotherapy was defined as 1 st line, oral dual therapy as 2 nd line, andgt; 2 oral treatments or oral combined with an injectable as 3 rd line and injectables only as 4 th line treatment. Treatment intensification was defined as starting a higher line of treatment. Comedication, comorbidities, clinical parameters and other {{factors associated with}} treatment choice were identified using multivariable relative risk estimation by Poisson regression with robust error variance. Findings: In the study period 485, 120 patients, i. e. 79 % of the treated T 2 DM population underwent treatment intensification. Changes in treatment choice were clearly visible over the study period, such as decline of thiazolidinedione (TZD) use (NL, ES, UK), and increase of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP 4 i) use (NL, ES, UK) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonist (GLP- 1 ra) use (UK). For 1 st line treatment advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with SU (all countries), whereas high BMI was inversely associated with SU in UK and ES. For 2 nd line advanced age was associated with metformin + SU (all countries) and renal comorbidity with SU + dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP 4 i) in UK and NL. High BMI was associated with metformin + thiazolidinedione (TZD) in UK and ES, and with metformin + DPP 4 i (UK). For 3 rd line advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with SU + insulin (NL, ES, UK). HbA 1 c andge; 8. 5 % was positively and high BMI inversely associated with any 3 rd line combination containing insulin. For 4 th line treatment women were more likely to receive GLP- 1 ra than men in UK and ES. Implications: The results suggest that the main factors driving treatment choice at any stage of intensification were age, HbA 1 c, BMI, renal and cardiac morbidity, and prior treatment history. These drivers were consistent with guidelines and contra-indications for specific medications. Differences between countries were generally consistent with, but not solely attributable to differences in local guidelines and reimbursement policies. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will show}} how patents {{policies}} {{can help the}} commercialization of inventions in Europe. Our study is mainly based on statistical material contained in the European Patent Office’s (EPO) database of published granted patents. Our study covers 407 granted patents {{in the field of}} chemistry and handling & processing in a one period year starting on 2007 - 12 - 24 and ending on 2008 - 12 - 26. Given the scope of data analysis, we found a tendency to limit the patents post (after) grant to a few states in Europe, mainly to Germany (DE), France (FR), Great Britain (GB), Italy (IT), <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES),</b> The Netherlands (NL) and Sweden (SE). This limitation in time and designated states is an indication that the markets in these states are the most important ones in Europe concerning the fields of chemistry and handling & processing for the applicant of the patent (e. g. the proprietor). In more than 70 % of the number of granted patents post grant in our empirical study DE, FR and GB are the designated states. But we also found that in several of the granted patents in our thesis, Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Switzerland (CH) and Finland (FI) are designated post grant. The numbers of designated states, post grant, in the scope of our thesis are higher compared with earlier studies applying the same method. For example Markus Reitzig’s empirical study that was made in 2004 uses 813 granted European patents, where the designation of DE, FR and GB was more significant and only 4 - 5 states on average were designated. It is an indication that the European market has extended the last 10 years within the fields of our study. The uniqueness of our empirical study comes from the survey of each of the 407 granted patents when it was filed at the European Patent Office (EPO) and after grant and publishing (post grant), i. e. {{at the beginning of the}} life cycle of the patent. As far as we know no earlier studies did so. Concerning our sample of applications for a European patent, the rational is the following. When the application is filed at EPO are all possible states designated, but post grant of the patent only a few state remains. Concerning the selection of the field of patenting, our consideration of data singularises chemistry and handling & processing. Clearly in the field of chemistry we found a marked incremental tendency for the transfer of patents rights. The transfer itself may be an indicator of a change either of industrial process toward R&D or a strategy toward patent policies in this specific field. The thesis tries consequently to evaluate if the EU-patent system will ease the commercialization of inventions in chemistry and handling´& processing in Europe. Especially for SMEs the EU-patent should facilitate a quicker and cheaper process. A general opinion assumes that the European patent application is too expensive for small companies. The process of establishing EU-patent was initiated 30 years ago and it will last another 5 years before it is fully possible to filing. Obviously, legal and political matters are not completely solved but that is not the direct concern of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Background and Research: Resent {{research}} on effects of social origin on class and education in 20 th century Switzerland {{has not only}} demonstrated the persistence of these effects (Pfeffer, 2008; Falcon, 2012; Falcon, 2013) but some results suggest even increasing effects of social origin for the youngest cohorts (Jann and Combet, 2012; Jann and Seiler, 2014), especially on education (for a short overview, cf., Falcon and Joye, 2015). This empirical evidence directly contradict the modernization thesis which predicts constant reductions of effects of social origin {{over the course of}} processes which are summarized under the label of modernization (eg., Lipset and Zetterberg, 1959; Kerr, 1962; Blau and Duncan, 1967). The importance of these results from Switzerland is, however, difficult to assess, because, to my knowledge, occupational mobility in Switzerland has never and educational mobility has only once (Pfeffer, 2008) been studied comparatively. The two basic research questions of this paper are therefore: How do the effects of social origin on education and class found in Switzerland compare to those from other Western European countries? And: can the analyses in this paper confirm the increasing effects of social origin suggested by some results for the youngest birth-cohorts in Switzerland? Data and Methodological Approach: To investigate these questions, a harmonized dataset is used with data on nine countries: Switzerland (CH), Germany (DE), Denmark (DK), <b>Spain</b> (<b>ES),</b> France (FR), Great Britain (GB), Ireland (IE), Netherlands (NL), and Norway (NO). Data is drawn from the 2011 EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (Eurostat, 2015) which includes a module on intergenerational transmission of disadvantages, and from the rounds 4 7 of the European Social Survey (ESS, 2008; ESS, 2010; ESS, 2012; ESS, 2014). For 63 897 respondents aged 35 60 the necessary information on their own and theirs parents’ occupation and education is available. These observations are grouped into three birth cohorts (the year used as label in parentheses) : 1950 - 59 (1955), 1960 - 69 (1965), and 1970 - 79 (1975). The two main dimensions used in the analyses are class and education. To avoid empty cells, both of them are measured with only three categories. For class, we collapse the original EGP-scheme (Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocarero, 1983) into three classes: The service class (I & II) becomes the upper class, non-manual employees (III), self-employed (IVa,c) and skilled workers (V & VI) the middle class, and semi- and unskilled workers (VIIa) as well as farmers (IVc) and agricultural workers (VIIb) the lower class. In order to fully utilize the full richness of the data, homemaker is included as a forth class to the class-scheme of the mothers. Similarly, the ISCED categories for education have been collapsed into categories for low, intermediate, and tertiary education. The applied methodological approach to estimate the effects of social origin builds on an approach first used by Jann and Combet (2012) and evaluated and described in more detail by Jann and Seiler (2014). The basic idea is simple: If origin strongly affects destination, the knowledge of origin strongly improves the prediction of destination. In turn, the improvement of the prediction of destination by knowing both parents’ education or class, measured by the Proportional Reduction of Errors (PRE), {{can be seen as a}} measure for the effect of origin on class or education of the respondent. In practice, this involves three steps: predict destination using a model without origin, predict destination using a model with origin and assess the improvement of the prediction by calculating the PRE conditional on each country and birth cohort. Contrary to the procedure described by Jann and Seiler (2014), a GMM-estimator and not a bootstrap procedure is used in to obtain valid standard errors. Preliminary Results and Outlook: Figure 1 shows the estimated effect of social origin on class and education over the three birth cohorts, separately for men and women and for each of the nine countries. Additionally, each plot shows the estimated differences between the three birth cohorts. Estimates and differences whose spikes do not cross the zero-line can be said to be statistically significant different from zero. For class, the general picture depicts persistence of effect across birth cohorts. There are two exceptions: Effects of parents’ classes on German women’s class have risen significantly from the first to the later birth cohorts; the same is true for French men. Apart from that, no increasing (but also: no decreasing) effects of social origin on class can be found. The results are more diverse for effects of parents’ on respondent’s educational attainment. On the left side of the figure, we can see that effects of social origin are relatively high in Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the results show significantly increasing effects for German women and Swiss men. Rising effects of social origin can also be found for Danish women when we compare the youngest with the middle cohort. The opposite is only true for Norwegian women: Here, the effects decrease strongly and significantly from the first to the second before it insignificantly increases again. In summary, the present paper mainly draws a picture that is in line with the {{research on}} educational inequality and social mobility (cf., Breen and Jonsson, 2005). I. e., it depicts persisting effects of social origin. However, results deviating from this general picture do not exhibit decreasing effects of social origin, but increasing trends. The analyses presented in this paper support – at least for men – the findings from Switzerland suggesting increasing effects of social origin on educational attainment. They also show that this is not the normal case in Western European countries but that it is not the only exception either. Comparative research needs comparable data and comparable data always come to the prize that they are badly adapted to some local specificities. The present analyses should, therefore, be repeated with local data but comparable method. Comparable data are, on the other hand, the only way to see a specific result within a broader picture. And they can point to phenomena that need closer attainted – and increasing effects of social origin is definitely such a case...|$|E

However, few studies have analyzed both the supply and demand sides of ES bundles, i. e., sets of associated ES that repeatedly appear together across time or space. This paper advances a framework to identify, map and assess ES bundles from a supply-demand approach to inform landscape planning and management. The framework {{is applied to the}} Barcelona metropolitan region, <b>Spain,</b> covering five <b>ES</b> and using eleven spatial indicators. Each indicator was quantified and mapped at the municipal level (n= 164) combining different proxy- and process-based models. Our results show significant associations among ES, both at the supply and demand sides. Further, we identified five distinct ES supply-demand bundle types and characterized them based on their specific ES relationships and their main underlying social-ecological conditions. From our findings, we contend that land sharing strategies should be prioritized in urban and agricultural areas to increase landscape multifunctionality while assuring the conservation of large periurban forest areas that are critical for delivering a wide range of local ES highly demanded by the urban population...|$|R

Pinus {{is one of the most}} dominant genera in the forests of the Northern Hemisphere. This study analyzes the pine pollination patterns in 30 locations of Spain with an average of 21 -year dataset. The aim is to evaluate possible changes in flowering intensity as well as in annual pollen production trends, according to the airborne pollen patterns. Annual Pollen Indices show three threshold values: (1) over 4000 grains per year in Catalonia, the Central System Mountains and Ourense (Galicia), (2) between 4000 and 1000 grains in central-south Spain and in the Balearic Islands, and (3) under 1000 in eastern Spain, Cartagena and the Canary Islands. Airborne pollen patterns were also influenced by Pinus species: The species located in the littoral and low land areas pollinated in the first pollination phase, from February to April, and the mountain pine species did in the second one, from April to June. The statistical analyses reveal increasing significant trends in 12 sites and significant decreasing trends in two. The Pinus flowering intensity is showing an earlier start and a delay in the end of the pollination period, thus a longer period of pollen in the air. This study suggests that the aerobiological monitoring is an interesting bio-indicator of changes happening in Pinus landscapes, and therefore explains the vulnerability of this genus in <b>Spain.</b> COST <b>ES</b> 0603 EUPOL; Laboratorios LETI S.

This mutation was first described in two Japanese patients from independent families and later in a French-Italian patient and a Vietnamese family. The two families presented here, {{are the first to}} be diagnosed with this mutation in the Iberian Peninsula. In the patients of both families, FAP was very aggressive as they rapidly developed multiple symptoms with progressive deterioration; we emphasize the presence of severe orthostatic hypotension in the Spanish proband which confined him to a wheelchair. This proband was the first patient with this mutation to have undergone liver transplantation and results were encouraging. The mutation was detected in four patients and one disease-free relative by DNA sequencing of exon 3 and induced mutation restriction analysis. The most outstanding feature was the single base transversion A to C in codon 50 (CGT instead of AGT), whereas in both Japanese patients and the French-Italian patient it was T to G (AGG instead of AGT).

Cánovas and Concepción Ávila Departamento de Biología Molecular y Bioquímica. Facultad de Ciencias. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de teatinos s/n, Málaga, <b>Spain</b> Email: cavila@uma. <b>es</b> Conifer trees divert large {{quantities}} of carbon into the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, particularly to generate lignin, an important constituent of wood. Since phenylalanine is the precursor for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the precise regulation of phenylalanine synthesis and use should occur simultaneously. This crucial pathway is finely regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. Transcriptome analyses indicate that the transcription factors (TFs) preferentially expressed during wood formation in plants belong to the MYB and NAC families. Craven-Bartle et al. (2013) have shown that Myb 8 is a candidate regulator of key genes in phenylalanine biosynthesis involved in the supply of the phenylpropane carbon skeleton necessary for lignin biosynthesis. This TF is able to bind AC elements present in the promoter regions of these genes to activate transcription. In Arabidopsis, the transcriptional network controlling secondary cell wall involves NAC-domain regulators operating upstream Myb transcription factors. We have identified in the P. pinaster genome three NAC proteins as potential candidates {{to be involved in}} vascular development. One of them, PpNAC 1 is expressed both in xylem and compression wood from adult trees and has been thoroughly characterized. Its role upstream the transcriptional network involving Myb 8 will be discussed. The understanding of the transcriptional regulatory network associated to phenylpropanoids and lignin biosynthesis in conifers is crucial for future applications in tree improvement and sustainable forest management.

The underlying physics of laser ablation remains incompletely understood due to complex laser-target and laser-plasma interactions, plasma expansion and confinement, plasma condensation interaction processes. The experimental setup and equipment used has been described elsewhere [1]. The laser beam form a transversely excited atmospheric (TEA) CO 2 pulsed-laser was focused onto a CaO target. The laser induced plasma was imaged 1 : 1 onto the entrance slit of different spectrometers. For time-resolved measurements, the detectors are synchronized with the trigger of the laser pulse. A Dove prism was inserted between to lenses into the observation optical path for rotating ¿/ 2 rad the plasma image for recording 2 D spectral images. The spatio-temporal evolution of the calcium oxide plasma produced by a high-power pulsed TEA-CO 2 laser has been investigated using optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and imaging methods. The emission observed in the plasma region is mainly due to electronic relaxation of excited Ca, Ca+, Ca 2 +, O, O+ and CaOH fragments. Time-integrated and time-resolved two-dimensional OES plasma profiles were recorded as function of emitted wavelength and distance from the target. The temperature measurements have been performed by Boltzmann diagram method. The temporal behaviour of specific emission lines of the species was characterized.

Forest trees are also of great economic value because they provide a wide range of products of commercial interest, including wood, pulp, biomass and important secondary metabolites. The productivity of most forest ecosystems is limited by low nitrogen availability and woody perennials have developed adaptation mechanisms, such as ectomycorrhizal associations, to increase the efficiency of N acquisition and metabolic assimilation. The efficient acquisition, assimilation and economy of nitrogen are of special importance in trees that must cope with seasonal periods of growth and dormancy over many years. In fact, the ability to accumulate nitrogen reserves and to recycle N is crucial to determine the growth and production of forest biomass. Ammonium is the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen in the soil of temperate forests and many research efforts are addressed to study the regulation of ammonium acquisition, assimilation and internal recycling for the biosynthesis of amino acids, particularly those relevant for nitrogen storage. In our laboratory, we are interested in studying nitrogen metabolism and its regulation in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster L. Aiton), a conifer species of great ecological and economic importance in Europe and for which whole-transcriptome resources are available. The metabolism of phenylalanine plays {{a central role in the}} channeling of carbon from photosynthesis to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and the regulation of this pathway is of broad significance for nitrogen economy of maritime pine.

INTRODUCTION Geminiviruses produces some of the most devastating diseases for agriculture worldwide. Geminiviral genomes encode only 5 to 7 proteins, forcing them to rely heavily on host cellular machineries and to interact with a high amount of host proteins in order to complete a full infection. The identification of the host proteins involved in viral infection will be an important step towards the understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process and develop new strategies to generate new sources of resistance. Previous efforts from our group have identified several genes involved in vesicle trafficking. OBJECTIVES The main aim of this work is to elucidate the role of the plant cell’s vesicle {{trafficking in}} a geminiviral infection. MATHERIALS AND METHODS Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette flanked by two direct repeats of the intergenic region of TYLCSV have been constructed (2 IR plants). When these plants are infected with TYLCSV, an overexpression of the reporter gene is observed in those cells where the virus is actively replicating. 2 IR plants were used in combination with virus induced gene silencing (VIGS), to identify vesicle trafficking genes involved in the infectious process. Viral replication was monitorized by GFP expression. Viral accumulation was determined using qPCR. RESULTS When silenced, four of the assessed genes reduced dramatically the viral amounts or completely abolished the infection. On the other hand, three of them had no significant effect over the infection and one of them seems to cause a slight increase in viral accumulation. CONCLUSIONS The vesicle trafficking machinery plays an essential role in geminivirus infection.

Ecosystem {{services}} (ES) mapping is attracting growing interest from landscape and urban planning, but its operationalization in actual decision-making is still limited. A {{clear distinction between}} ES capacity, flow and demand can improve the usefulness of ES mapping as a decision-support tool by informing planners and policy-makers where ES are used unsustainably and where ES flow is failing to meet societal demand. This paper advances a framework for mapping and assessing the relationships between ES capacity, flow and demand {{with a focus on}} the identification of unsatisfied demand. The framework was tested in the Barcelona metropolitan region, <b>Spain,</b> considering two <b>ES</b> of critical relevance for the urban population: air purification and outdoor recreation. For both ES, spatial indicators of capacity, flow, demand and unsatisfied demand were developed using proxy- and process-based models. The results show a consistent spatial pattern of all these components along the urban-rural gradient for the two ES assessed. The flow of both ES mainly takes place in the periurban green areas whereas the highest capacity values are mostly found in the protected areas located {{on the outskirts of the}} metropolitan region. As expected, ES demand and particularly unsatisfied demand are mostly situated in the main urban core (i. e., Barcelona and adjacent cities). Our assessment also reveals that the current landscape planning instrument for the metropolitan region mostly protects areas with high capacity to provide ES, but might lead to declining ES flows in periurban areas due to future urban developments. We contend that the mapping of ES capacity, flow and demand can contribute to the successful integration of the ES approach in landscape and urban planning because it provides a comprehensive picture of the ES delivery process, considering both ecological and social underlying factors. However, we identify three main issues that should be better addressed in future research: (1) improvement of ES demand indicators using participatory methods; (2) integration of ecological thresholds into the analysis; and (3) use of a multi-scale approach that covers both the local and regional planning levels and cross-scale interactions between them...|$|R

Related studies to border relations observe the weakness of these informal border contacts and relations. However, weak ties represent an opportunity for interaction, and little {{has been said about}} how they might play in the construction and performance of institutional cross-border cooperation (CBC). In this work, we examine the nature of personal border networks of professionals working in CBC and how they are interconnected with the institutional CBC. This paper is based on a mainly qualitative research of two different border regions: Andalusia, Algarve and Alentejo (AAA) and South Finland and Estonia (SFE). Nevertheless, the methodology is multi-method, using semi-structured interviews, with specific questions for applying a social network analysis. Conclusions point out different patterns of border relations in both border regions. In AAA, most of the cross-border relations are weaker and related to their professional involvement in institutional CBC. In SFE, border relations rely both on working and personal reasons. All of these cross-border relations imply a significant value as opportunities for social capital construction across the borders and, hence, for greater interaction and cross-border integration.

Gut 64. 12 (2015) : 1921 - 1935 and which has been published in final form at [URL] The tumour stroma/microenvironment not only provides structural support for tumour development, but more importantly it provides cues to cancer stem cells (CSCs) that regulate their self-renewal and metastatic potential. This is certainly true for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), where tumour-associated fibroblasts, pancreatic stellate cells and immune cells create an abundant paracrine niche for CSCs via microenvironment-secreted factors. Thus understanding the role that tumour stroma cells play in PDAC development and CSC biology is of utmost importance. DESIGN: Microarray analyses, tumour microarray immunohistochemical assays, in vitro co-culture experiments, recombinant protein treatment approaches and in vivo intervention studies were performed to understand {{the role that the}} immunomodulatory cationic antimicrobial peptide 18 /LL- 37 (hCAP- 18 /LL- 37) plays in PDAC biology. RESULTS: We found that hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 was strongly expressed in the stroma of advanced primary and secondary PDAC tumours and is secreted by immune cells of the stroma (eg, tumour-associated macrophages) in response to tumour growth factor-β 1 and particularly CSC-secreted Nodal/ActivinA. Treatment of pancreatic CSCs with recombinant LL- 37 increased pluripotency-associated gene expression, self-renewal, invasion and tumourigenicity via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR 2) - and P 2 X purinoceptor 7 receptor (P 2 X 7 R) -dependent mechanisms, which could be reversed by inhibiting these receptors. Importantly, in a genetically engineered mouse model of K-Ras-driven pancreatic tumourigenesis, we also showed that tumour formation was inhibited by either reconstituting these mice with bone marrow from cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (ie, murine homologue of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37) knockout mice or by pharmacologically inhibiting FPR 2 and P 2 X 7 R. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 represents a previously unrecognised PDAC microenvironment factor that plays a critical role in pancreatic CSC-mediated tumourigenesis.

Introduction: Suppression of gene silencing {{is a key}} mechanism {{for the success of}} viral infection in plants. DNA viruses from the Geminiviridae family encode several proteins that suppress post- and transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS/TGS). In Begomovirus V 2 {{has been shown to be}} the strongest PTGS suppressor in transient assays. Beet curly top virus (BCTV), the model species for the Curtovirus genus, is able to infect the widest range of plants among geminiviruses. In this genus, only C 2 protein has been described to inhibit PTGS and TGS. Objective: Our main goal is to test the PTGS {{suppressor activity}} of BCTV V 2 and to study further its gene-silencing suppression mechanism. Material and methods: To determine whether BCTV V 2 is also a gene silencing suppressor we carried out transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana wild-type or the 16 c GFP-expressing line: plant leaves were agroinfiltrated with binary constructs to express GFP (35 S:GFP) and V 2. Visual detection of GFP fluorescence was confirmed by western blot. Relative levels of the GFP-specific siRNAs were determined by northern blot. We also expressed the V 2 ORF from a Potato virus X-derived vector in N. benthamiana plants. As an approach to identify a genetic target of V 2 in the antiviral silencing pathway, we carried out a complementation analysis of BCTV-∆V 2 in a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in specific components of this pathway involved in DNA virus siRNA production and amplification (DCL 2, DCL 3, DCL 4, RDR 6 and RDR 2). Arabidopsis plants were infected by agroinoculation and the amount of viral DNA was measured by real-time qPCR. To gain more insight into the gene silencing suppression mechanism of V 2, we generated Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the viral protein. Wild-type (Col- 0) plants, as well as, plants containing the SUC-SUL hairpin or the AMPLICON (AMP) constructs were transformed with the same V 2 expression cassette used for the gene silencing assays. Results: Like its begomoviral counterpart, BCTV V 2 is a potent PTGS suppressor and produces an HR-like response in N. benthamiana plants when expressed from PVX. The molecular and genetic analysis of transgenic plants expressing V 2 indicates that, as the begomoviral V 2, BCTV V 2 inhibits the RDR 6 /SGS 3 -dependent silencing pathway. Finally, infection assays in Arabidopsis mutants confirm the importance of the RDR 6 /SGS 3 pathway in defence against curtoviruses, and reveal an additional RDR 6 /SGS 3 -independent gene-silencing suppression mechanism of V 2. Conclusions: BCTV V 2, as begomovirus V 2 protein, suppresses PTGS by impairing the RDR 6 /SGS 3 pathway. Keywords: Geminivirus, BCTV V 2, RNA-silencing suppressor. Universidad de Málaga.
