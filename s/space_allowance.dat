5000|$|The {{first is}} that Tryon was mistaken in the orders which he gave. It has {{variously}} been suggested {{that he might have}} been ill or indisposed in some way, supported by his curt comments to officers who queried him at the time, and his apparent inattention to the results when the manoeuvre commenced. Alternatively, that he was of sound mind, but mistook the turning circle of the ships involved. It has been suggested that a much more frequent manoeuvre was a turn of 90Â°, for which a <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> of two cables per ship would have been correct. On this basis, the ships would have completed their turns inwards at a spacing of two cables, then re-traced their course to the correct point to turn to their final anchor positions. Whatever the possible reason for the initial mistake, some confirmation of this explanation comes from the reported statement of Lieutenant Charles Collins, who had been officer of the watch on Victoria {{at the time of the}} incident. Memoirs written by Mark Kerr related that Collins had confirmed to him that Tryon had admitted on the bridge that this was the mistake he had made. One historian has gone so far as to suggest that Tryon's incomprehensible letters to Lord Charles Beresford indicate that he [...] "was suffering from some deterioration of the brain; that his fatal error was no mental aberration such as is to be expected of the young and inexperienced, but the consequence of a disease which at times clouded and confused his judgement and ideas." ...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if rearing male Holstein calves in wooden hutches modified to increase <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> would influence measures of performance, lying time per day, health, and respiratory immunocompetence. At 4 d of age, 60 calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 housing treatments: (1) conventional housing (CONV; 1. 23 m 2 /calf), (2) 1. 5 Ã CONV (MOD; 1. 85 m 2 /calf), or (3) 3 Ã CONV (MAX; 3. 71 m 2 /calf). Intakes of milk and solid feed were recorded daily and body weight was measured at 0, 3, 6, 10, and 12 wk of age. For the first 3 wk of the trial, calves were scored daily for fecal consistency, hydration, and hide cleanliness. In addition, calves were scored for respiratory health (i. e., nasal and eye discharge, ear position) until 7 wk of age. The total lying duration per day was recorded using data loggers at 3, 6, and 10 wk of age. Eight clinically healthy calves from each treatment were sensitized with subcutaneous ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged with aerosolized OVA to assess calf respiratory immunity at 11 wk of age. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 4 d after the OVA challenge and analyzed for leukocyte differentials and OVA-specific IgG, IgG 1, IgA, and IgE. Calf average daily gain and body weight were positively associated with <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> at approximately 3 wk before weaning and throughout postweaning, respectively. A greater <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> decreased lying time after 46 d. <b>Space</b> <b>allowance</b> did not influence fecal consistency, but there was a tendency for MAX calves to take 1 d longer to recover from loose feces than MOD calves.

Pigs were housed in balanced sex and had free access to feed in all phases for 14 weeks (growing phase I, growing phase II, finishing phase I, and finishing phase II). Results There was no statistical difference in growing phase, but a linear decrease was observed on average daily gain (ADG, p< 0. 01), average daily feed intake (ADFI, p< 0. 01), and body weight (BW, p< 0. 01) with decreasing <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> in late finishing phase. On the other hand, a quadratic effect was observed on gain to feed ratio in early finishing phase (p< 0. 03). Consequently, overall ADG, ADFI, and final BW linearly declined in response to decreased <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> (p< 0. 01). The pH of pork had {{no significant difference in}} 1 hour after slaughter, whereas there was a linear decrease in 24 h after slaughter with decreasing <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> Floor area allowance did not affect pork colors, but shear force linearly increased as floor space decreased (p< 0. 01).

The aim {{of this research was}} to determine whether grazing <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> could influence the efficacy of the ram effect. In August 1995, at Reading (latitude 51 degrees 27 'N), following a 3 -month isolation period from rams, two groups of nulliparous Mule ewes, aged 15 months, were introduced to four rains in a low (12 ewes/ha; treatment L, n = 124) or in a high stocking rate (84 ewes/ha; treatment H, n = 126). From the beginning of August until the end of August oestrous behaviour was recorded by daily checks of mating marks on ewes. Rams were removed and in October all ewes were scanned (day 50) for pregnancy. No significant differences were found in the parameters investigated. Eighty-two percent of the L and 75. 4 % of the H ewes exhibited oestrus, with a pronounced peak on day 23 following ram introduction and a compact concentration in the 21 - 25 -day period. The oestrous synchronisation rate in this 5 -day period was 69. 4 and 68. 3 %, respectively for L and H. The mean interval from ram introduction to oestrus was 23. 17 +/- 2. 4 days in L and 23. 0 +/- 2. 2 days in the H group. Conception rates were 84. 3 and 87. 4 % for L and H groups, respectively. These results suggest that the response of anoestrous ewes to the introduction of rams was not affected by grazing <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> and that yearling Mule ewes respond well to the ram effect in the late anoestrus season.

In particular, the straw bedding increased eating behaviour and it encouraged the simultaneous presence of more bull...|$|E
40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe aims {{of this study}} were to compare three {{different}} OWP designs with cubicle housing in terms of hoof and udder health, dirtiness scores, animal behaviour and productivity. The study was conducted over the winters 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006. The pad designs investigated were: Sheltered and unsheltered pads where cows were fed from a concrete apron adjacent to the woodchip lying area and an unsheltered self-feed pad where cows self-fed from a silage pit on top of the woodchip lying area. The latter design option {{was not included in the}} first year of the study. In that year the <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> also differed between the sheltered and unsheltered pads. In the second year of the study animals in all three pad designs had the same <b>space</b> <b>allowance...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the behaviour of finishing bulls raised in an uninsulated barn (UB) and at pasture (PAS). In experiment 1, dairy bulls were housed in an uninsulated barn (two groups of five bulls, 32 m 2 /pen) or at pasture (groups {{of four and}} five bulls, 5000 m 2 /paddock). In experiment 2, Hereford bulls were housed in an uninsulated barn (three groups {{of four or five}} bulls, 32 m 2 /pen) or at pasture (three groups of five bulls, 5000 m 2 /paddock). There were no differences in drinking, social licking, butting, other social behaviour, self-licking or idling between the UB and PAS bulls. The UB bulls spent more time in lying, ruminating, oral explorative and manipulative behaviour and rubbing and less time foraging and walking than the PAS bulls. The UB bulls performed more social licking and oral manipulation of objects and less mounting than the PAS bulls. These differences resulted most probably from the different feeding regimes and different <b>space</b> <b>allowances...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the main aspects that {{characterize}} the resting behaviour of eighteen months old heifers using two different resting <b>space</b> <b>allowances.</b> During the experiments the following resting behaviour aspects were determined: number of resting periods, the length of one resting period and the total length of resting periods. Results showed that when a resting space of 4. 5 m 2 per heifer was used the total length of laying down periods was 262. 8 minutes in the morning, 159. 5 minutes in the afternoon and 450. 5 minutes during the night. When the size of the resting space was increased to 5. 0 m 2 per heifer, the total length of resting periods decreased to 137. 2 minutes during the morning, 142. 7 minutes in the afternoon and 396. 8 minutes in the night. There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the two resting spaces for the total length of resting periods during the morning, afternoon and for 24 hours...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the main aspects that {{characterize}} the feeding behaviour of eighteen months old heifers using three different feeding <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> (0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 84 m feeding space per heifer). During the experiments the following feeding behaviour aspects were determined: number of feeding periods, the length of one feeding period and the total length of feeding periods. When a feeding space of 0. 6 m per heifer was used the total length of feeding periods in 24 hours had a value of 641 minutes, significantly bigger (p< 0. 05) than when feeding space was 0. 4 or 0. 84 m per heifer (543 and 453 minutes). There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) for total time spent feeding by calves between the second experimental variant (0. 6 m feeding space per heifer) and the first (0. 4 m feeding space per heifer) and the third experimental variant (0. 84 m feeding space per heifer) during the afternoon and during the night...|$|R
