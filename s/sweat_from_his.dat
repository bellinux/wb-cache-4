2500|$|... the Nazi entourage in Raiders of the Lost Ark, upon {{arriving}} at their island base, begin an elaborate {{trek to the}} centre of the island, with soldiers holding aloft National Socialist standards. The procession is somewhat ostentatious given the climate, prompting the black-dressed Gestapo agent to remove his hat and wipe the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow.|$|E
2500|$|Lever, and his bowling partner Bob Willis, both found {{themselves}} suffering from sweat falling into their eyes. It was suggested, naively, {{by the team}} physiotherapist that they apply strips of gauze covered with Vaseline above their eyes to divert sweat from their forehead away. In play these were found to slip, and Willis removed his. Eventually Lever also removed his and lay the gauze on the ground near the stumps where it was noticed by the umpires and Indian team, but not before he had used <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead to shine the ball.|$|E
60|$|Saunders {{wiped the}} <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow on his {{buckskin}} sleeve.|$|E
60|$|The {{labourer}} leant {{his elbow}} upon {{the shaft of}} the gig and turned his face, pale and <b>sweating</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> late work at the fire, up to Manston's.|$|R
60|$|Watching Panda, I {{saw that}} he fell {{into a kind of}} agony; his fat sides heaved, and, {{although}} the day was cold, <b>sweat</b> ran <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow.|$|R
60|$|The {{answer was}} a long time coming; at last the man nodded an assent, the <b>sweat</b> pouring <b>from</b> <b>his</b> purple face. She had set him thinking; her victory was sure.|$|R

6000|$|His comrade, Pat, wiped floods of <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> scarlet face. [...] "I'll be domned if ye ain't a son-of-a-gun fer worrk!" [...] he complained.|$|E
60|$|It {{was hard}} work, and the <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face {{and down his}} chin. But he kept at it, noting at each turn how close the steeds and the elegant turnout were drawing.|$|R
60|$|Paul saw {{drops of}} <b>sweat</b> fall <b>from</b> <b>his</b> father's brow. Six {{men were in}} the room--six coatless men, with yielding, {{struggling}} limbs, filling the room and knocking against the furniture. The coffin veered, and was gently lowered on to the chairs. The <b>sweat</b> fell <b>from</b> Morel's face on its boards.|$|R
6000|$|He got up awkwardly {{and leaned}} upon the table, {{breathing}} rather hard while big drops of <b>sweat</b> started <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead. [...] "This confounded ague grips me tight. Don't know when I've felt so shaky. Better {{give me your}} arm." ...|$|R
60|$|Trent stood upright, {{wiped the}} dank <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} and gazed around him fiercely, and upwards at that lurid little patch of blue sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'm gettin' plumb dried out," [...] Billy announced, mopping the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> sunburned forehead. [...] "What d'ye say we {{head for}} the coast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Terror blanched the warrior's cheek, Cold <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} ran, In vain {{his tongue}} essayed to speak,-- [...] 35 At last the stranger thus began: ...|$|E
60|$|Pat {{pointed at}} Neale's red, wet shirt. Neale slapped his breast, and {{drops of blood}} and <b>sweat</b> spattered <b>from</b> under <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{leadership}} convention, Fannon gave what The Globe and Mail called [...] "one of the wackiest leadership speeches ever", constantly wiping <b>sweat</b> away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face, thanking {{his mother and}} his dogsitter, and referring to his leadership opponent as [...] "Elizabeth freakin' May".|$|R
60|$|Taurus Antinor saw Him {{even now}} as he had seen Him then, with blood and <b>sweat</b> {{dripping}} <b>from</b> <b>His</b> brow, the pale, patient face serene and set, the eyes half closed in agony still glowing with unutterable love and with the perfect peace of complete sacrifice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! couldn't see us for smoke," [...] Hootchinoo Bill chuckled, flirting the {{stinging}} <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{brow and}} glancing swiftly {{back along the}} way they had come.|$|E
60|$|He threw {{aside the}} great armful of yellow flowers, {{took off his}} cap, and wiped the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. The sickle dangled loose in his hand.|$|E

6000|$|Rudi moved a little, {{lowering}} his arms. He turned to Hendricks, licking his lips. The whites {{of his eyes}} shone wildly. <b>Sweat</b> dripped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead, down his cheeks. He fixed his gaze on Hendricks. [...] "Major, he's gone insane. Stop him." [...] Rudi's voice was thin and hoarse, almost inaudible.|$|R
60|$|Dr Macphail was a timid man. He {{had never}} been able to get used to the hurtling of the shells over the trenches, and when he was {{operating}} in an advanced dressing-station the <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow and dimmed his spectacles in the effort he made to control his unsteady hand. He shuddered' a little as he looked at the missionary.|$|R
60|$|The {{break it}} made in that dead silence was awful. Joe's blood {{seemed to have}} curdled and frozen; a cold <b>sweat</b> oozed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> skin, {{and it was as}} if a clammy hand {{clutched}} at his heart. He tried to persuade himself that the fear displayed by the savage was only superstition, and that that moan was but the sigh of the night wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'd {{be worth}} {{a lot to the}} feller who can show me {{a way out of this}} mess," [...] said Buell, mopping the beads of <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
6000|$|There is silence. He {{takes out}} his {{handkerchief}} and mops the [...] <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. Going back blindly to his table, sits [...] down, and stares blankly at his lunch.|$|E
60|$|Mulhall {{wiped the}} <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> eyes. All were {{sweating}} profusely and breathing hard. There was no {{ice in the}} drink that was served, and whiskey and absinthe went down lukewarm.|$|E
60|$|Although he {{had been}} unable to see him drop the poison into the cup, a glance at Hafela told Owen that it was there; for though he kept his face under control, he could not prevent <b>his</b> hands <b>from</b> {{twitching}} or the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> starting upon <b>his</b> brow and breast.|$|R
60|$|Leo {{dropped back}} to the earth again, and saw the great star Aldebaran, that {{is set in the}} {{forehead}} of the Bull, blazing very near to the earth. When he came up to it he saw that his brother, the Bull, yoked to a countryman's plough, was toiling through a wet rice-field with his head bent down, and the <b>sweat</b> streaming <b>from</b> <b>his</b> flanks. The countryman was urging him forward with a goad.|$|R
5000|$|Apoxyomenos (the [...] "Scraper") {{is one of}} the {{conventional}} subjects of ancient Greek votive sculpture; it represents an athlete, caught in the familiar act of scraping <b>sweat</b> and dust <b>from</b> <b>his</b> body with the small curved instrument that the Romans called a strigil.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is papa," [...] said Jane, as {{they got}} to the gate. Then they waited for a few minutes till Mr. Crawley came up, very hot, wiping the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|E
60|$|Kells purled out a {{suspended}} breath and he flung the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. There was about him, {{perhaps more than}} the others, a dark realization of how close the call had been for Pearce.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I think I'll take one," [...] said Wallenstein, {{wiping the}} <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. His eye caught {{the shadow of}} Koho {{on the floor and}} {{followed}} it up to the old chief himself. [...] "Hello! who's this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Backed {{against the}} door of the hall stood Ben Chase, for once {{stripped}} of all authority and confidence and courage. Gale confronted him, and now Gale's mien was in striking contrast to the coolness with which he had entered the place. Though <b>sweat</b> dripped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face, it was as white as chalk. Like dark flames his eyes seemed to leap and dance and burn. His lean jaw hung down and quivered with passion. He shook a huge gloved fist in Chase's face.|$|R
60|$|The {{rest was}} but a {{repetition}} of what Tarzan and Jane Clayton had passed through. The priestesses came, and with them La, the High Priestess. Werper was raised and laid across the altar. Cold <b>sweat</b> exuded <b>from</b> <b>his</b> every pore as La raised the cruel, sacrificial knife above him. The death chant fell upon his tortured ears. His staring eyes wandered to the golden goblets from which the hideous votaries would soon quench their inhuman thirst in his own, warm life-blood.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} Buddhist site is the Mahamuni Shrine. According to local legend, the Buddha visited Dhanyawadi during his life. In Dhanyawadi, the noblemen and the affluent donated their wealth and possessions (mainly gold and silver), to be melted and cast into {{an image of}} the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have provided seven drops of <b>his</b> <b>sweat,</b> taken <b>from</b> <b>his</b> chest, and the drops were added to the molten metals. This allowed the Mahamuni Image, once cast, to be able to preach the Dhamma.|$|R
