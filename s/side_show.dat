5|$|The {{recently}} built Battersea Power Station then dominated most {{views of}} the area, so {{it was decided that}} the bridge's appearance was unimportant. Consequently, in contrast to the heavily ornamented 1858 bridge, the new bridge has a starkly utilitarian design and the only ornamentation consists of two ornamental lamp posts at each entrance. Each features a gilded galleon on top of a coat of arms. The outward facing sides of all four posts show the LCC coat of arms of the Lion of England, St George's Cross and the barry wavy lines representing the Thames; the inward faces on the south <b>side</b> <b>show</b> the dove of peace of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, that on the northwest corner shows the winged bull, lion, boars' heads and stag of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, and that on the northeast corner the portcullis and Tudor roses of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E

The third level reliefs show a battle procession, couples and scenes of common citizens celebrating Holi (Vasantotsava) by throwing water at each other.

25|$|Over {{the next}} two years the {{national}} side would sporadically play international fixtures but it would not be until the 1992 Pacific Cup when they would again begin playing with some regularity. At the 1992 Cup competition the side would show significant improvement on their previous inaugural cup effort with victories over Niue, Cook Islands, Fiji and the New Zealand Maori. This run of victories would earn them a place in the final of the 1992 Pacific Cup against the Western Samoan side but they would eventually lose a close fought match by four points 1814. The following tournament two years later would see the Tongan <b>side</b> <b>show</b> further improvement with several comfortable victories again earning them a spot in final of the Pacific Cup this time against the Fijians who had never defeated the Tongans at that time. The final was a tough affair but the Mate Ma'a were again victorious over Fiji 3411 and claimed their maiden Pacific Cup title.|$|E
25|$|The frieze of the Parthenon's entablature {{contained}} ninety-two metopes, fourteen each on {{the east}} and west sides, thirty-two each on the north and south sides. They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods). According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446–440BC. The metopes of {{the east side of the}} Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy (mythical battles between the Olympian gods and the Giants). The metopes of the west end show Amazonomachy (mythical battle of the Athenians against the Amazons). The metopes of the south <b>side</b> <b>show</b> the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs). Metopes 13–21 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the Lapith wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens and various myths. On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy.|$|E

500|$|Howerton's {{career began}} {{at a young}} age, when his father entered him into a local {{vaudeville}} show. In 1923, {{at the age of}} ten, Howerton joined the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, where he starred as a major attraction. The circus was the largest of the kind, with 800 performers and over 1000 animals. Although he was only ten years old, the circus sought to exaggerate his diminutive size by claiming that he was 18 years old. He was billed as the smallest man in the world, exhibited and known to the public under the name, [...] "Major Mite". The [...] "Major Mite" [...] moniker had previously been used by an American comedian who died in 1900, and a 19th-century circus performer, William E. Jackson, who died in 1901, at 24, [...] tall and weighing [...] Accompanied by his mother, Howerton spent 20 years with Ringling Brothers and also worked with the Cole Brothers Circus, the Coney Island Dreamland <b>Side</b> <b>Show,</b> and the World Circus Sideshow.|$|E
500|$|Though it {{was thus}} on 17 January 1940 decided {{to conquer the}} whole of the Netherlands, few units could be made {{available}} for this task. The main effort of Fall Gelb would be made in the centre, between Namur and Sedan, France. The attack on central Belgium was only a feint — and the attack on Fortress Holland only a <b>side</b> <b>show</b> of this feint. Although both the 6th and 18th Army were deployed on the Dutch border, the first, much larger, force would move south of Venlo to Belgium, leaving just the 18th Army under General Georg von Küchler to defeat the Dutch main force. Of all German armies {{to take part in the}} operation this was by far the weakest. It contained only four regular infantry divisions (the 207th, 227th, 254th and 256th Infantry Division), assisted by three reserve divisions (208th, 225th, and 526th Infantry Division) that would not take part in the fighting. Six of these divisions were [...] "Third Wave" [...] units only raised in August 1939 from territorial Landwehr units. They had few professional officers and little fighting experience apart from those who were World War I veterans. Like the Dutch Army, most soldiers (88%) were insufficiently trained. The seventh division was the 526th Infantry Division, a pure security unit without serious combat training. The German divisions, with a nominal strength of 17,807 men, were fifty percent larger than their Dutch counterparts and possessed twice their effective firepower, but even so the necessary numerical superiority for a successful offensive was simply lacking.|$|E
