40|$|A new foveated CMOS {{image sensor}} has been {{designed}} and fabricated. The photocell elements transform the light into current, and then, in a continuous way, into voltage without charge integration. This kind of sensing cell has been already employed in image sensors for normal cameras, but never in foveated sensors. The presented sensor tries to emulate the human eye pixel resulting in a sensor with a space variant distribution of pixels. Consequences of this distribution are the different size of the sensing elements in the pixel matrix, the non orthogonal shapes of the different elements that integrate the pixel, and, as a result, the different response of every cell in the sensor. A scaling mechanism is needed due to the different pixel size from circumference to circumference. A mechanism for current scaling is presented. This mechanism has been studied along with other effects, as the narrow channel effect on <b>submicron</b> <b>MOS</b> transistors, {{and the influence of}} the logarithmic response o [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} that combines logic resynthesis and linear placement {{in order to}} alleviate routing congestion in bit-sliced layout. In this approach, we restructure the logic using an intermediate placement solution and then adjust the placement to match the new logic structure. This ability to change logic structure during layout allows us to obtain channel density reductions that are not possible by physical design operations such as lateral shifting, pin permutation, and channel routing. Parts on an industrial chip have been re-synthesized using a prototype program implementing these ideas {{with an average of}} 11. 2 % reduction in bit slice area compared to the original designs. 1 Introduction One of the critical problems encountered in the design of today's VLSI circuits is optimization of the interconnect.

This {{technique has}} been greatly improved last years by developing new approaches that are generally used to study the MOS defects. These defects are often fixed trapped charges in the oxide coat at beginning, which may activate other defects such as surfac e states at the oxide/semiconductor interface after the application of bias - thermal stress, ionising radiation or injection carrier during the fabrication process or the use. This may result in fast ageing of the devices. This ageing is so pronounced when the dimensions are scaled down, which represents the main barrier in nano - electronics field.

It is {{shown that the}} FN current depends on the gate material and the bias polarity. The tunneling barrier heights, ¿B, have been determined from FN-plots. The larger barrier height for negative bias, compared to positive bias, suggests that electron injection takes place from the valence band of the gate. This barrier height for the GeSi gate is 0. 4 eV lower than for the Si gate due to the higher valence band edge position. Charge-to-breakdown (Qbd) measurements show improved oxide reliability of the GeSi gate on of PMOS capacitors with 5. 6 nm thick gate oxide.

Through the increase of the channel impurity concentration to suppress this effect, a reduction in drivability will occur. This cycle is a common issue in <b>submicron</b> <b>MOS</b> devices.

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} faster {{switching}} frequencies require high current drives and consequently high Ge contents for Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x hetero-MOSFETs. In addition, highly planar interfaces are {{a prerequisite for}} the successful incorporation of a Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x layer into a Si CMOS technology, with stringent constraints being placed on layer thicknesses. The influence of MBE growth temperature has been investigated in order to kinetically suppress strain induced interface roughening associated with high Ge contents (x#>=# 0. 3). However, {{it has been shown}} that simply reducing the growth temperature leads to highly defected layers on the atomic scale (evidenced from PAS and low temperature Hall measurements). A two-stage growth technique has been developed employing a low temperature growth (LTG) stage to suppress the strain induced macro-roughening followed by a post growth in-situ anneal (PGA) stage to remove the grown in defects and consequently enhance the electrical characteristics. Using this novel growth technique highly planar alloy layers have been grown which can withstand the thermal budgets required for CMOS processing before the onset of alloy layer degradation. Complicated growth specifications in terms of layer thicloiess and doping levels accrue with <b>submicron</b> <b>MOS</b> device-processes to circumvent short channel effects. Exemplary FET characteristics have been obtained on devices working down to 0. 35 #mu#m, processed on layers grown by the aforementioned LTG/PGA technique (HMOS 1). In addition, growth techniques have been developed for B #delta# layer stabilisation against diffusion and segregation, required for valence band tailoring of the next generation devices working down to 0. 15 #mu#m (HMOS 2). Finally, preliminary work has been undertaken on the development of a novel growth technique for the production of thin virtual substrates with a smooth surface morphology.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research presented in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effects of wearout processes on the performance and reliability of CMOS bistable circuits. The main wearout process affecting reliability of <b>submicron</b> <b>MOS</b> devices was identified as hot-carrier stress (and the resulting degradation in circuit performance). The effect of hot-carrier degradation on the resolving time leading to metastability of the bistable circuits also have been investigated. Hot-carrier degradation was identified as a major reliability concern for CMOS bistable circuits designed using submicron technologies. The major hot-carrier effects are the impact ionisation of hot- carriers in the channel of a MOS device and the resulting substrate current and gate current generation. The substrate current has been used as the monitor for the hot-carrier stress and have developed a substrate current model based on existing models that have been extended to incorporate additional effects for submicron devices. The optimisation of the substrate current model {{led to the development of}} degradation and life-time models. These are presented in the thesis. A number of bistable circuits designed using 0. 7 micron CMOS technology design rules were selected for the substrate current model analysis. The circuits were simulated using a set of optimised SPICE model parameters and the stress factors on each device was evaluated using the substrate current model implemented as a post processor to the SPICE simulation. Model parameters for each device in the bistable were degraded according to the stress experienced and simulated again to determine the degradation in characteristic timing parameters for a predetermined stress period. A comparative study of the effect of degradation on characteristic timing parameters for a number of latch circuits was carried out. The life-times of the bistables were determined using the life-time model. The bistable circuits were found to enter a metastable state under critical timing conditions. The effect of hot-carrier stress induced degradation on the metastable state operation of the bistables were analysed. Based on the analysis of the hot-carrier degradation effects on the latch circuits, techniques are suggested to reduce hot-carrier stress and to improve circuit life-time. Modifications for improving hot- carrier reliability were incorporated into all the bistable circuits which were re-simulated to determine the improvement in life-time and reliability of the circuits under hot-carrier stress. The improved circuits were degraded based on the new stress factors and the degradation effects on the critical timing parameters evaluated and these were compared with those before the modifications. The improvements in the life-time and the reliability of the selected bistable circuits were quantified. It has been demonstrated that the hot-carrier reliability for all the selected bistable circuits can be improved by design techniques to reduce the stress on identified critically stressed devices...|$|E
