5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail <b>sales</b> <b>outlet</b> of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E

2500|$|The five ex-St. Gallen trolleybuses never {{performed}} to ETCE's satisfaction under the low overhead-line voltage in Valparaíso, about 500V–550V [...] {{as compared with}} 600V in St. Gallen, and they were used in service only briefly – most in 1992 only, with one (142) in sporadic use until 1995 or early 1996. [...] They then were stored until being scrapped in 2008, except for No. 142.

2500|$|From the beginning, the Jet {{project was}} {{hampered}} by Hudson President A.E. Barit, 63 {{years old in}} 1953, who disregarded the suggestions of the company's stylists and other advisors. For example, Barit insisted that the compact-sized Jet offer full-size car amenities. While designers attempted to form a car that was lower, wider, and proportionally sleeker to the dimensions of a smaller compact car, Barit would not back away from features such as chair high seating for passengers, and a [...] "tall" [...] greenhouse with a ceiling that would allow riders to wear their hats while in the car. Barit also decided that the Jet's rear design would incorporate Oldsmobile-like high rear fender and small round tail light design. The design was further changed to accommodate the personal likes of Chicago, Illinois Hudson dealer Jim Moran, whose dealership became number one <b>sales</b> <b>outlet</b> for Hudson, accounting for about 5% of Hudson's total production. Moran fancied the 1952 Ford's wrap around rear window and roofline, and Barit ordered a similar design for the Jet. The final result was that the Jet's styling closely mimicked the larger 1952-1954 Ford in many respects. The strong unitized Monobuilt bodies for the Jet were produced by the Murray Corporation of Detroit. One {{of the reasons for}} outsourcing the production of bodies [...] "was that Murray agreed to amortize the tooling costs over the production run, reducing the upfront investment" [...] making the Jet possible because Hudson did not have enough resources to pay for the tooling costs.|$|E
