5|$|A Category1 {{hurricane}} {{was first}} observed about 585mi (940km) west-northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores on August5, based on reports from two ships, the Shelter and the A.Z.Greenland. Another <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> encountered the storm, the Magistrate, was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's assistant, Bob de Moor, was {{responsible}} for making many of the alterations. De Moor {{was sent to the}} port at Antwerp to sketch a 1939 oil tanker that would provide a basis for a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> appears in the story, the Speedol Star.|$|E
5|$|Six days later, Cooley led a large {{expedition}} {{to free the}} Gil Blas, a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had beached the previous year. The scale of the operation required all of the settlement's able men. On the next day, January 4, 1836, the Indians attacked the settlement.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} two {{recorded}} texts describing the <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> transported the obelisks from Egypt across the Mediterranean to Rome. The first recorded text is from Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), who described the great <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> transported the Vatican obelisk in 40 AD under the emperor Caligula. The second description comes from Ammianus Marcellinus (AD 330-393), who describes the <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> transported the Lateran Obelisk in 357 AD.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of the Dutch naval forces had been evacuated by the 14th. The few <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> remained were either captured, or sailed to Britain. The <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> reached Britain would later go on to defend the Dutch East Indies after that colony was invaded by the Japanese.|$|R
5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E

5|$|After the February Revolution, the {{condition}} of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. The <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were not expected to be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The Provisional Government halted all work on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Texas {{returned}} to peacetime duty, interrupted by several refits. She became the station ship in Charleston, South Carolina, by 1908 and was renamed San Marcos in 1911 {{to allow her}} name {{to be used by}} a new battleship. She became a target <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> same year and was sunk in shallow water in Chesapeake Bay. She was used as a gunnery target through World War II and was finally demolished in 1959 because her remains were considered a navigational hazard.|$|E
5|$|As {{invasion}} neared in mid-1944, the two battalions {{moved from}} their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard troopships and landing ship tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the Ulster Monarch, a passenger <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had {{served on the}} Belfast-Liverpool line before the war. Having been delayed, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André {{so that he would}} be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E

5|$|Meeker's first {{employment}} in the Pacific Northwest was unloading a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had docked at Portland. He moved to {{the nearby town of}} St. Helens, where construction of a wharf in competition with Portland's was under way—Oliver rented a house to lodge workers in, and Ezra went to help his brother. By this time, Ezra Meeker and his wife were determined to fulfill their original plan to farm, and when work was abandoned on the wharf, he went to find land which could be cultivated.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. Lastly, in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had been carrying wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E

5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
5|$|The 1936 Second London Naval Treaty, while {{superseding}} the 1922 agreement, nonetheless kept many of {{the same}} requirements, though it restricted gun size on new warships to 14-inch. These treaties heavily influenced the design of the North Carolina class, as can be attested to in the long quest to find a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> incorporated everything considered necessary while remaining under 35,000long tons.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Navy {{operated}} {{a series of}} seaplane bases on the Dalmatian Coast before World War II and decided that it needed a ship to transport seaplanes between them and to rescue downed aircraft after operations as had been common during World War I.
