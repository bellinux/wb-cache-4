25|$|In <b>{{secondary}}</b> <b>electron</b> imaging, or SEI, {{the secondary}} electrons are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) {{presented}} at the 2013 EUVL Workshop indicated that, {{as a measure of}} EUV photoelectron and <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> blur, 50–100 eV electrons easily penetrated beyond 15nm of resist thickness (PMMA or commercial resist), indicating more than 30nm range of resist affected centered on the EUV point of absorption, for doses exceeding 200–300 uC/cm2. This can be compared with the image contrast degradation reported for sub-40nm pitches later in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In some {{configurations}} {{information about}} several specimen properties is gathered per pixel, usually {{by the use}} of multiple detectors. In SEM, the attributes of topography and material contrast can be obtained by a pair of backscattered electron detectors and such attributes can be superimposed in a single color image by assigning a different primary color to each attribute. Similarly, a combination of backscattered and <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> signals can be assigned to different colors and superimposed on a single color micrograph displaying simultaneously the properties of the specimen.|$|E
40|$|The Monte Carlo {{method was}} used to {{simulate}} the process of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> excitation in resist PMMA with Mott cross section and dielectric function model. By analyzing the characteristics of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> excitation in the resist PMMA, and the simulation of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> energy range, we hold the opinion that the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> {{can not be ignored}} in the electron beam lithography...|$|R
40|$|Calculations were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of electron-produced <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> on the net charging current and the equilibrium voltage of spacecraft surfaces immersed in hot (keV) plasmas. The effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> produced by the primary plasma electrons were examined for aluminum, Teflon, Mylar, and Kapton. The results indicate that it is the primary electron energy region over which the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> are emitted (rather than the ratio of <b>secondary</b> to primary <b>electrons)</b> which determines the effectiveness of the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> in limiting the net charging current. While the electron-produced <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> decreased the charging current, they had little effect upon the equilibrium voltages attained...|$|R
50|$|As runaway {{electrons}} gain {{energy from}} an electric field, they occasionally collide with {{atoms in the}} material, knocking off <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons.</b> If the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> also have high enough energy to run away, they too accelerate to high energies, produce further <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons,</b> etc. As such, {{the total number of}} energetic electrons grows exponentially in an avalanche.|$|R
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
25|$|The SEM {{produces}} images by {{probing the}} specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular {{area of the}} specimen (raster scanning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. The lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat, emission of low-energy secondary electrons and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission (cathodoluminescence) or X-ray emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by an SEM maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. In the SEM image of an ant shown below and to the right, the image was constructed from signals produced by a <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> detector, the normal or conventional imaging mode in most SEMs.|$|E
25|$|SEM is not {{a camera}} and the {{detector}} is not continuously image-forming like a CCD array or film. Unlike in an optical system, the resolution is not limited by the diffraction limit, fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends {{on the size of}} the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with transmission electron microscope (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1nbsp&nm and 20nbsp&nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (<30 kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4nbsp&nm using a <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> detector.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} SEM mode is {{detection}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> emitted by atoms {{excited by the}} electron beam. The number of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> that can be detected depends, among other things, on specimen topography. By scanning the sample and collecting the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> that are emitted using a special detector, an image displaying the topography of the surface is created.|$|R

50|$|The e-beam prober generates an SEM {{image by}} raster-scanning a focused {{electron}} beam over a selected {{region of the}} semiconductor surface. The high energy electrons in the primary beam strike {{the surface of the}} silicon, producing a number of low energy <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons.</b> The <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> are guided back up through the SEM column to a detector. The varying numbers of <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> reaching the detector are interpreted to produce the SEM image.|$|R
2500|$|Nonconductive {{specimens}} collect charge when scanned by {{the electron}} beam, {{and especially in}} <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be electrically conductive, {{at least at the}} surface, and electrically grounded to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charge. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub. [...] Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum sputter coating or by high-vacuum evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include gold, gold/palladium alloy, platinum, iridium, tungsten, chromium, osmium, and graphite. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low atomic number (Z). The improvement arises because <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.|$|E
2500|$|The signals {{used by a}} {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} to produce an image result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms at various depths within the sample. Various types of signals are produced including secondary electrons (SE), reflected or back-scattered electrons (BSE), characteristic X-rays and light (cathodoluminescence) (CL), absorbed current (specimen current) and transmitted electrons. [...] <b>Secondary</b> <b>electron</b> detectors are standard equipment in all SEMs, but it is rare that a single machine would have detectors for all other possible signals.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a common}} example, <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> and {{backscattered}} electron detectors are superimposed and a color {{is assigned to}} each of the images captured by each detector, with an end result of a combined color image where colors are related to the density of the components. This method is known as density-dependent color SEM (DDC-SEM). Micrographs produced by DDC-SEM retain topographical information, which is [...] better captured by the secondary electrons detector and combine it to the information about density, obtained by the backscattered electron detector.|$|E

2500|$|Measurement of {{the energy}} of photons emitted from the {{specimen}} is a common method to get analytical capabilities. Examples are the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and Cathodoluminescence microscope (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced luminescence in (for example) geological specimens. [...] In SEM systems using these detectors {{it is common to}} color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared. [...] Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E
2500|$|In an EBPVD system, the {{deposition}} chamber must be evacuated to a pressure {{of at least}} 7.5 Torr (10−2 Pa) to allow passage of electrons from the electron gun to the evaporation material, which {{can be in the}} form of an ingot or rod. Alternatively, some modern EBPVD systems utilize an arc-suppression system and can be operated at vacuum levels as low as 5.0 Torr, for situations such as parallel use with magnetron sputtering. [...] Multiple types of evaporation materials and electron guns can be used simultaneously in a single EBPVD system, each having a power from tens to hundreds of kilowatts. Electron beams can be generated by thermionic emission, field electron emission or the anodic arc method. The generated electron beam is accelerated to a high kinetic energy and directed towards the evaporation material. Upon striking the evaporation material, the electrons will lose their energy very rapidly. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into other forms of energy through interactions with the evaporation material. The thermal energy that is produced heats up the evaporation material causing it to melt or sublimate. Once temperature and vacuum level are sufficiently high, vapor will result from the melt or solid. The resulting vapor can then be used to coat surfaces. Accelerating voltages can be between 3 and 40 kV. When the accelerating voltage is 20–25 kV and the beam current is a few amperes, 85% of the electron's kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy. Some of the incident electron energy is lost through the production of X-rays and <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> emission.|$|E

While in some devices, the anode and the grid require materials that suppress the secondary-elec-tron-generation process, the crossed-field amplifier (CFA) is an example where the cathode requires an efficient secondary-electron-emission material. Secondary-electron-emission processes will be discussed by a three-step rocess: penetration of the primary electrons, transmission of the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> through the material, and final escape of the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> over the vacuum barrier. The transmission of the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> is one of the critical factors in determining the magnitude of the secondary-electron yield. The wide band-gap in an insulator prevents low-energy <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> from losing energy through electron-electron collisions, thereby resulting in a large escape depth for the <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> and a large secondary-electron yield. In general, insulating materials have high secondary-electron yields, but a provision to supply some level of electrical conductivity is necessary in order to replenish the electrons lost in the secondary-electron-emission process. Our secondary-emission study of diamond emonstrates that the vacuum barrier height can have a strong effect on the total yield.
