25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
500|$|Monitor {{was soon}} in trouble {{as the storm}} {{increased}} in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts. Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon Monitor {{was hit by a}} squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers, Acting Master Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking, and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that {{as soon as they were}} on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the [...] towline with a hatchet. At 11:30p.m. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump; but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water. After all steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a bucket brigade, but to no avail.|$|E
2500|$|Long ago, the {{expected}} {{date of delivery}} was determined by taking the phase of the moon into consideration. [...] A delivery during a full moon was considered dangerous to {{the child and the}} mother. The arrival of the midwife at the home of the expectant mother varied. [...] Sometimes the family would call the midwife when the labor started and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> arrive at the home {{a few days before the}} anticipated birth. [...] This was probably dependent on the proximity of the midwife to the woman’s house. [...] The midwife and her assistant would assist with chores around the house if they were able to arrive early.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Clementina, [...] "I didn't see {{anything}} of it. She {{told me she}} had made a will; but she didn't quite like it, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> change it. <b>She</b> spoke of getting you to do it; I didn't know but she had." ...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are stories}} about people having been awakened by her {{carriage}} when she drove through the streets at night. The carriage <b>sometimes</b> stopped; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> sleep for a while, and then <b>she</b> <b>would</b> wake and the carriage would continue on its way. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> drove in circles around the royal palace. This habit was called [...] "Kring Kring" [...] (Swedish for [...] "around and around"; {{one of the few}} Swedish words Désirée learned).|$|R
2500|$|On December 31, 1862, a storm hit seas off Cape Hatteras, and Monitor, {{under tow}} by Rhode Island. Monitor was soon in trouble {{as the storm}} {{increased}} in ferocity, large waves splashing over and completely covering the deck, flooding into the vents and ports.

6000|$|Estella {{was always}} about, and always {{let me in}} and out, but never told me I might kiss her again. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> coldly {{tolerate}} me; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> condescend to me; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be quite familiar with me; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tell me energetically that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, [...] "Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?" [...] And when I said yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like [...] "Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!" ...|$|E
60|$|Whiskey {{learned in}} time to work for his living in many artful ways that his young {{mistress}} devised. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tie his nuts up in a paper package, which he would attack with great energy, gnawing the strings, and rustling the nuts out of the paper in wonderfully quick time. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tie a nut {{to the end of}} a bit of twine and swing it backward and forward over his head; and after a succession of spry jumps, he would pounce upon it, and hang swinging on the twine, till he had gnawed the nut away.|$|E
6000|$|... "But how {{thoroughly}} {{glad the}} countess {{must be that}} we are both going," [...] continued she. [...] "I declare we have treated her most infamously.

5000|$|... "Moll Anthony of the Red Hills had {{a supernatural}} power in curing paralysis, fits, strokes, and other sicknesses in humans and animals. It {{was said that}} she got the gift from the fairies. <b>Sometimes,</b> however, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> refuse to help a person, if she thought it best for the person to die, {{or if it was}} their second time to seek her help. Before asking for her help, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> welcome a {{complete}} stranger by addressing by their name and telling them their sickness. This passage concerns an account related to the author by 2 men who had received help from Moll."http://askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/folklore-of-ireland/folklore-folk-tales-and-c/moll-anthony-of-the-redhi/ ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{went very}} amiably to Whitford with George, and gained great credit with him, for admiring the prettiest {{speckled}} Hamburgh present; indeed, George was becoming {{very fond of}} [...] "poor Ethel," [...] as he still called her, and <b>sometimes</b> predicted that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> turn out a fine figure of a woman after all.|$|R
60|$|The torments {{of jealousy}} the cruel coquette made me endure were horrible. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> treat me as a child, {{sometimes}} as a man. She would always leave me {{if ever there}} came a stranger to the house.|$|E
60|$|It was {{astonishing}} how tenaciously {{the aged}} woman lingered. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> revive, with almost supernatural strength. Stimulated by the opiates, she would protest desperately against remaining in bed. The poor old creature {{seemed to think}} that the bed alone was responsible for her death.|$|E
6000|$|After {{that there}} were many {{pleasant}} days for Peter Rabbit. Sometimes little Miss Fuzzytail would meet him, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> shyly hide from, him, but somehow, somewhere, he managed to see her every day, and so all the time in Peter's heart was a little song: ...|$|E
60|$|She turned with thankfulness to the magenta anemones {{that were}} so gay. Some one told her that {{wherever}} Venus had shed a tear for Adonis, one of these flowers had sprung. They were not tear-like. And yet their red-purple silkiness had something pre-world about it, at last. The more she wandered, the more {{the shadow of the}} by-gone pagan world seemed to come over her. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>would</b> shriek and go mad, so strong was the influence on her, something pre-world and, it seemed to her now, vindictive. She seemed to feel in the air strange Furies, Lemures, things that had haunted her with their tomb-frenzied vindictiveness since she was a child and had pored over the illustrated Classical Dictionary. Black and cruel presences were in the under-air. They were furtive and slinking. They bewitched you with loveliness, and lurked with fangs to hurt you afterwards. There it was: the fangs sheathed in beauty: the beauty first, and then, horribly, inevitably, the fangs.|$|R
5000|$|Claiborne listed all {{employees}} in her corporate directory in alphabetical order, to circumvent what she perceived as male hierarchies. She controlled meetings by ringing a glass bell and became famous for {{her love of}} red—"Liz Red." [...] <b>She</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> pose as a saleswoman to see what average women thought of her clothes.|$|R
5000|$|As an adult, she {{had some}} success with poems, {{newspaper}} columns, short stories, one play and several novels. She had a special [...] "den" [...] in her home where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> sit and read or write. <b>Sometimes</b> in London <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go to Clifford's Inn, where she had a small personal office. She wrote a play, Bon Secours, in 1903. She may have written another play, Old Clothes, mentioned in a collectors' item manuscript - a letter written in March 1904 by Thomas Anstey Guthrie (1856-1934), who {{is also known as}} F. Anstey.|$|R
60|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{not notice}} him at all. Sometimes {{he would find}} her shyly peeping at him from behind a clump of grass. Then Johnny Chuck would try to make himself look very important, and would strut about as if he really did own the Green Meadows.|$|E
60|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{question}} Clayton as to {{the strange}} noises of the nights; the absence of servants and friends, and the strange rudeness of the furnishings within her room, but, though he {{made no effort to}} deceive her, never could she grasp the meaning of it all.|$|E
60|$|She had a {{beautiful}} way of sitting musing, gratefully, as if her heart were lit up. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> turn to him, laughing, to tell him some little thing that had happened during the day. Then he would laugh, they would talk awhile, before the vital, physical silence was between them again.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, papa, not tonight,--it {{would only}} trouble you tonight;" [...] {{and she sat}} upon his knee, as <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> in their gayest moods, and with her arm round his neck, she said: [...] "Papa, I will not leave you till you talk to me; oh, if you only knew how much good it would do to you, to tell me of it all." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{my story}} {{has made a}} jump from June to October, {{and during that time}} my {{relations}} with Beatrice and the countryside that was her setting had developed in many directions. She came and went, moving in an orbit for which I had no data, going to London and Paris, into Wales and Northampton, while her stepmother, on some independent system of her own, also vanished and recurred intermittently. At home they obeyed the rule of an inflexible old maid, Charlotte, and Beatrice exercised all the rights of proprietorship in Carnaby's extensive stables. Her interest in me was from the first undisguised. She found her way to my worksheds and developed rapidly, in spite of the sincere discouragement of Cothope, into a keen amateur of aeronautics. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> come <b>sometimes</b> in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes afoot with an Irish terrier, <b>sometimes</b> riding. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> come for three or four days every day, vanish for a fortnight or three weeks, return.|$|R
6000|$|Sandra Wentworth Williams {{certainly}} woke {{to find a}} copy of Donne's poems {{upon her}} dressing-table. And the book would be stood on the shelf in the English country house where Sally Duggan's Life of Father Damien in verse would join it one of these days. There were ten or twelve little volumes already. Strolling in at dusk, Sandra would open the books and her eyes would brighten (but not at the print), and subsiding into the arm-chair <b>she</b> <b>would</b> suck back again {{the soul of the}} moment; or, for <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> was restless, <b>would</b> pull out book after book and swing across the whole space of her life like an acrobat from bar to bar. She had had her moments. Meanwhile, the great clock on the landing ticked and Sandra would hear time accumulating, and ask herself, [...] "What for? What for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And though <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> bind me {{with her}} silver-corded speeches [...] To commix my words and {{laughter}} with the converse and the jest, [...] Oft I sat apart and, gazing on the river through the beeches, [...] Heard, as pure the swans swam down it, her pure voice o'erfloat the [...] rest.|$|E
60|$|Although by {{unalterable}} custom he submitted, at breakfast, {{the menus}} {{of the day}} to Hugh, the old butler came afterwards to Honora's boudoir during her struggle with the account books. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> look up and surprise his eyes fixed upon her, and one day she found at her elbow a long list made out in a painstaking hand.|$|E
60|$|What a {{life that}} poor man led with his wife, to be sure! Not a day passed without her scolding him and calling him names, and indeed <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> take the broom from behind the stove and beat him with it. He had no peace or comfort at all, and really hardly knew how to bear it.|$|E
50|$|Wendy Benson as Cleo, was {{a trainer}} and {{struggling}} actress {{working at the}} gym. Seen primarily as innocent and naive by her fellow gym staffers, she {{was in fact a}} woman with a mysterious past. This would be hinted at by the fact that <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> speak with a Southern accent when she was alone. She routinely received phone calls from a mysterious woman, also with a Southern accent, who called her Lorna Louise.|$|R
60|$|And {{thereafter}} Saxon listened, in a maze, to what {{almost seemed}} a wild farrago, save that the strange meaningless phrases were fraught with dim, mysterious significance. She caught glimmerings of profounds inexpressible and unthinkable that hinted connotations lawless and terrible. The woman's speech was a lava rush, scorching and searing; and Saxon's cheeks, and forehead, and neck burned with a blush that continuously increased. She trembled with fear, suffered qualms of nausea, thought <b>sometimes</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> faint, so madly reeled her brain; yet {{she could not}} tear herself away, sad sat on and on, her sewing forgotten on her lap, staring with inward sight upon a nightmare vision beyond all imagining. At last, when it seemed she could endure no more, and while she was wetting her dry lips to cry out in protest, Mercedes ceased.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 2002, Mzbel had the {{opportunity}} to work with Hush Hush Studios, which at that time had come on the scene as a new production firm. While at Hush Hush, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> be asked into the studio, and as the technicians played their instruments, she sang along, songs she had created. These were songs <b>she</b> <b>would</b> usually sing to herself with no serious intention of pursuing a music career. While working part - time at Hush Hush Studios, she secured another job, at Metro TV as the only digital video editor and also producer for 'Smash TV’, a weekend entertainment programme.|$|R
60|$|<b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{hide from}} him, {{and when he}} found her she would run away. Other times she {{would be just as}} nice to him as she could be, and they would have a jolly time hunting for sweet clover and other nice things to eat. Then Johnny Chuck's heart would swell until {{it seemed to him that}} it would fairly burst with happiness.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> sit before Oscar's looking-glass, and imitate all the innumerable tricks, artifices, and vanities of a coquette {{arraying}} {{herself for}} conquest--with such wonderful truth and humour of mimicry, {{that you would}} have sworn she possessed the use of her eyes. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> show him her extraordinary power of calculating by the sound of a person's voice, the exact position which that person occupied towards her in a room. Selecting me as the victim, she would first provide herself with one of the nosegays always placed by her own hands at Oscar's bedside; and would then tell me to take up my position noiselessly in any part of the room that I pleased, and to say [...] "Lucilla." [...] The instant the words were out of my mouth, the nosegay flew from her hand, and hit me on the face. She never once missed her aim, on any one of the occasions when this experiment was tried--and she never once flagged in her childish enjoyment of the exhibition of her own skill.|$|E
60|$|Sarah used {{to wonder}} silently at the sounds {{which seemed to}} her to have no {{particular}} air, such as she could beat time to with her foot as she worked; but in her heart she appreciated them; they made her {{feel as if she}} was in church, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> draw her apron across her eyes, wondering all the time what there was in the tones of the fiddle which should make her cry.|$|E
60|$|And because Michael took {{no notice}} of her, she {{made up to}} him. It {{was not long before}} she had her hands on him, and, quickly after that, an arm around his neck and her head snuggled against his. Then began her interminable tale. Day after day, {{catching}} him at odd times in the ring, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cling closely to him and in a low voice, running on and on, never pausing for breath, tell him, for all he knew, the story of her life. At any rate, it sounded like the story of her woes and of all the indignities which had been wreaked upon her. It was one long complaint, and some of it might have been about her health, for she sniffed and coughed a great deal and her chest seemed always to hurt her from the way she had of continually and gingerly pressing {{the palm of her hand}} to it. <b>Sometimes,</b> however, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cease her complaining, and love and mother him, uttering occasional series of gentle mellow sounds that were like croonings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Half an hour ago, {{and asking}} almost {{in his first}} breath for Nanda. I sent him {{up to her and}} he's with her now." [...] If Edward had his ways she had also some of her own; one of which, in talk with him, if talk it could be called, was never to produce {{anything}} till the need was marked. She had thus a card or two always in reserve, for it was her theory that she never knew what might happen. It nevertheless did occur that he <b>sometimes</b> went, as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have called it, one better.|$|R
60|$|Barbara saw {{the launch}} start, with mixed emotions. She was {{something}} of a rebel and had anybody but Cartwright ordered her to stop <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have obeyed. She waited in the shade, fixing her eyes on the laboring tugs. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> felt a thrill of triumph because Lister had conquered; <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> was tortured by suspense. She did not know if he stood at the levers in the engine-room, or lay, unconscious, in his bunk. Well, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> soon know and she shrank.|$|R
