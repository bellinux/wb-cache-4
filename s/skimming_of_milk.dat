Yet, improving the blue-white appearance and watery texture <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> {{is necessary to}} make consumers happy with skim milk. In this study, the influence of limited proteolysis with soluble or immobilized proteases, heat treatment, and pH on the whiteness <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> were examined to meet this goal. Limited proteolysis with milk-clotting enzymes increased the whiteness <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk.</b> the proteases porcine pepsin and chymosin were immobilized onto nonporous ceramic, glass, and controlled pore glass (CPG) beads. The enzymes were coupled to beads either directly or via crosslinker proteins. Pepsin, immobilized onto CPG beads via crosslinker proteins, exhibited the best properties with respect to enzymatic activity, stability, and whitening efficiency. The L value (whiteness) of this immobilized enzyme-treated skim milk was 79. 5, which approached the whiteness of 1 % fat milk. Immobilized proteases whitened skim milk more effectively than did soluble proteases. The whiteness <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was determined at various temperatures from 4 to 90 °C. The L value increased with increasing temperature throughout the range tested. For samples not heated above 50 °C, the increases in L values were completely reversible on cooling.

40|$|Foaming can be {{beneficial}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} temperature at/to which milk is foamed. For instance, foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is beneficial when making Italian style coffee such as cappuccino where steam from a steam generator is injected into milk to create a foam and to simultaneously heat the milk to ~ 65  70 °C. Foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is undesirable during operations such as pumping of cold (5 °C) milk in a dairy processing plant. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop an understanding of the foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and the factors that affect the foaming properties in the temperature range 5  85 °C and use this understanding to devise treatments and additives to improve/reduce the foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> depending on the end stage application. A review of literature showed that very little information was available on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature. Moreover a clear gap existed between an understanding of the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins in single or binary systems and the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> per se. Foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> over a broad temperature range were studied using a specially designed foaming apparatus, which enabled foams to be produced under standardised conditions. Foaming patterns of a range <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> which included raw whole milk, pasteurised homogenised full-cream milk, pasteurised skim milk, UHT homogenised full-cream milk, UHT skim milk and reconstituted milks made from low-, medium- and high-heat skim milk powder, were established as a function of temperature (5  85 °C). The foaming properties <b>of</b> a given <b>milk</b> were largely determined by the temperature at which milk was foamed, its fat content, and the processing conditions used during its manufacture. Skim milks had a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C when foamed over a temperature range of 5  85 °C. Image analysis <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams, as observed under a light microscope, showed that the surface <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams coarsened over time. This occurred most rapidly in foams produced at 5 °C and least rapidly in those produced at 45 °C. The foaming properties <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> were largely determined by the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat. Milk fat was detrimental to foam formation and stability <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> when milk fat globules contained both solid and liquid fat i. e. in the temperature range 5  40 °C. The extent of whey protein denaturation had a positive effect on the foam stability <b>of</b> reconstituted <b>milks</b> at lower temperatures (< 45 °C) and a negative correlation with foam stability at higher temperatures When skim milk was separated into its micellar, ultracentrifugal and defatted ultracentrifugal fractions, the foaming pattern <b>of</b> the parent <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature (5  85 °C), resembled that of the micellar fraction, with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. The foaming pattern of the serum phase <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> could not be determined due to precipitation of calcium, when the defatted ultracentrifugal supernatant was heated to temperatures G 45 °C. The sedimentable interfacial material isolated by low-speed centrifugation <b>of</b> collapsed <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams was made up of large-sized casein micelles; particle size measurements and electrophoretic analysis of this material showed that the stability <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams was mainly determined by the ability of micellar caseins to adsorb and form a stabilising network at the air serum interface of the foams. Addition of calcium-chelating agents, which increased the non-micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> decreased foam stability, while addition of calcium salts, which increased the micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> increased foam stability, reinforcing the observation that adsorption of micellar caseins is required for the stability <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams. The role of whey proteins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams could not be determined from a study of the sedimentable interfacial material, as they were lost in the supernatant during low speed centrifugation <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> foams. Lipolysis as measured by the FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> had a negative effect on the steam foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> with foamability and foam stability decreasing and the coarseness of foam increasing with an increase in the FFA content. The destabilising effect of the products of lipolysis was higher when milk was foamed at lower temperatures. A good correlation was observed between surface tension, FFA content and foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> However, natural variations in other surface active components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, protein and phospholipids, tend to mask the effect of changing FFA content on the surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and as a result it was difficult to arrive at an absolute surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> below which foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> were adversely affected. Increasing the total solids content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> decreased foamability and increased foam stability due to an increase in the viscosity coupled with an increase in the amount of protein available for adsorption at the airserum interface <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams. As in the case of increasing total solids content, addition of H-carrageenan decreased foamability and increased the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> due to an increase in viscosity <b>of</b> the <b>milk.</b> Emulsification <b>of</b> oils such as olive, canola and sunflower oils in skim milk using a microfluidiser resulted in a pronounced increase in the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing oil instead <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat resembled that <b>of</b> <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. This suggested that lipids which are fully liquid above 0 °C are not detrimental to the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foamed in the temperature range 5  85 °C. The higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing added oil, when compared to the parent skim milk, was attributed to an increase in the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a result of the added oil. Pre-heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> to temperatures G 65 °C altered the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foamability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> increased with an increase in the temperature of preheat treatment from 65 to 85 °C, while the foam stability was highest when milk was subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. Lowering of the measurable FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> by the likely binding of FFA to BSA and I-lactoglobulin, and the lack of whey protein denaturation, could be responsible for the higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. The present study represents a significant step forward in understanding the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> which is determined by the complex interplay between temperature, the structure, conformation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins, and the nature of other components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, mineral salts and FFAs. An understanding of the importance of caseins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams and the effect of the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> achieved in the present study, opens up exciting avenues for the manipulation of the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> especially to produce specialty milks with improved foaming properties...|$|R
