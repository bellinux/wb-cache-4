40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{approaches to}} topologically segmenting 2 D time-dependent vector fields. For {{this class of}} vector fields, two important classes of <b>lines</b> exist: <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> and path lines. Because of this, two segmentations are possible: either concerning the behavior of <b>stream</b> <b>lines,</b> or of path lines. While topological features based on <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> are well established, we introduce path line oriented topology as a new visualization approach in this paper. As a contribution to <b>stream</b> <b>line</b> oriented topology we introduce new methods to detect global bifurcations like saddle connections and cyclic fold bifurcations {{as well as a}} method to tracking all isolated closed <b>stream</b> <b>lines.</b> To get the path line oriented topology we segment the vector field into areas of attracting, repelling and saddle-like behavior of the path lines. We compare both kinds of topologies and apply them to a number of test data sets.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made into the mechanism of discrete frequency noise (DFN) generation from a NACA 0012 blade placed in a uniform oncoming flow. It was clarified that DFN was generated when the boundary layer on the blade surface was laminar and separated at the location upstream of the trailing edge. A dead air region was formed just after {{the trailing edge of}} the blade. Therefore a Karman vortex street occurred. Meanwhile we could not observe a close relationship between the existence of a separation bubble and the generation of DFN. That is, DFN was generated even when the attack angle of the flow was nearly zero and no separation bubble was observed. When a separation bubble existed, the boundary layer became turbulent and the flow did not separate up to the trailing edge, so a dead air region was not formed behind the blade, which resulted in the disappearance of DFN. The prediction of the sound pressure level of DFN generated from this <b>stream</b> <b>lined</b> blade by Fukano's theory for a flat plate model agreed well with the measured value...|$|E

Simulation can be used with value stream mapping to give it power and flexibility in order to dynamically change the state of the system.   The spiral welding production line has been working for many years.

40|$|A new {{technique}} for interactive vector field visualization using {{large numbers of}} properly illuminated <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> is presented. Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> in space.

Our patterns are defined sparsely and can have a significant extent, i. e., they are integration-based and not local. This allows for a greater flexibility in defining features of interest. Similarity is measured using intrinsic curve properties only, which enables invariance to location, orientation, and scale. Our method starts with splitting <b>stream</b> <b>lines</b> using globally-consistent segmentation criteria.
