25|$|IBL was a {{franchise}} league commercially managed by an Indian <b>sports</b> <b>rights</b> management company, Sporty Solutionz as commercial partners. With the brand value of US$1 million, Indian Badminton League was the richest badminton league in the world. Jwala {{was one of}} the six marquee players and team captains to be auctioned. The auction itself was not short of controversy. The base price of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa was halved from USD 50,000 to USD 25,000, without the players' notice and Women's Doubles event was replaced by a second Men's Singles. This left both Jwala and Ashwini hurt and angry. Jwala was bought for USD 31,000 and captained the Delhi franchise, but the team did not reach the semis and finished fifth. Gutta and Ponnappa after IBL confirmed on that they were set to reunite. Jwala went on to add that the two decided to come together because of a couple of reasons. The first was the Indian Badminton League's organisers knocking out the women's doubles category from the tournament, which in turn resulted in the base prices of Jwala and Ashwini.|$|E
500|$|Despite some {{positive}} initial attendance numbers, {{after three years}} {{it was clear that}} general American fan interest in Canadian football was sparse. Canadian differences, such as three downs and the wider field had not been embraced south of the border. [...] While the league had a small deal with ESPN2, a major television contract had not materialized (the league's U.S. teams, led by Baltimore, had tried to negotiate a deal with CBS Sports, then without any pro or college football or major league <b>sports</b> <b>rights,</b> but were unable to do so, as CBS instead managed to pick up college football rights to the Big Ten Conference, Southeastern Conference and Army–Navy Game for 1996). There was no widespread national promotional effort for the league, and the general preference to avoid competing with the NFL in major markets hurt the league's efforts to reach out to major media platforms; with only Baltimore in a large media market, and teams in minor league markets such as Birmingham and Shreveport (as well as the serious consideration of Mississippi), the Big Three television networks—which have historically required teams in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago to offer coverage—refused to cover the league. The July to November CFL season, designed to ensure the playoffs finish before Canada's harsh winters set in, forced the American teams to play {{the first half of the}} season in oppressive heat (other than the Texans, who played indoors) the second half in competition with high school, college football, and the NFL.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 September 2017, it was {{announced}} that the then-current digital rightsholder, Star India (a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox), had acquired the global media rights to the IPL under a five-year contract beginning in 2018. Valued at 16,347.5 crore (163.475 billion, US$2.55 billion, £1.97 billion), it is a 158% increase over the previous deal, and the most expensive broadcast rights deal in the history of cricket. The IPL sold the rights in packages for domestic television, domestic digital, and international rights; although Sony held the highest bid for domestic television, and Facebook had made an US$600 million bid for domestic digital rights (which U.S. media interpreted as a sign that the social network was interested in pursuing professional <b>sports</b> <b>rights),</b> Star was the only bidder out of the shortlist of 14 to make bids in all three categories.|$|E

2500|$|By {{contrast}} to Stern's assessment, media analysts and many fans {{found that the}} cable-heavy television deal made many games unavailable and, in addition, devalued the league. Starting with {{the second round of}} the playoffs, TNT's NBA coverage becomes exclusive, meaning that no locally produced league broadcasts can compete against the TNT telecasts (though commiserate with the move to <b>sports</b> <b>rights</b> to cable, few over-the-air local stations currently carry NBA coverage). Because of this, fans of teams in the playoffs who do not have a cable television subscription are unable to watch most playoff games. In addition, ABC's coverage is always exclusive, including during the regular season. If an ongoing game airs opposite one televised by ABC, it cannot be televised in the local market, which has the side effect of causing some games to not be aired on television at all. Sports Business Daily quoted Houston Chronicle writer Jonathan Feigen regarding the structuring of the NBA's deal with ABC: ...|$|E
