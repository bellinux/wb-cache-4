Its founder was Brent Bolleman and its first raison d'être was to refine and market an {{electrostatic}} computer product based on the design of Quad Electrostatics. Electrostatic speakers have their own problems due to the need for the membrane requiring high voltage, which is dangerous and has the requirement of a <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>transformer,</b> which is costly. The ultimate desire was to have a speaker that looked great and sounded great, so the conversion to planar magnetic design, which had problems of its own but easier dealt with, most notably was the need for rare earth magnets, which were expensive. Much of the focus of the transition focused on how to reduce this cost element and make the speakers more appealing to a larger pool of consumers. The early unnamed company started sending out prototypes to United Technologies. Through this the company made contacts with Woody Jackson a high end audio products expert based in Little Rock Arkansas, and Dave Clark an audio engineer who had ties to Delphi based in Detroit.

40|$|Pre-mature {{failures}} of wind turbine <b>step</b> <b>up</b> (WTSU) <b>transformers</b> {{have been reported}} in the wind farms although, the failed transformers had previously passed all quality assurance tests and had assembled all standard requirements. Vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) initiated steep front transient impact is one of the potential causes of such insulation failures. The use of VCB as switching devices and intense cable network increases the likelihood for high frequency transient overvoltages (TOVs) in wind farms. Multiple prestrikes and restrikes of VCB in conjunction with cable capacitance and inductance of transformer give rise to fast steep front voltage transients which eventually cause insulation failures in WTSU transformer. This emphasizes the need to conduct switching transient analysis studies for wind power plants, to investigate the severe switching overvoltages experienced by WTSU transformers. In this work, high frequency modeling in a broad frequency range for major components of the wind farms and an investigation of switching transients on WTSU transformer are presented. An adaptive model of VCB capable of simulating statistical phenomena and overvoltages on circuit breaker and the components that it interacts with is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC. A high frequency phase model of single core cable, taking into account the high frequency effect of cable, i. e., electromagnetic transient propagation, skin effect and reflections is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC. A linear wideband frequency-dependent black box model of an actual WTSU transformer based on the experimental determination of admittance matrix in a wide frequency range and subjecting the measured admittance matrix to an approximation by means of a rational function through vector fitting is used to simulate WTSU transformer.
