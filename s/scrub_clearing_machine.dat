50|$|In the 1960s {{the round}} {{was once again}} {{neglected}} with the southern entrance waterlogged and the round covered in scrub. In 1967 Cornwall County Council raised {{the level of the}} forecourt and paved the entrance to improve drainage as well as some <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing</b> and reseeding. Following the management work, Perranzabuloe Parish Council leased the site and in 1884-85 there was further scrub clearance and the fence replaced. Rose Community Association and later Rose Men's Institute took over the management until 1995. The following year Cornwall Wildlife Trust undertook an ecological assessment and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> from the outer face of the banks and the ditch. The Cornwall Heritage Trust now had the lease but did not maintain the site and in 2002, English Heritage handed the site to the current leaseholders, St Piran's Trust.|$|R
50|$|Portion 1212 was {{inspected}} in June 1883, and a rough map {{produced from}} this inspection shows that Jensen's house was {{situated in the}} south- east corner of the selection. This was a four roomed house, built with pine palings and covered with pine shingles. Other structures included a kitchen, fowl house, stable, pig house, and underground tank. Out {{of a total of}} 10 acres of <b>scrub</b> <b>cleared</b> and burnt, five acres of land were planted with sugar cane, and the rest was planted with corn, potatoes and fruit trees. The uncultivated land was used for cattle and horses.|$|R

50|$|In October 1874, Doherty {{selected}} portion 21, parish of Pimpama (158 {{acres of}} second class pastoral land on Hotham Creek, on which Laurel Hill Farmhouse was later built). The block already contained some improvements, including a slab barn {{and a small}} humpy and about 12 acres of <b>scrub</b> <b>cleared</b> and partly under cultivation, for which Doherty paid £20, and was issued with a conditional lease on the property for 10 years from 1 January 1875. At {{the same time he}} selected the adjoining portion 31 with 135 acres, on which existing improvements comprised a bark-roofed barn, a small slab house, some <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> and a small stockyard. It appears that the Dohertys resided on portion 31 from October 1874 until mid-1879, when they moved to portion 21. In 1879, Doherty also acquired the lease to portion 151, an 84-acre block which abutted the eastern boundary of portion 21.|$|R

All {{injections}} were performed using a 25 -G insulin needle and syringe (Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Silicone 5 -mm-long catheter sections (scale Fr 8, RUSCH Brilliant Pediatric, Teleflex Inc., Wayne, PA, USA) were implanted subcutaneously (sc) into the right flank of the mice as previously described [32, 33], with the following modifications. Analgesia (carprofen (Rimadyl), 5  mg kg− 1, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) was administered by sc injection 60  min prior to anaesthesia (inhalation of 2 % isoflurane in oxygen). The incision site was shaved and cleansed with chlorhexidine gluconate (Hydrex Surgical <b>Scrub)</b> <b>clear</b> solution (Ecolab, Northwich, Cheshire, UK). After insertion of the catheter, the incision site was sealed with tissue adhesive (GLUture, Abbott Laboratories, Maidenhead, UK). The incision sites were healed for at least 7  days prior to inoculation with bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{strongylosis}} are {{the dominant}} parasitic infections of sheep and goats. The successful control of these parasites cannot be done exclusively with anthelmintics, {{but the first}} step is an integrated program for environmental prophylaxis. The correct planning of the prophylaxis program has to be preceded by the analysis of the related problems: (1) the parasitological status of farm livestock; (2) knowledge of the farm management; (3) hydrogeological, pedological and climatic-environmental aspects. The environmental control strategies can be resumed as follows: avoiding animals from different farms to share the same pasture; avoiding animals of different age classes to graze together; parcel the pastures to permit a rational rotation; rotational grazing of pastures according to the seasonal development of parasites; stocking rate; young animals grazing ahead of the older animai ones; crop management practices (draining, ploughing, harrowing, <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing,</b> fertilizing, etc.). These measures make the habitat less suitable for the free-living stages of gastrointestinal strongyles, reducing the potential of infection of the same pastures...|$|R
50|$|The Kaurna {{people were}} a {{hunter-gatherer}} society. Among their customs was {{the practice of}} fire-stick farming (deliberately lit bushfires for hunting purposes) in the Adelaide Hills, which the early European settlers spotted before the Kaurna were displaced. These fires {{were part of a}} <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing</b> process to encourage grass growth for Emu and Kangaroo. This tradition led to conflict with the colonists as the fires tended to cause considerable damage to farmland. In an official report, Major Thomas O'Halloran claimed the Kaurna also used this as a weapon against the colonists by lighting fires to deliberately destroy fences, survey pegs and to scatter livestock. Due to this regular burning by the time the first Europeans arrived, the foothills' original Stringybark forests had been largely replaced with grassland. Since the late 1960s, restrictions on foothills subdivision and development have allowed regeneration of native trees and bush to a 'natural' condition that would not have existed at the time of European occupation.|$|R
5000|$|Wanneroo {{is one of}} the {{original}} Macedonian settlements in Australia. It was also the first [...] "Macedonian village" [...] in Australia. Approximately 25 kilometres from Perth it was an attractive location for many early Macedonian migrants. Many of these were Aegean Macedonians from the Florina and Kastoria regions. The first Macedonian to come to Wanneroo was Stojan Angelcoff who immigrated to Australia in 1923. He later brought out his wife and many other relatives. Many of the early migrants made a living through Market Gardening and <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing.</b> Soon families and wives were brought out to the settlement and it was referred to as the [...] "Macedonian Village". It would be these wives and families who would later go on to found the social and cultural organisations found in the area. By 1930 there were some 150 Macedonians in Waneroo which was steadily increasing. Another settlement was founded at Upper Waneroo. The area was well suited to growing vegetables in the summer.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} {{subtropical}} rainforest, {{part of the}} Bundjalung nation, before the Big <b>Scrub</b> was <b>cleared</b> in the late 19th century. A remnant of the forest is at nearby Booyong Flora Reserve. The red-brown soil is derived from a basaltic flow from the nearby Mount Warning and later volcanic flows from the Nightcap Range. Average annual rainfall at Lismore is 1340 mm and 1733 mm at Byron Bay.|$|R
40|$|Pseudo-steppe with {{grasses and}} annuals {{includes}} {{a variety of}} xeric, termophilic and mostly open Mediterranean perennial and annual grasslands growing on usually eutrophic, but also oligotrophic, soils. Three major sub-types should be considered: one of perennial basophile rather hard short-grass communities, included in Lygeo-Stipetalia; another one of very dense and short but highly productive perennial summer drying swards, created by intense and continuous livestock activity, included in Poetalia bulbosae; and a last one of pioneer and ephemeral basophilous annual grasslands, included in Brachypodietalia (Trachynietalia) distachyae. The diversity of plant, invertebrate and vertebrate communities is usually high. Pseudo-steppe with grasses and annuals has a typical Mediterranean distribution, with a significant area located in the Iberian Peninsula (mostly in Spain), followed by Italy, France, Greece, Cyprus and Malta. The habitat has been favoured by traditional management schemes and contributes to the so-called cultural landscapes. It usually occurs in a mosaic pattern {{with a wide variety}} of related habitats, many of them also included in the 92 / 43 EEC Directive. As a consequence, a high number of animal species protected by that Directive depend, to a higher or lesser degree, on this habitat type. That is why a holistic perspective is needed when considering conservation management models. Too low a grazing intensity will result in scrub encroachment, a reduction in biodiversity and an increased risk of wild fires. For Poetalia bulbosae communities, experience shows that this will lead to their disappearance due to rapid changes in floristic composition. Therefore, grazing (particularly sheep grazing) is essential for the long-term maintenance of this habitat. Regular <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing</b> on small to medium-size irregular plots and silvicultural treatments on related forests and coppices are advisable as complementary measures, as well as the conservation or restoration of traditional infrastructures (water points, hedges, stone walls) and nearby small agricultural plots. A light phosphoric fertilization is recommended for Poetalia bulbosae communities; however, fertilization with other nutrients or on other 6220 habitat type communities should be banned. Restoration of 6220 habitat type communities from overgrown sites will require <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing</b> and intense grazing for many years. Other relevant measures are reducing or banning the use of pesticides and herbicides, protecting the habitat from urbanization processes, control of tourism activity when necessary, promoting livestock quality labels, improving living conditions for shepherds and implementing new land management strategies...|$|R
