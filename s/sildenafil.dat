5|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}}: {{erectile dysfunction}} {{is common in}} male patients with MS. There is some evidence indicating that <b>sildenafil</b> citrate may be a useful treatment.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{medications}} and mechanical devices {{are the first}} choice in treatment because they are less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include <b>sildenafil</b> (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
5|$|Sold as Cialis and {{initially}} codenamed IC351, tadalafil {{is a drug}} prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED) and approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is a phosphodiesterase type5 (PDE5) inhibitor, similar in function to <b>sildenafil.</b> In addition to ED and PAH, tadalafil has undergone clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia and for female sexual dysfunction.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is <b>sildenafil</b> (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, <b>sildenafil</b> (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
25|$|In {{clinical}} trials, {{the most}} common adverse effects of <b>sildenafil</b> use included headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision. Some <b>sildenafil</b> users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the FDA found that <b>sildenafil</b> could lead to vision impairment in rare cases {{and a number of}} studies have linked <b>sildenafil</b> use with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} {{exercised}} {{by people who}} are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of <b>sildenafil,</b> effectively multiplying the plasma levels of <b>sildenafil,</b> increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of <b>sildenafil</b> to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of <b>sildenafil</b> include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> (Viagra). Concomitant {{administration}} of isosorbide mononitrate and <b>sildenafil</b> (Viagra) or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate {{with the potential}} result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, <b>sildenafil</b> should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy.|$|E
25|$|Vardenafil's {{indications}} and contraindications are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to <b>sildenafil</b> citrate (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis). The difference between the vardenafil molecule and <b>sildenafil</b> citrate is a nitrogen atom's position and the change of sildenafil's piperazine ring methyl group to an ethyl group. Tadalafil is structurally different from both <b>sildenafil</b> and vardenafil. Vardenafil's relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil's.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> {{has been}} found to enhance {{electrically}} evoked oxytocin release from the pituitary gland. In accordance, the drug shows oxytocin-dependent antidepressant-like effects in animals, and it has proposed that <b>sildenafil</b> may hold promise as a potential antidepressant in humans.|$|E
25|$|Viagra (<b>sildenafil)</b> for erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer {{scientists}} Andrew Bell, David Brown, and Nicholas Terrett originally discovered <b>sildenafil</b> as {{a treatment}} for various cardiovascular disorders. Since becoming available in 1998, <b>sildenafil</b> has been a common treatment for erectile dysfunction; its primary competitors are tadalafil (trade name Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), {{which is responsible for}} degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of <b>sildenafil</b> {{is similar to that of}} cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, <b>sildenafil</b> should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
25|$|Pfizer's {{patent on}} <b>sildenafil</b> citrate expired in Brazil in 2010.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} mouth spray {{preparations}} of <b>sildenafil</b> for faster onset of action.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} suggests that <b>sildenafil</b> may help men who experience antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> {{and other}} PDE5 inhibitors have {{moderate}} efficacy for treating secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|There were 2,958,199 {{prescriptions}} for <b>Sildenafil</b> in 2016 in England, compared with 1,042,431 in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Pfizer filed {{a patent}} {{covering}} the substance <b>sildenafil</b> {{and its use}} to treat cardiovascular diseases. This would be marketed as Revatio. The patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012. The patent on Revatio (indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction) expired in late 2012. Generic versions of this low-dose form of <b>sildenafil</b> have been available in the U.S. {{from a number of}} manufacturers, including Greenstone, Mylan, and Watson, since early 2013. Health care providers may prescribe generic <b>sildenafil</b> for erectile dysfunction. However, the generic is not available in the same dosages as branded Viagra, so using dosages typically required for treating ED requires patients to take multiple pills.|$|E
25|$|Manufacture {{and sale}} of <b>sildenafil</b> citrate drugs is common in China, where Pfizer's patent claim is not widely enforced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> acts by {{inhibiting}} cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (phosphodiesterase 5, PDE5), {{an enzyme}} that promotes degradation of cGMP, which regulates blood {{flow in the}} penis.|$|E
25|$|Losartan can, and topical nitrates may, {{reduce the}} {{severity}} {{and frequency of}} attacks, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors <b>sildenafil</b> and tadalafil may reduce their severity.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the tongue}} use of <b>sildenafil</b> for erectile {{dysfunction}} {{results in an}} average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting {{for an average of}} 40 minutes.|$|E
25|$|When {{taken by}} mouth <b>sildenafil</b> for erectile {{dysfunction}} {{results in an}} average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> {{should not}} be used if sexual {{activity}} is inadvisable due to underlying cardiovascular risk factors (such as recent heart surgery, stroke or heart attack, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Professional {{athletes have}} been {{documented}} using <b>sildenafil,</b> believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich their muscles. In turn, they believe it will enhance their performances.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, Pfizer's patent 2,324,324 for Revatio (<b>sildenafil</b> used {{to treat}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension) was found invalid by the Federal Court in June 2010, on an application by Ratiopharm Inc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil</b> {{appears to}} improve some {{risk factors for}} high-altitude {{pulmonary}} edema but {{it is unclear whether}} or not it affects the rate of the condition itself as of 2008.|$|E
25|$|GTN {{also can}} cause severe hypotension, circulatory collapse, and death if used {{together}} with vasodilator {{drugs that are}} used for erectile dysfunction, such as <b>sildenafil,</b> tadalafil, and vardenafil.|$|E

25|$|While <b>sildenafil</b> {{improves}} some {{markers of}} disease {{in people with}} pulmonary arterial hypertension, {{it does not appear}} to affect the risk of death or serious side effects as of 2014.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sildenafil,</b> sold as {{the brand}} name Viagra among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Its effectiveness for treating sexual dysfunction in women has not been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Other {{vascular}} agents such as {{nitric oxide}} (NO), n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-Name), nitroglycerin, NO + phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., <b>sildenafil),</b> and endothelin receptor antagonists have no effect, {{and in some}} cases worsen of the EIPH.|$|E
25|$|The US FDA {{has banned}} {{numerous}} products {{claiming to be}} Eurycoma longifolia that, in fact, contain only analogs of <b>sildenafil.</b> Sellers of such fake herbals typically respond by just changing {{the names of their}} products.|$|E
25|$|Like {{several other}} medications, {{the most obvious}} being erythromycin, {{cimetidine}} interferes with the body's metabolization of <b>sildenafil,</b> causing its strength and duration to increase (therefore also its side effects to be more likely and prominent).|$|E
25|$|The primary {{indication}} of <b>sildenafil</b> is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability {{to sustain a}} satisfactory erection to complete intercourse). Its use {{is now one of}} the standard treatments for erectile dysfunction, including for men with diabetes mellitus.|$|E
