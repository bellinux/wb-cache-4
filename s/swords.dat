5|$|During the Yayoi {{period from}} about 300BC to 300AD, iron tools and weapons such as knives, axes, <b>swords</b> or spears, were {{introduced}} to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula. Shortly after this event, Chinese, Korean, and eventually Japanese swordsmiths produced ironwork locally. <b>Swords</b> were forged to imitate Chinese blades: generally straight chokutō with faulty tempering. Worn slung from the waist, they were likely used as stabbing and slashing weapons. Although functionally it would generally be more accurate to define them as hacking rather than slashing weapons. Swordmaking centers developed in Yamato, San'in and Mutsu where various types of blades such as tsurugi, tōsu and tachi were produced. Flat double-edged (hira-zukuri) blades originated in the Kofun period, and around the mid-Kofun period <b>swords</b> evolved from thrusting to cutting weapons. Ancient <b>swords</b> were also religious objects according to the 8th century chronicles Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. In fact, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan is a sword, and <b>swords</b> have been discovered in ancient tumuli or handed down as treasures of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. Few ancient blades (jokotō) exist because the iron has been corroded by humidity.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or <b>swords.</b> Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: <b>swords</b> are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against <b>swords.</b>|$|E

5|$|The protagonist wields four {{different}} styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and bazooka. Almost all <b>swords,</b> axes, and spears have four versions, and repeated use of them can increase their skill levels {{to a maximum of}} three, unlocking a new charged attack with each level. The range and power of each type of weapon increased the more it is used; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen, while the <b>swords</b> and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy's vicinity. With the exception of the Bone Crusher, all <b>swords,</b> axes, and spears can cut through vegetation; some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers.|$|E

50|$|This game {{contains}} a new feature called solar forging, available after the player has completed the cathedral stage and rescued Smith.

(i.e. blood <b>sword</b> and blood <b>sword</b> = blood <b>sword</b> SP (when done properly), long <b>sword</b> and long <b>sword</b> = long <b>sword</b> SP). A combination of two weapons of the same type will give another weapon of that type, while weapons of two different types will yield one of the third types (for example, a <b>sword</b> with a <b>sword</b> will always give combined into a <b>sword</b> and a <b>sword</b> with a spear will always be combined into a hammer).|$|R

5|$|When {{the force}} marched west in 1873, it brought twenty-five British Army 1868 pattern lances {{along on the}} {{expedition}} to impress the Blackfoot First Nation. The force also used <b>swords,</b> with the 1822 pattern British Light Cavalry sabre approved for commissioned officers, and the non-commissioned officers carrying the British 1853 pattern weapon; some constables unofficially equipped themselves with <b>swords,</b> despite Commissioner French having doubts about their utility. The policy around the carrying of these weapons was reviewed in 1880, due to concerns that <b>swords</b> were no longer practical in conflicts with the First Nations. Commissioner Irvine wanted to equip all of his force with <b>swords</b> for use in close quarter combat, while the authorities in Ottawa were opposed to any extension; as a compromise, some 1822 pattern <b>swords</b> were purchased for storage in the police armouries. In 1882, non-commissioned officers were authorised to carry the 1822 pattern sabre, and commissioned police officers adopted the new British 1896 pattern cavalry sword when it was issued a few years later. The mounted police deployed to Siberia {{at the end of}} the First World War carried the 1908 pattern cavalry sword.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than <b>swords,</b> <b>swords</b> are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: <b>swords</b> and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than <b>swords</b> and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of <b>Swords,</b> Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of <b>Swords</b> so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of <b>Swords,</b> Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
