A RSC contains Environmental Site Assessments that ascertain the current condition of a site, including whether contamination exists on-site. The RSC is required when a property owner is choosing to change the property use from a less-sensitive to more-sensitive use (Example: Industrial Use to Residential Use) and is often required by the municipality's Chief Building Official before approval of a building permit.|$|E

A contractor ordinarily will not be entitled to recover for a constructive change in the work required by the government where the government's actions were not the direct cause of {{the contractor}}'s increased costs. An example of such a situation is where government-furnished property is not at the work site on schedule, but does not cause any delay to the contractor because, for other reasons, the contractor was not ready to proceed with the installation of that property. Where, however, a contractor and the government are both responsible, through their unreasonable acts, for failure to discover a differing <b>site</b> <b>condition,</b> the costs of the delay have been ordered shared.|$|E
30|$|The dataset used in {{this study}} was unique as LiDAR {{measurements}} were taken under uniform flying conditions and predominantly from a single tree species that occurred across a very diverse set of stand and <b>site</b> <b>conditions.</b> The relative control of LiDAR attributes and tree species within this dataset allowed the impact of stand structure and <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> on GRper to be accurately assessed. Response functions between GRper and independent variables were well defined as variation in stand and <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> were extremely wide. Findings show that a relatively large proportion of the variation in GRper could be attributed to stand conditions (age, stand and understory structure) with the <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> (stand slope) accounting for somewhat less of the variance.|$|R

Infrastructure and development planning are especially crucial, and the GIS will permit the DoA to assess the potential impact of development projects (e.g., construction of buildings, roadways, pipelines) on or near archaeological sites. MEGA-Jordan is also seen as a tool for coordinating archaeological site data with Jordanian government ministries (e.g., Tourism and Antiquities, Planning, Agriculture) and for academic research.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built by {{contractor}} Daelim Industrial Co., LTD, at a contract price of 40.3 million USD. Concrete pylon height with typical H-shape is 103m and constructed by auto climbing form. The main span of 327m across the lake is constructed using the free cantilever method and the side span of 57.5m is constructed by the full staging method.The combination of composite section (reinforced concrete deck and I-shaped steel girder) for the center span and concrete section for side spans applied to the bridge because of decreasing effect of weight balance. Concrete pylon has typical H-shape. The leg shape beneath the superstructure level, on the other hand, needs to be narrow {{down a little bit}} to make the size of foundation smaller mainly for less rock excavation at foundation locations and better handling of construction unit(caisson) considering the <b>site</b> <b>condition.</b> Cable is MSS(Multi Strand System) as 2 planes semi-fan. An extra pier support in each side span has been applied. To maximize the counter weight effect by concrete girder at side span, it is necessary to make the side span heavier as possible and not to have excessive bending moment by increasing dead load at the same time. Here, the extra pier support gives more opportunity for having more weight and stiffness in side span without resulting in excessive bending moment in girders and pylons.|$|E
50|$|Early in the 1990s it {{was deemed}} that the school's {{existing}} single storey buildings, {{built in the}} 1970s, were far too small to accommodate the rapid growth and expansion of both Coláiste Eoin and Íosagáin. It was decided that the school would require both a new classroom block and a sports hall/auditorium. The project, however, experienced difficulties from the outset {{due to a lack}} of funds. It took many years of collecting voluntary donations from parents and other members of the public for the project to even reach the planning stage. A second barrier was posed by the fact that additional accommodation could only be placed in a constricted rear area of the site, because the existing grass, gaelic pitch to the south of this site was sacrosanct. This restricted <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> caused the new building to be formed into two shared elements: a four storey academic block, and a Sports Hall with performance space. Despite these difficulties, building finally commenced in 2001, of a Grafton Architects designed structure that met with all the schools requirements. The project was completed in 2003 and has since won a prestigious award at the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland Awards 2004.Work recently went underway for a new building to be built on the far-side of Coláiste Íosagáin's main building, on a small side section of the school grass pitch in summer of 2013. The building consists of new classrooms,new changing rooms and chiefly, a school oratory. The building was completed in early December 2013 and is named 'Aireagal', because the main principle of the building is to provide an oratory for the students. This building completes the refurbishment of the school, and also means that no more classes are held in prefabricated buildings.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Goette’s 1994 study {{tries to}} {{classify}} important international site factors and to structure {{the process of}} international site selection. Goette distinguishes between economic <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> (sales potential, competitive conditions, infrastructure and transportation costs, labor, monetary <b>conditions),</b> political <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> (tax legislation, environmental protection, institutional market entry barriers, support of business, political risks), cultural <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> (differences in language, mentality, religion, {{and the lack of}} acceptancy of foreign companies), and geographical <b>site</b> <b>conditions</b> (climate, topography). This study again demonstrates that an attempt to cover all aspects will result in loss of quality as all factors were not or could not be taken into consideration. Goette also theorizes that, in particular, industrial site decisions within companies are usually once-off and division-related decision-making processes. Based on this, Goette assumes a relatively low learning curve, and hence little potential for improvement for subsequent projects.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSite-based habitat {{condition}} multi-metrics offer {{a simple}} surrogate for biodiversity assessment, but their merit has seldom been tested. Three such multi-metrics – Habitat Hectares, BioCondition, and BioMetric – are prominent in Australia. They all measure similar attributes, convert primary data into attribute condition scores (metrics), then weight and aggregate attribute condition scores {{into a single}} <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> score (multi-metric). We compared these multi-metrics and tested whether <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> scores were correlated with the species richness {{of a range of}} plant, vertebrate and invertebrate taxa recorded from Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea) woodland remnants in eastern Australia in a range of condition states. <b>Site</b> <b>condition</b> scores (n= 43) ranged from 17 to 88 / 100, and the summed richness of all taxa recorded from sites ranged from 93 to 192 species. The multi-metrics ranked sites similarly (rs≥ 0. 79), but BioMetric scored sites significantly lower. <b>Site</b> <b>condition</b> scores were significantly correlated with the total species richness at sites (Habitat Hectares r= 0. 51, BioCondition r= 0. 49, BioMetric r= 0. 43), however, 75 % or more of the variation was left unexplained. Linear modelling of attribute condition scores (metrics) showed that nearly 50 % of the variation in total richness could be explained by a parsimonious model containing only nine condition attributes drawn from the three multi-metrics. This finding revealed that the independent explanatory power available within attribute condition scores (metrics) was not fully utilised by the <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> scores (multi-metrics). To refocus attention on the importance of careful selection, weighting and aggregation of condition attribute scores, and to improve communication and interpretation of the derived <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> multi-metrics, we introduce the weighted wedge diagram, a schematic that conveys visually and quantitatively: (i) the condition status of all attributes; (ii) the relative weightings applied to all attributes; and (iii) whether sites are degraded in terms of composition, structure and/or functional components...|$|E

40|$|The {{reference}} rock <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> has {{two important}} applications for ground-motion prediction {{in the stable}} continental region {{of central and eastern}} North America (CENA). (1) It represents the <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> for which ground motions are computed using semiempirical ground-motion prediction equations. In addition, (2) it represents the <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> to which site amplification factors, which are used to modify ground-motion intensity measures for softer <b>site</b> <b>condition,</b> are referenced (i. e., site amplification is unity for reference rock). We define reference rock by its shear (S) and compression (P) -wave velocities, as well as a site attenuation parameter (kappa(0)), which is used in stochastic ground-motion simulation methods. Prior definitions of reference rock conditions in CENA were based mostly on indirect large-scale crustal velocity inversions and judgment. We compile and interpret a unique database of direct velocity measurements to develop criteria for assessing the presence of reference rock <b>site</b> <b>condition</b> based on measured seismic velocities and their gradient with respect to depth. We apply the criteria to available profiles and perform rigorous statistical analysis from which we recommend S-and P-wave velocities of 3000 and 5500 m/s, respectively, for the reference rock condition. We recommend that, for practical applications, use ranges of reference S-and P-wave velocities of 2700 - 3300 m/s and 5000 - 6100 m/s, respectively. The ranges are based on a +/- 5 % change in amplification using quarterwavelength theory. We do not find evidence for regional dependence of the reference velocities, which are derived principally from three general geographic regions: (1) Atlantic coast, (2) continental interior, and (3) Appalachian Mountains. Our data do not provide reference velocities for the Gulf Coast region. The recommended velocity-compatible reference rock site kappa is 0. 006 s. ope...|$|E
