Treatments with solutions were made through SCB immersion. Statistical design was a change-over whit two groups of 3 animals each. Results showed no effect of SCB treatments over soybean and cotton seed protein degradabilities. Effective degradability was 58. 13 % (cotton seed) and 90. 64 % (raw soybeen), with rumen effluent rate of 0. 02...|$|E
40|$|Presently {{available}} {{bone substitute}} materials are either bioactive with poor biomechanical stability or they show good biomechanical impact, but are bioinert. The {{aim of this}} study was to combine bioactivity of hydroxyapatite (HA) and the mechanical properties of bioinert ceramics like yttrium oxide by creating composites. To evaluate their bioactivity and biocompatibility we examined in a first group osteoblastic responses to pure ceramics: hydroxyapatite (HA), fluorapatite (FA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP), as well as composites: FA/HA, yttriumoxide/HA and pure yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) in vitro. In a second group we examined different stabilizers (calcium-, cer- yttrium and magnesiumoxide) of zirkonoxide to evaluate if there are any differences in bioactivity or cytotoxicity. In the third group we developed a method to activate the surface of the ceramics by treating them with <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxyde.</b> We expected to create OH- at the surface on which cells adhere better. Human Osteoblast-like cells were obtained from trabecular bone fragments of patients undergoing knee surgery. 1 x 10 4 cells were cultured on each ceramic described above. We determined the material’s effect on cell adhesion, proliferation and protein secretion after 24 hours and seven days of cultivation. Trypan blue was used to desperate dead and living cells on the ceramic surface. Alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin secretion as markers of bone formation were measured. Cell morphology and mineralisation were examined using special stainings. Apoptosis was determined using a nick end labelling technique. Cell proliferation and differentiation on HA and TCP were quite good. Apoptosis could hardly be detected. FA and the composite FA/HA showed similar results concerning the examined parameters. Y 2 O 3 had the lowest cell counts both after one day and one week. The apoptosis rate was high (up to 25 %). In the second group we found no difference between the stabilisation of zirkonoxide with calcium-, cer- or magnesiumoxide. All of them showed quite good results. In the third group we showed that <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxyde</b> does improve bioactivity as all parameters of the modified ceramics were above the pure ones. We showed that there are some ceramics which could be interesting bone substitute materials in future. But further studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] A study {{fractionation}} {{of medium}} chain fatty acids ethyl esters from virgin coconut oil via transesterification and distillation under reduced pressure. Transesterification was strarted by preparing sodium ethoxyde from <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxyde</b> and ethanol and then mixed {{it with the}} coconut oil: ratio ethanol/oil (1 : 2), stirring speed 500 rpm, 2 % NaOH catalyst concentration, and reaction time of 60 minutes at room temperature. Ethyl ester which was obtained in every treatment was separated, washed and filtered, which was then characterized by GC-MS. Then ethyl ester formed separated using distillation under reduced pressure method based on differences in boiling point. At this stage fractionation by three fractions, namely the fraction 1 ( 170 o C). Each fraction was analyzed composition of {{fatty acid ethyl ester}}s using gas chromatography (GC). The result showed that the yield medium chain fatty acid ethyl ester is 75. 59 %. While the stage fractionation of fatty acid ethyl ester dominated by ethyl laurate with a range of above 60 % for each fraction.

40|$|Beet {{pulp and}} potato fibre were {{liquefied}} and saccharified {{with a combination}} of cellulase from Trichodermaviride and pectinase from Aspergillusniger. Cell wall polysaccharides were hydrolysed extensively. The application of a packed column reactor, connected with a hollow fibre ultrafiltration unit was investigated for the enzymatic hydrolysis of beet pulp. A high degree of polysaccharide hydrolysis of spent grain by the action of cellulases was obtained after pretreatment with sulfuric acid or <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxyde.</b> Essentially only monomeric sugars were present in the enzyme digest of the acid pretreated material. Six endoglucanases, three exoglucanases and a β-glucosidase were purified from a commercial cellulase preparation of T. viride origin. These enzymes were characterized with respect to their activities on several cellulosic substrates as well as chemical and physical properties. The β-glucosidase showed no cellobiase activity. Random and less random acting endoglucanases were distinguished. Adsorption, kinetic and synergistic behaviours of these enzymes were investigated on crystalline cellulose. It was shown that an optimal ratio of endoglucanase to exoglucanase was needed in order to obtain a maximal degree of synergism. This ratio could be related to the adsorption behaviours of the cellulases, suggesting that synergism between endoglucanases and exoglucanases takes place in very close cooperation at the surface of the cellulose particle. From activity experiments on xylan specific and nonspecific glucanases could be demonstrated. However, the non-specific glucanases prefer to hydrolyse β- 1, 4 -glucosidic linkages over β- 1, 4 -xylosidic bonds. ...|$|E
