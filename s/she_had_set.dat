5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Aicha Fall {{qualified}} for the London Games as a wildcard, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>set</b> no time for her event, the 800 meters. She was {{to compete in the}} 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics 800 meters but did not start the event. She competed on August 8 in Heat 5 against seven other athletes. She posted a time of 2 minutes and 27.97 seconds, finishing sixth and setting a national record in the process. She placed ahead of Palestine's Woroud Sawalha (2 minutes and 29.16 seconds) and behind Canada's Melissa Bishop (2 minutes and 09.33 seconds) in a heat led by Ukraine's Nataliia Lupu (2 minutes and 8.35 seconds). Overall, Fall was 24.12 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-finals and therefore did not advance.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was {{important}} because the human species had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>set</b> up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E

25|$|Isinbayeva {{started the}} 2009 season by {{becoming}} {{the first woman to}} vault over 5metres indoors. She first raised her world indoor mark with a vault of 4.97m, then raised the bar to 5.00m and cleared that height as well. The two marks were set at the Pole Vault Stars indoor meet, on 15 February, in Donetsk, Ukraine. It was the sixth consecutive year <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>set</b> an indoor world record in this meet. She received the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportswoman of the Year in recognition of her achievements – it was also the fifth time she had been nominated for the award in as many years.|$|E
25|$|Keen {{to quickly}} atone for her disappointing {{performances}} at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, O'Sullivan competed {{in her first}} indoor competition for five years at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics in Paris in March 1997. Prior to that meeting, O'Sullivan had travelled to Australia to get some early season competition in the Australian domestic outdoor season. O'Sullivan recorded her best result in Canberra, on 11 January, where she won a 5000 m race in 15:10.98. She had entered both the 1500 m and 3000 m at the World Indoors, but eventually she chose to only contest the 3000 m event. In the final, on 8 March, O'Sullivan hit {{the lead in the}} last lap, but she was overtaken by Romanian Gabriela Szabo who went on to narrowly defeat O'Sullivan in 8:45.75 compared to the Irishwoman's second place time of 8:46.19. At the World Cross Country Championships she finished 9th but helped Ireland win the Bronze Medal in the Team Event. Compared with the magnificent performances that she had produced in previous years, O'Sullivan had an indifferent outdoor season in 1997, and her best time of 8:53.53 over 3000 m, which she achieved in Paris on 25 June, was 7 seconds slower than the time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>set</b> indoors in March. Similarly, her best performance at 5000 m for the year remained the time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>set</b> in Australia in January. At the World Championships held in Athens, O'Sullivan produced her best 1500 m time of the year of 4:05.31 when she finished fourth in her semi-final on 3 August. In the final, held two days later, O'Sullivan was never a serious threat, and she finished 8th in 4:07.81. O'Sullivan had even greater disappointment in the 5000 m where she was the defending world champion, finishing only 7th in her heat and failing to qualify for the final.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} four games, the outcome was all but decided {{by the end of}} the first quarter. In the gold medal game against Canada, the results would be very different. Canada entered the game with a 4–0 record, the same as the USA team. The game started with low scoring, neither team {{managing}} to reach double digits in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter the teams were tied 9–9. The scoring picked up in the second quarter, but by both teams. The USA team, after hitting only 3 of their first 16 field goal attempts, went on a 10–0 run to take an eight-point lead, but Canada did not fold, and responded to tie the game. The teams were tied at 27 points each at halftime. The teams traded baskets early in the third period, but then the USA went on a 22–0 run to take a large lead. The USA extended the lead until it reached 38 points in the fourth quarter. Canada out scored the USA over the final minutes, but the game was out of reach, and the USA went on to win the game 82–48, and the gold medal. Asia Durr was named the tournament MVP. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>set</b> three single game records for the U16 tournament, including most points, 26, most steals, 8, and most field goal attempts 22. Teammate Katie Lou Samuelson also set a record.
