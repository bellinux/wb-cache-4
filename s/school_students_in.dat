5|$|Bournemouth is {{a tourist}} and {{regional}} centre for leisure, entertainment, culture and recreation. Local author and former mayor, Keith Rawlings, suggests that Bournemouth has a thriving youth culture {{due to its}} large university population and many language <b>school</b> <b>students.</b> <b>In</b> recent years, Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK visitors and many clubs, bars and restaurants are located within the town centre. In a 2007 survey by First Direct, Bournemouth {{was found to be}} the happiest place in the UK, with 82% of people questioned saying they were happy with their lives.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, {{three young}} boys {{turned up at}} a senior {{athletics}} meet in Geelong, Victoria. They approached official Trevor Billingham, but Billingham turned them away citing their youth {{as a reason for}} them not to be allowed to compete. A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp had a lot of primary <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> attendance.|$|E
5|$|The Vernon Square school {{opened on}} Pentonville Road in 1913, {{expanding}} to cover secondary <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> 1949.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{students}} travel to school using the nation's bus network, which is free for state school students to use. Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm. Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas, two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April, in addition to public holidays. Maltese school students receive {{the highest number of}} days off of all <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Europe, with 90 days during the 2010-11 academic year being non-school days. This is 14 days more than the European average of 76. Virtually all Maltese state schools run tuck shops, while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than her mother could give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern {{parts of the country}} where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|From 1865 until 1918, Briarcliff Manor served {{students}} up to {{the ninth}} grade. Before 1918, Briarcliff students who wanted to proceed to high school would attend the nearby Ossining High School. After 1918, Briarcliff introduced an advanced curriculum for high <b>school</b> <b>students.</b> <b>In</b> 1923, four students were {{the first in a}} Briarcliff school to receive high school diplomas. In 1928, with the entrance of additional high school students, an extension was added to the Spanish Renaissance-style Grade School for use as Briarcliff High School. The building was located adjacent to the Walter W. Law Memorial Park. The enlarged school accepted students from Croton, Hawthorne, North White Plains, Valhalla, and as far as Granite Springs.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{there were}} 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were {{operated}} {{by the government and}} 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect {{from the end of the}} school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Australia, accounting for 40.6percent of ACT enrollments.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{considered}} {{returning to}} Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought {{a home and}} opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him {{to serve on the}} Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, and then to a more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his Recollections, a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for its time, for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall's enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The last he delivered was to high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the town of his birth.|$|E

5|$|The Jordanian {{educational}} system {{consists of a}} two-year cycle of pre-school education, 10 years of compulsory basic education, and two years of secondary academic or vocational education, after which the students sit for the Tawjihi exams. 79% of children go through primary education, while secondary school enrollment has increased from 63% to 97% of high school aged students in Jordan. Between 79% and 85% of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Jordan move on to higher education. According to the CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in 2015 was 95.4%. UNESCO ranked Jordan's education system 18th out of 94 nations for providing gender equality in education. Education is not free in Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year <b>school</b> <b>students.</b> <b>In</b> some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Research {{into the}} atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's Physics Department in the {{international}} spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project. In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into University Extension. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies {{in response to the}} return of GIs after World War II. In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum. Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension. While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.|$|E
