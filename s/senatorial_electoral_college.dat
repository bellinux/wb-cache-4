50|$|In 1836, the Reform Convention met in Baltimore {{and demanded}} the direct {{election}} of the Governor and the Senate, {{the elimination of the}} Governor’s Council and the reapportionment of the House of Delegates. This act {{set the stage for the}} constitutional crisis of 1837, which his administration successfully resolved. He was re-elected on January 2, 1837, receiving 70 of the 81 votes cast. Governor Veazey was re-elected in 1838, and received 52 of the 81 votes. The gubernatorial election in 1838 marked the last time the General Assembly was to elect a governor. After 1838, the Governor would now be chosen directly by the people. The State Senate was also reorganized by awarding one Senator to each county and one to Baltimore City. The people would choose them directly while both the old <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> and the Governor’s Council were abolished in accordance with his recommendations.|$|E

40|$|The {{reason for}} the birth of the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> in the United State emerged from a genuine concern for {{legitimate}} and authentic representation of we the people granted by the people. Notwithstanding, the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> as operated in a contemporary world is without foundation for furtherance of such cause. Arguably, not only is the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> process antiquated but also it represents a farce to the mandate it justifiably seeks. Of the prevailing 50 states, 48 make the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> a mockery of its purpose by offering the candidate all the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> votes for those states. Only two states attempt at preserving the rationale for the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b> The time has come for a transformational departure from the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> to a system that offer <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> points (ECP) by congressional districts equal to the number of <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> votes and thus restoring the legitimacy of the peoples representative.

40|$|We {{review a}} number of {{different}} statistical techniques for creating seats-votes curves and apply the most reliable of these to estimate seats-votes relationships in the US <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> 1900 - 1992. We consider the now rejected claim, once firmly estab-lished as part of the common journalistic and even academic wisdom, that the US <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> has recently been strongly biased in favor of Republicans. and show that this claim was based largely on a confusion between bias (asymmetry in the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> gains earned by the votes received by different parties or candidates) and swing ratio (responsiveness of change in <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> seat share to change in popular vote). Although there has been substantial bias during this century in the way the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> translates Democratic and Republican votes into <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> seats, and for the earlier party of this century (from 1900 to 1940) that bias has been in favor of Republicans, to explain why many recent <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> majorities have been so lopsided we must look not at bias but at swing ratio. We show that the swing ratio in the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> has generally been increasing since 1900, rising from an average value (1900 - 1924) around three to an averag...|$|R

5000|$|Argentina had an <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> {{established}} by its original 1853 Constitution, {{which was used}} to elect its president. The constitution was amended in 1949 and the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> was replaced with direct elections by popular vote used in the elections of 1951. After the Revolución Libertadora the 1957 reform repealed the 1949 Constitution and the <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> was used again in the elections of 1958 and 1963. The elections of March 1973 and September 1973 used direct elections by popular vote and a not used two-round system according to the Temporary Fundamental Statute enacted by the military junta in 1972.

40|$|This paper explores how the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> shapes {{incentives}} for presidential candidates to allocate resources across states. It does so {{by developing a}} probabilistic voting model of electoral competition under an <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> system. The model delivers a precise recommendation for how presidential candidates, trying to maximize the probability of gaining {{a majority in the}} <b>Electoral</b> <b>College,</b> should allocate their resources. If the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> shapes presidential incentives, then this should be most stark in a presidential campaign. Therefore, the model first applied to the 1988 - 2000 presidential campaigns. Although important for the political system, the direct effect of campaign spending on people's welfare is limited. Therefore the model is used to test whether the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> distorted the distribution of federal civilian employment 1948 - 1996. The empirical evidence suggests that the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> system influenced the actual allocation of campaign resources and federal employment. Having established that the model has some empirical plausibility, the paper goes on to analyze the eeffct of an institutional reform: the transition to a direct national vote for president...|$|R
40|$|This {{theoretical}} note {{argues that}} although both gross costs and possible gross {{benefits from the}} <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> can be identified, they cannot be compared {{in such a way}} as to generate a case that the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> yields net benefits to society. In other words, the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> system, pure and simple, artificially distorts behavior in a market where household preferences are to intended be expressed; although this distortion yields apparent benefits and costs, the existence of net benefits is not established. In sum, since the <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> system artificially distorts geographic voter participation rate patterns, the case needs to be made w y the system should be retained. ...|$|R
