5|$|In September 1740, as unrest rose {{among the}} Chinese population, spurred by {{government}} repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would {{be met with}} deadly force. On 7October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area.|$|E
