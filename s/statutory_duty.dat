5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during court proceedings, otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be disclosed to the Gaming Board. Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority {{to decide how to}} allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to do so. However, on the facts of the case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E
25|$|A duty {{to consult}} {{interested}} parties before reaching a decision may be imposed by statute, or arise {{by way of}} a legitimate expectation on their part. The courts are reluctant to imply a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to consult in the absence of factors leading to a legitimate expectation, or to imply a duty to consult people other than those actually required by statute to be consulted. A <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to consult is almost invariably regarded as mandatory and, where there is consultation, it must be adequate.|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} view {{of corporate}} regulation is that corporations {{are to be}} managed {{for the benefit of}} their shareholders. The general law and <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> of directors and officers reflect this “shareholder primacy norm”, with duties formulated to prevent directors acting otherwise than in the interests of shareholders. However, the general law and <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> are not identical. The remedies and enforcement mechanisms differ considerably, which raises the question as to whether the public enforcement of <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> carries with it a public interest mandate that general law duties do not. This article considers what role the public interest should have in enforcing <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> and whether such a role represents a challenge to the dominant shareholder primacy norm of corporate law. This issue is highly topical as recent decisions have suggested that the <b>statutory</b> <b>duties</b> of directors and officers are limited in their scope to protecting the interests of shareholders, even {{to the detriment of the}} public interest. We contest that viewpoint and argue that, at least in relation to <b>statutory</b> <b>duties,</b> directors and officers have obligations that extend beyond the narrow conception of the protection of shareholder wealth...|$|R

25|$|Expectations are not {{legitimate}} {{when they}} require a public {{authority to act}} in breach of its <b>statutory</b> <b>duty.</b> This applies only when the statutory provisions diametrically conflict with the representation. In other words, the statutory provision will render the courts' fulfilment of the expectation impossible. However, a statutory provision which merely permits, but does not compel the public authority to breach the expectation will not necessarily justify any such breach.|$|E
25|$|A {{provision}} {{will usually}} be declaratory if {{it relates to}} the performance of a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> rather than to the exercise of a power on individual interests. If a procedural code established in a statute is intended to be exhaustive and strictly enforced, its provisions are mandatory. The determination will depend on the context and whether, for instance, a mistake is found to be trivial or whether individual rights are obviously prejudiced by the failure to observe the requirement.|$|E

25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E
25|$|The {{prior consent}} of a data subject is also {{required}} before personal data is processed. (Section 20) This requirement is, however, subject to exceptions.

Consent is also required for the processing of special personal data (Section 37(2) (b)). A data subject also object to the processing of personal data (section 20(2)), and the data processor is required to stop processing the data upon such objection (section 20(3)).|$|E
25|$|In Germany, a {{relatively}} new law, which {{has been established in}} 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{securities}} industry, arbitration {{has long}} been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims, are resolved in arbitration. The SEC has come under fire from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for not fulfilling <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues. The final result in the case where the arbitrators were in contempt of court is unknown; it was settled out of court under settlement agreement terms that, at the broker's insistence, are confidential.|$|E
500|$|This {{position}} was further buttressed in Re Findlay (1984), where four prisoners {{contended that the}} Home Secretary's new policy of refusing parole in all but exceptional cases was a fetter upon his discretion. The House of Lords rejected {{the argument that the}} relevant statutory provisions required [...] "individual consideration of individual cases in every instance, free of presumptions or policies", and held that {{it would be difficult to}} understand how a Secretary of State could properly manage the complexities of his <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> without a policy.|$|E
500|$|In the UK, the House of Lords has {{considered}} {{the relevance of}} the availability of financial resources to a public authority's decision. In R. v. Gloucestershire County Council, ex parte Barry (1997), the court held that it was relevant for Gloucestershire County Council, which had a <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to provide home care services to elderly and frail people, to have considered the cost of doing so when determining whether they should be withdrawn. For instance, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that [...] "needs for services cannot sensibly be assessed without having some regard to the cost of providing them. A person's need for a particular type or level of service cannot be decided in a vacuum from which all considerations of cost have been expelled." ...|$|E

500|$|Barry was {{distinguished}} in {{the subsequent}} case R. v. East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy (1998), in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) sufferer was challenged. The services were reduced due to {{a cut in the}} authority's home tuition budget. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, speaking for the House of Lords, noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision-maker to assess the [...] "needs" [...] of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was [...] "necessary in order to meet" [...] those needs. The statute only listed the services that could be provided, and did not define what [...] "needs" [...] meant. Thus, it was [...] "perhaps not surprising" [...] that the court had laid down the availability of resources as a criterion for determining what should be considered [...] "needs". On the other hand, in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide [...] "suitable education" [...] to the applicant, which was defined according to [...] "wholly objective educational criteria". Financial resources were not mentioned at all. In the circumstances, the judge held that the extent of the latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority's decision. He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty, this was a situation of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters. Thus, the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its <b>statutory</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E

2500|$|R. v. Ealing London Borough Council, {{ex parte}} Times Newspapers Ltd. (1986) {{dealt with the}} {{principle}} of irrelevant considerations as well. In this case, Ealing London Borough Council had refused to provide certain newspapers in their public libraries because the newspapers' proprietors were political rivals {{of members of the}} Council. The Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the political sentiments of the local authority should not have interfered with its decision to run the public libraries because it was irrelevant to its <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to provide [...] "a comprehensive and efficient library service for all persons desiring to make use thereof".|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{designation}} system allowed territorial police forces {{to recover the}} additional costs of providing extra police officers for airports in their police area, it had some limitations. There was no effective means of arbitration between an airport operator and the police force - the Secretary of State for Transport could [...] "determine" [...] what the payment would be, but could not adjudicate on what level of service should be provided. At Luton Airport, which was not designated, Bedfordshire Police provided armed police under their <b>statutory</b> <b>duty</b> to provide [...] "effective and efficient policing", but the airport operator refused {{to pay for the}} service.|$|E
