The spectral, temporal and spatial resolution of the data collected are all adjustable in real time, making it possible to keep the tradeoff between the sensor operating parameters at optimum at all times. The instrument contains no macro-scale moving parts and is therefore an excellent candidate {{for the development of a}} robust, compact, lightweight and low-power-consumption sensor.

40|$|Directed Energy (DE) systems {{offer the}} {{potential}} for true planetary defense from small to km class threats. Directed energy has evolved dramatically recently and is on an extremely rapid ascent technologically. It is now feasible to consider DE systems for threats from asteroids and comets. DE-STAR (Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploration) is a phased-array laser directed energy system intended for illumination, deflection and compositional analysis of asteroids [1]. It can be configured either as a stand-on or a distant stand-off system. A system of appropriate size {{would be capable of}} projecting a laser spot onto the surface of a distant asteroid with sufficient flux to heat a spot on the surface to approximately 3, 000 K, adequate to vaporize solid rock. Mass ejection due to vaporization creates considerable reactionary thrust to divert the asteroid from its orbit. DESTARLITE is a smaller stand-on system that utilizes the same technology as the larger <b>standoff</b> <b>system,</b> but with a much smaller laser for a dedicated mission to a specific asteroid. DESTARLITE offers a very power and mass efficient approach to planetary defense. As an example, a DE-STARLITE system that fits within the mass and size constraints of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) system in {{a small portion of the}} SLS block 1 launch capability is capable of deflecting an Apophis class (325 m diameter) asteroid with sufficient warning.

40|$|A survey amongst {{stakeholders}} in 2007 identified wintering systems with less environmental impact and a reliable supply {{of high quality}} feed, which are cost effective and simple to implement, {{as one of the}} top three issues requiring research and demonstration in the Southland region of New Zealand. This study used a modelling approach to examine the cost effectiveness, exposure to climate-induced risk and major economic drivers of four selected wintering strategies, i. e. (1) grazing a forage brassica crop on support land (Brassica system), (2) grazing pasture on support land (All pasture system), (3) cows fed grass silage, made on the support land, on a loafing pad where effluent is captured (<b>Standoff</b> <b>system),</b> and (4) cows fed grass silage, made on the support land, in a housed facility where effluent is captured (Housed system). The model was driven by virtual climate data generated by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and economic input data from the DairyNZ Economics Group for the 08 / 09 season with a milk price of NZ$ 4. 551 /kg milksolids (fatÂ +Â protein). The Housed system had the highest average (Â± STDEV) operating profit (profit after depreciation but before interest charges) over 35 independently simulated climate years (NZ$ 743 Â Â±Â  122 /ha), followed by All pasture (NZ$ 681 Â Â±Â  197 /ha), Standoff (NZ$ 613 Â Â±Â  135 /ha) and Brassica (NZ$ 599 Â Â±Â  212 /ha). This ranking was sensitive to the assumptions and treatment of capital costs. The Housed system was the least exposed to climate-induced risk with a coefficient of variation of operating profit of 16 % compared to 35 % of the Brassica system. The four systems demonstrated different financial strengths and weaknesses that largely balanced out in the end. The Brassica system is a high risk system from an environmental perspective and the All pasture system an unlikely alternative because of scarcity of suitable land. Both the Housed and Standoff systems appear to be cost effective alternatives that allow high control over cow feeding, body condition and comfort over winter. Furthermore, both systems have the potential to provide high control over the storage and release of animal effluent onto land, thus saving fertiliser costs and reducing environmental footprint.

40|$|The Air Base {{has long}} been a {{potential}} target of attack for enemy planners. An effective way to attack the United States Air Force (USAF) is to avoid its usual dominance in the air and use an asymmetrical approach, attacking air bases with ground forces inserted into the Joint Rear Area. The history of airbase ground attacks from 1942 to 1994, documented in the book Snakes in the Eagles' Nest, shows that the dominant strategy employed by air base attackers has been the standoff attack. Roughly, 75 percent of all airbase attacks have been through the use of rockets or mortar fire from outside the airbase's perimeter defenses. In Vietnam, where the defenses against penetrating ground attacks were emphasized, this percentage rose to 96 percent. Historically, robust main operating bases, with passive defensive measures such as hardened facilities and redundant systems, have been able to withstand standoff attacks. The relative inaccuracy of the attacker's <b>standoff</b> <b>systems</b> and their limited ability to sustain fire on the air base minimized damage. Times have changed and the USAF finds itself operating in an expeditionary mode across the globe. Expeditionary Air Forces cannot depend on the luxury of operating off airfields with the robust infrastructure of main operating bases. In addition, the emergence of man portable, guided munitions for mortars and guided anti-tank missiles has increased the accuracy of potential standoff weapons. Finally, the sophistication of Improvised Explosive Devices in Iraq and of modern radio-controlled model aircraft suggests the potential for attackers to build their own guided standoff weapons. The potential for a "one shot, one kill" standoff weapon is here today, negating the effectiveness of passive hardening measures. Disrupting these attacks will take new strategies. Understanding current Joint and USAF doctrine is the first step. Areas for further study include disrupting the enemy forces before they launch a standoff attack, intercepting the standoff round in flight and mitigating the damage on impact are discussed...|$|R

Samples {{of the highly}} energetic materials (HEMs) 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were deposited on aluminum plates and detected at several source-target distances by carrying out remote infrared spectroscopy (RIRS) measurements on the aluminum substrates in active mode.

40|$|Wintering {{of dairy}} cows on high {{yielding}} forage crops {{is a key}} contributor towards total farm nitrate leaching loses. High stocking density’s, and subsequent excretion of nitrogen- loaded urine, onto bare, saturated soils results in high nitrate leaching rates. Incorporation of standoff facilities into traditional in situ wintering systems has been suggested as a viable approach to mitigating nitrate leaching., but limited quantitative data exists for percentage of urine captured, {{and the performance of}} non-lactating dairy cows wintered under such systems. Two winter systems were compared between June and July 2017 at the Ashley Dene Research and Development Station (ADRDS). Both systems fed fodderbeet (7 KgDM/cow/day fodderbeet, 4 Kg DM/cow/day silage) but in the control system, cows spent 23 hours/day grazing fodderbeet in situ, with a one hour supplement allocation period on a concrete feedpad while the comparison was a <b>standoff</b> pad <b>system,</b> were cows were restricted to a 6 hour fodderbeet allocation period (plus one hour on the feedpad), and spent 17 hours/day on a variety of stand of pad surfaces (stones, sand, woodchip and carpet). To quantify variation in urine deposition between the two systems, PEETER urine sensors were attached to cows and used to measure urination frequency and volume. Urination behavior from eight cows were successfully measured for a period of 24 hours. To compare the suitability of the farms systems from a production perspective, fodderbeet and supplement utilization, cow liveweight, and body condition score were also measured throughout the trial. Results show {{there was no difference in}} dry matter utilization (94. 2 + ± 3. 4 %), and liveweight gain (580 ± 6. 7 gCow/day) between systems. Apparent energy consumption (123 MJME/cow/day) suggested that body condition score gain targets of 0. 5 units would be achievable over a 60 day wintering period. Urination behavior was unaffected by wintering system, with average urination event volumes, urination event frequency’s, and total daily urine volumes of (1. 8 ± 1. 03 l/event), (8. 37 ± 4. 34 events/day) and (15. 12 ± 5. 5 l/cow/day) were recorded. The percentage of total urine captured under the <b>standoff</b> pad <b>system</b> (82 ± 8. 66 %) suggest that the expected quantity captured is reflective of the duration of a stand off period. When compared to a 24 hour in situ system, the capture of 82 % of urine reduced estimated urine coverage from 54. 6 % to 9. 6 % of total paddock area. Based on established leaching values under fodderbeet in stony, Canterbury soil types, this reduction in paddock urine coverage resulted in an estimated reduction in winter nitrate leaching of 31. 4 Kg N/ha or 61. 6 %. It was therefore concluded that stand off pad systems can be effectively used to mitigate winter nitrate leaching whilst maintaining acceptable levels of cow performance...|$|R

In these types of engagements, assumptions of linearity no longer hold and model uncertainties {{in the form of}} unmeasured aerodynamic coefficients and complex non-linear aerodynamics are common. The target filter is an important sub-system of any guidance loop that extimates the required target and engagement information. To improve the performance of this target filter in challenging environments involving manoeuvring target, a fill understanding of any non-linearities present is required. The aim of this report is to investigate the manoeuvring target filtering problem, to examine the importance of mode measurements and to examine a particular filtering approach. A review of existing filtering results is provided before introducing a non-linear filtering approach known as hybrid filtering. Three possible filtering approaches are examined in simulation studies: the extended Kalman filter, the interacting multiple model filter and a new hybrid filtering approach. The simulation studies suggest that mode measurements may improve target filtering performance but the studies do not support the use of the examined hybrid filtering approach. Some refinement of this hybrid filtering approach is required. An improved understanding of filtering techniques is required to aid support of present upgrade programs involving the guidance loops of new air-to-air and <b>standoff</b> missile <b>systems.</b> This understanding is necessary for the support of future weapon procurement upgrade programs...|$|R

Current scenario of globalized civilization threat from terror drives {{the need to improve}} the performance and capabilities of standoff explosive trace detection devices to be able to anticipate the threat from a safe distance to prevent explosions and save human lives. In recent years, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an emerging approach for material or elemental investigations. All the principle elements on the surface are detectable in a single measurement using LIBS and hence, a standoff LIBS based method has been used to remotely detect explosive traces from several to tens of metres distance.

40|$|The {{trend toward}} {{intelligent}} manufacturing has produced {{an increase in}} the need for sensors which can nondestructively evaluate components and processes in real-time. One commonly used nondestructive approach is ultrasonic inspection. The most common method for generating and sensing ultrasound in materials makes use of contacting piezoelectric transducers. A gel or water interface is often used to match the acoustic impedance between the sensor and part. This constraint can impose limitations on their applicability for some types of in-process industrial control or inspection, specifically, inspection of moving parts at elevated temperatures or in vacuum. While noncontact receivers have been made using capacitance or magnetic induction, often their spacing to the workpiece must be maintained within a close tolerance. The lack of a substantial standoff distance for these sensors also reduces their usefulness in some industrial inspection and process control applications. Specifically, contacting schemes and close proximity sensors are not well suited for conditions such as extreme vibrations and fast moving parts with irregular surfaces. Furthermore, it may be more cost effective, from the users perspective, to use a long <b>standoff,</b> remote sensing <b>system</b> which could be applied {{to a wide range of}} materials including metals, semiconductors and composites...|$|R

Consequently, a study of millimeter/submillimeter wave mixers is important for the choice of technology and topology. Aiming for either the next generation of high-speed communication or standoff imaging applications, different mixer topologies are studied, designed and fabricated as candidates for further integration in receivers. The presented mixer topologies include the self-oscillating mixer, the resistive FET mixer, the Gilbert mixer, and the transconductance mixer. All these topologies have been realized in given technologies, and cover the frequencies around ~ 145 GHz, ~ 220 GHz, and ~ 340 GHz.

Full spectra of fluorescein in addition to rhodamine B were obtained from the system collecting photoacoustic and thermal lens data concurrently with comparable results. Calibrations in both the collinear and crossed beam geometry were generated with crossed beam geometry having only a slight decrease in limits of detection but an overall improvement in spatial resolution over collinear geometry, which will be a main advantage of this system in comparison to currently available technologies for <b>standoff</b> detection.

40|$|Directed energy laser {{ablation}} {{at the surface}} of an asteroid or comet produces an ejection plume that will impart a thrust on the asteroid. This thrust can mitigate a threatened collision with the Earth. This technique uses the asteroid itself as the deflection propellant. The DESTAR laser system is designed to produce a sufficiently intense spot {{on the surface of}} an asteroid to accomplish this in one of two operational modes. One is a complete 2 ̆ 2 stand-off 2 ̆ 2 mode where a large space based phased-array laser directed energy system can interdict asteroids at large distances allowing sufficient time to mitigate nearly all known threats. A much smaller version of the same system, called DE-STARLITE, {{can be used in a}} 2 ̆ 2 stand-on 2 ̆ 2 mode by taking a much smaller laser to the asteroid and slowly deflecting it over a sufficiently long period of time. Here we present orbital simulations for a range of near-Earth asteroid impact scenarios for both the <b>standoff</b> and stand-on <b>systems.</b> Simulated orbital parameters include asteroid radius and composition, initial engagement time, total laser-on time and total energy delivered to target. The orbital simulations indicate that, for exposures that are less than an orbital time, the thrust required to divert an asteroid is generally inversely proportional to laser-on time, proportional to target mass and proportional to the desired miss distance. We present a detailed stand-on scenario, consistent with current dedicated mission capabilities, to show the potential for {{laser ablation}} to allow significant deflection of targets with small systems. As one example we analyze a DE-STARLITE mission scenario that is in the same mass and launch envelope as the proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) but using a multi kilowatt class laser array capable of deflecting a 325 m diameter asteroid with 2 N of thrust for 15 years in a small fraction of even the smallest SLS block 1 launch vehicle configuration...|$|R
30|$|Due to many {{advantages}} over single carrier waveforms in radar systems, such as frequency diversity, short {{time on the}} target and agile waveform optimization, multicarrier waveforms have been considered to be amongst the best candidates for radar systems. Reference [6] introduces a generalized multicarrier radar model, and novel multicarrier spread spectrum waveforms are proposed and generated utilizing the derived model. It is shown that such waveform outperforms well-known existing multicarrier waveforms, which can lower the peak to average power ratio. In [7] and [8], it is stated that orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar signals offer a better range and Doppler resolution than other radar signals. Motivated by the recent interest in multicarrier waveforms for radar systems, [9] develops a new mechanism for spectrum sharing between radar and OFDM communication systems, where the authors optimize the OFDM waveforms for radar and communication systems by appropriately allocating the subcarriers based {{on the importance of}} each channel. Bica et al. in [10] propose radar waveform design algorithms in spectrum sharing environments based on two different applications, target characterization and target detection, where the communication signals scattered off the target are considered as interference in the objective functions. The work is further extended in [11] where the communication signals scattered off the target can be exploited at the radar receiver, which significantly improves its target detection performance. In [12], the methods of coexistence between radar and communications systems are studied, where the authors derive achievable bounds on performance for a receiver that observes communications and radar return in the same frequency band. A new spectrum sharing system architecture and set of coexistence mechanisms that mitigate RF interference effects on the exchange of internal state information between radar and communications systems are investigated in [13], which shrink the mimimum required <b>standoff</b> range between <b>systems</b> while sustaining the performance of each system. Overall, the previous studies lay a solid foundation for the problem of spectrum sharing in joint radar and communication systems, and {{it should be noted that}} the target detection performance can be improved by optimizing the radar transmission waveform while guaranteeing the quality of communication links.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the ability}} to perform simultaneous, multi-element and {{real-time}} analysis without pretreatment and doing from a distance, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in standoff mode is now considered a cutting-edge analytical technology. All these features have allowed its application in various fields such as security, environment, cultural heritage protection and space exploration, among the more outstanding. Nonetheless, the fact of working to long distances involves greater difficulties than in a lab-scale. Thus, in a first part of this memory, the behavior of the analytical signal has been assessed. On the other hand, a second part demonstrates the applicability of the technique in standoff mode for solving real-life problems. • Fundamental studies 1. Main causes affecting the uncertainty of the analytical signal in standoff LIBS. One of the most sensitive issues in standoff LIBS is maybe the large variability observed in the analytical response of distant targets. Therefore, in this work, a standoff LIBS sensor has been used to assessment of the laser beam delivering up to a distant target as well as the properties of the light emitted from the plasma induced gathered by the sensor. • Applications standoff LIBS 1. Evaluation of the Cultural Heritage: Malaga Cathedral. Cultural heritage is a valuable source of history and a unique and irreplaceable legacy of our past. While sometimes an artwork can be transported to the laboratory for its analysis, in other cases this option is not feasible. The ease compaction in mobile platforms of LIBS instrumentation for in situ analysis, allows for moving the system sensor to the location of the sample. For first time a <b>standoff</b> LIBS <b>system</b> has been used to characterize and analyze the composition of building materials as well as potential sources of contamination in a historic building on difficult to access areas, since this technology only requires a clear line of sight to the target. I. Location and identification of explosive-contaminated fingerprint. Nowadays, {{it is clear that the}} detection of explosives due to numerous terrorist attacks requires a special attention. LIBS is an attractive technology to anticipating this type of threats. In the present work, the ability of a mobile LIBS sensor to locate and identify fingerprints of explosives residues (DNT, TNT, RDX, PETN and chloratite) on different surfaces (aluminum and glass) from a minimum distance of 30 m has been demonstrated. Chemical distribution maps of the different residues with 100 % effectiveness were developed. However, despite the effectiveness of the technique in the localization and detection of explosives residues, one of the main problems is the identification of products that share a similar elemental composition, and thus a similarity in the analytical response. In this memory have been developed and implemented chemometric algorithms, which are capable of adapting to different working ranges, to distinguish residues of organic explosives of traces of dairy products, such as olive oil, motor oil, hand cream, gasoline, fuel oil, etc. on a metal surface (aluminum). This strategy allows categorize the residues assessed with a 100 % accuracy and error rates below 5 %. II. Forensic studies for the determination of radiological material. Although radioactivity has numerous applications in everyday life, the danger of a radiological dispersal event, either by natural causes or malicious (dirty bombs) is more than evident. Therefore, the detection and identification of explosives as well as their monitoring and quantification from a safe location is demanded. The potential of standoff LIBS to scan, analyze and quickly characterize the radiological contamination in various objects of street furniture has been here evaluated. The results have demonstrated the selectivity and sensitivity of the technology to detect radioactive surrogates such as Co, Ba, Sr, Cs, Ir and U on substrates of aluminum, clay, concrete and glass. It have been also demonstrated the capabilities of the technique for simultaneous and in situ analysis of explosive and radiological evidence in a post-detonation scenario...|$|R
