30|$|The European {{rail freight}} industry, {{developed}} on a domestic focus with powerful incumbent railway undertakings, {{has not yet}} developed the necessary collaborative or integrated approach needed {{for the kind of}} total pan-European transport chain widely practiced by maritime shipping lines, for example. There are various reasons for this, including the fact that the multiple actors in multimodal transport chains have, at times, opposing interests. This, coupled with the high level of entry barriers faced by private new entrants, has failed to generate the development of industrialised, <b>pan‐European</b> <b>services</b> to respond to market needs. Moreover, no modern studies of this market have been conducted to evaluate its evolution, anticipate the needed revolution, or suggest new business models suitable to face the challenges due to, among other things, the protectionist attitude of the incumbents towards their market share. The bundling of the various categories of traffic (bulk, containers), the creation of efficient nodes to de-bottleneck by optimising the use of existing infrastructure, the development of fully interoperable Trans‐European Rail Freight Corridors with a powerful governance platform, and coordination with national infrastructure managers, are all progressing too slowly. Overcoming the patchwork of national safety rules, through powerful action by the European Railway Agency (ERA), is progressively arriving at an urgent need to increase the pace. All of these elements have hindered the introduction of <b>pan-European</b> rail <b>services.</b>|$|R

40|$|Currently, many {{soil erosion}} studies at local, regional, {{national}} or continental scale use models {{based on the}} USLE-family approaches. Applications of these models pay little attention to seasonal changes, despite evidence in the literature which suggests that erosion risk may change rapidly according to intra-annual rainfall figures and vegetation phenology.

30|$|Although the U.S freight {{transport}} system has very different (operational, technical and geographical) conditions, road and rail freight increased from 29.8 % (1239 btkm) and 37.3 % (1554 btkm) respectively, in 1990, to 35.2 % (1929 btkm) and 42.2 % (2309 btkm) by 2009. This {{has been at}} the expense of rail passenger and waterways transport [7]. Experts point out that liberalised (in particular downsized and/or limited federal economic regulation) [8] freight oriented railways [9], including privately owned and operated railways, have helped the United States freight railway industry succeed in gaining higher market share [10, 11]. It {{should be noted that the}} European railways are passenger oriented, originating from government owned and operated national railways with a focus on national priorities (not simply for economic advantage) [11, 12]. Although some incumbents such as DB Schenker or SNCF Fret have become standalone freight operators, and some previously public rail freight operators became wholly private (e.g. English, Welsh and Scottish Railways (EWS) the share of independent private operators is insignificant, not least since many early private companies were subsequently bought out by incumbents looking to compete in new markets, e.g. Rail 4 Chem eventually becoming part of SNCF. The European Commission has adopted and implemented, at various levels, many directives - including three Railway Packages, with ambitions for a fourth - in an attempt to make the European railways more competitive and achieve modal shift targets. The Commission has also funded research initiatives to upgrade and integrate the infrastructure and rolling stock, to achieve <b>pan-European</b> <b>services</b> and improve operational practices [5, 12 – 14].|$|R

We benchmark our knowledge-assisted kriging algorithm against 7 other algorithms on UK met-office wind data (189 sensors). Our wind estimation results are comparable, but not better than ordinary kriging, but the kriging error maps are much sharper and reflect the known spatial features better.
