40|$|Records of {{whale sharks}} in the Caribbean are {{relatively}} sparse. Here we document 24 records of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus Smith 1882) for the Dutch Caribbean, four for the windward islands of <b>Saba,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> <b>and</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Maarten,</b> and twenty {{for the southern}} Caribbean leeward islands of Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire. The results suggest a higher abundance of whale sharks in the southern, leeward part of the Dutch Caribbean, likely associated with seasonal upwelling-driven productivity known for the southeastern Caribbean area. A bimodal seasonal pattern as documented for Venezuela was not as pronounced in our findings for the Leeward Dutch Caribbean and whale sharks were recorded in 9 months of the year. In the Windward Dutch Caribbean all (4) records so far were for the winter months of December-February.

40|$|At least 33 {{native species}} of marine mammals have been {{documented}} from the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR). For many of these species, {{the waters of the}} region serve as primary habitat for critical activities that include feeding, mating and calving. However, relatively little remains known about their biology, life history, distribution and behavior, particularly also around the windward Dutch islands (<b>Saba,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> <b>and</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Maarten).</b> In this study we compiled 84 marine mammal records for the waters of these islands, comprising 9 previously published records and 75 new records. A total of eight distinct species are documented, six of which are cetaceans. In comparison to the leeward Dutch islands (Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire), documented strandings are few. Results suggest that whereas beaked whales and Bryde’s whale are more common around the leeward Dutch islands, humpback whales are more common around the windward Dutch islands. This study concludes that more dedicated efforts are needed to better document and understand cetacean composition, seasonality and use of the both the windward and leeward Dutch Caribbean maritime territories. Such initiatives should help further clarify any potential regional differences as well the underlying causes thereof. Several nations, including the USA, the Dominican Republic and France, have established marine mammal sanctuaries in their Caribbean waters. Declaring the Dutch EEZ as a marine mammal sanctuary would be a valuable contribution to the conservation of marine mammals in the region...|$|E

5|$|While it {{was moving}} little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought {{prolonged}} tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58mph (92km/h) were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4.0 in (102mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 in (43mm) and 1.5 in (41mm) of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported {{in some parts of}} Aruba. In the SSS Islands (<b>Saba,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> <b>and</b> Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76mph (122km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4in (139.4mm). Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.|$|R
40|$|We here {{provide a}} {{synoptic}} overview and preliminary update {{of the marine}} mammals of the Dutch Caribbean EEZ based on 279 cetacean sighting and stranding records. The Dutch Caribbean EEZ is composed of two distinct sectors. One is centered around the leeward Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao (71, 000 km 2) while the other is centered around the windward Dutch islands of <b>Saba,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> <b>and</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Maarten</b> (22, 000 km 2). The previous principal review (of cetaceans) dating from 1998, was based on only 70 records from the leeward sector and confirmed the occurrence of some 13 species for Dutch Kingdom waters. Now, with a 4 -fold increase in number of records, 19 species can be documented for the Dutch Kingdom waters (18 species in the leeward sector and 8 species in the windward sector). The windward sector stands out for its large number of humpback whale sightings (45 % of records) and may form part of its former (or current) calving grounds. This species remains relatively rare in the leeward sector (5 % of records) {{and continues to be}} targeted by aboriginal fishing in its destination wintering grounds to the east, where the relict breeding population is having difficulty to rebound. The species is of growing interest to tourism in the region and urgently needs full protection from all fishing in the southern Caribbean. The leeward EEZ sector further lies down-stream from seasonal upwelling areas off Venezuela that support the largest fishery of the Caribbean. This sector stands out for its high occurrence of beaked whales and the Bryde’s whale. Marine mammal strandings are much more common here (26 % of records) than in the northern sector (3 % of records). Human induced mortalities (first suggested in 1974) and disturbance due to coastal tourism and recreation are key and growing concerns in the southern Dutch EEZ sector. The marine mammal fauna of the Dutch Caribbean is evidently rich and varied but continues to suffer man-induced mortality and disturbance. Several nations, including the USA, the Dominican Republic and France, have recently established marine mammal sanctuaries in Caribbean waters. The Netherlands should consider doing the same...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{waist circumference}} (WC) as a screening tool for obesity in a Caribbean population. To identify risk groups {{with a high}} prevalence of (central) obesity in a Caribbean population, and to evaluate associations between (central) obesity and self-reported hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based study. Subjects: A random sample of adults (18 y or older) was selected from the Population Registries of three islands of the Netherlands Antilles. Response was over 80 %. Complete data were available for 2025 subjects. Intervention: A questionnaire and measurements of weight, height, waist and hip. Main outcome measurement: Central obesity indicator (WC {{greater than or equal}} to 102 cm men, {{greater than or equal to}} 88 cm women). Results: WC was positively associated with age (65 - 74 y vs 18 - 24 y) in men (OR = 7. 7, 95 % CI 3. 4 - 17. 4) and women (OR = 6. 4, 95 % CI 3. 2 - 12. 7). Women with a low education had a higher prevalence of central obesity than women with a high education (OR 0. 5, 95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 7). However, men with a high income had a higher prevalence of a central obesity than men with a low income (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 6). WC was the strongest independent obesity indicator associated with self-reported hypertension (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 0) and diabetes mellitus (OR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 1. 9). Conclusions: The identified risk groups were women aged 55 - 74 y, women with a low educational level and men with a high income. WC appears to be the major obesity indicator associated with hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

40|$|The Caribbean {{islands of}} Bonaire, <b>Saba,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Aruba, Curacao <b>and</b> <b>St.</b> Maarten {{are part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The islands have a rich {{biological}} diversity and a variety of globally threatened ecosystems. These ecosystems are important for their services such as the production of food, coastal protection, tourism attraction, erosion control, medicine, carbon sequestration and climate change resilience, water and air purification and/or retention, and non-material benefits such as heritage and recreational experiences. Robust monitoring indicators are needed to assess ecosystem health in relation to environmental change and socio-economic stressors and exploitation. The Kingdom of the Netherlands has ratified international treaties and conventions, signed regional agreements and implemented national law for the protection of nature and biodiversity in the Dutch Caribbean. These treaties call for reporting on status and trends of biodiversity. Currently considerable effort is being invested in collecting baseline data and local monitoring to support local policy on and management of nature and biodiversity. These activities partially overlap with the demands of treaty reporting requests, but do not provide all the data necessary to satisfy the needs of either the reporting obligations or the local policy and management needs. The main issues are that: • Existing monitoring programmes on the islands do not cover all required biodiversity and nature topics; • Several existing monitoring programmes are based on methods that cannot be used to generate the indicators required. This report concludes that monitoring all the separate species identified would require considerable resources. Monitoring in the Dutch Caribbean cannot be compared to the Netherlands which {{has a long history of}} monitoring the natural environment and many periodic reviews of the efficacy of monitoring techniques. Holistic monitoring of ecosystems using key indicators is a good alternative to detailed monitoring as the ecosystem health implicitly considers all dependent species. However, some additional species monitoring is necessary of keystone species, endangered species, commercially important species and invasive species...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Netherlands Antilles is an {{autonomous}} entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and comprises a federation of five Caribbean islands: Bonaire and Curacao (the Leeward islands) which comprise 80 per {{cent of the}} population of 211, 000 <b>and</b> <b>Saba,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> <b>and</b> the southern part of St. Maarten (the Windward islands). Like the other countries in the Kingdom, it enjoys full autonomy in internal matters as, for example, education, public health, justice and customs. It has a per capita income of about US$ 12, 000. The Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands account for about 75 per cent (Curacao (70 per cent) and Bonaire (5 per cent)) and 25 percent respectively of the economy of the Netherlands Antilles. The Netherlands Antilles has its own currency, the Netherlands guilder, which is pegged to the United States dollar at a fixed rate since 1971. The economy has some unique features that stem from its close relations with the Netherlands, its undiversified nature and heavy dependence on tourism, offshore finance, oil refining and shipping, the high share of trade (exports of goods and services of about 75 per cent of GDP), its geographical characteristics, its common border with the French Republic on St. Maarten, its duty-free access for imports from Aruba, its de facto free trade zone (FTZ), partial dollarization, especially for the Windward Islands, and its highly regulated labor market (1). Adverse economic shocks {{in the last two decades}} affected particularly the offshore financial sector and the oil refinery and, to a lesser extent, tourism. The repeal of withholding taxes in the United States in the 1980 s indirectly caused the collapse of a number of highly profitable offshore financial activities in Curacao, leading to significant drops in government revenue and contributions to foreign exchange earnings. The withdrawal of Shell from Curacao in 1986 and the (temporary) closure of the oil refinery which had been a mainstay of the Curacao economy for almost three quarters of a century was the second major shock. It was subsequently leased to the Venezuelan State Company, Petroleos de Venezuela Sociedad Anonima (PDVSA), which resumed operations and preserved employment. In the 1990 s, the Windward Islands were bit by several devastating hurricanes, which destroyed much of the economic infrastructure on the islands, including about half of the number of available hotel rooms in St Maarten. Further negative shocks were related to the discontinuation of certain trade privileges on European markets for Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), the withdrawal by the Netherlands of certain tax privileges for Dutch pensioners residing in the Netherlands Antilles and disruptions in the availability of Solidarity Fund resources for the smaller islands. National income has been on the decline since 1997. GDP declined by about 6 per cent between 1997 and 1999. Underlying fiscal imbalances and structural weaknesses have also impacted negatively on the economy. In recent years, with recession high unemployment and migration have been experienced (2). The Netherlands Antilles has been able to survive thanks to additional aid from the Netherlands, large-scale spontaneous emigration (mostly to the Netherlands), some drop in international reserves, an increase in domestic debt and arrears and reduced outlays for the maintenance of public assets. From 1986 onwards, successive efforts at restoring macroeconomic balance, particularly with regard to public finance, were made, but were unsuccessful. Adjustment was also attempted in 1996 and 1997, but failed to meet the desired targets. In 1999, the government launched a new National Recovery Plan" (NRP). The NRP contains important medium-term structural adjustment measures aimed at restoring macroeconomic balance and conditions for revitalizing the economy. The NRP subsequently served as an important input into a comprehensive adjustment plan drawn up with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and reflected in the government's Memorandum of Economic Policies dated 15 September 2000. Beyond restoring macroeconomic balance and reforming the economic incentive framework, the government aims at establishing a Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) for the formulation and implementation of a sustainable long-term growth strategy. It is against the above background that this study is undertaken. Its main objective is to assess the integration options facing the Netherlands Antilles (3) vis-a-vis the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). A secondary objective is to examine the above taking into account, inter alia, the level of trade between the Netherlands Antilles and CARICOM, the barriers to trade between the two groups of countries and the requirements for increasing trade between the two groups of countries. The Consultant was given an initial Draft Terms of Reference (Annex 1) with the intention of modifying it in the course of the interviews with all the stakeholders. The main idea that emerged from these interviews was a concern with some possible form of association with CARICOM. The Consultant was asked to exam the costs and benefits of various forms of association and to recommend an option. This adjustment of the Terms of Reference (TOR) was substantial and involved the Consultant having to do some interviews and collect documentation in CARICOM. The study essentially revolves around the search for a road map for the Netherlands Antilles. It is tackled in the first instance by describing the existing system of trade of the Netherlands Antilles with a view to determining the import and export structures and the specific nature and extent of trade in goods and services between the Netherlands Antilles and CARICOM. 1 Netherlands Antilles: Elements of a Strategy for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Growth.
