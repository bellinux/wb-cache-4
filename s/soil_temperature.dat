The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily <b>soil</b> <b>temperature.</b> This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent.

5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four inches wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest with leaves or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E

On the other hand, the Technical Summary of the Fourth Assessment Report of the UNFCC, reflecting a consensus view, indicates a potential Amazon forest loss of between 20 and 80% as a result of climate impacts induced by a temperature increase in the basin of between 2.0 and 3.0degrees Celsius. The IPCC is also indicating a likelihood of major biodiversity extinctions as a consequence. Specifically, according to the Earth Simulator, temperature increases and disruption in precipitation cycles (up to a 90% reduction {{by the end of the}} century) could seriously hamper the workings of the Amazon as a forest ecosystem, reducing its capacity to retain carbon, increasing its <b>soil</b> <b>temperature,</b> and eventually forcing the Amazon through a gradual process of savannization.

40|$|Average {{recommended}} planting {{dates for}} corn in Iowa lie between April 12 and May 18 {{in order to}} achieve 98 - 100 percent yield potential, but this varies a bit on the specific location (Abendroth and Elmore, 2010). Currently, Iowa <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> range from approximately 57 - 63 °F (Iowa Environmental Mesonet, 2013). While these temperatures are often considered good for planting because 50 °F is the temperature necessary for corn seed germination, the weather forecasted is not ideal for a corn seed to germinate and begin emergence. According to NOAA, Story County highs May 2 and 3, 2013, will be in the low 40 s°F with lows in the mid 30 s with potential rain, sleet and snow. Last year, on April 26, Iowa <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> ranged from 58 - 64 °F; however, by April 29 <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> dropped to 49 - 53 °F across the state.

25|$|Colonies {{of the red}} {{imported}} {{fire ant}} have tunneling surfaces that protrude out of the surfaces where workers forage. These areas of protrusion tend to be within their own territory, but greater ant colonisation can affect this. Tunnels are designed to allow effective body, limb and antennae interactions with walls, and a worker can also move exceptionally fast inside them (more than nine bodylengths per second). The holes exit out of any point within the colony's territory, and foraging workers may need to travel half a metre to reach the surface. Assuming the average forager travels 5 m, over 90% of foraging time is inside the tunnels {{during the day and}} rarely at night. Workers forage in soil temperatures reaching 27°C (80°F) and surface temperatures of 12–51°C (53–123°F). Workers exposed to temperatures of 42°C (107°F) are at risk of dying from the heat. The rate of workers foraging drops rapidly by autumn, and they rarely emerge during winter. This {{may be due to the}} effects of <b>soil</b> <b>temperature,</b> and a decreased preference for food sources. These preferences only decrease when brood production is low. In the northern regions of the United States, areas are too cold for the ant to forage, but in other areas such as Florida and Texas, foraging may occur all year round. When it is raining, workers do not forage outside, as exit holes are temporarily blocked, pheromone trails are washed away, and foragers may be physically struck by the rain. The soil's moisture may also affect the foraging behaviour of workers.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{folklore}} {{holds that}} porcini sprout {{up at the}} time of the new moon; research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies. Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn (June to November in the UK), their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in <b>soil</b> <b>temperature.</b> Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes, in what is known in some circles as a [...] "bolete year". A 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat, corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study; removal of the litter layer on the forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production, but previous studies reported contradictory results. A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap (about 21mm or 0.8in) occurred when the relative air humidity was the greatest, and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the air humidity dropped below 40%. Factors most likely to inhibit the appearance of fruit bodies included prolonged drought, inadequate air and soil humidity, sudden decreases of night air temperatures, and the appearance of the first frost. Plots facing north tend to produce more mushrooms compared to equivalent plots facing south.|$|E
500|$|Plants are {{generally}} started in protected locations {{early in the}} growing season before being transplanted outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested. Seedlings typically emerge in about 4–6 days from seeds planted [...] deep at a <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> between [...] Growers normally place plants [...] apart. Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity. Some varieties of cabbage {{have been developed for}} ornamental use; these {{are generally}} called [...] "flowering cabbage". They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink. Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days. Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch. They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade. The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed. Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth. Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include: growth in the compacted soils that result from no-till farming practices, drought, waterlogging, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.|$|E

However, there are still great uncertainties about where microrefugia are located, and the exact role that moisture plays in buffering extreme temperatures. In this study we quantified the effects of moisture on the distribution and variability of near-surface <b>soil</b> and air <b>temperatures.</b> We collected hourly 1 cm soil and 5 cm air temperatures and humidities at 111 sites from May 2011 to March 2012. Sites were diverse in terms of elevation (2 - 1428 m), distance from coast (180 m- 403 km), canopy cover (0 - 100 %), topographic exposure, and susceptibility to cold air drainage. We found that variability (diurnal range) of both <b>soil</b> and air <b>temperatures</b> decreased under moister conditions. While air temperatures were related more strongly to humidity, <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> were related more to vapour pressure deficit (VPD). That is, both high temperature and low humidity were required before the VPD was sufficient to dry out the soil and allow <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> to vary. We then used a regional regression approach to model the spatial distribution of minimum and maximum air and <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> for each day over the 10 months in terms of latitude, elevation, canopy cover, distance to coast, cold air drainage potential, and topographic exposure to the south and northwest. We found that elevation was the dominant factor explaining the distribution of <b>soil</b> and air <b>temperatures</b> under moist conditions. Other factors, such as canopy cover and topographic exposure, had a stronger influence on air temperatures whenever humidity was low. However, these factors only affected <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> at times when higher temperatures combined with low humidity to produce higher VPD. Our results provide new insights into how moisture influences the spatial distribution of near-surface <b>soil</b> and air <b>temperatures.</b> Microrefugia will be more apparent under drier conditions, but climate change may affect refugia for <b>soil</b> and air <b>temperatures</b> differently.
