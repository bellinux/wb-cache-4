2500|$|Warhol was {{an early}} adopter of the <b>silk</b> <b>screen</b> printmaking process as a {{technique}} for making paintings. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his [...] "blotted line" [...] technique, [...] applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas. In his book , Warhol writes, [...] "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>screening</b> {{is a type}} of {{printing}} on paper or textiles, in which an ink is embedded in the cloth. The ink is controlled {{through the use of a}} stencil, which is placed directly over the paper or textile. This process can only handle one colour of ink at a time. Therefore, multi colored designs must be <b>silk</b> <b>screened</b> several times, with each interval taking time to dry.|$|R

2500|$|Stewart {{left school}} at age 15 and worked briefly as a <b>silk</b> <b>screen</b> printer. Spurred on by his father, his {{ambition}} {{was to become}} a professional footballer. In summer 1960, he went for trials at Brentford F.C., a Third Division club at the time. Contrary to some longstanding accounts, Stewart states in his 2012 autobiography that he was never signed to the club and that the club never called him back after his trials. In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, [...] "Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1968, Great Falls High School {{began using}} a logo {{with the word}} [...] "Bison" [...] {{in the form of}} a bison. The logo was {{designed}} by then-student Daniel Clasby. In the fall of 1968, Clasby was lying in bed when the idea for a logo came to him. He spent several hours that night working on it, and then showed it to art teacher Don Walters. Walters heartily approved of it, and so did many of the school's athletes. A <b>silk</b> <b>screen</b> was made, and Clasby and his friends began making posters and T-shirts with the logo on it. The Bison Logo (seen in the infobox) was an immediate hit. In time, the logo was added to the front of the press box in Memorial Stadium, where it still existed as of 2015.|$|E

6000|$|Of course, these hotels vary in {{size and}} magnificence. Some are not larger than our own largest town dwellings, while others, again, are palaces. As these {{buildings}} were originally constructed to lodge a single establishment, they have their principal and their inferior apartments; some have their summer and their winter apartments. As is, and always must be the case, where everything like state and magnificence are affected, the reception-rooms are en suite; the mode of building which prevails in America, being derived from the secondary class of English houses. It is true, that in London, many men of rank, perhaps of the nobility, {{do not live in}} houses any larger, or much better, than the best of our own; though I think, that one oftener sees rooms of a good size and proper elevation, even in these dwellings, than it is usual to see in America. But the great houses of London, such as Burlington-house, Northumberland-house, Devonshire-house, Lansdown-house, Sutherland-house (the most magnificent of all) etc. are, more or less, on the continental plan, though not generally built around courts. This plan eschews passages of all descriptions, except among the private parts of the dwelling. In this respect, an American house is the very opposite of a European house. We are nothing without passages, it being indispensable that every room should open on one; whereas, here the great point is to have as little to do with them as possible. Thus you quit the great staircase by a principal door, and find yourself in an ante-chamber; this communicates with one or two more rooms of the same character, gradually improving in ornaments and fixtures, until you enter a salon. Then comes a succession of apartments, of greater or less magnificence, according to circumstances until you are led entirely round the edifice, quitting it by a door on the great staircase again, opposite to the one by which you entered. In those cases in which there are courts, the principal rooms are ranged in this manner, en suite, on the exterior range, usually looking out on the gardens, while those within them, which look into the court, contain the bed-rooms, boudoir, eating-rooms, and perhaps the library. So tenacious are those, who lay any claim to gentility here, of the use of the ante-chambers, that I scarcely recollect a lodging of any sort, beyond the solitary chamber of some student, without, at least, one. They seem indispensable, and I think rightly, to all ideas of style, or even of comfort. I remember to have seen an amusing instance of the strength of this feeling {{in the case of the}} wife of a former French minister, at Washington. The building she inhabited was one of the ordinary American double houses, as they are called, with a passage through the centre, the stairs in the passage, and a short corridor, to communicate with the bed-rooms above. Off the end of this upper corridor, if, indeed, so short a transverse passage deserves the name, was partitioned a room of some eight feet by ten, as a bed-room. A room adjoining this, was converted into a boudoir and bed-room, for Madame de ----, by means of a <b>silk</b> <b>screen.</b> The usual door of the latter opened, of course, on the passage. In a morning call one day, I was received in the boudoir. Surprised to be carried up stairs on such an occasion, I was still more so to find myself taken through a small room, before I was admitted to the larger. The amount of it all was; that Madame de ----, accustomed to have many rooms, and to think it vulgar to receive in her great drawing-room of a morning, believing au premier, or up one pair of stairs, more genteel than the rez de chaussée, or the ground floor, and feeling the necessity of an ante-chamber as there was an abruptness in being at once admitted into the presence of a lady from a staircase, a sort of local brusquerie, that would suit her cook better than the wife of an envoy extraordinary, had contrived to introduce her guests through the little bed-room, at the end of the upstairs entry! ...|$|E
