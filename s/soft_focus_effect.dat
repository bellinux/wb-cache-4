5000|$|The Idolmaster 2 also {{received}} several graphical improvements over the franchise's previous titles, and its graphical engine received an overhaul {{to facilitate the}} additional processing demand. Gradation {{is added to the}} game's character toon shader, a method which graphics programmer Keiichi Maezawa referred to as [...] "sensitive toon". Maezawa noted that this change made the characters' shadows look more delicate, and believed it addressed concerns from the franchise's artist staffers that the 3D graphics looked cute when the characters are moving but not as still images. Although toon shading is prominently used for the characters, the technique is not applied to the stages in performances. To reduce the sense of discrepancy that this created, bloom and flare effects were added to the stage performances' graphics, in addition to the depth of field and <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>effects</b> previously used in the original Xbox 360 game. Maezawa also pointed to moving and wavering objects in the background, such as palm trees and beating waves, as major additions to stage performances that serve to make the idols more appealing. To create the confetti and steam used in the performances, Maezawa reused the particles engine from DeadStorm Pirates, a video game also released by Bandai Namco Games.|$|R

In 2015 Lensbaby introduced another complete lens, the Velvet 56, a 56mm lens capable of 1:1 macro and, by incorporation intentional spherical aberration, more at larger apertures and less as the lens is closed down, the lens also provides a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

50|$|Effects in {{the film}} were created using the {{substitution}} splice, two multiple exposures, dissolves, and defocusing the lens to create a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>effect.</b> The portrait effect is an early example of a matte effect in filmmaking, in which a mask over the lens ensured that only a specific section of the image in view would be filmed and exposed. Matting {{had been used in}} still photography since the 1850s, when photographers such as Henry Peach Robinson and Oscar Gustave Rejlander used them to compose painting-like scenes. The first filmmaker {{to take advantage of it}} was likely the British cinematic pioneer George Albert Smith (who knew of Méliès through their mutual colleague Charles Urban). Méliès continued to experiment with matting techniques in later films, such as The One Man Band and A Spiritualist Photographer.|$|E
40|$|Electronic version {{excludes}} illustrations {{for which}} permission {{has not been}} granted by the rights holderThe history, practice and aesthetic of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lens in photography is elucidated and developed from its earliest statements of need to the current time with a particular emphasis on {{its role in the}} development of the Pictorialist movement. Using William Crawford's concept of photographic 'syntax', the use of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lens is explored as an example of how technology shapes style. 	A detailed study of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lenses from the earliest forms to the present is presented, enumerating the core properties of pinhole, early experimental and commercial <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lenses. This was researched via published texts in period journals, advertising, private correspondence, interviews, and the lenses themselves. The author conducted a wide range of in-studio experiments with both period and contemporary <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lenses to evaluate their character and distinct features, as well as to validate source material. 	Nodal points of this history and development are explored in the critical debate between the diffuse and sharp photographic image, beginning with the competition between the calotype and daguerreotype. The role of George Davison's The Old Farmstead is presented as well as the invention of the first modern <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lens, the Dallmeyer-Bergheim, and its function in the development of the popular Pictorialist lens, the Pinkham & Smith Semi-Achromatic. The trajectory of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lens is plotted against the Pictorialist movement, noting the correlation betwixt them, and the modern renaissance of <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lenses and the diffuse aesthetic. 	This thesis presents a unique history of photography modeled around the determining character of technology and the interdependency of syntax, style and art...|$|R
50|$|In photography, <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> is a lens flaw, {{in which}} the lens forms images that are blurred due to spherical aberration. A <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> lens {{deliberately}} introduces spherical aberration {{in order to give}} the appearance of blurring the image while retaining sharp edges; it {{is not the same as}} an out-of-focus image, and the effect cannot be achieved simply by defocusing a sharp lens. <b>Soft</b> <b>focus</b> is also the name of the style of photograph produced by such a lens.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> (spherical aberration) is {{sometimes}} a desired effect, particularly in glamour photography where the [...] "gauzy" [...] look may be considered flattering. The Canon EF 135mm 2.8 with Softfocus {{is an example of}} a lens designed with a controllable amount of <b>soft</b> <b>focus.</b>|$|R
50|$|Artists of The West Coast Photographic Movement (also {{known as}} Straight photography) took a {{realistic}} approach to imagery. They created sharp-focus photographs of natural American Western objects and scenery, skillfully composing with subtleties of tone, light and texture. This approach was entirely radical. From 1910 {{to the early}} 1930s, the dominant style was East Coast Pictorialism in which objects were shot with haze and gauze to purposely blur the image for a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>effect.</b> The aim was to mimic Impressionist paintings. With the emerging West Coast Movement, photography no longer imitated painting and developed as a separate art form. The new movement spread in the 1950s as the West Coast artists championed the use of natural environmental forms and clarity of detail—very novel concepts at the time.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1935, the Daily Record, {{which was}} the Official Organ of the Scottish Photographic Federation, {{utilised}} the talent of Andrew Paterson. Writing that his [...] "name is known wherever the camera {{is regarded as a}} serious medium of expression in portraiture," [...] Paterson was brought to the photographic studios of the Daily Record in order to collaborate with their own regular staff and [...] "provide that inspirational note that keeps the newspaper picture pages continually fresh and interesting." [...] It also offered [...] "to make arrangements with prominent citizens who would like to take advantage of Mr Andrew Paterson's presence in Glasgow, to secure a portrait by his always individual hand."One particular technique Paterson used to great effect was virtually new at the time - the soft focus lens, coupled with subtle lighting effects. The <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> <b>effect</b> is used in glamour photography because the effect eliminates blemishes and, in general, produces a dream-like image. Many think of these lenses as merely a way to 'erase wrinkles,' and although very flattering for portraiture, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, soft focus lenses were popular for a number of subjects. A group that called themselves 'Pictorialists' used them {{on a wide range of}} subject matter. They were contemporaries of the Impressionist movement, and the soft focus lenses created a similar feeling in photographs. Paterson married Jean MacKenzie MacLennan in the Station Hotel, Inverness, in March 1901 and they had three children, a daughter Constance and twin boys Hector and Hamish.Paterson outlived his wife by six months and died on the afternoon of 15 December 1948, aged 72 years, at his home Tigh-an-Uillt in Culduthel Road, Inverness.The studio business was carried on by his son Hector G.N. Paterson until his own retirement in 1980.|$|E

50|$|In The Goddess, the cinematographer Hong Weilie humanises and centers {{the protagonist}} through its unique close up scenes and angles that show both Ruan Lingyu’s facial {{expressions}} {{and the larger}} contextual setting. Additionally, Hong uses the characteristic Lianhua <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> to represent strong emotions, specifically for the goddess. Whenever the camera focuses on Ruan Lingyu’s facial expressions, the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> is used to highlight and intensify the anger or pain written there. One of the notable scenes where this <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> is used but in a distinct manner is {{towards the end of}} the film, when the goddess is behind bars.
