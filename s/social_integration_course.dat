40|$|The {{first year}} at {{university}} is a particularly challenging experience which requires quick student’s adjustment to the new academic context by coping with social, academic and administrative demands. Many freshmen struggle with this adjustment and fail or decide to leave higher education, which entail psychological and financial costs. First year experience in higher education has been extensively investigated in the literature and several variables were identified as predictors of academic achievement and retention. Yet, {{the majority of the}} studies focused on single factor analysis, restraining the comprehensive understanding of freshmen adjustment as a global and dynamic process. To overcome this limit, the current study used a longitudinal qualitative design in order to grasp the dynamic complexity of adjustment process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two steps with 17 freshmen from Science department. The aims were to unfold the constructs at play in student’s adjustment process and the dynamic interplay between them over time. The material was analyzed through thematic and sequential analysis. The analyses were grounded into Expectancy-value theory and the Self-system process model. In accordance with theoretical background, preliminary results identified <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> <b>course</b> value, self-efficacy beliefs, cognitive and behavioral engagement as major themes. Moreover, students’ discourse revealed interplay between contextual characteristics (heavy workload, increased academic demands…), self-efficacy beliefs and engagement across the year.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the social justice {{principles}} embedded in California State University (CSU) Educational Administration Preparation Programs. More specifically, this study explored the intended, implemented, and assessed curriculum relative to social justice and critical consciousness, and investigated if differences exist between university instructor demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, employment status, and years of teaching educational administration preparation courses) and the degree of <b>social</b> justice <b>course</b> <b>integration</b> and integration importance. In addition, this study examined the approaches used to align social justice leadership curriculum. _x 000 D_A chronological mixed-methods design was utilized for this study, as descriptive survey research, interviews, and document review were used. Qualitative data from survey short answers and open-ended questions, individual interviews, and document review explained the survey quantitative results in greater detail. The unit of analysis was the curriculum in CSU Educational Administration Preparation Programs. Curriculum included the intended, implemented, and assessed curriculum. Independent variables examined were instructor demographic characteristics and <b>social</b> justice <b>course</b> <b>integration</b> and integration importance. Seventy-one participants responded to the electronic survey, representing 19 of the 21 CSU campuses that offer an educational administration preparation program.

40|$|Among current {{retention}} models, Tinto’s Interactionalist Model {{has reached}} near paradigmatic status. When his {{model has been}} applied to two-year college settings, the <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> results have been inconsistent. This has led Maxwell (2000) and Deil-Amen (2011) to suggest that a different construct of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> exists in community colleges, and that this construct may not be related to the traditional construct of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> in four-year university settings. The current study sought to ascertain whether these two constructs of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> were related. A random sample of two-year college students were asked to complete a survey consisting of questions aimed at assessing both <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> constructs. In addition, since many community colleges serve the dual purpose of educating both occupational and transfer students, this study investigated whether differences existed between these two sub-populations in both the <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> constructs. Furthermore, this study investigated whether each of these two constructs differed when interacting with demographic variables including gender and race. Finally, the influence of age on <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> was studied for both constructs of <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> as well as its potential interaction with program of study (i. e. occupational vs. transfer students). After conducting the analysis, {{it was found that the}} two <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> constructs were highly related. In addition, no significant differences were found between transfer and occupational students on either <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> construct. While significant correlations were found concerning age and <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> they were all small and explained little of the overall variance. As such, the influence of age on <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> was minimal. However, it was found that <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> using Tinto’s construct, does significantly vary by gender, and that <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> using the Maxwell (2000) and Deil-Amen (2011) construct does significantly vary when gender interacts with program of study (i. e. occupational vs. transfer students). Future research strategies including longitudinal analysis, regression analysis, investigation of campus ecology variables, and qualitative techniques were all recommended, as was the necessity of institutional-specific research. ...|$|R

In this contribution we look at the <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> of the four biggest ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands (Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Antilleans). The operationalisation of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> refers to the magnitude of informal contacts the ethnic groups have with autochthonous, Dutch friends.

Crosssectional data collected in 1994 show that Antilleans have the most contacts with the Dutch, then the Surinamese, then the Turkish and finally the Moroccans who have the fewest contacts with the Dutch.

40|$|Voluntary {{organizations}} are generally perceived as important arenas in which <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> can be fostered. There is, however, {{no consensus on}} the meaning of such integration, and the empirical evidence for the claim is lacking. This article studies <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> within voluntary sport organizations, which make up a significant element of civil society in most Western societies. The article provides a theoretical framework well suited for the study of <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> which differentiates members according to their levels of social interaction and emotional bonding across four community types: Strong, pragmatic, mediated, and weak. When applying this framework to the case of Danish sport organizations, the distribution of members among the four community types indicates that, although sport {{organizations are}} important arenas for the development of <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> there is also a large minority of members who do not experience <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> This article shows that both individual characteristics linked to members and organizational characteristics linked to sport organizations exert significant influence on the level and nature of <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> Jointly, the results demonstrate that there are grounds to reassess the general conception that sport organizations are important arenas in which <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> can be fostered...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Low {{levels of}} {{perceived}} <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> or loneliness, {{are associated with}} increased risk {{for a range of}} poor health outcomes.

No studies, however, have examined whether the association between <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and sleep disturbance is consistent with a causal effect after accounting for genes that are common to both variables.   Method: Using twin data ('N' = 905 twin pairs) from the nationally-representative Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey, I evaluated a series of bivariate twin models exploring whether the phenotypic association between low <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and sleep disturbance can be explained by shared genetics. In addition, the current study specified a series of quantitative models for studying gene x environment (G X E) interactions to determine whether the genetic and environmental influences on sleep disturbance differ as a function of <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> Results: The phenotypic association between <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and sleep disturbance was fully accounted for by genes that are common between the two variables, suggesting that within-twin pair differences in <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> do not exert a causal influence on sleep disturbance. <b>Social</b> <b>integration,</b> however, moderated the non-shared environmental influence on sleep disturbances, with the greatest environmental influences observed at the lowest levels of <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that an essential feature of the evolutionary model of loneliness may need refinement or elaboration.

Nevertheless, training-companies and apprentices should be attentive if there is a huge and constant decrease in the assessment of the <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> as these might indicate a negative development which can result in dropping out from apprenticeship (Berweger et al. 2013; Stalder and Schmid, 2016).

Data was gathered using online questionnaires. The student questionnaire included demographics, as well as three scales, academic <b>integration,</b> <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and intention to persist. Academic integration was measured with the subscales of advisor relationship and academic interaction. <b>Social</b> <b>integration</b> was measured with the subscales of peer group support, faculty interactions and involvement in social interactions. The subscales for each scale were combined to create academic <b>integration,</b> <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and socialization scores. The director questionnaire included five questions designed to measure attitudes and design of online programs. Mean scores were formulated from descriptive statistics. Correlation and regression analysis were used to identify scale relationships. ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U and Tukey’s HSD were conducted to identify program differences and to identify attitude and program format differences. A significant positive relationship between academic <b>integration</b> and <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> was identified {{as well as a}} significant positive relationship between academic and <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and intention to persist. Significant differences were found between online and campus students, with campus students being higher on academic and <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> scales, but not on the intention to persist scale.

This study indicates that socialization as explained through academic and <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> is an important factor of persistence in Masters Students, and that there are differences in integration of campus and online students. Strategies to improve socialization and completion include faculty/graduate student interactions and active graduate student clubs and for online students; communication components designed to increase meaningful interactions...|$|R
40|$|We tested whether <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> {{protects against}} memory loss and other {{cognitive}} disorders in late {{life in a}} nationally representative US sam-ple of elderly adults, whether effects were stronger among disadvantaged indi-viduals, and whether earlier cognitive losses explained the association (reverse causation). Methods. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (N= 16638), we examined whether <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> predicted memory change over 6 years. Memory was measured by immediate and delayed recall of a 10 -word list. <b>Social</b> <b>integration</b> was assessed by marital status, volunteer activity, and frequency of contact with children, parents, and neighbors. We examined growth-curve models for the whole sample and within subgroups. Results. The mean memory score declined from 11. 0 in 1998 to 10. 0 in 2004. Higher baseline <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> predicted slower memory decline in fully ad-justed models (P<. 01). Memory among the least integrated declined at twice the rate as among the most integrated. This association was largest for respondents with fewer than 12 years of education. There {{was no evidence of}} reverse causation. Conclusions. Our study provides evidence that <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> delays mem-ory loss among elderly Americans. Future research should focus on identifying the specific aspects of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> most important for preserving memory. (A...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to aid in the {{understanding}} of the influence of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> (SI) in enterprise information systems (EIS) use. Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth case study was carried out, where 40 interviews were collected along with eight informal conversations, five observations, and secondary data from a company with ten years of experience in the management and application of EIS. Informants were EIS users from top management to middle management, different-user departments, the IT department, as well as the IT vendor. Findings: A total of six <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> processes and three <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> mechanisms were identified that help to explain the influences of <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> in EIS use. Research limitations/implications: This research could be further extended to explore other possible <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> processes, enablers or inhibitors which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of EIS usage. Practical implications: By understanding the concept of SI, practitioners should be able to provide appropriate effort, attention and action which could evolve in the process to optimize productivity and efficiency of EIS use. Originality/value: The theoretical contribution of this paper is the development of a coherent conceptual <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> (SI) framework to connect the interrelationships among the three social capital dimensions proposed by Nahapiet and Ghoshal...|$|R
