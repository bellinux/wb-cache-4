40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{checking}} and enforcing multi-contact stability based on the Zero-tilting Moment Point (ZMP). The key to our development is the generalization of ZMP <b>support</b> <b>areas</b> {{to take into account}} (a) frictional constraints and (b) multiple non-coplanar contacts. We introduce and investigate two kinds of ZMP <b>support</b> <b>areas.</b> First, we characterize and provide a fast geometric construction for the <b>support</b> <b>area</b> generated by valid contact forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the full <b>support</b> <b>area.</b> Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots using the Linear Pendulum Mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM induce a shrinking of the <b>support</b> <b>area,</b> even for walking on horizontal floors. We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call pendular <b>support</b> <b>area.</b> We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the pendular <b>support</b> <b>area</b> is a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible multi-contact motions where an HRP- 4 humanoid locomotes in challenging multi-contact scenarios.

3000|$|It {{is clear}} from (7) that {{broadening}} of the wavenumber domain <b>support</b> <b>area</b> {{can be achieved by}} exploiting the frequency diversity (due to bandwidth B) and the space diversity (due to accumulative angle Δθ). Therefore, to increase the size of the wavenumber domain <b>support</b> <b>area,</b> a direct way is to select the illuminators with a high signal bandwidth and/or to increase the coherent accumulative angle of the receiver. We also observe from (7) that the carrier frequency of transmitted signal and the bi-static angle also affect the size of <b>support</b> <b>area.</b> A higher carrier frequency results in a larger <b>support</b> <b>area,</b> provided that the bi-static angles remain the same. That is, whenever possible, it is desirable to choose the illuminators which are operated in higher carrier frequencies. In addition, a small bi-static angle will result in a large <b>support</b> <b>area.</b> In the extreme case, the <b>support</b> <b>area</b> achieves its maximum value in the mono-static case, i.e., when the bi-static angle is zero, whereas it reaches its minimum value when the bi-static angle is 180 ° (θ [...]...|$|R

One of such alternatives is to use externally bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) to provide reinforcement.|$|E

Differently from previous approaches that deal only with the balance of static posture, we {{solve the problem of}} balancing a dynamic motion. We achieve dynamic balance by analyzing and controlling the trajectory of the zero moment point (ZMP). Our algorithm consists of three steps. First, it analyzes the ZMP trajectory to find out the duration in which dynamic balance is violated. Dynamic imbalance is identified by the ZMP trajectory segments lying out of the <b>supporting</b> <b>area.</b> Next, the algorithm modifies the ZMP trajectory by projecting it into the <b>supporting</b> <b>area.</b> Finally, it generates the balanced motion that satisfies the new ZMP constraint.
