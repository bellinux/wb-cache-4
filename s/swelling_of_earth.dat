40|$|Grout {{injection}} is {{a technique}} commonly used in the repair and strengthening of masonry, due to the simplicity in its execution. However, to design a suitable grout, a proper methodology must be followed. The grout must accomplish requirements that depend mainly on mechanical behaviour and durability features of the struc-tures. Grouting can be also applied to earthen structures, for repairing cracks and filling voids. The same methodology {{can be used to}} design grouts, but the requirements must be adapted. Therefore, this paper pre-sents a discussion concerning the repair and strengthening <b>of</b> masonry and <b>earth</b> constructions through grout injection. To emphasize the differences in the requirements, first a short characterization <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> as a building material is given. Subsequently, the main decay phenomena are identified. Finally, attention goes to the effect <b>of</b> shrinkage and <b>swelling</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and the design of an appropriate grout for injection.

Sailing in December, 1499, {{he passed the}} Canary and Cape Verde Islands, standing southwest until he {{lost sight of the}} polar star. Here he encountered a terrible storm, and was exceedingly perplexed and confounded by the new aspect of the heavens. Nothing was yet known of the southern hemisphere, nor of the beautiful constellation of the cross, which in those regions has since supplied to mariners the place of the north star. The voyagers had expected to find at the south pole a star correspondent to that of the north. They were dismayed at beholding no guide of the kind, and thought there must be some prominent <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>earth,</b> which hid the pole from their view. [94] ...|$|R

Fracture fluids should be selected to minimize the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> clay. The use of 2  % KCl in water-based fluids and other chemicals can prevent clay swelling.|$|R

40|$|The {{decline in}} {{isometric}} force, <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> sarcoplasmic reticulum {{and loss of}} desmin was measured in semimembranosus lateralis muscle of male Wistar rats immediately after a short series of brief (500 ms) maximal isometric contractions. For the active muscle, the series ended below (protocol A) and just over muscle optimum length (protocol AA). In one protocol, the muscle remained passive and was extended to lengths just over muscle optimum length (protocol P). After all experimental protocols, no loss of desmin was observed and sarcomere appearance was normal. Protocol A produced <b>swelling</b> (87 %) <b>of</b> the sarcoplasmic reticulum but no decline in isometric force. Protocol AA produced larger <b>swelling</b> (147 %) <b>of</b> the sarcoplasmic reticulum and an isometric force decline (< 49 %) at short muscle lengths. <b>Swelling</b> <b>of</b> sarcoplasmic reticulum was observed mainly in the periphery of muscle fibres. Protocol P {{did not result in}} <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the sarcoplasmic reticulum and isometric force decline.

40|$|Samples of {{pinewood}} (Pinus Sylvestris) were swelled in ternary {{mixtures of}} ethanol – acetone – water. The tangential, radial and longitudinal swelling was measured and volumetric <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> oven-dried samples was determined. Anomalous properties of binary and ternary liquid systems have cardinal influence on <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> wood. <b>Swelling</b> in solutions was multiplied applying the same samples {{and a new}} solution with the same concentrations.

The values for re-swelling in new solutions were up to two times higher when the same solutions were used. Re-swelling resulted in gradual damping in swelling values. The SEM analysis showed that multiple <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> wood in water causes decrease in the elasticity of the wood matter.
