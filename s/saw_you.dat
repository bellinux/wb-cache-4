5|$|As a freelancer, Langan {{developed}} {{three more}} episodes of I <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> for Granada. Her only other project was producing David Nicholls' romantic comedy series Rescue Me with Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC One. As well as producing it, {{she made her}} credited directorial debut on the final episode. The six-part series, starring Sally Phillips, was broadcast in 2002. It was not a ratings success, and the BBC did not commission a second series.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Ripley {{was cast}} in her {{breakthrough}} role of Jenny Gifford in the ITV series Cold Feet. Initially a supporting role in the pilot episode, Ripley's character was expanded when a series was commissioned in 1998. She stayed with the show for three full series before leaving to take more varied roles and {{to spend more time}} with her family. She returned for a guest appearance in the fifth series. After leaving Cold Feet, Ripley played a succession of leading roles in comedies and dramas including Green-Eyed Monster (2001), I <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> (2002), The Stretford Wives (2002), and Dead Gorgeous (2002). Each role won her critical acclaim. In 2006, she filmed a leading role in the ITV drama Bon Voyage, before taking time away from acting after the birth of her second child. Ripley returned to television in 2009, starring as human resources manager Christine Frances in the ITV comedy drama Monday Monday, and Nicola Perrin alongside Martin Clunes in BBC One's Reggie Perrin.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Ripley {{appeared}} in the British dogme film The Announcement, as well as playing lead female character Grace Bingley—opposite Paul Rhys—in the Granada television pilot I <b>Saw</b> <b>You,</b> which used {{many of the same}} production staff as Cold Feet. David Belcher of The Herald called Ripley [...] "perfectly scatty, tousled and self-sufficient" [...] in the role, and Joe Joseph of The Times complimented her comic timing. Ripley returned to I <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> for a three-episode miniseries in 2002. She considers I <b>Saw</b> <b>You,</b> in which she acted alongside her husband Daniel Lapaine, the television show she is most proud to have worked on.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Langan {{was made}} an {{executive}} producer in the department. She oversaw several productions, including Passion Killers (1999, starring Ben Miller), Safe as Houses (2000, starring Ricky Tomlinson), {{and the pilot}} episode of David Nicholls' I <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> (2000, starring Paul Rhys and Fay Ripley). In 2000, Langan was offered a position at the BBC's drama department, which had been rearranged that year. The trade magazine Broadcast reported the BBC had made a [...] "substantial offer" [...] to her. Granada's director of programmes Grant Mansfield countered the BBC's bid by offering Langan the position of deputy controller of drama, operating under Andy Harries, who had recently been appointed controller of the same department. Langan accepted neither offer, and instead became a freelance producer after her contract with Granada expired.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2007 {{while walking}} in Boston Common, Simon Glik {{observed}} an arrest by Boston police officers John Cunniffe, Peter Savalis, and Jerome Hall-Brewster. Glik began recording the arrest after {{he heard a}} bystander say [...] "ou are hurting him, stop". Because Glik was concerned that the officers were using excessive force, he filmed the encounter with his cell phone. Although Glik was 10 feet away and was not interfering with the arrest, {{one of the officers}} turned to him after placing handcuffs on the suspect and said [...] "I think you have taken enough pictures". Glik replied that he was recording the incident; he said, [...] "I am recording this. I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> punch him". When the officer determined that this included audio, he placed Glik under arrest for violating the Massachusetts wiretapping law.|$|E

500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You <b>Saw,</b> <b>You</b> Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records. Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again {{more than anything in the}} world. I think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E
500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protégé, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956." [...] Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and [...] " [...] of pre-feminist [...]" [...] For example, volume 78 in the series Update on Crime (1992) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, [...] "Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?" [...] Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: [...] "'I <b>saw</b> ... <b>You</b> don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni doesn't turn me on!... Won't you please let me explain.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because {{of a man who}} has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't know about you then, till I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E

500|$|Williams and Barlow {{performed}} [...] "Shame" [...] for {{the first}} time on 12 September 2010 at the Help for Heroes concert held in London. On 2 October the duo sang the song at the series eight of the Strictly Come Dancing. A Metro newspaper critic reviewed the performance and wrote, [...] "the pair, wearing matching black suits, spent much of the early stages of their performance sitting on stools and gazing into each other’s eyes as they sung the duet." [...] On 7 October, Williams and Barlow were chatting at the BBC Radio 1 where they gave a performance of the song. The singers were guests at the Paul O'Grady Live chat show and also performed the single on 8 October. Three days after, on 11 October, they gave a rendition of the track on the morning television programme, Daybreak. On 18 November the pair performed the song on the German reality TV programme, [...] Barlow included [...] "Shame" [...] on the set list of his 2014 tour, Since I <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> Last, where he performed a solo acoustic version of the song.|$|E

Wishing to discover what else John knew and prevent any further visions from occurring, Olivia insists on returning to Walter’s sensory deprivation tank. Inside the tank, Olivia sees a memory of John in a restaurant. Despite Walter's vehement protest that it is impossible, Olivia is convinced that John Scott saw her. Afterward, she sees John meeting with Mark and two other unidentified men. After Mark and another man leave, John kills the other man. Olivia believes the group were looking to sell the compound as a street drug, and she's able {{to track down the}} other man, George Morales (Yul Vazquez). Once apprehended, he denies killing Mark and demands immunity and protection from Massive Dynamic, who he believes was responsible for Mark's death as well as other recent fringe events. Olivia confronts Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) about her suspicions, but George is murdered before he can be of further help to them. Later that night, Olivia gets another email from John Scott simply saying, [...] "I <b>SAW</b> <b>YOU.</b> IN THE RESTAURANT." ...|$|E
500|$|Oberman has {{described}} her {{time on the}} show as [...] "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers [...] "must have been on crack", adding how [...] "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying [...] "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> kill Den.' I don't agree with censorship {{but there has to}} be a level of responsibility." ...|$|E

500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E
