One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. <b>Should</b> <b>anyone</b> die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|Dr Legg was {{conveyed}} as a {{man that}} was trusted within the community. A traditional GP with roots in the East End, who had a genuine concern for his loyal patients and the area. The majority of his storylines concerned other characters' problems (where he {{was seen as the}} first port of call <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> need advice or fall ill), or they related to his own professional conduct. His personal life was largely kept hidden from viewers, although he would occasionally reminisce about his and Albert Square's history, mainly with other characters supposedly born in the area, such as Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and later Benny Bloom (Arnold Yarrow). The character was also featured within a series of spin-off EastEnders novels by Hugh Miller, set prior to 1985. Within the novelisation entitled , readers were made privy to the character's history as a trainee doctor during World War II, and his blossoming relationship with his would be wife, Judith.|$|E
500|$|Art and {{inscriptions}} may not {{be confined}} to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example, a Greek inscription on a stele (from Itanos) has been translated as:"Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. <b>Should</b> <b>anyone</b> wish to know: off ‘the little pig’ and the stele the sun turns." [...] From Mesoamerica come Mayan and Aztec codices. These are folding books made from Amatl, processed tree bark on which are glyphs in Mayan or Aztec script. The Dresden codex contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.|$|E

The Smoking Man lies {{to the rest of the}} Syndicate, telling them that Scully's would-be assassin was killed in the car bombing and that the tape has been destroyed with him. Mulder and Scully return to Klemper's greenhouse, finding the Well Manicured Man there. He admits to knowing Mulder's father and states that he helped gather genetic data for post-apocalyptic identification, data Klemper used to work on alien-human hybrids.

500|$|One concern {{addressed}} by Hazlitt is the assertion by previous critics that Macbeth {{is little more}} than a crude and violent amalgam of extremes filled with [...] "Gothic" [...] barbarisms. Hazlitt notes, however, that <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> think Macbeth's character is so composed of contradictory extremes as to be implausible, it is, rather, the circumstances and the passions in conflict that provide the extremes, while Macbeth's character retains a strong underlying unity throughout. [...] "Macbeth in Shakespear no more loses his identity of character in the fluctuations of fortune or the storm of passions than Macbeth in himself would have lost the identity of his person." [...] Kinnaird notes that here, as if anticipating it by a century, Hazlitt argues against the view advanced by Elmer Edgar Stoll in 1933, that Macbeth's character is too full of contradictions to be plausible.|$|E
500|$|Before {{giving his}} decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> ever take his {{daughter}} by force, {{all those who}} had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To this all the suitors readily agreed, each believing {{that he would be}} given Helen's hand. At this point the Catalogue of Suitors has come to a close, but even as Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces Achilles because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close. With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, [...] "for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human on earth would have defeated him". But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore Hermione to him.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{improved with}} the third episode; writing in New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised Episode 3 as being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce", and commented positively on Ripley's and Nesbitt's acting. Billen compared the production and fantasy scenes with Thirtysomething and Ally McBeal. In the Evening Standard, following the conclusion of Vanity Fair and prior to the broadcast of Episode 6, Billen wrote, [...] "The style is light, the narrative frequently inconsequential. The men go to the pub and lust after the barmaid. The women meet in the wine bar and make fun of the men for lusting after the barmaid. The great settings are DIY stores, antenatal classes and sitting rooms. Why <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> be interested? If domestic trivia has now been outlawed by the BBC as a subject for sitcoms and if even soap operas rely on murders and armed sieges to keep up their figures, why should the travails {{of a set of}} ex-dinkies have become a minor cult?" [...] He analysed the series in relation to its early-middle-aged viewers being [...] "a forgotten people", comparing the storylines to real-life issues experienced by friends. He concluded: ...|$|E

X-Play claimed {{that it was}} a [...] "pleasure to play", and praised its [...] "beautiful" [...] graphics and audio. The game satisfied IGN, which appreciated the lengthy minimum of 10 to 12 hours of playtime required to complete the game, further hailing it as an [...] "outstanding achievement on the Game Boy Advance". GamesRadar and GamePro, however, felt that the game was [...] "a little short", but still [...] "love every minute of it", finding the hidden secrets and new power-ups [...] "sublimely ingenious". The sentiment was shared with GameSpot, which was disappointed that the game ended so soon, but still stated, [...] "Metroid fans should absolutely get it, as <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> willing to trade off some quantity for some serious quality in their gaming time." [...] Metroid Fusion received several accolades. It was named Handheld Game of the Year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards. The game was also chosen as Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game by IGN and Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance by GameSpot.|$|E

2500|$|For Austin, [...] "doing things" [...] {{with words}} means, first and foremost, {{deploying}} illocutionary force. The secret {{of this is}} community participation or collusion. There must be a 'correct' (conventionally agreed) procedure, and all those concerned must accept {{that it has been}} properly followed. [...] In the case of a priest declaring a couple to be man and wife, his words will have illocutionary force only if he is properly authorised and only if the ceremony is properly conducted, using words deemed appropriate to the occasion. Austin points out that <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> [...] attempt to baptize a penguin, the act would be null and void.

2500|$|The first {{element is}} a {{fountain}} {{in the shape}} of a five-pointed star, [...] in height and set on the northern end of the site. The fountain is clad in a nearly black granite known as St. John's Black. Water in the basin overflows the sides of the fountain, and is collected in a small trough at the base of the structure. In the center of the fountain is an eternal flame. Jets below the surface of the water generate bubbles of natural gas, which rise to the surface. Two igniters, hidden among five decorative stones which just break the surface, ignite the gas, which rises to a flame about [...] high (although this varies due to weather). Sensors monitor the flame to ensure a smooth flow of gas and that the igniters function properly. Pressure sensors in the basin automatically stop the flow of gas <b>should</b> <b>anyone</b> attempt to climb into the fountain. The system is monitored and controlled remotely via the Internet, allowing both the operator (the National Park Service) and the fabricator (Technifex) to operate the system. The fountain is designed to remain filled but not overflow during winter months.|$|E
