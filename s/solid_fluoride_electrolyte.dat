Assessing the fluoride solid electrolyte’s electrochemical stability and its conduction properties in a mixture with carbon, {{as well as the}} possible interaction of fluoride-ion with carbon both during the electrode preparation and upon electrochemical reactions, are mandatory to enable future practical applications. Here, we discuss these points using LaF 3 doped with BaF 2 (La 0. 95 Ba 0. 05 F 2. 95, LBF) as a benchmark <b>solid</b> <b>fluoride</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> We establish that lithium may be used as a pseudo-reference electrode to assess the electrochemical stability window of LBF and support the experiment with thermodynamic calculations. We demonstrate the chemical compatibility of LBF with carbon upon ball-milling, and investigate the electrical conductivity of the formed LBF-C composite. We use a LBF|LBF-C|LBF cell (in this configuration, LBF serves as electronically blocking electrode) to assess the ionic conductivity of the LBF-C composite. The results confirm that both electronic and ionic percolations are insured within the LBF-C composite despite a noticeable decrease of the ionic conductivity. Finally, we use a Li|LBF|LBF-C cell to evaluate the electrochemical fluorination of the carbon in the LBF-C composite. Our results suggest an electrochemical activity of carbon with fluoride ions.

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the use of {{dispersed}} solid electrolytes and auxiliary electrodes in galvanic cells have increased the need for assessment of materials compatibility. In the design of dispersed solid electrolytes, the potential reactions between the dispersoid and the matrix must be considered. In galvanic cells, possible interactions between the dispersoid and the electrode materials must also be considered in addition to ion exchange between the matrix and the electrode. When auxiliary electrodes, which convert the chemical potential of a component present at the electrode into an equivalent chemical potential of the neutral form of the migrating species in the solid electrolyte are employed, displacement reactions between phases in contact may limit the range of applicability of the cell.
