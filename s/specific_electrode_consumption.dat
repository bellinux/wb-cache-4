40|$|International audienceDuring two-phaseelectrolysis for aluminium, {{hydrogen}} or fluorine industrial production, {{there are}} bubbles which are created at electrodes which imply a quite important electrical properties and electrochemical processes disturbance. Bubbles are motion {{sources for the}} electrolysis cell flow, and then hydrodynamic properties are strongly coupled with species transport and electrical performances. Bubbles presence modifies these global and local properties: the electrolysis cell and the current density distribution are modified. This disturbance {{can lead to the}} modification of the local current density and to anode effects for example. There is few works concerning the local modelling of electrochemical processes during a two-phaseelectrolysis process due to the difficulty of measurements in such electrolytes. Produced bubbles involve a great hydrodynamic acceleration at the electrode interface which leads to great chemical composition modification and, sometimes, also the mechanical the <b>electrode</b> <b>consumption</b> due to both erosion and flow accelerated corrosion. Nevertheless, effects like the anode effect, particularly expensive on the point of the process efficiency, should need a better understanding.
