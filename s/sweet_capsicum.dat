A capsicum variety has to be with high yield, to have quality and adaptability according to the ecological conditions of the region.

National committee verified two capsicum cultivars on year 2002 nd as the product of this work One of them is the cultivar Julija; <b>sweet</b> <b>capsicum</b> with long fruits and the other is the cultivar Mina, chilly pepper. Variety Julija (known as L-ZA- 10) were analyzing during two years on the three different locations (Novi Sad, Smederevska Palanka and Zajecar). Yield of the variety was on the level of standard - Župska rana and Gold medal. Julija always had a higher level of the yield than other varieties which were researched, especially in conditions of extremely high level of temperature and base air humidity. Variety Mina (known as L-ZA- 1) was early maturing variety with higher yield and higher tolerance to plant diseases and vermins than standard variety Yellow hot chilli pepper. ...|$|E

Solanum americanum (Black nightshade) is a common weed in Brazil and samples showing mosaic were collected from sweet pepper crops to verify the presence of viruses.

The field-grown sweet pepper crop presents several challenges for robotic systems such as {{the high degree of}} occlusion {{and the fact that the}} crop can have a similar colour to the background (green on green). To overcome these issues, we propose a two-stage system that performs per-pixel segmentation followed by region detection. The output of the segmentation is used to search for highly probable regions and declares these to be sweet pepper. We propose the novel use of the local binary pattern (LBP) to perform crop segmentation. This feature improves the accuracy of crop segmentation from an AUC of 0. 10, for previously proposed features, to 0. 56.

40|$|The {{aetiology}} of {{a disease}} characterized by severe leaf curling and leaf distortion symptoms in peppers was studied in Burkina Faso. Surveys were conducted in fields planted with <b>sweet</b> pepper (<b>Capsicum</b> annuum) and hot pepper (Capsicum frutescens) to collect leaf samples and assess disease incidence. Collected samples were analyzed using biological tests (mechanical inoculation and whitefly transmission), triple-antibody-sandwich- enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis. Mechanical inoculation tests were negative while transmission by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci led to infection rates of more than 80 %. TAS-ELISA and PCR tests indicated that symptoms observed were associated with begomovirus infections. Involved virus isolates showed pairwise nucleotide identity of more than 99 % with Pepper yellow vein mali virus (PepYVMV) and formed with this virus a distinct clade in phylogenetic analyses. Altogether, these results indicated that PepYVMV was the causal agent of leaf curling symptoms in peppers...|$|R

30|$|The <b>sweet</b> pepper, <b>Capsicum</b> annuum L., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops. In Egypt, it is cultivated for local consumption and exportation (El-Laithy et al. 2013). It covers a production area of about a quarter million m 2 in greenhouses and yielded 9993  tons in 2013 (Heikal and Ebrahim 2013). The two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is a ubiquitous and economically important agricultural pest feeding on a wide range of host plant species (Xie et al. 2006). Probably, the most important pest species in the family is Tetranychidae (Tehri et al. 2014) and it is known to attack about 1200 species of plants. The economic threshold for spider mites was estimated as three or more motile forms per leaf (Warabieda 2015). Under favorable conditions, spider mites can rapidly build up to very large populations where they are characterized by a high reproductive capacity, causing important economic damage and yield losses close to 90 % (Ginette et al. 2014).|$|R

The metabolites contributing predominantly to such differentiation were sugars and organic and fatty acids. Also a partial separation according to the geographical origin was obtained always by analyzing the NMR data with PLS-DA. Some of the discriminating molecules are peculiar for pepper and contribute to define the overall commercial and organoleptic quality so that HRMAS-NMR proved to be a complementary analysis to standard tools used in food science and, in principle, can be applied to any foodstuff...|$|R

40|$|Aims Our aim was {{to study}} effects of salt stress and high {{irradiance}} on photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII) and I (PSI) in leaves of <b>sweet</b> pepper (<b>Capsicum</b> annuum). Methods We used the chlorophyll a fluorescence technique and the JIP-test to study the responses of sweet pepper leaves to salt stress with different NaCl concentrations and under high irradiance (1 000 μmol·m– 2 ·s– 1). Important findings The chlorophyll a fluorescence induction curves changed greatly as induced by NaCl stress under high irradiance, and photoinhibition of PSII was aggravated with apparent effects on PSII reaction centers and the acceptor side. Also, the donor side of PSII was damaged by high NaCl concentration under high irradiance. Additionally, the activity of PSI reaction centers (P 700 +) was inhibited by NaCl stress under high irradiance. Therefore, NaCl stress could aggravate photoinhibition of sweet pepper photosystem under high irradiance, and photoinhibition was greater with higher NaCl concentration. However, PSI photoinhibition was less than PSIIphotoinhibition. Additionally, high NaCl concentration could induce both damage to PSII donor sides and PSI...|$|R

Compost treatments positively affected fruit antioxidant compounds of pepper (antioxidant activity, total phenolic and carbohydrate content). But, no significant difference was found in total flavonoid content between compost and control treatments. The highest antioxidant activity and carbohydrate content were obtained in plants treated with 10 ton ha- 1 of compost. Fruit quality factors (pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and fruit firmness) were influenced by compost treatments.
