30|$|We used {{nanoparticle}} {{concentrations of}} up to 200 mg/kg soil dry mass (dm) for dry spiking, and concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/L for wet spiking dispersions, resulting in soil concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/kg dm. The maximum concentrations used for wet spiking were limited by the maximum water holding capacity (WHCmax) of the soil and by the maximum concentrations suitable for the stock dispersions. The WHCmax limits {{the maximum amount of}} water that can be added to achieve a water content suitable for ecotoxicological testing. Dispersions with nanoparticle concentrations higher than the maximum 200 mg/L we used were considered unsuitable because this resulted in immediate sedimentation, reflecting the formation of large agglomerates. We investigated the effects of wet and dry spiking with soil as the carrier in tests using plants, earthworms and microbes (nitrogen transformation). We also compared dry spiking with soil and silica <b>sand</b> <b>carriers</b> by considering the potential ammonium oxidation activity.|$|R

Ferric salt {{modified}} sands {{were prepared}} with quartz <b>sand</b> as a <b>carrier</b> and ferric salt coating {{by the two}} methods of repeat high-temperature process and repeat alkaline deposition process. The specific surface area of two ferric salt modified sands were detected, and their Pb 2 + adsorption capability in different conditions were also described in this paper. The {{results showed that the}} specific surface area of ferric chloride and ferric nitrate modified sand was 2. 468 m 2 /g and 4. 247 m 2 /g respectively, which was 6. 910 and 12. 612 times more than that of raw quartz sand. In the neutral pH condition, the removal efficiency of Pb 2 + by raw quartz sands was approximately 37 %, in contrast, the removal efficiency reached 85 % by ferric nitrate modified sand and over 90 % by ferric chloride modified sand, and it was much higher than that of raw quartz sand...|$|R
40|$|A Eulerian-Eulerian CFD {{model was}} used to {{investigate}} the fast pyrolysis of biomass in a downer reactor equipped with a novel gas-solid separation mechanism. The highly endothermic pyrolysis reaction {{was assumed to be}} entirely driven by an inert solid heat <b>carrier</b> (<b>sand).</b> A one-step global pyrolysis reaction, along with the equations describing the biomass drying and heat transfer, was implemented in the hydrodynamic model presented in part I of this study (Fuel Processing Technology, V 126, 366 - 382). The predictions of the gas-solid separation efficiency, temperature distribution, residence time and the pyrolysis product yield are presented and discussed. For the operating conditions considered, the devolatilisation efficiency was found to be above 60 % and the yield composition in mass fraction was 56. 85 % bio-oil, 37. 87 % bio-char and 5. 28 % non-condensable gas (NCG). This has been found to agree reasonably well with recent relevant published experimental data. The novel gas-solid separation mechanism allowed achieving greater than 99. 9 % separation efficiency and < 2 s pyrolysis gas residence time. The model {{has been found to be}} robust and fast in terms of computational time, thus has the great potential to aid in future design and optimisation of the biomass fast pyrolysis process...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{has found}} great {{acceptance}} among the engineering {{community as a}} tool for research and design of processes that are practically difficult or expensive to study experimentally. One of these processes is the biomass gasification in a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB). Biomass gasification is the thermo-chemical conversion of biomass at a high temperature and a controlled oxygen amount into fuel gas, also sometime referred to as syngas. Circulating fluidized bed is a type of reactor in which it is possible to maintain a stable and continuous circulation of solids in a gas-solid system. The main objectives of this thesis are four folds: (i) Develop a three-dimensional predictive model of biomass gasification in a CFB riser using advanced Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) (ii) Experimentally validate the developed hydrodynamic model using conventional and advanced measuring techniques (iii) Study the complex hydrodynamics, heat transfer and reaction kinetics through modelling and simulation (iv) Study the CFB gasifier performance through parametric analysis and identify the optimum operating condition to maximize the product gas quality. Two different and complimentary experimental techniques were used to validate the hydrodynamic model, namely pressure measurement and particle tracking. The pressure measurement is a very common and widely used technique in fluidized bed studies, while, particle tracking using PEPT, which was originally developed for medical imaging, is a relatively new technique in the engineering field. It is relatively expensive and only available at few research centres around the world. This study started with a simple poly-dispersed single solid phase then moved to binary solid phases. The single solid phase was used for primary validations and eliminating unnecessary options and steps in building the hydrodynamic model. Then the outcomes from the primary validations were applied to the secondary validations of the binary mixture to avoid time consuming computations. Studies on binary solid mixture hydrodynamics is rarely reported in the literature. In this study the binary solid mixture was modelled and validated using experimental data from the both techniques mentioned above. Good agreement was achieved with the both techniques. According to the general gasification steps the developed model has been separated into three main gasification stages; drying, devolatilization and tar cracking, and partial combustion and gasification. The drying was modelled as a mass transfer from the solid phase to the gas phase. The devolatilization and tar cracking model consist of two steps; the devolatilization of the biomass which is used as a single reaction to generate the biomass gases from the volatile materials and tar cracking. The latter is also modelled as one reaction to generate gases with fixed mass fractions. The first reaction was classified as a heterogeneous reaction while the second reaction was classified as homogenous reaction. The partial combustion and gasification model consisted of carbon combustion reactions and carbon and gas phase reactions. The partial combustion considered was for C, CO, H 2 and CH 4. The carbon gasification reactions used in this study is the Boudouard reaction with CO 2, the reaction with H 2 O and Methanation (Methane forming reaction) reaction to generate methane. The other gas phase reactions considered in this study are the water gas shift reaction, which is modelled as a reversible reaction and the methane steam reforming reaction. The developed gasification model was validated using different experimental data from the literature and {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions. Good agreement was observed, thus confirming the capability of the model in predicting biomass gasification in a CFB to a great accuracy. The developed model has been successfully used to carry out sensitivity and parametric analysis. The sensitivity analysis included: study of the effect of inclusion of various combustion reaction; and the effect of radiation in the gasification reaction. The developed model was also used to carry out parametric analysis by changing the following gasifier operating conditions: fuel/air ratio; biomass flow rates; <b>sand</b> (heat <b>carrier)</b> temperatures; <b>sand</b> flow rates; sand and biomass particle sizes; gasifying agent (pure air or pure steam); pyrolysis models used; steam/biomass ratio. Finally, based on these parametric and sensitivity analysis a final model was recommended for the simulation of biomass gasification in a CFB riser...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{nanomaterials}} {{included in}} the OECD WPMN priority list is titanium dioxide, a chemically stable mineral which exists in several crystalline forms. The two tetragonal forms (anatase and rutile) are used most often in a technical context, and each crystalline structure has specific properties that determine its applications. Examples {{include the use of}} TiO 2 in white pigments and in sunscreens, the latter because of the high refractive index (n = 2.7) which allows rapid absorption of ultraviolet radiation. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 means that {{it can be used to}} produce easy-to-clean surfaces, for air/water purification, deodorization, and sterilization [4 – 8]. These multiple applications mean that environmental distribution is inevitable. Model calculations suggest that typical TiO 2 concentrations in Europe are 1.28 μg/kg in soil, 89.2 μg/kg in sludge-treated soil, and 0.015 μg/L in surface water, whereas values in the USA are approximately half of those mentioned above [9]. Current information concerning the manufacture, processing, use, and end-of-life of nanoscale TiO 2 has recently been summarized [10]. One of the standardized terrestrial test systems {{included in the}} endpoint list of the WPMN is the earthworm reproduction test [11]. This test can be performed not only in artificial soil, but also in natural soils to increase the environmental relevance of the results. Several methods have been described for the application of nanomaterials to soil, including (1) the dispersion of dry powder directly in the soil [12, 13], (2) the application of a nanoparticle directly to the soil [13, 14], and (3) the application of a suspension in food which is added to the soil [15]. We used TiO 2 and silver nanoparticles and various test organisms (soil microflora, plants, earthworms) to investigate five different application methods: (1) spiking the soil with powder using soil as the carrier, (2) spiking the soil with powder using silica <b>sand</b> as the <b>carrier,</b> (3) spiking the soil with an aqueous dispersion, (4) spiking the earthworm food with powder, and (5) spiking the food with an aqueous dispersion. Chemical analysis of the spiked soil showed that powders and aqueous dispersions achieved comparable homogeneity (in both cases, the standard deviation for six samples taken at each spiking concentration was < 5 %). The application method did influence bioavailability, but the principal effect of the nanomaterials (i.e., toxic vs. nontoxic, stimulation or inhibition of reproduction) was similar for all methods. There was no difference in the effect from nanomaterials added directly to the soil or added to the feed, but direct application to the soil was preferred because this approach is described in the OECD guideline [11]. The application of powder produced better dose-response curves than dispersions, perhaps because the latter resulted in large nanoparticle agglomerates in the soil, thus reducing bioavailability. Experiments describing the application methods will be published separately.|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} activities discharge sulphate- and metal-containing wastewaters, including {{the manufacture of}} pulp and paper, mining and mineral processing, and petrochemical industries. Acid mine drainage (AMD) {{is an example of}} such sulphate- and metal-containing waste streams. Formation of AMD is generally the result of uncontrolled oxidation of the sulphide minerals present in the terrain in which the drainage flows with concomitant leaching of the metals. Acid mine drainage (AMD) and other sulphate- and metal-containing waste streams are amenable to active biological treatment. Anaerobic reduction of sulphate, reaction of produced sulphide with metal ions present in the waste stream, and biooxidation of excess sulphide are three main sub-processes involved in the active biotreatment of AMD. Anaerobic reduction of sulphate can be achieved in continuous stirred tank bioreactors with freely suspended cells or in immobilized cell bioreactors. The application of freely suspended cells in a continuous system dictates a high residence time to prevent cell wash-out, unless a biomass recycle stream is used. In an immobilized cell system biomass residence time becomes uncoupled from the hydraulic residence time, thus operation of bioreactor at shorter residence times becomes possible. In the present work, kinetics of anaerobic sulphate reduction was studied in continuous immobilized cell packed-bed bioreactors. Effects of carrier matrix, concentration of sulphate in the feed and sulphate volumetric loading rate on the performance of the bioreactor were investigated. The bioreactor performance, in terms of sulphate reduction rate, was dependent {{on the nature of the}} carrier matrix, specifically the total surface area which was provided by the matrix for the establishment of biofilm. Among the three tested <b>carrier</b> matrices, <b>sand</b> displayed the superior performance and the maximum volumetric reduction rate of 1. 7 g/L-h was achieved at the shortest residence time of 0. 5 h. This volumetric reduction rate was 40 and 8 folds faster than the volumetric reduction rates obtained with glass beads (0. 04 g/L-h; residence time: 28. 6 h) and foam BSP (0. 2 g/L-h; residence time: 5. 3 h), respectively. Further kinetic studies with <b>sand</b> as a <b>carrier</b> matrix indicated that the extent of volumetric reduction rate was dependent on the feed sulphate concentration and volumetric loading rate. At a constant feed sulphate concentration, increases in volumetric loading rate caused the volumetric reduction rate to pass through a maximum, while increases in feed sulphate concentrations from 1. 0 g/L to 5. 0 g/L led to lower volumetric reduction rates. The maximum volumetric reduction rates achieved in the bioreactors fed with initial sulphate concentration of 1. 0, 2. 5 and 5. 0 g/L were 1. 71, 0. 82 and 0. 68 g/L-h, respectively. The coupling of lactate utilization to sulphate reduction was observed in all experimental runs and the rates calculated based on the experimental data were in close agreement with calculated theoretical rates, using the stoichiometry of the reactions involved. The maximum volumetric reduction rates achieved in the immobilized cell bioreactors were significantly faster than those reported for freely suspended cells employed in the stirred tank bioreactors...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis {{of biomass}} is the {{thermochemical}} conversion process whereby the long lignocellulosic polymers in biomass are cracked into several higher-value {{products such as}} bio-oil, bio-char and combustible non-condensable gases (NCG). Fast pyrolysis in particular is aimed at maximising the yield of crude liquid bio-oil, with the production of bio-char and NCG as co-products. Since a large quantity of under-utilised biomass is produced in the forestry sector annually, as by-product from harvesting, this sector has shown particular interest in this process. Furthermore, the continuing drive for renewable and sustainable energy production, particularly of drop-in liquid biofuels, has urged the development of such technology on a commercial scale. The main purpose {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of the scalable dual fluidised bed (DFB) reactor system designed and constructed at the University of Pretoria by Swart in 2012. The sub-objectives of this study were as follows: • Biomass pre-treatment equipment was implemented to ensure that the physical characteristics of the biomass feedstock meet the pyrolysis process requirements. • The scalable DFB reactor system, including all sub-systems and ancillary equipment, was commissioned to ensure satisfactory operation of the complete system. • Continuous, steady-state experimental runs were conducted to produce fast pyrolysis products in the scalable DFB reactor system. • The fast pyrolysis products were quantified and characterised to evaluate the technical feasibility of the DFB reactor system. • A material and energy balance was conducted over the pyrolysis fluidised bed (PFB) reactor to quantify its performance. Eucalyptus grandis raw material, as received from Sappi Southern Africa’s Ngodwana mill, was successfully converted to bio-oil, bio-char and NCG in the scalable DFB reactor system. Fast pyrolysis was conducted at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, a vapour residence time of 4 s and a sawdust feed rate of 2. 0 kg/h. The PFB reactor temperature could be controlled easily, at the desired setpoint (500 °C), by continuously circulating hot solids between the two bubbling fluidised beds. The excellent temperature control of the PFB reactor makes the DFB system a suitable reactor system for the fast pyrolysis of biomass on a commercial scale. At these PFB reactor conditions the yield of fast pyrolysis products, on a dry feedstock basis, was determined as 36. 3, 14. 0 and 49. 7 weight % for bio-oil, NCG and bio-char respectively. High-value process heat, in the form of hot flue gas (450 – 500 °C), was produced in the combustion fluidised bed Although the crude liquid bio-oil contained highly oxygenated compounds (including organic acids, water, alcohols, esters, sugars, aldehydes, ketones, furans, pyrans and phenolics) it may be utilised for heat generation when co-fired with conventional fossil fuels, including heavy furnace oil. However, the scalable DFB reactor system allows for integrated catalytic fast pyrolysis, which would enable catalytic cracking of the biomass feedstock, and the subsequent pyrolysis vapours, to selectively produce deoxygenated bio-oil compounds, compatible with conventional refinery streams. The DFB reactor system allowed easy separation of bio-char from the pyrolysis vapours by means of the bio-char cyclone. The bio-char had a high heating value of only 17. 0 MJ/kg because of an unexpectedly high inorganic content of 54. 4 weight % on a dry basis. However, 77. 0 weight % of the inorganics were identified as entrained silica sand fines. Notwithstanding the entrained silica fines, the bio-char carbon content was determined as approximately 55 weight % on a dry basis, which would result in a high heating value of approximately 29 MJ/kg. Combustible NCG (including carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene and propene) were produced as co-product from the fast pyrolysis of E. grandis sawdust in the DFB reactor system. The high heating value of the NCG was estimated at 7. 3 MJ/kg or 8. 3 MJ/Nm 3. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that both the solid bio-char residue and NCG could be combusted in the CFB reactor to supplement its energy demand. At the sawdust feed rate of 2 000 g/h and silica sand circulation rate of 50 kg/h, the production rate of pyrolysis products was estimated at 687. 8, 265. 2 and 940. 0 g/h for bio-oil, NCG and bio-char respectively. However, only 13. 0 g/h of bio-char was collected from the bio-char cyclone, with the balance (i. e. 927. 0 g/h) understood to have been transferred to the CFB with the silica <b>sand</b> heat <b>carrier.</b> The recycle rate of the NCG was determined as 7 689. 7 g/h. The total energy input from the feedstock and recycled NCG was determined as 150 W, while the energy supplied to the PFB by means of the hot silica sand was determined as 3 889 W. The pyrolysis reaction energy demand, at the feed rate of 2 000 g/h, was determined as 1 000 W. The pyrolysis reactor freeboard temperature was found to be much lower than the fluidised bed temperature (± 195 °C vs. ± 500 °C) as a result of heat loss. Therefore, the energy output from the pyrolysis products was determined as only 344 W. The overall heat loss from the PFB reactor was estimated at a very high 2 696 W, which implies that approximately 69 % of the total energy supplied to this reactor by means of the hot silica sand was dissipated to the surrounding atmosphere. From a heat loss evaluation, it was concluded that the biomass throughput could be increased by as much as five to ten times by mitigating the heat loss.
