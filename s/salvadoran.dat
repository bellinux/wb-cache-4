50|$|Money from {{remittances}} {{has also}} increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many <b>Salvadorans</b> abroad can afford {{higher prices for}} houses in El Salvador than local <b>Salvadorans,</b> and thus push up the prices that all <b>Salvadorans</b> must pay.|$|R
50|$|El Salvador’s {{accommodation}} {{on economic}} and militia demand {{also meant that}} the United States would provide more benefits to <b>Salvadorans</b> living within the United States; <b>Salvadorans</b> have been eligible to receive TPS (Temporary Protection Status) since 2001. Approximately 2 million <b>Salvadorans</b> live in the United States, making it the sixth largest ethnic group in the United States. Such {{a large number of}} <b>Salvadorans</b> means that they have the capacity to send money back to El Salvador, which would make a very large contribution to its economy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Salvadorans</b> who are racially European, {{especially}} Mediterranean, {{and indigenous}} people in El Salvador {{who do not}} speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, as well as tri-racial Pardo <b>Salvadorans,</b> also identify themselves as Mestizo culturally. El Salvador {{is the only country}} in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, who passed racial laws to keep black people out of El Salvador, though <b>Salvadorans</b> with African ancestry are present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo <b>Salvadorans</b> who largely cluster with the Mestizo population.|$|R

5|$|Noriega {{acted as}} a conduit for U.S. support to the Contra militants in Nicaragua for many years, {{including}} funds and weapons. He allowed the CIA to establish listening posts in Panama, and also helped the U.S.-backed <b>Salvadoran</b> government against the leftist <b>Salvadoran</b> insurgent Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. U.S. spy ships used bases in Panama in their operations against the Nicaraguan government, {{and much of the}} intelligence gathered by these ships was processed in the U.S. bases in Panama. Noriega permitted these activities despite the Panama Canal treaties restricting the use of the U.S. bases to protecting the canal.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 2010 the FIFA Emergency Committee {{suspended}} the <b>Salvadoran</b> Football Federation (FESFUT) {{on account of}} government interference. This decision by FIFA {{was based on the}} fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country's official register, and that the government had failed to acknowledge the authority of the Normalisation Committee set up to represent FESFUT. Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up, and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension to be lifted, <b>Salvadoran</b> authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the Normalisation Committee of the <b>Salvadoran</b> Football Association. The suspension was lifted by May 28. By FIFA lifting the suspension, La Selecta was once again allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels. El Salvador's under-21 team qualified for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) tournament in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. However, CONCACAF decided to suspend football at the 2010 CAC shortly thereafter. El Salvador was also able to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E

50|$|The first Salvadorians {{that came}} to the United States before the war began arrived mostly to San Francisco, where they worked as {{shipyard}} employees {{in the early twentieth}} century. These were mostly working class <b>Salvadorans,</b> as <b>Salvadorans</b> from the middle and upper classes came to the U.S. for education or residence in the early 1900s, usually in the East Coast. <b>Salvadorans</b> that came during this period were mostly economic migrants, as El Salvador was affected by economic turmoil during the Great Depression and slow growth after World War II ended. In the 1960s and early 1970s, most of the immigrants were women; and found work being housekeepers or in childcare.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{nickname}} [...] "Football War" [...] {{implies that the}} conflict was due to a football match, {{the causes of the}} war go much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in Honduras and immigration and demographic problems in El Salvador. Honduras is more than five times the size of neighbouring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was some 40% higher than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century <b>Salvadorans</b> had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969 more than 300,000 <b>Salvadorans</b> were living in Honduras. These <b>Salvadorans</b> made up 20% of the peasant population of Honduras.|$|R

San Francisco's North Beach district is considered the Little Italy of the city, and was once home to a significant Italian American community. San Francisco and Marin County both have substantial Jewish communities. The Latino population is spread throughout the Bay Area, but among the nine counties, the greatest number of them live in Santa Clara County, while Contra Costa County sees the highest growth rate.

5|$|More recent {{immigration}} {{in the late}} 20th century and early 21st century has fueled new communities of Hispanics and Asians. , 9.0% of Virginians are Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 6.5% are Asian. The state's Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics living in Northern Virginia. Hispanic citizens in Virginia have higher median household incomes and educational attainment than the general Virginia population. As far as Hispanic groups, {{there is a large}} <b>Salvadoran</b> population in the DC suburbs of Northern Virginia, and a large Puerto Rican population in the Hampton Roads region of Southeast Virginia. Northern Virginia also has a significant population of Vietnamese Americans, whose major wave of immigration followed the Vietnam War, and Korean Americans, whose migration has been more recent and was induced in part by the quality school system. The Filipino American community has about 45,000 in the Hampton Roads area, many of whom have ties to the U.S. Navy and armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas' {{force of}} 480 {{men had been}} split into four teams, {{ranging in size from}} 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador, and {{assembled}} in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan army's largest frontier post. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by <b>Salvadoran</b> policemen before it got to the border. At 8:20am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz's immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas' forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot up for grabs. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the <b>Salvadoran</b> capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by El Salvador, and was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E
