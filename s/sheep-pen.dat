These changes {{are reflected in the}} significant number of terms borrowed from local Slavs. About 20% of the Hungarian vocabulary is of Slavic origin, including the Hungarian words for <b>sheep-pen</b> (akol), yoke (iga) and horseshoe (patkó).

6000|$|Well, sir; I've made inquiry of a Sidlinch {{woman as}} to his burial, and what I thought seems true. They buried en wi' a new six-foot hurdle-saul drough's body, from the <b>sheep-pen</b> up in North Ewelease though they won't own to it now. And the {{question}} is, Is the moving worth while, considering the awkwardness?' ...|$|E
60|$|THE orangoutang in the {{big iron}} cage lashed to the <b>sheep-pen</b> began the discussion. The night was stiflingly hot, and as Hans Breitmann and I passed him, {{dragging}} our bedding to the fore-peak of the steamer, he roused himself and chattered obscenely. He had been caught somewhere in the Malayan Archipelago, {{and was going to}} England to be exhibited at a shilling a head. For four days he had struggled, yelled, and wrenched at the heavy iron bars of his prison without ceasing, and had nearly slain a Lascar incautious enough to come within reach of the great hairy paw.|$|E
6000|$|... "What, never? You {{who have}} declared, I won't say unblushingly, for heaven knows you have blushed enough about it, but openly {{and on your}} oath, that you have always some {{different}} object of affection, with whom you walk, sit, talk, and whisper; whose hand you squeeze, round whose waist you put your arm (a crime, by the by, never imputed to my client), whom you even confess that you kiss; and yet you sit here secure, unassailed, unsolicited for damages, unengaged, as you lead us to suppose. What are the fathers and brothers of Connaught doing to let such a hydra-headed monster as thou near their doors--such a wolf into their <b>sheep-pens?</b> Go down, thou false Lothario. Go down, thou amorous Turk, and remember that a day of retribution may yet come for yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|The tickets which Billy Windsor had {{obtained}} from his newspaper friend were {{for one of}} the boxes. These proved to be sort of <b>sheep-pens</b> of unpolished wood, each with four hard chairs in it. The interior of the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club was severely free from anything in the shape of luxury and ornament. Along the four walls were raised benches in tiers. On these were seated as tough-looking a collection of citizens as one might wish to see. On chairs at the ring-side were the reporters, with tickers at their sides, by means of which they tapped details of each round through to their down-town offices, where write-up reporters were waiting to read off and elaborate the messages. In the centre of the room, brilliantly lighted by half a dozen electric chandeliers, was the ring.|$|R
60|$|Sheep next. The <b>sheep-pens</b> are up here, {{past the}} Branch Bank of Paris {{established}} {{for the convenience of}} the butchers, and behind the two pretty fountains they are making in the Market. My name is Bull: yet I think I should like to see as good twin fountains - not to say in Smithfield, but in England anywhere. Plenty of room; plenty of time. And here are sheep-dogs, sensible as ever, but with a certain French air about them - not without a suspicion of dominoes - with a kind of flavour of moustache and beard - demonstrative dogs, shaggy and loose where an English dog would be tight and close - not so troubled with business calculations as our English drovers' dogs, who have always got their sheep upon their minds, and think about their work, even resting, as you may see by their faces; but, dashing, showy, rather unreliable dogs: who might worry me instead of their legitimate charges if they saw occasion - and might see it somewhat suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|But, friend, We {{speak of}} what is; not {{of what might}} be, And how 'twere better if 'twere otherwise. I am the man you see here plain enough: Grant I'm a beast, why, beasts must lead beasts' lives! Suppose I own at once to tail and claws; [...] 350 The {{tailless}} man exceeds me: but being tailed I'll lash out lion fashion, and leave apes To dock their stump and dress their haunches up. My business is not to remake myself, But make the absolute best of what God made. Or--our first simile--though you prove me doomed To a viler berth still, to the steerage-hole, The <b>sheep-pen</b> or the pig-stye, I should strive To make what use of each were possible; And as this cabin gets upholstery, [...] 360 That hutch should rustle with sufficient straw.|$|E
6000|$|Equally at the squire's table {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the ladies, at the farmers' market-ordinary, and at the village ale-house, the topic which, after the political question of the day, excites the most general interest, is the management of animals. Riding home from hunting, the conversation usually gravitates towards horse-breeding, and pedigrees, and comments on this or that [...] "good point;" [...] while a day on the moors is very unlikely to end without something being said on the treatment of dogs. When crossing the fields together from church, the tenants of adjacent farms are apt to pass from criticisms on the sermon to criticisms on the weather, the crops, and the stock; and thence to slide into discussions on the various kinds of fodder and their feeding qualities. Hodge and Giles, after comparing notes over their respective pig-styes, show by their remarks that they have been observant of their masters' beasts and sheep; and of the effects produced on them by this or that kind of treatment. Nor is it only among the rural population that the regulations of the kennel, the stable, the cow-shed, and the <b>sheep-pen,</b> are favourite subjects. In towns, too, the numerous artisans who keep dogs, the young men who are rich enough to now and then indulge their sporting tendencies, and their more staid seniors who talk over agricultural progress or read Mr. Mechi's annual reports and Mr. Caird's letters to the Times, form, when added together, {{a large portion of the}} inhabitants. Take the adult males throughout the kingdom, and a great majority will be found to show some interest in the breeding, rearing, or training of animals, of one kind or other.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{old time}} of the King Artour, Of which that Bretons speken great honour, All was this land {{fulfilled}} of faerie; The Elf queen, with her joly company, Danced full oft in many a grene mead. This was the old opinion, as I rede-- I speake of many hundred years ago, But now can no man see no elves mo. For now the great charity and prayers Of limitours,[39] and other holy freres, That searchen every land and every stream, As thick as motes in the sunne-beam, Blessing halls, chambers, kitchenes, and boures, Cities and burghes, castles high and towers, Thropes and barnes, <b>sheep-pens</b> and dairies, This maketh that there ben no fairies. For there as wont to walken was an elf, There walketh now the limitour himself, In under nichtes and in morwenings, And saith his mattins and his holy things, As he goeth in his limitation. Women may now go safely up and doun; In every bush, and under every tree, There is no other incubus than he, And he ne will don them no dishonour."[40] ...|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the rocks}} his city was: [...] Before his palace, in the sun, [...] 180 [...] He sat {{to see his}} people pass, [...] And judge them every one [...] From its {{threshold}} of smooth stone. [...] They haled him many a valley-thief [...] Caught in the <b>sheep-pens,</b> robber-chief [...] 185 [...] Swarthy and shameless, beggar-cheat, [...] Spy-prowler, or rough pirate found [...] On the sea-sand left aground; [...] And sometimes clung about his feet, [...] With bleeding lid and burning cheek, [...] 190 [...] A woman, bitterest wrong to speak [...] Of one with sullen thickset brows: [...] And sometimes from the prison-house [...] The angry priests a pale wretch brought, [...] Who through some chink had pushed and pressed [...] 195 [...] On knees and elbows, belly and breast, [...] Worm-like into the temple--caught [...] He was by the very god, [...] Whoever in the darkness strode [...] Backward and forward, keeping watch [...] 200 [...] O'er his brazen bowls, such rogues to catch!

60|$|Next to {{the brigade}} messhouse were {{two groups of}} low {{buildings}}, called the Sikh Squares, and on the flat roofs of these buildings sandbag parapets were raised. Next to this, at the extreme western point, stood the house of Mr. Gubbins, the commissioner, a strong building, defended with stockades, and having at the angle a battery, called Gubbins' Battery. Along the northwestern side {{were a number of}} yards and buildings, the racket-court, the <b>sheep-pens,</b> the slaughter-house, the cattle-yard, a storehouse for the food for the cattle, and a guardhouse; and behind them stood a strong building known as Ommaney's house, guarded by a deep ditch and cactus hedge, and defended with two pieces of artillery. A mortar battery was planted north of the slaughter-house. Next along the line was the church, converted now into a granary, and in the churchyard was a mortar battery. Next came the house of Lieutenant Innis, a weak and difficult post to hold, commanded as it was by several houses outside the inclosure. Commanding the extreme north point, which was in itself very weak, was the Redan Battery, a well-constructed work. From this point, facing the river, was a strong earthwork, and outside the sloping garden served as a glacis, and rendered attack on this side difficult. Near the eastern angle stood the hospital, a very large stone building, formerly the banqueting-hall of the British residents at the court of Oude. Near the hospital, but on lower ground, was the Bailey Guard. Dr. Fayrer's house, south of the hospital, was strongly built, and from its terraced roof an effective musketry fire could be kept up on an enemy approaching on this side. Next to it came the civil dispensary, and then the post office, a strong position, defended by a battery. Between this and the south corner came the financial office, Sago's house, the judicial office, and the jail. The Residency, a spacious and handsome building, stood {{in the center of the}} northern portion of the inclosure, surrounded by gardens. It was on elevated ground, and from its terraced roof a splendid view of the city and surrounding country could be obtained. The begum's khotee, or ladies' house, stood near the center of the inclosure; it was a large building, and was used as a commissariat store and for the dwellings of many officers' families. Thus it will be seen that the Residency at Lucknow, as defended against the insurgents, comprised a little town grouped round the dwelling of the Resident.|$|R

50|$|The {{house was}} entered {{from the east}} side as {{this was the only}} side that afforded {{protection}} from the weather. A wide corridor led into the yard. To the right was the kitchen, which took up almost the whole eastern wing. In the northern wing was the best room, the altar room and the bedroom of the dalai Lama's parents, all connected with each other. The byre, the guest room and the store room were in the western wing, while the stable, the kennel and the <b>sheep-pen</b> were in the southern wing. The yard, the covered in-way and the stalls were paved with stone slabs. The rooms had wooden floors.|$|E
