30|$|The <b>cones</b> of <b>sugar</b> pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas) {{are among}} the largest of all conifers, {{reaching}} 56 cm long (Kinloch and Scheuner 1990). <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> are a locally abundant component of the surface fuel bed in middle elevation mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada (Figure 1). <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> were investigated by van Wagtendonk et al.

30|$|We {{discovered}} that <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> burn with greater flame lengths and flaming times than the cones of other North American resister pines (sensu Agee 1993) studied to date. <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cone</b> flaming times were only exceeded by the resin-coated serotinous cones of knobcone pine and Monterey pine (Fonda and Varner 2004). <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> burned with greater flame length, flaming time, smoldering time, and mass loss than sugar pine foliage (Fonda et al. 1998), indicating that cones augment surface fire behavior of sugar pine forests, and likely do so {{to a greater}} degree than do cones of other resister pine species (Fonda 2001, Fonda and Varner 2004). Finally, we found that flammability of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> varied dramatically and was dependent on degree of cone maturation and post-deposition decomposition. Our results indicate that the developmental stage at which cones become surface fuels and the time since deposition exert strong control over the contribution of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> to surface fire behavior.|$|R
30|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{measurements of}} cone burning characteristics implicate <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> as {{contributors to the}} surface fire regime created by litterfall in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests (sensu Fonda and Varner 2004). <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> burn with greater flame lengths and longer flaming times than cones of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Balf.), two other pine species that commonly co-occur with sugar pine. Maximum flame length and flame duration for mature <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> exceeded previously reported values for ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine by ca. 58 cm and 120 s (Fonda and Varner 2004). The relatively greater potential contribution of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> to surface fire behavior compared to cones of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine becomes more apparent when burning characteristics of cones are considered alongside those of conspecific foliage. Maximum flame lengths of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine needles were similar to maximum flame lengths of conspecific cones (Fonda et al. 1998). Maximum flame lengths of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones,</b> however, were twice that of sugar pine needles, in addition to cones having longer flaming time and smoldering time compared to needles (Fonda et al. 1998). Thus, it appears that <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> can be relatively greater contributors to surface fire behavior than cones of ponderosa pine or Jeffrey pine. By enhancing the flammability of the surface fuels, <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> may {{play an important role}} in the fuel dynamics of in mixed-conifer forests that lack a significant ponderosa pine or Jeffrey pine component, such as the YFDP.|$|R

30|$|Although <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> do not {{necessarily}} drive surface fire dynamics throughout the forest, at small spatial scales they are locally abundant (Figure 1) and likely influence fire behavior and effects at such scales. Microtopography, down coarse woody debris, and the spatial arrangement of large diameter coneproducing trees cause the abundance of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> {{on the forest floor}} to vary spatially. Accumulations of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> that may increase the severity of surface fire locally could, for example, contribute to the small-scale (15 m to 20 m) spatial heterogeneity observed in these mixed-conifer forests (e.g., Larson and Churchill 2012, Lutz et al. 2012) through increased mortality of smaller trees. Fonda and Varner (2004) advanced a similar hypothesis, noting that cones of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine are frequently aggregated around tree bases and therefore may contribute to maintenance of a low-competition environment in the immediate tree neighborhood when they burn. Further study is warranted, given the vigorous burning characteristics of individual <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> in the laboratory, of spatial patterns of cone accumulation on the forest floor and the burning characteristics of aggregations of cones.|$|R

30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the physical and}} burning characteristics of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas) cones and their contribution to woody surface fuel loadings. Field sampling was conducted at the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot (YFDP), a 25.6 ha mapped study plot in Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We developed a classification system to describe <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> of different sizes and decay conditions, and examined differences among cone classes in biomass, bulk density, flame length, burning time, consumption, and relative contribution to surface fuel loads. <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> comprised 601 kg ha− 1 of surface fuels. Mature cones comprised 54 % of cone biomass, and aborted juvenile cones accounted for 44 %. Cone biomass, diameter, and bulk density differed among cone condition classes, as did burning characteristics (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001 in all cases). Flame lengths ranged from 5 cm to 94 cm for juvenile cones, and 71 cm to 150 cm for mature cones. Our {{results showed that the}} developmental stage at which <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> become surface fuels determines their potential contribution to surface fire behavior in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests. <b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> burn with greater flame lengths and flame times than the cones of other North American fire-tolerant pine species studied to date, indicating that cones augment the surface fire regime of sugar pine forests, and likely do so to a greater degree than do cones of other pine species.|$|R

30|$|The cone {{condition}} class model {{captured the}} variation of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cone</b> physical characteristics. Cone length and diameter increase substantially during cone growth (Figure 2). Cone morphology also changes—small, immature cones have a closed structure of imbricate scales forming a dense shell, resulting in higher bulk density. During maturation, cone scales separate {{from one another}} as they reflex away from cone stems, resulting in higher cone volume and lower bulk density (Table 1). These changes in cone morphology alter cone surface area to volume ratio, an important determinant of fuel combustion (van Wagtendonk 2006) for which our cone bulk density measurements serve as a proxy. As a result, bulk density and length explain most {{of the variation in}} <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cone</b> structure.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cone</b> {{production}} {{takes two}} years and cone crops can sustain high rates of spontaneous abortion {{during the first year}} of development (Kinloch and Scheuner 1990). The <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cone</b> beetle (Conophthorus lambertianae) can cause very high (up to 93 %) rates of cone loss (Bedard 1968, Kinloch and Scheuner 1990), suggesting that aborted juvenile cones could be an episodically important component of litter fall. Additionally, Douglas-squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii Bachman) activity can result in high levels of cone litter fall, and squirrel activity also visibly changes the morphology and, presumably, burning characteristics of <b>cones</b> (Tevis 1953). <b>Sugar</b> pines growing in pure stands deposited cones into the surface litter at a rate of 336 kg ha− 1 yr− 1, but with high levels of interannual variability (290 kg ha− 1 yr− 1; van Wagtendonk and Moore 2010). Average deposition rate for <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> in a mixed-conifer stand was 435 kg ha− 1 yr− 1, accounting for up to 10 % of total annual litter fall (Stohlgren 1988). These studies only sampled recently fallen cones, however, and the relative contribution of fresh aborted first-year cones, fresh mature cones, and older partially decomposed cones (sensu Varner et al. 2009) to surface fuel loads is unknown.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> {{comprised}} 1.3 % of {{the total}} forest floor fuel (duff, litter, and woody fuels < 10 cm in diameter) mass in the YFDP (Lutz et al. 2012). On sites with active frequent fire regimes, <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> may comprise a larger fraction of the surface fuel load that is {{more in line with}} their relative representation in annual litterfall inputs (up to about 10 %; Stohlgren 1988): frequent fires preclude development of a deep duff layer, which should increase the proportional representation of apparently rapidly decaying pine cones in the surface fuel bed in an active fire regime (Figure 1). In addition, fire may stimulate cone production. For example, thinning alone, and in combination with prescribed fire, increased ponderosa pine cone production (Peters and Sala 2008).|$|R

The pouring technique is as crucial as the quality of the tea itself. Moroccan tea pots have long, curved pouring spouts and this allows the tea to be poured evenly into tiny glasses from a height. For the best taste, glasses are filled in two stages. The Moroccans traditionally like tea with bubbles, so while pouring they hold the teapot high above the glasses. Finally, the tea is accompanied with hard <b>sugar</b> <b>cones</b> or lumps. Morocco has an abundance of oranges and tangerines, so fresh orange juice is easily found freshly squeezed and is cheap.|$|R

30|$|Mature <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones,</b> with flame lengths > 1 m and flame {{duration}} of 3 min to 6 min, clearly {{have the potential}} to contribute to surface fire behavior and spread (Fonda and Varner 2004). Under some circumstances, flaming mature cones might also ignite shrubs and tree saplings. Burning cones also contribute to fire spread when they roll downhill beyond the fire perimeter, {{part of the reason for}} the practice of cup-trenching fire lines on steep terrain. Cones that smolder for long periods, such as the approximately 35 min smoldering times observed here for classes I through III, become potential ignition sources in the litter and duff layers with negative consequences for large tree survival (Hood 2010). Our laboratory measurements did not examine differences in burning characteristics due to different moisture contents or due to admixtures of cones and needles (sensu Taylor and Fonda 1990, Fonda and Varner 2004). A combination of laboratory and field experiments would provide insights into the role of <b>sugar</b> pine <b>cones</b> as a flame and heat vector for surface and ladder fuel ignition, or as a vector for duff ignition.|$|R
40|$|The current {{industry}} {{standard for the}} assessment of ice cream cone crispness is a relatively complex instrumental measurement that more directly measures hardness than crispness. The objective of this research was to identify a simpler instrumental measure that corresponds to the consumer perception of crispness in ice cream cones. Uniform cone pieces were equili-brated to three different water activity (Aw) levels and 50 untrained judges rated crisp intensity of the pieces at each Aw level twice on a 10 -point line scale using positional relative rating. Significant differences in perceived crispness between the three different Aw levels were found for two different cone types. No significant difference was found between replications. Corre-lation coefficients between perceived crispness and Aw were r =- 0. 999 (P < 0. 01) for two different cones types. These findings suggest that Aw is a simple instrumental measure of crispness in <b>sugar</b> <b>cones.</b> PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This study contained two key findings. First, they show that water activity is highly correlated with the consumer perception of cone crispness, making it an excellent way to monitor crispness over time and from batch to batch. Second, these findings confirm that, as has been previously shown with model systems, positional relative rating reduces variability across replications when used with actual products. It also demonstrates that it can be used effectively with untrained consumers...|$|R
