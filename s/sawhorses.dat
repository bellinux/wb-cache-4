6000|$|The Mule snorted, and the Woozy laughed; Toto {{had lost}} his growl and could only look scornfully at the Sawhorse, who stood in his place unmoved. But the Lion {{stretched}} himself and yawned, saying quietly, [...] "Were we all like the Sawhorse, {{we would all be}} <b>Sawhorses,</b> which would be too many of the kind. Were we all like Hank, we would be a herd of mules; if like Toto, we would be a pack of dogs; should we all become the shape of the Woozy, he would no longer be remarkable for his unusual appearance. Finally, were you all like me, I would consider you so common that I would not care to associate with you. To be individual, my friends, to be different from others, {{is the only way to}} become distinguished from the common herd. Let us be glad, therefore, that we differ from one another in form and in disposition. Variety is the spice of life, and we are various enough to enjoy one another's society; so let us be content." ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{mentioned}} garden parties. One of our annual institutions was Mrs. Willett's children's party in May; for the Willett house had a garden that covered {{almost a quarter}} of a block. Mrs. Willett loved children, the greatest regret of her life being that providence had denied her a large family. As far back as my memory goes she had been something of an invalid; she had a sweet, sad face, and delicate hands so thin as to seem almost transparent; and she always sat in a chair under the great tree on the lawn, smiling at us as we soared to dizzy heights in the swing, or played croquet, or scurried through the paths, and {{in and out of the}} latticed summer-house with shrieks of laughter and terror. It all ended with a feast at a long table made of <b>sawhorses</b> and boards covered with a white cloth, and when the cake was cut there was wild excitement as to who would get the ring and who the thimble.|$|E
50|$|A {{sawhorse}} {{can also}} be used as the base for a portable work table by placing a sheet of 3/4 in plywood or even a door on top of two <b>sawhorses.</b> If the <b>sawhorses</b> are strong enough, the portable table {{can be used as a}} platform for tools like a table saw, although with caution if the top is not secured to the <b>sawhorses.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Just {{then the}} Scarecrow {{proposed}} a race between the <b>Sawhorse</b> and the Cab-horse; and although {{all the others}} were delighted at the suggestion the <b>Sawhorse</b> drew back, saying: ...|$|R

50|$|Modern <b>sawhorses</b> {{are usually}} made of {{dimensional}} lumber, {{but the basic}} form of the sawhorse has remained unchanged for centuries. For example, one of the illustrations in De Re Metallica (1556) contains a drawing of a millwright using a pair of <b>sawhorses</b> to support the beams he is forming. The top {{of each of these}} <b>sawhorses</b> appears to be made from a halved log, with legs mortised or dovetailed into place.|$|E

60|$|Meantime, the Woozy had {{approached}} the <b>Sawhorse</b> {{and begun to}} sniff at it. The <b>Sawhorse</b> resented this familiarity and with a sudden kick pounded the Woozy squarely on its head with one gold-shod foot.|$|R
60|$|Beside {{the stall}} of the <b>Sawhorse</b> {{had been placed}} another for Hank, the mule. This was not quite so {{beautiful}} as the other, for the <b>Sawhorse</b> was Ozma's favorite steed; but Hank had a supply of cushions for a bed (which the <b>Sawhorse</b> did not need because he never slept) and all this luxury was so strange to the little mule that he could only stand still and regard his surroundings and his queer companions with wonder and amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>Sawhorse</b> is the {{favorite}} steed of Princess Ozma, the Ruler of the Land of Oz, and {{he lives in a}} stable decorated with pearls and emeralds, {{at the rear of the}} royal palace. He is swift as the wind, untiring, and is kind to his friends. All the people of Oz respect the <b>Sawhorse</b> highly, and when I visit Ozma she sometimes allows me to ride him--as I am doing to-day. Now you know what an important personage the <b>Sawhorse</b> is, and if some one--perhaps yourself--will tell me your name, your rank and station, and your history, it will give me pleasure to relate them to the <b>Sawhorse.</b> This will lead to mutual respect and friendship." ...|$|R
5000|$|Maetta's attendants {{bring in}} the prisoners, with Jinjur dressed as a milkmaid and Prissy wearing the checked skirt and a coat covered in medals. Maetta orders Athlos to cast Mombi into the dungeon, the latter spewing insults at the others as they drag her away. When Maetta takes away Jinjur for her punishment, Jack wishes that they all had <b>sawhorses,</b> and the Woggle-Bug works his magic, {{summoning}} six <b>sawhorses</b> for the number, [...] "The Equine Paradox" [...] (Tip, Woggle-Bug, Jack, Regent, Prissy, Professor).|$|E

5000|$|M.A.S.H. units, {{according}} to one doctor assigned to the unit, [...] "weren't on the front lines, but they were close. They {{lived and worked in}} tents. It was hot in the summer and colder than cold in the winter." [...] The operating room consisted of stretchers balanced on carpenter's <b>sawhorses.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>sawhorse</b> may be {{designed}} to fold for storage. A <b>sawhorse</b> with a wide top is particularly useful to support a board for sawing or as a field workbench, and is more useful as a single, but also more difficult to store.|$|R
60|$|Jack now {{examined}} the map Ozma {{had given him}} and found the right path to take, which the <b>Sawhorse</b> obediently followed. Underneath the trees all was silent and gloomy and Jack beguiled the way by whistling gayly as the <b>Sawhorse</b> trotted along.|$|R
60|$|There {{was an open}} wagon, {{with three}} seats for the passengers, and the wagon was drawn by the famous wooden <b>Sawhorse</b> which had once been brought to life by Ozma {{by means of a}} magic powder. The <b>Sawhorse</b> wore wooden shoes to keep his wooden legs from wearing away, and he was strong and swift. As this curious {{creature}} was Ozma's own favorite steed, and very popular with all the people of the Emerald City, Dorothy knew that she had been highly favored by being permitted to use the <b>Sawhorse</b> on her journey.|$|R
5000|$|Born in 1876 in Church Hill, Mississippi, Errol Payne Palmer {{graduated}} from Barnes Medical College of St. Louis, Missouri, in 1898. He moved to Phoenix in 1900 setting up his first practice at 108 North Center Street, now Central Avenue. Dr. Palmer related {{in his personal}} papers [...] "I rode a bicycle for town calls and rented a horse and buggy from the livery stable for country calls." [...] When Dr. Palmer arrived in Phoenix, [...] "St. Joseph's Hospital had twelve beds and no operating room. A pair of carpenter <b>sawhorses</b> were placed in a patient's room and boards were put across the <b>sawhorses</b> to make an operating table. The part to be operated on was washed with warm water and soap, chloroform was the usual anesthetic and this was administered {{by some of the}} other surgeons." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{table is}} not a {{regulation}} ping-pong table but is made from one or two sheets of plywood, usually measuring 4'x8', 5'x9', or 5'x10'. However, a regular ping-pong table may be utilized if available. The sheets are propped up on supports such as <b>sawhorses,</b> garbage cans, or frames specially built from lumber or steel pipes.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a bronze {{sculpture}} by K G Bejermark in the pavement facing the park. Named Humor and inaugurated in 1970, it displays a man lifting a manhole cover in the pavement. The man is modelled after the actor and humorist Hans Alfredsson. The <b>sawhorses</b> surrounding the sculpture are, however, additions by the City Park Administration (Parkförvaltningen).|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} avoid being turned into a marble statue, Tip runs away with Jack that very same night and steals the Powder of Life. [...] He uses it to animate the wooden <b>Sawhorse</b> for Jack to ride. The <b>Sawhorse</b> runs so quickly that Tip is left behind. Walking alone, he meets General Jinjur's all-girl Army of Revolt, which is {{planning}} to overthrow the Scarecrow (who has ruled the Emerald City {{since the end of}} The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). Meanwhile, Jack and the <b>Sawhorse</b> arrive at the Emerald City and make the acquaintance of His Majesty the Scarecrow. Jinjur and her crew invade the Emerald city, terrorize the citizens, and loot the city, causing great havoc and chaos. Tip joins Jack and the Scarecrow in the palace, and they escape on the <b>Sawhorse's</b> back.|$|R
40|$|Three new osmium-containing <b>sawhorse</b> {{complexes}} of {{the formula}} Os 2 (μ- O 2 CR 1) (μ-O 2 CR 2) (CO) 4 (L) 2 were synthesized using microwave radiation. These complexes {{are the first}} examples of mixed-carboxylate ligand <b>sawhorse</b> complexes and offer a proof-of-concept {{to the idea of}} “cluster customization. ” The structures of these compounds are analyzed for their properties including how they interact with solvent molecules and how different axial ligands affect the amount of disorder in their crystal structures.

The entire sequence of collisions took at least 10 seconds.|$|E
50|$|A saw-horse or {{sawhorse}} (saw-buck, trestle, buck) is a beam {{with four}} legs {{used to support}} a board or plank for sawing. A pair of <b>sawhorses</b> can support a plank, forming a scaffold. In certain circles, it {{is also known as}} a mule and a short sawhorse is known as a pony. A sawhorse may also be a rack for supporting logs for sawing, known in the US as a sawbuck.|$|E
50|$|A {{second strike}} hit the {{construction}} site on July 18. This jurisdictional strike involved 250 carpenters, {{who were involved in}} a dispute with the plasterers over who had the right to build <b>sawhorses.</b> More than 2,000 of the 3,000 workers on the two-building job site were idled as the strike continued. The strike ended on July 19 after both labor unions agreed to allow the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL to arbitrate the dispute.|$|E

50|$|Sawing competitions, {{also called}} trontzalaritza or arpana, {{are seen as}} a {{variation}} of aizkolaritza and involve sawing through pieces of wood. The log is either fixed horizontally on <b>sawhorses</b> at a height of 40 cm or at an angle with one end over the sawhorse and two members of the sawing team sitting on the lower end to stabilise the log, with two other handling the saw. The saw is usually 2 m long, the logs vary but can be over 1 m in circumference and usually between 10-20 in number.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-to-late 20th century {{a common}} version {{was made of}} wood {{in the shape of}} a sawhorse. The legs are similar but rather heavy duty facsimiles of the hobby sawhorse-version, and about the same height. The {{horizontal}} bar consists of a heavy duty plank about 4.2 metres (14 ft) long with printed on it in large letters: Police Line - Do Not Cross. Beginning in the 1980s, steel barriers gradually took the place of wooden <b>sawhorses</b> at many events, including major holiday parades in New York City.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the bridge}} is listed on the NRHP, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had to approve the renovation. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funds helped pay for the work done. The {{dedication}} ceremony was held on October 30, 1998, with Lycoming County Commissioner Russell Reitz and PennDOT Director of Municipal Services Thomas Lyons cutting a plank on wooden <b>sawhorses</b> with an old crosscut saw as the ribbon cutting ceremony. The other county commissioners and the local state representative and state senator were also present and spoke, as did {{a representative of the}} [...] "Theodore Burr Covered Bridge Society of Pennsylvania".|$|E

All of these had good appetites except the <b>Sawhorse</b> and the Glass Cat, and each was given a plentiful supply of the food it liked best.|$|R
60|$|This <b>Sawhorse,</b> while made of wood, {{was very}} much alive and could travel swiftly and without tiring. To keep the ends of his wooden legs from wearing down short, Ozma had shod the <b>Sawhorse</b> with plates of pure gold. His harness was studded with {{brilliant}} emeralds and other jewels and so, while he himself {{was not at all}} handsome, his outfit made a splendid appearance.|$|R
