Rotated displays, {{in which the}} subpixels are arranged vertically rather than horizontally, are not currently supported. Using ClearType on these display configurations will actually reduce the display quality.

25|$|This {{point of}} view argues that {{management}} (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production {{at the end of}} 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> safety systems to save moneyâ€” including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans. Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations. Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.|$|E

25|$|The {{operating}} frequency {{range of a}} RO depends on the input and output characteristics. The highest frequency of the input (controlling) signal {{is limited by the}} response of the RO light source to the change in the controlling current and by the response of the photoresistor to light; its typical value ranges between 1 and 250Hz. The response time of a photoresistor to <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> of the light typically varies between 2.5 and 1000 ms, whereas the response to switching the illumination on is about 10 times faster. As to the light source, its reaction time to a current pulse is in the nanosecond range for an LED, and is therefore neglected. However, for an incandescent lamp it is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which limits the frequency range of the respective ROs to a few Hz.|$|E
25|$|The main {{inefficiency}} in {{a common}} thermal working machine is the expansion valve, which allows to pass the refrigerant liquid from the low pressure blow pressure without using the potential energy available. This patented and published invention in 2017 by Giuseppe Verde adopts a special technique based on power regeneration for internal cycles, {{in order to reduce}} the consumption of electricity. Innovation is therefore linked to the insertion of a heat exchanger for the recovery of energy and an alternator within a conventional refrigeration system. Applying this device results in a high improvement in energy efficiency and refrigeration capacity. Both of these effects increase when the operating temperature and the evaporation temperature decrease. In addition, an advantageous object of the present invention is the insertion of an electric charge accumulator comprising an automatic timed control system for <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> the electric circuit, which guarantees the possibility of economically benefiting the multi-hour tariff electric energy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
50|$|The {{switchover}} {{for individual}} countries varies; {{in some countries}} it is being implemented in stages as in Australia, India and the United Kingdom, where each region has a separate date to <b>switch</b> <b>off.</b> In others, the whole country switches on one date, such as the Netherlands, which <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> all analog services on 11 December 2006.

25|$|Physical {{evidence}} and CCTV {{footage of the}} fire showed that it probably started towards {{the stern of the}} ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off {{at the end of each}} day, and no one recalled <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.|$|E
500|$|The SATCOM link functioned {{normally}} from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT) {{until it}} {{responded to a}} ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07. Ground-to-air ACARS messages continued to be transmitted to Flight 370 until Inmarsat's network sent multiple [...] "Request for Acknowledge" [...] messages at 02:03, without a response from the aircraft. At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the SDU. At 02:25, the aircraft's SDU sent a [...] "log-on request". It is not common for a log-on request to be made in-flight, but it could occur for multiple reasons. An analysis of the characteristics and timing of these requests suggest a power interruption in-flight {{is the most likely}} culprit. As the power interruption was not due to engine flame-out, per ATSB, {{it may have been the}} result of manually <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> the aircraft's electrical system.|$|E

Cook had been around Charlotte for five months and no one realized there was anything wrong until he started developing stroke symptoms again.

He claims to have had no recollection of leaving Florida, nor what he had done during his five months in Charlotte. When asked, he stated that, [...] "It was like someone <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> a light and then switching it back on." [...] Cook's story has been told through different media.

Constantine pleads with Billy not to touch Pandora's box, afraid of the power it may possess, but Shazam leaves Constantine and returns to the group, where he sees the effect the box has had on Wonder Woman. He knocks the box aside and picks it up; the resulting contact corrupts him also, giving him an appearance similar to Black Adam and causing a huge ripple through the magical planes.|$|E
500|$|That same evening McCudden {{was told}} to pack his {{belongings}} since {{he was to be}} reassigned to 29 Squadron RFC flying Airco DH.2 scouts. McCudden was pleased to be flying scouts, finding it [...] "light after flying the F.E." [...] McCudden soon found from pilots that the machine was not popular and had to be handled with care. Nevertheless, while on patrol between ArmentiÃ¨res and Ypres on 6 September 1916 he scored his first victory. He engaged an all-white Albatros B.II, and shot it down. He then chased another but it escaped through superior speed. Confirmation of his victory was given three days later by an I ANZAC Corps unit. It had crashed on the Gheluve-Mennin road at the time and place of his claim. McCudden nearly added to this score the following day. He engaged a Fokker monoplane but his gun jammed. <b>Switching</b> <b>off</b> his engine, he rectified the damage but the Fokker pilot took the opportunity to pursue him.
