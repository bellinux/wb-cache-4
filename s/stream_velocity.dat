Brown's Creek {{flows through}} the Brown's Creek Park and Nature Preserve northwest of Stillwater, then proceeds east to it confluence with the St. Croix River. At one time in its history, Brown’s Creek was diverted into McKusick Lake, which supplied water to Stillwater residents. By 1955 fisheries managers recognized that warm lake water was putting a strain on the trout population in Brown’s Creek. In {{an effort to reduce}} water temperatures for the benefit of trout, a dike was constructed to separate the stream from the lake and return the flow back to Brown’s Creek. The dike still exists today. In 1999, Browns Creek underwent a re-route in the fall of 1999 that shortened this section of the stream from 5,130 feet to 2,000 feet in order to lower water temperatures by avoiding water warming in previous meander through a wetland just north of Lake McKusick, increasing <b>stream</b> <b>velocity</b> and decreasing organic matter in the stream. This project by the city of Stillwater and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources also restored natural riparian vegetation as the creek traverses the Oak Glen Golf Course.|$|E

The experimental acoustical fields were produced by three different 4 mm diameter flat and focused transducers driven by the transmitter generating the average acoustic power within the range from 1 �W to 6 mW. The <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> was measured along the ultrasonic beam from 0 to 2 cm. Streaming was induced in a solution of water and corn starch. The experimental results showed that for a given acoustic power the <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> was independent of the starch density in water, changed from 0. 3 to 40 grams of starch in 1 lof distilled water. For applied acoustic powers, the <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> changed linearly from 0. 2 to 40 mm/s. Both, the theoretical solutions for plane and focused waves and the experimental results were in good agreement. The <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> field was also visualised using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) and two different evaluation methods. The first based on the FFT-based cross-correlation analysis between small sections for each pair of images and the second employing the algorithm of searching for local displacements between several images. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|At the epoch of decoupling, cosmic baryons had {{supersonic}} velocities {{relative to}} the dark matter that were coherent on large scales. These velocities subsequently slow the growth of small-scale structure and, via feedback processes, can influence the formation of larger galaxies. We {{examine the effect of}} <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> on the galaxy correlation function, including all leading-order contributions for the first time. We find that the impact on the BAO peak is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of ~ 5) over the results of previous investigations, with the primary new effect due to advection: if a galaxy retains memory of the primordial <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity,</b> it does so at its Lagrangian, rather than Eulerian, position. Since correlations in the <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a significant shift in the observed BAO position. If <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> impact tracer density at the 1 % level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO scale is shifted by approximately 0. 5 %. This new effect, which is required to preserve Galilean invariance, greatly increases the importance of including <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> in the analysis of upcoming BAO measurements and opens a new window to the astrophysics of galaxy formation.

Various studies suggest that such <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> change the halo statistics and also influence the formation of Population III stars. In this study, we aim to explore the impact of <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> on the formation of supermassive black holes at z> 10 via the direct collapse scenario. To accomplish this goal, we perform cosmological large eddy simulations for two halos of a few times 10 ^ 7 M_ with initial <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> of 3, 6 and 9 km/s. These massive primordial halos illuminated by the strong Lyman Werner flux are the potential cradles {{for the formation of}} direct collapse seed black holes. To study the evolution for longer times, we employ sink particles and track the accretion for 10, 000 years. Our findings show that higher <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> increase the circular velocities from about 14 km/s to 16 km/s. They also delay the collapse of halos for a few million years, but do not have any significant impact on the halo properties such as turbulent energy, radial velocity, density and accretion rates. Sink particles of about ∼ 10 ^ 5 M_ are formed {{at the end of our}} simulations and no clear distribution of sink masses is observed in the presence of streaming motions. It is further found that the impact of <b>streaming</b> <b>velocities</b> is less severe in massive halos compared to the minihalos as reported in the previous studies.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of a high baryonic <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> on the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) with the help of cosmological simulations carried out using the moving mesh code arepo. We show that a <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> that is as large as three times the root-mean-squared value is effective at suppressing the formation of H_ 2 -cooled minihaloes, while still allowing larger atomic cooling haloes (ACHs) to form. We find that enough H_ 2 forms in the centre of these ACHs to effectively cool the gas, demonstrating that a high <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> by itself cannot produce the conditions required for DCBH formation. However, we argue that high <b>streaming</b> <b>velocity</b> regions do provide an ideal environment for the formation of DCBHs in close pairs of ACHs (the "synchronised halo" model). Due to the absence of star formation in minihaloes, the gas remains chemically pristine until the ACHs form. If two such haloes form with only a small separation in time and space, then the one forming stars earlier can provide enough ultraviolet radiation to suppress H_ 2 cooling in the other, allowing it to collapse to form a DCBH.
