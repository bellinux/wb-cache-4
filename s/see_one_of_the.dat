In the good ending, Atlantis succumbs to the eruption of the still active volcano as the duo flees from the city. The final scene depicts Indiana kissing Sophia {{on top of the}} escape submarine, to comfort himself for the lack of evidence for their discovery.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Hibbard-Swenson Company {{chartered}} {{the newly}} built motor schooner King & Winge to carry relief {{supplies to the}} Belvedere and complete the normal trading run. King & Winge became stuck in the ice near Point Barrow and bent her propeller. The ship was extricated by the revenue cutter Bear on August 22. They met the Belvedere at Point Barrow, delivered the supplies, took on some crewmen from the Elvira, and subsequently put into at Nome August 30. Bear arrived the same day and reported that its attempt to rescue {{the crew of the}} Karluk from Wrangel Island off the northeast Siberian coast had been thwarted by bad weather, ice and low fuel. Stefansson's former secretary Burt McConnell then requested that King & Winge attempt a rescue; this request was reiterated by Captain Bartlett of the Karluk. Swenson set out for Wrangel Island in the King & Winge with A.P. Jochimsen as Master. They stopped at East Cape, Siberia, and picked up an umiak and a party of natives to man it, in case they had to cross ice interspersed with open water. As they approached the beach in the umiak, the native crew was alarmed to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Karluk survivors vigorously pumping a rifle, but Swenson reassured them in their language. They removed a total of twelve expedition survivors from two separate camps. The survivors included an Inupiaq couple and their two children. The survivors were later transferred to the Bear.|$|E
500|$|Back at the raft, Michael and Sawyer <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raft's pontoons, {{and they}} decide to board it. Sawyer swims to the pontoon, giving Michael his gun in case the shark appears. When it does, Michael fires several times, {{apparently}} injuring the shark. Michael then joins Sawyer on the pontoon, and when the morning breaks, he cries, realizing {{that he should not}} have brought Walt with him on the raft, and blames himself for his son's kidnapping. At this point, Sawyer notices that they are back near the island. When they wash ashore, they meet Jin running toward them, hands tied behind his back, shouting the word [...] "Others", and fleeing a group holding him captive.|$|E

500|$|The {{decade of}} the 1980s is perhaps more closely {{associated}} with the leveraged buyout than any decade before or since. [...] For the first time, the public became aware of the ability of private equity to affect mainstream companies and [...] "corporate raiders" [...] and [...] "hostile takeovers" [...] entered the public consciousness. [...] The decade would <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest booms in private equity culminating in the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which would reign as the largest leveraged buyout transaction for nearly 17 years. [...] In 1980, the private equity industry would raise approximately $2.4 billion of annual investor commitments {{and by the end of}} the decade in 1989 that figure stood at $21.9 billion marking the tremendous growth experienced.|$|E
500|$|Sovetsky Soyuz (—Soviet Union) was {{formally}} laid down 15 July 1938 in Shipyard Nr. 189 (Ordzhonikidze) in Leningrad, although {{evidence suggests that}} construction actually began in January 1939 after her slipway was completed, the necessary cranes were in place, and working drawings had been completed. When the war began she {{was estimated to be}} 21.19% complete, with [...] of steel assembled on the slip. She was only lightly damaged by German air attacks and bombardments, and, as some material had been used during the Siege of Leningrad, she was estimated to be 19.5% complete {{after the end of the}} war. Some thought was given to completing her, but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war. Stalin's expressed desire to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Project 23-class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her; this was ordered on 29 May 1948 and was well underway by April 1949.|$|E
500|$|Star Trek Into Darkness {{director}} J.J. Abrams {{stated in}} September 2013 {{that he was}} hurt by the game's poor reception and quality, {{saying that it was}} [...] "obviously a big disappointment". He also claimed it hurt Star Trek Into Darkness by being released shortly before the film. Later, in November 2013, Digital Extremes creative director Stephen Sinclair said to IGN that he was [...] "kind of surprised [...] to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most awesome, popular and successful film directors working today slagging on that project". Video game insiders linked the poor reception of the game to the departure of Brian Miller in his role as the Senior Vice President of Paramount, as he had been heavily involved in the marketing for the game. Insiders had specifically attributed issues with the game to the [...] "ego" [...] of both Miller and his predecessor Lesinski, [...] "insisted this hallowed and cherished franchise was a key brand extension in the gaming vertical only to be compromised by disastrous results and reviews".|$|E

2500|$|The {{alternate}} U.S. {{version of}} Lammy's Stage 6, however, drew mixed praise and criticism. IGN called it [...] "a far off island [...] has that Japan-idol-talk influence... So {{if you were}} expecting to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> levels being in hell, well, it's not in there." [...] Similarly, GameSpot's Gerstmann made a later update on his March 26, 1999, review by commenting on the U.S. alterations to Stage 6, exclaiming, [...] "It doesn't really affect the game too much, since much of the game doesn't {{make a lot of}} sense to begin with." ...|$|E

In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Remagen {{during the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Germany {{resulted in the}} unexpected capture of the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine and likely shortened World War II in Europe. After capturing the Siegfried Line, the 9th Armored Division of the U.S. First Army had advanced unexpectedly quickly towards the Rhine. They were very surprised to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last bridges across the Rhine still standing. The Germans had wired the bridge with about [...] of demolition charges. When they tried to blow it up, {{only a portion of}} the explosives detonated. U.S. forces captured the bridge and rapidly expanded their first bridgehead across the Rhine, two weeks before Operation Plunder. The GIs' actions prevented the Germans from regrouping east of the Rhine and consolidating their positions.|$|E
2500|$|The Marlboro {{township}} {{center has}} historically been considered an area around the intersection of Main Street (Route 79) and School Road. In the late 19th century the intersection held two hotels (both of them are now gone), general store (was on the lot of the current fire department building), and Post Office (was on the lot of a current Chinese Restaurant). Behind the current small mini-mart {{on the corner of}} this intersection, you can still <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original barns from the early 19th century. However, Marlboro no longer has any official town center and can be considered an example of suburban sprawl. Efforts are underway to create an official [...] "Village Center" [...] and multiple proposals have come forward in recent discussions. Current vision statements suggest the creation of a pedestrian-friendly, mixed use Village Center, with an emphasis on walkability and traffic calming.|$|E
2500|$|After the marshes, {{they then}} cross the desolation {{and come to}} the Black Gate. [...] At night, Sam overhears Gollum talking to himself and {{plotting}} to get the Ring back. [...] Unable to do so because of the promise he made to Frodo, he resolves to allow something he refers to only as [...] "She" [...] {{to take care of his}} problem. Sam realizes that the Ring masters Gollum more than hunger. Gollum persuades Frodo and Sam not to enter the Black Gate, where they would have been surely caught. Gollum tells them of a secret entrance to Mordor. Thus, they head south into Gondor's province of Ithilien, where they get to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "oliphants" [...] in a battle between the men of Gondor and the Haradrim. [...] They are then accosted by a group of Gondorian rangers led by Faramir, the brother of Boromir. Frodo learns from Faramir of Boromir's death. Faramir and the Rangers lead Frodo and Sam into a secret hideout where Sam accidentally reveals to Faramir that Frodo carries the One Ring. As a result of this, Frodo reveals the plan to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Unlike his brother Boromir, Faramir resists the temptation of the Ring. Later that night, Gollum is captured diving for fish into the sacred pool. Frodo negotiates Gollum's freedom with Faramir. The following morning Faramir allows them to go on their way, but warns them that Gollum may know more about the secret entrance than he has been telling them.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 October 2009, a {{competition}} called the [...] "Up to Now Pub Quiz" [...] was launched on Facebook. Fans {{were required to}} create teams of five, and were posed with ten questions, related to the band's entire career, each week. The team with the most correct answers at the end will fly to London to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, with a certain part of travel cost paid. The team will be allotted their own private box at the venue, and {{will get a chance}} to meet the band afterward. Along the same lines, a Swiss radio station 20 Minuten hosted a similar competition for listeners. They had a pair of tickets for the concert for the Royal Albert Hall concert of 24 November to give away. All flight and hotel accommodation costs were paid for by the radio station. UK radio station Xfm organized {{a competition}} called [...] "Xfm's Snow Patrol Bad Photoshop Challenge", with ten pairs of tickets were up to win. These tickets would enable fans to see the band rehearse in a yet-unnamed location in Brighton at the eve of the Reworked Tour. The challenge was to associate five photoshopped pictures with Snow Patrol song titles. The competition will end on 10 November 2009. A further fifteen pairs of tickets will be given away on air. Tickets for the intimate acoustic show in London for the promotion of Up to Now could only be obtained via two competitions, one organized on Play.com and the other on the band's official website. Both involved answering a simple question. For the HMV singing and performance, wristbands were available from 9am on 3 December 2009. One band was assigned to one person, however, it was not necessary to have one to see the band perform. The bands were required only {{to gain access to the}} signing. Tickets for the mini-festival at Ward Park will go on pre-sale on 9 December 2009, and on general sale on the 11th, priced at £44.|$|E
