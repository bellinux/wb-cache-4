5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbs was also mottled brown while the rear <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thighs were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of}} the underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|The Ganeshida have a pair {{of small}} oral lobes and {{a pair of}} tentacles. The body is {{circular}} rather than oval in cross-section, and the pharynx extends over the inner <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lobes.|$|E
5|$|These starfish are deep-sea {{dwelling}} {{and have}} particularly flexible arms. The inner dorso-lateral <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms contain characteristic longitudinal muscle bands. In some species, the tube feet lack suckers.|$|E
40|$|A {{sharp edge}} is formed on an optical device {{by placing the}} optical device in a holding mechanism; {{grinding}} one surface so that it and a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism are co-planar; and polishing both <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism with felt until an edge on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism obtains a desired sharpness...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} forming a light {{emitting}} diode includes: (a) growing epitaxially an epitaxial film over an epitaxial substrate; (b) roughening an upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epitaxial film; (c) forming a top electrode on <b>the</b> roughened upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epitaxial film; (d) detachably attaching a temporary substrate over <b>the</b> roughened upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epitaxial film; (e) roughening <b>the</b> lower <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epitaxial film; (f) disposing <b>the</b> roughened lower <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epitaxial film on a reflective top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> an electrically conductive permanent substrate; (g) filling an optical adhesive in a gap between <b>the</b> roughened lower <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epitaxial film and <b>the</b> reflective top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permanent substrate; and (h) after the step (g), removing the temporary substrate from the epitaxial film...|$|R
50|$|The talocalcaneonavicular joint is a {{ball and}} socket joint: <b>the</b> rounded head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talus being {{received}} into the concavity formed by <b>the</b> posterior <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navicular, <b>the</b> anterior articular <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calcaneus, and <b>the</b> upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plantar calcaneonavicular ligament.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and nozzles to cover exterior <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship with {{a spray of}} salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Confederate Memorial {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} restoration. The monument had darkened due to weathering. The <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memorial were sanded and sealed for future protection. This restoration effort was funded through charitable contributions. The {{names of the}} contributors were inscribed within the same treasurer's book used to record the memorial's inaugural contributions on June6, 1866. The monument's restoration cost totaled $2,850 USD.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the theropod clade Abelisauridae, which is considered a family in Linnaean taxonomy. Along with the family Noasauridae, abelisaurids are included in the superfamily Abelisauroidea, which is in turn a subdivision of the infraorder Ceratosauria. Abelisaurids are known for their tall skulls with blunt snouts, extensive sculpturing on the outer <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facial bones (convergent with carcharodontosaurids), very reduced (atrophied) forelimbs (convergent with tyrannosaurids), and stocky hindlimb proportions, among other features.|$|E
5|$|Parsnip {{leaves are}} {{sometimes}} tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves. The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means.|$|E

5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut into the food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stems or leaves where the thrips have fed.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E

30|$|A third {{strategy}} is to locate the Au NPs on <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes. The particles are either tethered to <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes or directly deposited on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes <b>surface</b> by lipid vesicle metallization process. On the deposited Au NPs, a gold shell can be further grown.|$|R

5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E

40|$|An {{article is}} welded, as in weld repair of a defect, by {{positioning}} a weld lift-off block {{at a location}} on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article adjacent to <b>the</b> intended location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weldment on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article. The weld lift-off block has a wedge shape including a base contacting <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article, and an upper face angled upwardly from the base from a base leading edge. A weld pool is formed on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by directly heating <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article using a heat source. The heat source is moved relative to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article and onto <b>the</b> upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block by crossing <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wedge, without discontinuing <b>the</b> direct heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by the heat source. <b>The</b> heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article with the heat source is discontinued only after the heat source is directly heating <b>the</b> upper face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block, and not the article...|$|R
50|$|Purkinje {{images are}} {{reflections}} <b>of</b> objects from <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye. They are {{also known as}} Purkinje reflexes and as Purkinje-Sanson images. At least four Purkinje images are usually visible. The first Purkinje image (P1) is the reflection from <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cornea. The second Purkinje image (P2) is the reflection from <b>the</b> inner <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cornea. The third Purkinje image (P3) is the reflection from <b>the</b> outer (anterior) <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens. The fourth Purkinje image (P4) is the reflection from <b>the</b> inner (posterior) <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens. Unlike the others, P4 is an inverted image.|$|R
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E
