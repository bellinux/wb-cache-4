5|$|The Teaneck Community Charter School (TCCS) had a 2011–12 {{enrollment}} of 306 students in Kindergarten through eighth grade with 26.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a <b>student–teacher</b> <b>ratio</b> of 11.77:1. TCCS is {{a charter school}} that operates independently of the Teaneck Public Schools under a charter granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education, which was renewed for five years in 2012. Admission {{is open to the}} public for available slots (after returning students and siblings of existing students are entered) and offers an after school program and summer camp. As the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of non-resident students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the district; the balance of funding comes directly from the state of New Jersey. The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009–10 school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – We {{investigate}} how key {{school and community}} characteristics interact with the characteristics of individual students and families in determining the enrollment patterns {{in public and private}} schools. Using unique, nationally-representative, individual-level data, we find evidence that a number of factors plausibly influenced by public policy (e. g., school-district concentration, <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios,</b> and local violent crime rates) have powerful effects on the composition of public and private schools...|$|R
50|$|Classes {{with too}} many {{students}} are often disrupting to education. Also, too many students in a class results in a diverse field of students, {{with varying degrees of}} learning ability. Consequently, the class will spend time for less academic students to assimilate the information, when that time could be better spent progressing through the curriculum. In this way, <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios</b> are compelling arguments for advanced or honors classes.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} most {{vocational}} training is weak. A few community colleges with limited capacity of 200-300 students have high applicant-place ratio (especially for nursing and the UNRWA Gaza Training Centre). The rest {{of community colleges}} have only around one applicant-place ratio. Manual skilled occupations continue to have low status and only the least academically able {{students are expected to}} enroll at TVET institutions. The majority of colleges have low <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios</b> and high unit cost.|$|R

50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{development of}} the grammar school was by Joseph Lancaster and Andrew Bell who developed the monitorial system.

50|$|Using {{property}} taxes to fund public schools contributes to school inequality. Lower-funded schools {{are more likely}} to have (1) lower-paid teachers; (2) higher <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios,</b> meaning less individual attention for each student; (3) older books; (4) fewer extracurricular activities, which have been shown to increase academic achievement; (5) poorly maintained school buildings and grounds; and (6) less access to services like school nursing and social workers. All of these factors can affect student performance and perpetuate inequalities between students of different races.|$|R
40|$|As {{charter schools}} {{continue}} to proliferate across United States, {{their impact on}} the public education system is becoming an increasingly important public policy question. Charter school proponents argue that combined pressures of consumer choice and market competition will induce traditional public schools to respond by providing higher quality education and promoting innovation and equity. Skeptics worry that charter schools pose risks of segregating students by race and economic level, and reducing per-pupil resources available to traditional public schools. This dissertation provides a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of charter schools on regular public schools by addressing the following questions: 1) How do the charter schools affect the racial, ethnic and cosio-economic distribution, <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios</b> and achievement of traditional public schools? 2) How do the size and scope of competitive effects vary according to different measures of competition? 	Using two-period panel data from the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core Data (CCD) for traditional public schools in Florida, New Jersey, Texas and Ohio, I compare changes in racial and ethnic distribution, <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios</b> and achievement in public schools that do and do not face competition. I use a variation of the difference-in-differences (DD) estimation strategy to study the effect of charter schools on the outcome measures. The findings from the study suggest that introduction of charter schools in the educational landscape has affected student distributions, and at least in some cases, <b>student-teacher</b> <b>ratios</b> and the performance of traditional public schools. Charter schools seem to contribute to declines in the share of non-Hispanic white students in traditional public schools in all four states. The results show variation in other outcome areas across states and competition measures. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring what will happen to non-choosers in traditional schools as well as the role of considering state context and empirical measures while generalizing from charter school studies.
