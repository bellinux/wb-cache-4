An analysis of statistical data from Eurostat, enhanced with input from various industrial federations, revealed that merely six types of wastes {{are responsible for the}} lion's share of energy embedded in all the waste currently sent to incineration and/or landfill. They include in particular household and similar waste as well as <b>sorting</b> <b>residues,</b> which jointly account for nearly four fifths of the energy contained in all landfilled waste, and which together with wood waste comprise almost two thirds of the energy contained in all waste sent for incineration. Techniques for improving energy recovery were discussed for each of the five main categories of waste-to-energy processes: combustion plants, waste incineration plants, cement and lime kilns, anaerobic digestion plants and others. Figures from 2013 / 2014 showed that the three middle categories accounted together for an estimated total of 676 PJ annual mixed energy outputs from waste. Using the technical options available today, and without taking into account any possible changes to the types and amounts of waste currently sent for energy recovery, this value could be increased by more than a quarter. However, future developments in waste generation and waste management may possibly lead to an increase of energy recovery by incineration for household and similar waste as well as for <b>sorting</b> <b>residues,</b> an increase in energy recovery by anaerobic digestion for animal and vegetal wastes and a decrease of the amounts sent for energy recovery for several other wastes, including source separated wastes such as wood waste.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the performances of}} the energy recovery pathway from the residual waste based on {{the production of a}} Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) to be exploited via co-combustion in a cement kiln. The SRF is produced in a single stream Mechanical-Biological Treatment plant, where bio-drying of the waste is followed by mechanical refining in order to fulfil the quality requirements by the cement kilns. Peculiar of this MBT is the fact that <b>sorting</b> <b>residues</b> are disposed in a nearby landfill, managed according to a bioreactor approach, where landfill gas is collected for electric energy recovery. A detailed mass and energy balance of the system is presented based on one year operational data, followed by its Life Cycle Assessment. Results show that the system is energetically and environmentally effective, with most of the impacts being more than compensated by the savings of materials and energy. Major role in determining such outcome is the displacement of petcoke in the cement kiln, both in terms of its fossil CO 2 emissions and of its life cycle impacts, including the trans-oceanic transport. To check the robustness of the results, two sensitivity analyses are performed on the landfill gas collection efficiency and on the avoided electric energy mix...|$|E

The efficiency of pre-processing can be affected by high losses to undesignated output fractions. Standard batch tests usually provide mass balances and are a good proxy for bulk materials balances (iron/steel, aluminum, plastics). This article aims at harmonizing methodologies and recommends a strategy for further study in pre-processing on a plant scale. We have developed an “extended batch test” method, which should help to • describe the fates of materials and elements, • assess the quality of output fractions, • identify access points for critical metals and other valuable elements to enable their recovery. A methodical approach was compiled with common material flow analysis methods and an extended set of methods, which improve the reliability via the assessment of uncertainties. This applies to systematic effects and random effects. This extended batch test was performed with a 40 Mg Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE) batch to trace the flows of industrial base metals, precious metals and critical metals in a WEEE pre-processing plant. Results show that one-third of the input was separated and sorted manually, while the remaining material was subsequently crushed and automatically sorted.

The data was generated by gravimetric determination of the sorting products, sampling and sorting analysis. Since the particle size of beverage cartons is larger than 120. mm, a modified sampling plan was implemented and targeted multiple sampling (3 - 11 individual samplings) and a total sample size of respectively 1200. l (ca. 60. kg) for the BC-products and of about 2400 l (ca. 120. kg) for material-heterogeneous mixed plastics (MP) and <b>sorting</b> <b>residue</b> products. The results infer that the quantification of the beverage carton yield in the process, i. e., by including all product-containing material streams, can be specified only with considerable fluctuation ranges. Consequently, the total assessment, regarding all product streams, is rather qualitative than quantitative. Irregular operation conditions as well as unfavorable sampling conditions and capacity overloads are likely causes for high confidence intervals. From the results of the current study, recommendations can basically be derived for a better sampling in LP-processing plants. Despite of the suboptimal statistical results, the results indicate very clear that the plants show definite optimisation potentials with regard to the yield of beverage cartons as well as the required product purity.

Positive sort literals define the sort structure for sorted unification. Sorted unification exploits the sort restrictions of variables. As the occurrence of sort literals is not restricted, it might be necessary to add additional literals to resolvents and factors and to dynamically change the set of positive sort literals used by sorted unification during the deduction process.

40|$|A {{modelling}} methodology using a leachate {{source term}} has been produced for estimating the timescales for achieving environmental equilibrium status for landfilled waste. Results are reported as {{the period of}} active management required for modelled scenarios of non-flushed and flushed sites {{for a range of}} pre-filling treatments. The base scenario against which results were evaluated was raw municipal solid waste (MSW) for which only cadmium failed to reach equilibrium. Flushed raw MSW met our criteria for stabilisation with active leachate management for 40 years, subject to each of the leachate species being present at or below their average UK concentrations. Stable non-reactive wastes, meeting EU waste acceptance criteria, fared badly in the non-flushed scenario, with only two species stabilising after a management period within 1000 years and the majority requiring > 2000 years of active leachate management. The flushing scenarios showed only a marginal improvement, with arsenic still persisting beyond 2000 years management even with an additional 500 mm y− 1 of infiltration. The stabilisation time for mechanically <b>sorted</b> organic <b>residues</b> (without flushing) was high, and even with flushing, arsenic and chromium appeared to remain a problem.

The intense composting option with minimal flushing appeared to create a scenario where equilibrium could be achieved.

40|$|Introduction In November 2011 archaeologists of City of Rotterdam Archaeological Service (BOOR) {{conducted}} underwater {{research in}} the Yangtze harbour, Rotterdam Maasvlakte, The Netherlands. The research {{was carried out by}} order of Port of Rotterdam Authority and supervised by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands. The results of geological, botanical, zoological and archaeological analyses of the retrieved material generated new information on the occupation of a relatively high river dune by prehistoric hunter-gatherers, and on the development history of the surrounding landscape ca. 9, 000 years ago. Methods Rather than employing divers the underwater investigations were carried out on board a vessel using a wire-operated, horizontal closing grab. Three small trenches (total area ca. 375 m²) were excavated in layers in a fairly controlled fashion. Underwater excavations cannot achieve the same level of precision as is possible on land, but the many soil core samples taken in the project’s preliminary phase allowed detailed descriptions of the geomorphological stratigraphy. The excavation resulted in 316 bulk bags of soil. All soil was sieved on land, using sieves with mesh sizes of 10 and 2 mm, after which archaeologists and volunteers carefully <b>sorted</b> the <b>residues,</b> documenting a total of ca. 46, 000 finds. Results Plenty of Mesolithic occupation remains were retrieved at all three grab locations, from depths ranging between 17 to 21 m below modern MSL. The finds span the age range from ca. 8400 to 6500 BC, when the site transformed from dryland (an inland dune) to wetland (drowned delta subsurface). At the foot of the inland dune, the depositional conditions allowed for excellent preservation of bone, charcoal and plant material as well as stone artefacts. The site provides an unusually rich and detailed body of evidence on environmental conditions and the Middle Mesolithic palaeo-economy. The landscape ecotones around the site yielded an abundance of food while gradually being transformed, due to rising sea levels, from a valley containing the rivers Rhine and Meuse into the mouth area of those rivers. At 6500 BC, the site was finally transgressed: drowned in an estuary and swallowed up by the sea. Conclusion The Rotterdam Yangtze Harbour research project demonstrates the preservation of Mesolithic sites along the river Rhine, at depths in nowadays coastal and offshore areas. Furthermore, it demonstrates the feasibility of archaeological investigation of such submerged sites, even at depths of 18 to 20 m beneath sea, lake and harbour floors. Never before had such a submerged site been excavated at such a great depth. The scientific report (in English) will appear in the autumn of 2014, providing a full description of all finds as well as their landscape context...|$|R
40|$|Information, in {{addition}} to that provided by signal sequences, for translocation across the plasma membrane is thought to be present in exported proteins of Escherichia coli. Such information must also exist for the localization of such proteins. To determine the nature of this information, overlapping inframe deletions have been constructed in the ompA gene which codes for a 325 -residue major outer membrane protein. In addition, one deletion, encoding only the NH 2 -terminal part of the protein up to residue 160, was prepared. The location of each product was determined by immunoelectron microscopy. Proteins missing residues 4 - 45, 43 - 84, 46 - 227, 86 - 227 or 160 - 325 of the mature protein were all efficiently translocated across the plasma membrane. The first two proteins were found in the outer membrane, the others in the periplasmic space. It has been proposed that export and sorting signals consist of relatively small amino acid sequences near the NH 2 terminus of an outer membrane protein. On the basis of sequence homologies it has also been suggested that such proteins possess a common sorting signal. The locations of the partially deleted proteins described here show that a unique export signal does not exist in the OmpA protein. The proposed common <b>sorting</b> signal spans <b>residues</b> 1 - 14 of OmpA. Since this region is not essential for routing the protein, the existence of a common sorting signal is doubtful.

40|$|Background: By {{virtue of}} their shared ancestry, {{homologous}} sequences are similar in their structure and function. Consequently, multiple sequence alignments are routinely used to identify trends that relate to function. This type of analysis is particularly productive when it is combined with structural and phylogenetic analysis. Results: Here we describe the release of PFAAT version 2. 0, a tool for editing, analyzing, and annotating multiple sequence alignments. Support for multiple annotations is {{a key component of}} this release as it provides a framework for most of the new functionalities. The sequence annotations are accessible from the alignment and tree, where they are typically used to label sequences or hyperlink them to related databases. Sequence annotations can be created manually or extracted automatically from UniProt entries. Once a multiple sequence alignment is populated with sequence annotations, sequences can be easily selected and sorted through a sophisticated search dialog. The selected sequences can be further analyzed using statistical methods that explicitly model relationships between the sequence annotations and residue properties. Residue annotations are accessible from the alignment viewer and are typically used to designate binding sites or properties for a particular residue. Residue annotations are also searchable, and allow one to quickly select alignment columns for further sequence analysis, e. g. computing percent identities. Other features include: novel algorithms to compute sequence conservation, mapping conservation scores to a 3 D structure in Jmol, displaying secondary structure elements, and <b>sorting</b> sequences by <b>residue</b> composition. Conclusion: PFAAT provides a framework whereby end-users can specify knowledge for a protein family in the form of annotation.

Virol. 70 : 6508 – 6515, 1996). In this report, we have analyzed the sequences in the NA TMD involved in apical transport and raft association by making chimeric TMDs from NA and human transferring receptor (TR) TMDs and by mutating the NA TMD sequences. Our {{results show that the}} COOH-terminal half of the NA TMD (amino acids [aa] 19 to 35) was significantly involved in raft association, as determined by Triton X- 100 (TX- 100) resistance. However, in addition, the highly conserved residues at the extreme NH 2 terminus of the NA TMD were also critical for TX- 100 resistance. On the other hand, 19 residues (aa 9 to 27) at the NH 2 terminus of the NA TMD were sufficient for apical <b>sorting.</b> Amino acid <b>residues</b> 14 to 18 and 27 to 31 had the least effect on apical transport, whereas mutations in the amino acid residues 11 to 13, 23 to 26, and 32 to 35 resulted in altered polarity for the mutant proteins. These results indicated that multiple regions in the NA TMD were involved in apical transport. Furthermore, these results support the idea that the signals for apical sorting and raft association, although residing in the NA TMD, are not identical and vary independently and that the NA TMD also possesses an apical determinant(s) which can interact with apical sorting machineries outside the lipid raft...|$|R

This departure is directly inspired by {{a critique of the}} Meno found in the works by Soren Kierkegaard written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus. The central implication of Kierkegaard's influence for Tractatus interpretation is that thought [...] -or thinking [...] -referred to in the Tractatus of necessity extends beyond the limits of language. There are at present two competing interpretative readings of the Tractatus in the literature. One reading [...] -referred to as the "Standard" reading since it is propounded by almost all notable Wittgenstein scholars, e. g., Pears, Hacker, McGuinness, Anscombe, Rhees, Malcohn [...] -has it that the "mystical" sections of the Tractatus must be, to some degree, taken seriously. The other reading [...] -a "New" reading advocated most prominently by Winch, Diamond, and Conant [...] -argues that the Standard reading is self-contradictory in that it maintains that the limits of language and those of thought are the same while it simultaneously maintains that there is a <b>sort</b> of Mystical <b>residue</b> left over even after the Tractatus has (according to the dictates of section 6. 54) been "thrown away". The New reading sees Wittgenstein's point as being precisely {{that there is no such}} left-over residue and that we must accept this. Both readings are however incorrect in regard to Wittgenstein's view of limits in the Tractatus. While the New reading takes somewhat seriously the influence of Kierkegaard on the Tractatus, it asserts that a Kierkegaardian influence bolsters the New reading's view of the mystical as well as its view that language and thought share the same limits in the Tractatus. The opposite is in fact the case. Das Mystische corresponds to Kierkegaard's "absolutely unknown" that language [...] -but not thought [...] -runs up against as a limit. Wittgenstein himself alludes to this correspondence in conversation with members of the Vienna Circle in 1929. As such, if the influence of Kierkegaard is to be seen in its proper light, the problem is not with the Standard reading of Das Mystische, but rather with the view that the limits of thought and language in the Tractatus are the same. For Kierkegaard, unless thought extends beyond the limit of language there is no conceivable nexus for the subject or the divine. This is precisely his critique of Plato's Meno in Fragments. That this view is also the bedrock of the Tractatus' metaphysics is what the present thesis argues is the proper "Kierkegaardian reading" of Wittgenstein's Tractatus...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{small vessel}} disease-related brain lesions such as white matter lesions and lacunes are common {{findings}} of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} in the elderly. These lesions {{are thought to be}} major contributors to disability in old age, and risk factors that include age and hypertension have been established. The radiological, histopathologic and clinical phenotypes of age-related cerebral small vessel disease remarkably resemble autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy, which is caused by mutations in NOTCH 3. We hypothesized that genetic variations in NOTCH 3 also play a role in age-related cerebral small vessel disease. We directly sequenced all 33 exons, the promoter and 3 ′-untranslated region of NOTCH 3 in 195 participants with either coalescent white matter lesions or lacunes and compared the results to 82 randomly selected participants with no focal changes on magnetic resonance images in the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study. We detected nine common and 33 rare single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 20 were novel. All common single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in the entire cohort (n[*]=[*] 888), and four of them, rs 1043994, rs 10404382, rs 10423702 and rs 1043997, were associated significantly with both the presence and progression of white matter lesions. The association was confined to hypertensives, a result which we replicated in the Cohorts for Heart and Ageing Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium on an independent sample of 4773 stroke-free hypertensive elderly individuals of European descent (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). The 33 rare single nucleotide polymorphisms were scattered over the NOTCH 3 gene with three being located in the promoter region, 24 in exons (18 non-synonymous), three in introns and three in the 3 ′-untranslated region. None of the single nucleotide polymorphisms affected a cysteine <b>residue.</b> <b>Sorting</b> Intolerant From Tolerant, PolyPhen 2 analyses and protein structure simulation consistently predicted six of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (H 170 R, P 496 L, V 1183 M, L 1518 M, D 1823 N and V 1952 M) to be functional, with four being exclusively or mainly detected in subjects with severe white matter lesions. In four individuals with rare non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, we noted anterior temporal lobe hyperintensity, hyperintensity in the external capsule, lacunar infarcts or subcortical lacunar lesions. None of the observed abnormalities were specific to cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy. This is the first comprehensive study investigating (i) the frequency of NOTCH 3 variations in community-dwelling elderly and (ii) their effect on cerebral small vessel disease related magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes. We show that the NOTCH 3 gene is highly variable with both common and rare single nucleotide polymorphisms spreading across the gene, and that common variants at the NOTCH 3 gene increase the risk of age-related white matter lesions in hypertensives. Additional investigations are required to explore the biological mechanisms underlying the observed association...|$|R
