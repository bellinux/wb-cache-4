5|$|Odd Horten is an overcautious 67-year-old {{man about}} to retire after forty {{years as a}} train driver on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he goes through a meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time driving the train to Bergen. When he gets there, he makes small talk with Svea, who owns the {{boarding}} house where he stays when there and whom he now may never <b>see</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

25|$|The High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show {{a rapidly}} {{increasing}} population of Europe, which caused great {{social and political}} change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not <b>see</b> <b>again</b> in some areas until the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Some {{photographers who}} came later complained to Seedman {{that they had}} been unfairly {{deprived}} of the same photo opportunity their competitors had gotten. He obligingly brought Dellernia out for them to <b>see</b> <b>again,</b> but the defendant had his head low. So Seedman, knowing he would regret doing so, forced Dellernia's head up and held him by the chin so his face would be visible.|$|E

Unlike {{her relationship with}} Tara, Willow is able to hold a separate identity while with Kennedy.

25|$|In 1973, he {{traveled}} to the Soviet Union, his first visit back since he left in 1922. The Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow had a special exhibition for the occasion of his visit.

In St. Petersburg, he was reunited {{with two of his}} sisters, whom he had not seen for more than 50 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationships}} between India {{in the days}} of the British Raj and the US were thin. Swami Vivekananda promoted Yoga and Vedanta in America at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, during the World's Fair in 1893. Mark Twain visited India in 1896 and described it in his travelogue Following the Equator with both revulsion and attraction before concluding that India was the only foreign land he dreamed about or longed to <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> Regarding India, Americans learned more from English writer Rudyard Kipling. Mahatma Gandhi had an important influence on the philosophy of non-violence promoted by Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Just {{about to}} set off on a new voyage, the sea-captain Adhémar de Feuilles-Mortes plans to arrange the {{marriage}} of his ward Antoinette to his nephew René. Unfortunately Antoinette is {{not in love with}} René; her love is René’s friend the young lawyer Frontignac. Equally, René, a musketeer travelling between one exploit and the next, is desperate to <b>see</b> <b>again</b> a Creole girl whom he met while he was on Guadeloupe. But in spite of this his uncle Adhémar insists. However the admiral summons the commander to sea, and no sooner is he out of port and sight – presumably {{for a couple of years}} – than Antoinette, in collusion with René, marries her sweetheart Frontignac.|$|E

25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E

500|$|While her {{siblings}} were on hiatus {{to raise their}} families, Andrea launched a solo career. She released her first album, Ten Feet High, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, {{who has worked with}} Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. Her first single, [...] "Shame on You" [...] was an up-tempo pop song about men and women going to war and leaving behind partners they may never <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> It received positive reviews from music critics; IndieLondon described the song as a [...] "slick package" [...] that was [...] "polished, well produced and with a message that's difficult to ignore". Losing Todays David Adair gave the song a strong review, writing that Corr's vocals were [...] "crisp and uplifting". Liverpool's Daily Post gave the song a three-star rating, commenting that it was [...] "deceptively upbeat", which masked its [...] "heavier message about conscription and war".|$|E

500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to <b>see</b> <b>again</b> in American history".|$|E
500|$|According to the {{classical}} Quranic exegete, Ibn Kathir, after Ezra questioned how the resurrection will {{take place on the}} Day of judgment, God had him brought back to life many years after he died. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness and she could <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> He meets his son who recognized him by a mole between his shoulders and was older than he was. Ezra then led the people to locate the only surviving copy of Torah as the remaining were burnt by Nebuchadnezzar. It was rotting and crumpled, so Ezra had a new copy of the Torah made which he had previously memorised. He thus renovated the Torah to the Children of Israel. Ibn Kathir mentions that the sign in the phrase [...] "And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people" [...] was that he was younger than his children. After this miracle, Ibn Kathir writes that Jews began to claim that Ezra was the 'son of God'.|$|E
500|$|Wellesley {{later told}} Stevenson that [...] "I should {{not like to}} <b>see</b> <b>again</b> such a loss as I {{sustained}} on the 23rd September, even if attended by such a gain", and in later life he referred to Assaye as [...] "the bloodiest for the numbers that I ever saw". Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Munro, the Company's district collector at Mysore, was critical of the high proportion of casualties and questioned Wellesley's decision not to wait for Stevenson. He wrote to Wellesley: [...] "I am tempted {{to think that you}} did it with a view of sharing the glory with the smallest numbers". In response, Wellesley politely rebuffed Munro's accusations and defended his action as necessary because he had received and acted upon incorrect intelligence regarding the Maratha position. Assaye was 34-year-old Wellesley's first major success and despite his anguish over the heavy losses, it was a battle he always held in the highest estimation. After his retirement from active military service, the Duke of Wellington (as he later became known) considered Assaye the finest thing he ever did in the way of fighting even when compared to his later military career.|$|E

500|$|Various music journalists, {{critical}} theorists, {{and authors}} have deemed Madonna {{the most influential}} female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Women in Music" [...] list and The Daily Telegraphs [...] "20 Greatest Female Artists" [...] list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that [...] "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon." [...] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that [...] "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep {{on the edge of}} tendency and commerciality." [...] Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that [...] "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye." [...] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to." [...] Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will never <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E
500|$|The darker {{approach}} to the popular magical girl subgenre in Japanese anime and manga was also a point of high praise by reviewers. In its take on the series, the staff at Japanator remarked that this trope [...] "added a level of depth and complexity to the genre that we haven’t ever seen, and I don’t think we will <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> [...] Adding on that dressing gave the show a more perverse and cruel feeling to it, making {{it all the more}} compelling to watch." [...] Liz Ohanesian of LA Weekly attributed the genre deconstruction of Puella Magi Madoka Magica to the series' popularity with older, male audiences, an otherwise unusual demographic to the genre. Furthermore, she commented on cultural impact that the series produced, observing that in both Japan and the US there has been incredible fan captivation surrounding the series. She credited the all-star crew including writer Urobuchi, director Shinbo, and the Shaft animation studio as [...] "hitmakers" [...] and described the anime as [...] "a series designed for acclaim." [...] TechnologyTell's Jenni Lada warned that the show's external appearance belied its true [...] "darker and more twisted" [...] essence. She recommended viewers watch at least three episodes in order to discover the series' true nature. The subversion of the magical girl genre was said to [...] "draw attention to the question of narrative power", particularly in the use of alternative timelines, as the characters fight for their survival. Production I.G's Katsuyuki Motohiro watched Puella Magi Madoka Magica after hearing opinions that it exceeded Neon Genesis Evangelion. Upon viewing the series, he was so amazed that he began analyzing Urobuchi's other works and was then motivated to request Urobuchi to write the crime thriller Psycho-Pass. In issue 103 of Neo, journalist Matt Kamen wrote, [...] "With its...daring {{approach to}} a dated genre, Puella Magi Madoka Magica essentially does for magical girls what Neon Genesis Evangelion did for giant robots." [...] Writing for the Kotaku blog, critic Richard Eisenbeis hailed the series as [...] "one of the best anime." [...] He goes on to write, [...] "It deconstructs the magical girl genre and builds an emotional narrative filled with memorable characters." ...|$|E
