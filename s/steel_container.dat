On the basis of physical surveys, 11 union councils (UCs) were selected as population of these UCs comprised of all three socio-economic levels. Since the population of low-income groups is greater than both the high and middle income groups, therefore, for better statistical results of MSW composition, four <b>steel</b> <b>containers</b> were randomly selected from low-income areas and three <b>steel</b> <b>containers</b> each were selected from high and middle income areas.

In the laboratory, glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions; some sources instead recommend nickel-Monel-PTFE systems.|$|E

2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large <b>steel</b> <b>container</b> with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E

The corrosion rate of the steel coupons was high under biotic conditions (not, vert, similar 30 μm/year) in comparison to blank sterilized runs (not, vert, similar 14 μm/year). Culture experiments in compacted conditions with clay–stone cores and steel coupons under 120 bar, simulating deep geological conditions, gave results similar to those obtained in batch experiments (e. g. production of H 2 S). This indicates the plausibility of SRB growth during the construction and operational phases of the repository and their survival at least temporarily after the disposal closure if water is available, which may cause fast corrosion of the <b>steel</b> <b>containers</b> under disposal conditions...|$|R
