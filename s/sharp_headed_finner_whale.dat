6000|$|Again, {{think of}} the {{microscopic}} fungus--a mere infinitesimal ovoid particle, which finds space and duration enough to multiply into countless millions {{in the body of}} a living fly; and then of the wealth of foliage, the luxuriance of flower and fruit, which lies between this bald sketch of a plant and the giant pine of California, towering to the dimensions of a cathedral spire, or the Indian fig, which covers acres with its profound shadow, and endures while nations and empires come and go around its vast circumference. Or, turning to {{the other half of the}} world of life, picture to yourselves the great <b>Finner</b> <b>whale,</b> hugest of beasts that live, or have lived, disporting his eighty or ninety feet of bone, muscle, and blubber, with easy roll, among waves in which the stoutest ship that ever left dockyard would flounder hopelessly; and contrast him with the invisible animalcules--mere gelatinous specks, multitudes of which could, in fact, dance upon the point of a needle with the same ease as the angels of the Schoolmen could, in imagination. With these images before your minds, you may well ask, what community of form, or structure, is there between the animalcule and the whale; or between the fungus and the fig-tree? And, a fortiori, between all four? ...|$|R

25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{also caused}} substantial damage to irrigation systems over {{a very wide}} area of the valley, with the canals of the Imperial Irrigation District being breached in multiple locations. With {{ninety percent of the}} damage done to the canals south of the international border, water rationing became necessary in Brawley and Imperial during the days following the earthquake spanning the restoration period. The canals brought water from the Mexican side of the border to the United States and supplied 3000 miles of irrigation waterways and ditches in the Imperial Valley. The primary trunkline was the Alamo Canal and it sustained nine breaks, each several hundred feet in length, along a twenty-mile stretch between <b>Sharp's</b> <b>heading</b> and Cudahy check.|$|R
6000|$|When {{within ten}} {{yards of the}} two little black patches {{there was a sudden}} movement; they widened into an {{enormous}} head, and a huge beast rose to his feet, startled at the discovery he had just made that men were close at hand. In an instant the hunter hurled his spear with all his force. Tough as was the animal's hide, the <b>sharp</b> <b>head</b> cut its way through. With a roar the beast plunged into the rushes, the shaft of the spear falling out of its socket as it did so, and the strong cord ran out rapidly from the reel held by the hunter. Presently the strain ceased. [...] "He has laid down again in shelter," [...] the hunter said; [...] "we will now follow him and give him a second spear." ...|$|R

6000|$|... § XXIX. 7. Fish. These, as {{beautiful}} in their forms {{as they are}} familiar to our sight, while their interest is increased by their symbolic meaning, are of great value as material of ornament. Love of the picturesque has generally induced a choice of some supple form with scaly body and lashing tail, but the simplest fish form is largely employed in mediæval work. We shall find the plain oval body and <b>sharp</b> <b>head</b> of the Thunny constantly at Venice; and the fish used in the expression of sea-water, or water generally, are always plain bodied creatures in the best mediæval sculpture. The Greek type of the dolphin, however, sometimes but slightly exaggerated from the real outline of the Delphinus Delphis,[67] {{is one of the}} most picturesque of animal forms; and the action of its slow revolving plunge is admirably caught upon the surface sea represented in Greek vases.|$|R

60|$|So {{now for a}} brown bear. He, too, {{is found}} in the regions of ice and snow, and in the North of Europe he is hunted by the peasants in a way which we will not imitate. When they find a den or cave in the rocks in which they think a bear is concealed, these sturdy hunters make all sorts of noises to worry him out, and when at last the bear comes forth to see what is the matter, he finds a man {{standing}} in front of his den, armed with a short lance with a long <b>sharp</b> <b>head,</b> and a bar of iron placed crosswise on the handle just below the head. Now, a full-grown brown bear is not afraid of a man who is armed with a little weapon like this, and so he approaches the hunter, and rearing on his hind legs, reaches forth his arms to give the man a good hug, if he comes any nearer.|$|R

30|$|Here, we {{demonstrate}} {{the observation of}} SERS activity from quasi-one-dimensional crystalline molybdenum (Mo) nanoscrew assemblies. The as-prepared Mo nanoscrews consist of many screw threads on their surfaces and very <b>sharp</b> <b>heads</b> at the ends. Such geometry is capable of concentrating the light field to enhance the Raman scattering of the adsorbed methylene blue (MB) molecules. Raman mapping indicated that the nanoscrew substrate exhibited reproducible SERS activity over an area of 100  ×  100  μm 2. The underlying mechanisms of the SERS behavior of the Mo nanoscrew assemblies were then systematically explored in terms of single-particle dark-field scattering spectroscopy, scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), and numerical electromagnetic simulations, which unveiled that the amplified Raman signal {{were associated with the}} electric field enhancement originated from the optical coupling between the screw threads in each individual nanoscrew. Besides, the electromagnetic coupling between different nanoscrews can additionally contribute to the SERS activity of the nanoscrew assemblies. The results obtained in our study can not only {{demonstrate the}} SERS activity of the Mo nanostructures, but also further our understanding on light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, using micromagnetic {{modeling}} {{based on}} the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, three types of advanced recording technologies have been studied and their physics illuminated. Conventional perpendicular magnetic recording and its related issues are studied in modeling. Our simulations indicate that the spatially random lateral exchange coupling becomes a new medium noise source for grains smaller than 8 nm and will offset any advantage brought by finer grains. It is in excellent agreement with the slight increase in grain size and oxide boundary thickness in the recording media of recent hard disk drive products. It {{turns out that the}} signal to noise ratio (SNR) gain from the media comes from the vertically segmented media with graded anisotropy and appropriate exchange coupling. The media stack optimization and SNR potential are explored through modeling. Also, a way to improve the field gradient is proposed. A <b>sharp</b> <b>head</b> field gradient is proved to be effective in SNR enhancement. A novel sub-coercivity recording scheme, named microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR), is a promising candidate for next generation magnetic recording...|$|R
