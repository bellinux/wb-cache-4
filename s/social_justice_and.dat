5|$|During this time, <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> <b>and</b> race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E

Historically <b>and</b> culturally, <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> judgments <b>and</b> decisions are more commonly generated by, framed within, and dependent upon satisfying [pre]dispositions (cf., generative processes) associated with enforcing and normalizing rights and rules through a tumultuous history of morality and ethicality (Lassman, 2000; Nash, 2003; Rydgren, 1949), predicated in part on rights, <b>justice</b> <b>and</b> legal ideology. As it stands, it can be stated that within academia <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> is accountability, handed down from politics and economics; albeit, in academic terms, “accountability as moral accountability is a primary requirement of interpretation, formulated upon coherence theory” (Skrla et al., 2004, p. 10). Theoretically, proposing that {{within the scope of}} <b>justice,</b> academic <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> judgments <b>and</b> decisions reflect structure, domain specific functions, and frames of reference (cf., ontological thought). To these ends, rights, <b>justice,</b> <b>and</b> legal ideology are theorized as necessary for the explication, formulation and application of an academic theory of <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> judgment <b>and</b> decision-making...|$|R

5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against <b>social</b> <b>justice,</b> <b>and</b> compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état.
