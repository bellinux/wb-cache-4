50|$|First {{invented by}} Blumlein in early 1930s, {{original}} <b>stereophony</b> was {{a system that}} converts the phase difference of the signals recorded {{by a pair of}} microphones to the amplitude difference of in-phase input signals to two loudspeakers.|$|E
5000|$|In a BBC {{white paper}} {{published}} in January 1963, the authors explored two-channel <b>stereophony,</b> and remarked {{that it was}} at a disadvantage compared with multi-channel <b>stereophony</b> that was already available in cinemas in that [...] "the full intended effects is apparent only to observers located within in a restricted area in front of the loudspeakers". The authors expressed reservations about dispersion and directionality in 2-channel systems, noting that the [...] "face-to-face listening arrangement" [...] was not able to give an acceptable presentation for a centrally-located observer in a domestic setting. The paper concluded: The achievement of suitable directional characteristics within the aesthetic and economic limitations applying to domestic equipment will however require a much greater research effort than either the corporation or the radio industry have so far been able to devote to the subject.|$|E

50|$|After {{working in}} the {{recording}} industry in the 1930s, Haddy was employed in wartime projects during the Second World War. These required new, sophisticated sonic developments that Haddy and his colleagues later put to peacetime use in Decca's innovative postwar recording techniques. He was an early proponent of the long-playing record, <b>stereophony,</b> video discs and digital recording.|$|E

5000|$|Summing localization: {{for time}} delays below 2 ms, {{listeners}} only perceive one sound; its direction {{is between the}} locations of the lead and lag sounds. An application for summing localization is the intensity <b>stereophony,</b> where two loudspeakers emit the same signal with different levels, resulting in the localized sound direction between both loudspeakers. The localized direction depends on the level difference between the loudspeakers.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1971, he {{directed}} {{research and development}} of sound and video systems technology at the Radio and Television Research Centre. He helped develop the delta <b>stereophony</b> system—the first true directional and distance sound reinforcement system for large halls and television productions—as well as a home processor for multichannel audio. Today, the sound reinforcement system is used both in Germany and abroad. Multichannel stereo ambiophonics (the first four-channel system) and automatic sound studio technical equipment were also developed under his leadership.|$|E

5000|$|Lewis was {{a shrewd}} picker of {{employees}} and associates. His choice of Culshaw, the pioneering engineer Arthur Haddy, {{and the international}} manager Maurice Rosengarten were crucial to Decca's success. [...] Lewis kept Decca ahead of the British competition by launching the long-playing record in Europe in June 1950, following the example of American Columbia, and encouraging the development of <b>stereophony</b> as early as 1954. In the 1960s, Decca famously turned down an agreement with The Beatles, but made amends for the error by signing up The Rolling Stones and other successful groups. On the classical side, Lewis took the risk of backing Culshaw's hugely expensive plan to make a high-quality studio recording of Wagner's Ring cycle which, to the amazement and envy of Decca's rivals, {{proved to be a}} best-seller.|$|E
50|$|The {{audio quality}} of LPs has {{increased}} greatly since their 1948 inception. Early LP recordings were monophonic; Alan Blumlein patented Stereophonic sound in 1931 (although <b>stereophony</b> had {{been demonstrated in}} 1881) but unsuccessful {{attempts were made to}} create stereophonic records from the 1920s, including Emory Cook's 1952 idea of using two tracks, and a system using vertical modulation (harking back to Edison's 1877 experiments) for one channel and (then-universal) horizontal for the other, until the modern system ultimately released by Audio Fidelity Records in November 1957. This format uses two modulation angles, equal and opposite 45 degrees from vertical (and so perpendicular to each other), that can also be thought of as using traditional horizontal modulation for the sum of Left plus Right channels (mono), making it essentially compatible with simple mono recordings, and vertical-plane modulation for the difference of the two channels.|$|E
5000|$|Under Haddy's {{technical}} leadership, Decca was {{the first}} British company to issue long playing records (1950) {{and was in the}} vanguard of <b>stereophony</b> {{in the middle of the}} decade. He was also a pioneer of the video disc at the end of the 1960s, which did not succeed commercially, and of digital recording, which quickly became the industry standard. Of his work on the latter, Ivor Humphreys wrote in Gramophone: Haddy was a keen advocate of recording from the start, noting in particular the benefits of zero tape modulation noise, the enormous signal-to-noise ratio and the fact that a copy of a digital master really is a genuine cloneand not a marginally degraded copy. He was not uncritical, though, and was troubled especially by recordings in which the ambient noise of a venue is seemingly modified or all but eliminated, and he made various tests to try to quantify the effect. The accepted need now to preserve some degree of background ambient noise if a recording is to sound natural and lifelike is due in part to his concern.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate perceptual differences between three sound recording and reproduction techniques, namely transaural, ambisonics and <b>stereophony,</b> in terms of spatial quality (Exp. 1) and localization (Exp. 2) {{on a variety of}} sound material. Results indicate a strong contrast between ambisonics and the other two techniques. Specifically, ambisonics provides a good sense of immersion and envelopment but a poor localization and readability of the scene, while <b>stereophony</b> and transaural provide a precise localization and a good readability but lack immersion and envelopment. These results suggest that a trade-off between immersion and precision may be difficult to achieve using these techniques. [Keywords: Multi-Channel Audio, Perceptual Evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Listening {{tests were}} {{conducted}} in order to analyse the localisation of band-limited stimuli in vertical <b>stereophony.</b> The test stimuli were seven octave bands of pink noise, with centre frequencies ranging from 125 – 8000 Hz, as well as broadband pink noise.

The experimental data obtained showed that localisation under the aforementioned conditions is generally governed by the so-called “pitch-height” effect, with the high frequency stimuli generally being localised significantly higher than the low frequency stimuli for all conditions. The effect of interchannel time difference was found to be significant on localisation judgments for both the 1000 - 4000 Hz octave bands and the broadband pink noise; it is suggested that this was related to the effects of comb filtering. Additionally, no evidence could be found to support the existence of the precedence effect in vertical <b>stereophony...</b>|$|E

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} dealing with low {{frequency}} all valve stereo amplifier unit conception for an electric guitar. The amplifier contains two independent output stages with two power tubes EL 34, working in AB class, with 40 Watts of power. The apparatus is equipped with two channels, EQ correctors, parallel effects loop, output selection with lowered anode power supply, selection between silicon or tube rectifier. The preamplifier works in mono mode and the <b>stereophony</b> is reached by dividing the signal in an added effects system. This unusual solution differs from both monaural conceptions and binaural power amplifiers which contains no preamp. It offers the possibility of <b>stereophony</b> without the necessity of dividing the guitar signal before the amplifier’s input. The sound {{that comes from the}} speaker on one side is effected {{and on the other side}} is dry by using monaural effects apparatus. The sound from both speakers is effected by using binaural effect apparatus. The amplifier can be used as power amplifier stage only when the return of the effect loop is used as the amplifier input. Every available possible solution is discussed in case of each block and then the most suitable is chosen. The biggest attention is paid to a proposal and calculation of both power and output transformer, ergonomical lay-out of the stages in need of the best S/N separation. The stages were simulated in Micro-Cap 9. 0 and Tonestack 1. 3 computer programmes. The construction was carried out with the emphasis on proper shielding and grounding.
