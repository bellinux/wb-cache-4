40|$|Substrate {{specificity}} {{is critically}} important for enzyme catalysis. In the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase), minor changes in substituents can convert substrates into inhibitors. Here we report the crystal structures of six human PNMT complexes, including the first structure of the enzyme in complex with its physiological ligand R-noradrenaline. Determining this structure required rapid <b>soak</b> <b>methods</b> because of the tendency for noradrenaline to oxidize. Comparison of the PNMT–noradrenaline complex with the previously determined PNMT–p-octopamine complex demonstrates that these two substrates form almost equivalent interactions with the enzyme and show that p-octopamine is a valid model substrate for PNMT. The crystal structures illustrate the adaptability of the PNMT substrate binding site in accepting multi-fused ring systems, such as substituted norbornene, as well as noradrenochrome, the oxidation product of noradrenaline. These results explain why only a subset of ligands recognized by PNMT are methylated by the enzyme; bulky substituents dictate the binding orientation of the ligand and can thereby place the acceptor amine {{too far from the}} donor methyl group for methylation to occur. We also show how the critical Glu 185 catalytic residue can be replaced by aspartic acid with a loss of only 10 -fold in catalytic efficiency. This is because protein backbone movements place the Asp 185 carboxylate almost coincident with the carboxylate of Glu 185. Conversely, replacement of Glu 185 by glutamine reduces catalytic efficiency almost 300 -fold, {{not only because of the}} loss of charge, but also because the variant residue does not adopt the same conformation as Glu 185...|$|E

Using total RNA extracted with RNeasy (R) or leaf <b>soak</b> <b>methods,</b> real time RT-PCR detected TSWV in all infected samples collected from 16 horticultural crop species (including flowers, herbs and vegetables), two arable crop species, and four weed species by both assays. In samples in which DAS-ELISA had previously detected TSWV, real time RT-PCR was effective at detecting it in leaf tissues of all 22 plant species tested at a wide range of concentrations. Bulk samples required more robust and extensive extraction methods with real time RT-PCR, but it generally detected one infected sample in 1000 uninfected ones. By contrast, ELISA was less sensitive when used to test bulked samples, once detecting up to I infected in 800 samples with pepper but never detecting more than I infected in 200 samples in tomato and lettuce. It was also less reliable than real time RT-PCR when used to test samples from parts of the leaf where the virus concentration was low. The genetic variability among Australian isolates of TSWV was small. Direct sequencing of a 587 bp region of the nucleoprotein gene (S RNA) of 29 isolates from diverse crops and geographical locations yielded a maximum of only 4. 3 % nucleotide sequence difference. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no obvious groupings of isolates according to geographic origin or host species. TSWV isolates, that break TSWV resistance genes in tomato or pepper did not differ significantly in the N gene region studied, indicating that a different region of the virus genome is responsible for this trait...|$|E

40|$|To develop {{biomimetic}} fibroin/apatite composites with bone―like structure byalternate <b>soaking</b> <b>method,</b> the degummed natural fibroin fibers were pretreatedby soaking into CaCl 2 :EtOH:H 2 O (&lt;&gt;n(CaCl 2 ):&lt;&gt;n(EtOH):&lt;&gt;n(H 2 O)= 1 : 2 : 8 ) {{solution for}} given {{time and then}} soaked into calciumsolution and phosphate solution, respectively, to fabricate fibroin/apatite composites. The effects of pretreatment time andthe alternate soaking times on fibroin microstructure and fibroin/apatitecomposites were examined by SEM, FTIR, XRD and TGA techniques. The pretreatmentusing CaCl 2 :EtOH:H 2 O(&lt;&gt;n(CaCl 2 ):&lt;&gt;n(EtOH):&lt;&gt;n(H 2 O)= 1 : 2 : 8 ) solution makes fibroin fiber exhibit rougher surface and higher internalporosity, which is beneficial to interaction of calcium ion and residue groupssuch as ―COOH, &ndash;OHand ―CONH― from fibroin, and then improvethe deposition of apatite on fibroin fibers. The homogeneous apatites withoriented &lt;&gt;c―axis were formed on the pretreated fibroin fibers. Moreover,there are more than 30 wt% apatites deposited on fibroin fibers after alternatesoaking for more than 3 times. The fibroin/apatite composite has potential tobe applied as bone repair materials...|$|R
40|$|Since CCA {{preservative}} {{was banned}} in Indonesia, alternative preservative should be searched. One of the preservative which has good fixation characteristic like CCA is ZFE. preservative that contain zink, fluor and chrom. The retention and penetration of ZFK in five Indonesian wood species were studied. The ZFK preservative was applied using <b>soaking</b> <b>method</b> for 3, 5 and 7 days, where the solution concentration applied was 5 % and 10 %. Five wood species choosed {{in the experiment}} were damar (Agathis loranthifolia), keruing (Dipterocarpus caudiferus), jelutung (Dyera costulata), meranti merah (Shorea palembanica) and nyatoh (Palaquium leiocarpum). The lest results based on retention and penetration requirements for wood used under roof, and {{in the open air}} both without ground contact, showed that only two species, keruing and jelutung, could satisfactorily meet the standard under the experimental conditions, while other tree species (damar, meranti merah and nyatoh) do not comply with tire standard. For under roof and in the open air uses without ground contact keruing can be consecutively soaked for 7 days in Basilit ZFK solution of 10 %, while jelutung for 5 days...|$|R
40|$|In this work, three {{chitosan}} derivatives (N-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC), N-carboxybutyl chitosan (CBC) and N-succinyl chitosan (SCC)) were impregnated with flurbiprofen (an anti-inflammatory drug) and timolol maleate (an anti-glaucoma drug), using a supercritical solvent impregnation (SSI) technique (and employing {{high pressure}} CO 2 and CO 2  + EtOH mixtures) {{in order to}} develop hydrogel-type ophthalmic drug delivery applications. Impregnation experiments were carried out from 9. 0 up to 14. 0  MPa, and at 303. 0, 313. 0 and 323. 0  K. The resulting polymeric drug delivery systems, as well as other polymeric samples processed in CO 2, were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Drug release kinetics studies were performed for all prepared systems. The effects of impregnation pressure and temperature on the release kinetics results were studied and compared to the traditional <b>soaking</b> impregnation <b>method.</b> For the same operational conditions, results confirmed that the three different (chemically and physically) polymeric structures conditioned the impregnation and the drug release processes. Despite the final released drug mass is always the result of the employed operational impregnation conditions and of the very complex relative specific interactions that may occur between all species present in the system (drugs, polymers, CO 2 and ethanol), results showed that, for N-carboxymethyl chitosan, the predominant effects in the impregnation process seemed to be the solubility of drugs in CO 2 and in CO 2  + EtOH mixtures, as well as the swelling and plasticizing effect of CO 2 and ethanol on the polymer. Finally, the SSI method proved to be a more efficient and "tunable" impregnation process than the traditional impregnation of drugs by a <b>soaking</b> <b>method.</b> Therefore, and using this "tunable" SSI method, these N-chitosan derivatives-based ophthalmic drug delivery systems can be easily and efficiently prepared taking in consideration the desired drug levels according to patients needs.

40|$|Rice is {{the most}} popular food in Sri Lanka where {{approximately}} 70 % of the paddy production goes through the parboiling process. Parboiling process is a hydrothermal treatment method. This treatment process consumes energy, water and other environmental resources and adds air and solid emissions, effluents and wastages back to environment which cause adverse environmental impacts. Total environmental input and output emissions of the parboiling process depend on the selected treatment method and the type of equipment used. Therefore the total environmental effects of each and every step in the life cycle of the production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly paddy parboiling method. The overall objective of this work is to assess environmental impacts of different parboiled paddy production methods adopted in Sri Lanka by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA is a methodological context to estimate the environmental effects caused by the life cycle of a product, service or process. Goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment and interpretation are the four major steps in LCA methodology. The environmental performance of three parboiling methods named as modern <b>method</b> with hot <b>soaking</b> and mechanical drying, modern <b>method</b> with hot <b>soaking</b> and sun drying and semi modern <b>method</b> with cold <b>soaking</b> and sun drying were assessed and compared quantitatively and qualitatively. Processes from paddy harvesting to rice cooking are included in the system boundary. According to the results, highest impact of parboiled rice production is given by the cooking step. The highest impacts from cold <b>soaking</b> operation <b>method</b> were observed in eutrophication, depletion of abiotic resources and climate change impact categories. The hot <b>soaking</b> <b>method</b> resulted highest impacts on human toxicity, photo oxidant formation and acidification...|$|R
