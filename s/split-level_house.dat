50|$|The Matthews-Godt House is a {{historic}} house on the 248 Skyline Drive in North Little Rock, Arkansas.

It is a frame structure finished in brick veener, in the English Revival style.

50|$|The Isabel Roberts {{house is}} {{sometimes}} credited {{as being the}} first <b>split-level</b> <b>house.</b> It also has features typical of Wright’s mature Prairie style, including broad overhanging eaves, low hip roofs, continuous bands of windows which he called “light screens”, an emphatic water table, cruciform plan, large fireplace surrounded by Roman brick, built-in bookcases, stained woodwork, a tree growing through the roof, elimination of basement and attic space, and an overall emphasis on the horizontal line. Wright’s Vosburgh House is similar in conception to the Isabel Roberts house.|$|E

However, back split <b>houses</b> - <b>split-levels</b> with the second story built into the back - are common in the southern portion of the city near the 8 Mile border. This style of home is often the result of additions often built onto one-story bungalows and ranch houses.|$|R

50|$|The Wonderland Gang mainly trafficked in {{the burgeoning}} cocaine trade of the era, but despite {{its role as}} the most {{influential}} and feared cocaine distributorship of its time in Los Angeles, some of its members were heroin addicts. Drugs were regularly dealt from the residence at 8763 Wonderland Avenue in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. The two bedroom <b>split-level</b> <b>house</b> was leased in Joy Miller's name. Miller and her live-in boyfriend, Billy DeVerell, were the usual residents; Ron Launius and his wife, Susan, were house guests.|$|E

At the age of 14, he had to drop out of high school to earn money for his family after his father became ill. He worked many jobs and later used money he had saved to build a <b>split-level</b> <b>house</b> in Côte Saint-Luc, which was sold immediately after its completion to a wealthy bystander who was passing by on the street. Lépine quickly doubled his money, and started building homes, and eventually incorporated Groupe Lépine in 1953.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{influential}} review in The New Republic titled [...] "The Architecture of Escape," [...] critic Lewis Mumford denounced [...] "Laverock Farm" [...] and buildings like it as [...] "architectural anaesthesia" [...] and [...] "hocus-pocus":The critical {{weakness of the}} romantic architect {{is that he is}} employed in creating an environment into which people may escape from a sordid workaday world, whereas the real problem of architecture is to remake the workaday world so that people will not wish to escape from it."Laverock Farm" [...] lasted barely 30 years, it was demolished in 1956. A development of <b>split-level</b> <b>houses</b> was built on the former estate and as infill around other existing houses.|$|R
50|$|North Coventry's {{settlement}} is less dense, and its housing and businesses are of more recent construction. In the 18th century, {{this section of}} the town was largely used for dairy and vegetable farming. As the United States expanded westward, many farming families left the rocky fields of Connecticut for the more fertile land of the Ohio River valley. Most of the farms in North Coventry were abandoned, and the land reclaimed by second-growth forest. In the 1960s and 1970s, tract housing developments were built on some of this land, mainly raised ranch or <b>split-level</b> <b>houses</b> on one acre (4,000 m²) lots. Development slowed from the mid-1970s through the 1990s, but several new developments were constructed in North Coventry after 1990. These tend to feature larger houses on two acre (8,000 m²) lots.|$|R
5000|$|Through the 1960s, {{she was a}} {{prominent}} figure in the experimental architecture world, and was influenced by European Modernists and the Bauhaus, including Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In 1943, her <b>split-level</b> <b>house</b> in Beverly Hills was the first project that allowed Grossman to act as both interior designer and architect. The house was a major breakthrough for her as an architect and was featured in John Entenza's influential magazine Arts & Architecture. Her houses were on the smaller side, around 1,500 square feet, and were carefully crafted using materials like wood and glass. Her work reflected both the International Style of fellow European emigres such as Rudolph Schindler and Richard Neutra, with the airy, open-plan housing of the Case Study program architects, such as Craig Ellwood, the Eameses, and Pierre Koenig. Between 1949 and 1959 she designed fourteen houses in Los Angeles. Grossman became known for building homes on [...] "difficult plots", lots under 1,500 square feet with difficult landscapes on hillsides. She later worked with influential Southern California designers such as Garrett Eckbo.Of her sixteen built projects, fourteen of the houses were located in Los Angeles, one was in San Francisco and one was in her native Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|Burnsville is a fully {{developed}} suburban bedroom community. Large pockets of ramblers and <b>split-level</b> <b>houses</b> {{were due to}} Interstate 35W's completion in the 1960s which came earlier {{than most of the}} metro highways. Burnsville through the 1990s filled in the last of its available land with upscale housing stock and apartment complexes. In the 2000s Burnsville went under redevelopment activity, producing many four-story residential buildings. The [...] "Heart of the City", a new downtown area, contains mixed-use residential and retail buildings. This has produced a diverse range of housing types from single-family homes to high-density condominiums. Since the city was developed in a sprawl fashion, new and old buildings sit between each other. The original industrial area along the Minnesota River is mostly abandoned, and also contains a sealed land-fill site. The new industrial area in {{the west side of the}} city contains many manufacturing and corporate headquarters as well as large modern warehouses. West of the new downtown area are new office buildings, where one tower reaches above ten stories.|$|R

50|$|College Park was {{developed}} beginning in 1889 near the Maryland Agricultural College (later the University of Maryland) and the College Station stop of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The suburb was incorporated in 1945 and included the subdivisions of College Park, Lakeland, Berwyn, Oak Spring, Branchville, Daniel's Park, and Hollywood. The original College Park subdivision was first plotted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell. The area remained undeveloped and was re-platted in 1889 by John O. Johnson and Samuel Curriden, Washington real estate developers. The original 125 acre tract {{was divided into}} a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots, with a standard lot size of 50 ft by 200 ft. College Park developed rapidly, catering {{to those who were}} seeking to escape the crowded Washington, D.C., as well as to a rapidly expanding staff of college faculty and employees. College Park originally included single-family residences constructed in the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Stick styles, as well as modest vernacular dwellings. Commercial development increased in the 1920s, aided by the increased automobile traffic and the growing campus along Baltimore Avenue / Route 1. By the late 1930s, most of the original subdivision had been partially developed. Several fraternities and sororities from the University of Maryland built houses in the neighborhood. After World War II, construction consisted mostly of infill of ranch and <b>split-level</b> <b>houses.</b> After incorporation in 1945, the city continued to grow and build a municipal center in 1959.|$|R
