40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Significant {{declines in}} the catch rates of <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> (Sphyrna zygaena) have {{recently}} been reported {{off the coast of}} New South Wales, Australia. Quantitative investigations on the life history and correlates of distribution of exploited marine species is fundamental in providing sound species management, as resulting quantifiable results can help determine how population structures are affected by fishing, and their capacity to recover from reduced stocks. This information is particularly important for commercially targeted animals, such as sharks. This thesis assesses the age, growth and distribution of juvenile <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> (Sphyrna zygaena) on the east coast of Australia. Vertebra, along with information on sample sex, size and stage of maturity were collected from 144 sharks. Lengths-at-age and growth rates were estimated from vertebral growth band counts for 82 females (109 – 284 cm total length (LT) and 62 males (120 – 255 cm LT). A multimodal approach (various growth functions) was used on pooled data and then separated by sex. These were compared using Akaike Information Criterion, sorted by Akaike score (Δ) with supporting evidence weighed using Akaike weights (ω). These indicate that a multimodal approach is necessary for growth analysis and that sex specific models are required. Females attained a maximum theoretical total length (L∞) of 302. 2 cm and k of 0. 06, whereas male L∞ was larger at 340. 7 cm with a k of 0. 06. Sex ratios were similar, however 96 % of samples were not sexually mature, indicating that the coastal population of S. zygaena are mostly immature. These results have important implications in assessing the resilience of S. zygaena to stock depletion in south eastern Australian waters. This is fundamental for management decisions about status listings and allowable fishery interactions. Environmental variables influencing the catch of juvenile S. zygaena within the New South Wales Shark Meshing (Bather Protection) Program (SMP) were investigated to identify potential variables that explain spatial and temporal variability in catches. Using remotely sensed products and spatial conditions, 23 years of daily catch data from the SMP were applied to generalised linear mixed models with random effects to predict capture. The environmental variables assessed included sea surface temperature (SST), rainfall and chlorophyll a, as well as spatial and temporal variables such as distance to estuary mouth, substrate type, moon phase and southern oscillation index. Additionally, the introduction of acoustic deterrent devices were included in the model using year of introduction (1999). Corellative information indicates that juvenile S. zygaena catch were greatest at warmer SSTs, during dry weather, dark moon phases, in primarily sandy surroundings, and in nets closest to estuary mouths. Chlorophyll a concentration and southern oscillation did not help explain variation in catch. However, after adjusting for temporal changes in significant environmental factors, a temporal decline in catch was still present, indicating that the temporal decline in catch was not attributed to the environmental conditions assessed. The best predictor of temporal decline in the model was the introduction of acoustic deterent devices on nets. While a catch decrease after device introduction may be coincidental to an actual decline in the population, the close agreement between the fit of the model and the change point suggests that the temporal decline was associated with the introduction of the acoustic devices. This study suggests that further investigation at a finer level of detail (i. e. satellite tracking) is required into how each of the significant environmental conditions drives movement patterns of S. zygaena. This will also allow for a confirmation of the current studies method in detecting environmental patterns of occurrence and may allow an opportunity to test how acoustic alarms may affect their sensory biology. This thesis can assist decision makers in potential status listings both locally and worldwide. The identification of environmental and demographic catch patterns allow for informed coastal management decisions to take place, complementing future species specific adaptive management strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{records from}} longline fishing programs conducted in Hawai'i between 1959 and 1980. Data from 11 species of sharks (173 individual sharks) are reported and compared with worldwide records. Although {{much of the}} data is nearly 30 yr old, the information was never fully utilized and represents the following important findings. The relationship between clasper length and total length (TL) for bluntnose sixgill shark, Hexanchus griseus (Bonnaterre), indicates that males mature at about 309 cm TL. High fecundity (114 pups) is reported for the prickly shark, Echinorhinus cookei Pietschmann. The smallest mature male E. cookei (183 cm TL) and the smallest pregnant (205 cm TL) bignose shark, Carcharhinus altimus (Springer), are recorded. New maximum depth of capture records for the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus Umbatus (Valenciennes), at 64 m, and for the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark,</b> Sphyrna zygaena (L.), at 68 m, are also documented. Distributions of deep-sea sharks in Hawai'i appear {{to be associated with}} isothermic submergence, and the sharks remain below the thermocline (100 - 400 m) and in water temperatures of 9 - 12 °C. Carcharhiniform sharks in Hawai'i range to greater depths than reported elsewhere; this appears to be correlated with the Tropics having warmer water temperatures (20 - 26 °C), which extend down to 100 - 400 m in depth...|$|E
40|$|Sharks {{have not}} {{historically}} {{been considered a}} valuable resource but, {{with the increase in}} demand for their fins, shark catch numbers have risen dramatically and many shark populations are suffering. It is difficult to know the extent of the problem because {{there is a lack of}} information about sharks and shark catch is vastly under-reported. The <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna zygaena) is valuable in the shark fin market for its eight, large fins and is frequently landed at the Puerto López fish market in Ecuador. EquililbrioAzul is a marine conservation organization that has been keeping track of shark catch in the Puerto López market for the last seven years. Analyses of these data show that juvenile and male smooth hammerheads are being overfished and that total catch and average total length have remained relatively static since 2007. It is important to use this data to drive future regulation and fishing methods in the area in order to protect the local populations of sharks. Based on this data I recommend that conservation efforts focus on changing fishing locations to prevent landing juvenile sharks, improving data collection, community education on the importance of shark conservation, and continuing research on smooth hammerhead behavior and ecology worldwide...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} shark products, {{along with the}} shark's fishing vulnerabilities, {{has led to the}} decrease in certain shark populations. In this study we used a DNA barcoding method to identify the species of shark landings at fishing ports, shark fin products in retail stores, and shark fins detained by Taiwan customs. In total we identified 23, 24, and 14 species from 231 fishing landings, 316 fin products, and 113 detained shark fins, respectively. All the three sample sources were dominated by Prionace glauca, which accounted for more than 30 % of the collected samples. Over 60 % of the species identified in the fin products also appeared in the port landings, suggesting the domestic-dominance of shark fin products in Taiwan. However, international trade also contributes a certain proportion of the fin product markets, as four species identified from the shark fin products are not found in Taiwan's waters, and some domestic-available species were also found in the customs-detained sample. In addition to the species identification, we also found geographical differentiation in the cox 1 gene of the common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus), the pelagic thresher shark (A. pelagicus), the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna zygaena), and the scalloped hammerhead shark (S. lewini).

A relatively common shark, it is captured, intentionally or otherwise, by many commercial fisheries throughout its range; its fins are extremely valuable for use in shark fin soup. This shark is potentially dangerous and has likely been responsible for a few attacks on humans, though it is less likely to encounter swimmers than other large hammerhead species due to its temperate habitat.|$|R

Within the individual fatty acids, the only significant differences were greater amounts of 22 : 6 n- 3, total n- 3 polyunsaturates and total polyunsaturates in smooth, when compared to scalloped, hammerhead liver. This may reflect the more wide spread distribution of this species into cooler waters. Within both species the liver levels of the same fatty acid fractions decreased from spring to summer, which may correlate with changes in fatty acid profile to adapt to any differences in amount or species of prey consumed, or other considerations, eg. buoyancy, however there was no data to clarify this.|$|R
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> blue <b>sharks</b> and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks.

40|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> Sphyrna zygaena (Sphyrnidae) is {{regularly}} caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, but {{is one of}} the least studied of all pelagic sharks. Recently, ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) issued recommendations underlining the need for more studies on the life history parameters of this and other pelagic shark species. To this end, the age and growth of S. zygaena were studied in the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic Ocean, in an area where growth parameters were not yet available for this species. Data from 139 specimens, caught between June and September 2009, ranging in size from 136 to 233 cm fork length (FL), were analysed. Preliminary trials were carried out to assess the most efficient growth band enhancement technique. These indicated that sectioning the vertebrae into 500 μm sections followed by staining with crystal violet produced the best results. Growth models were fitted using the traditional von Bertalanffy growth equation and a modification of this equation using a known size at birth. Growth models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The von Bertalanffy growth equation seemed to be the most adequate model to describe growth in this species, with resulting growth parameters of L inf = 272 cm FL, k = 0. 06 year for males and L inf = 285 cm FL, k = 0. 07 year for females. In the first four years of life, S. zygaena grows 25 cm per year on average, but its growth slows down in later life. Future stock assessment models should incorporate these age and growth parameters for species management and conservation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

Information was collected by on-board fishery observers who monitored 834 longline fishing sets between August 2008 and December 2011, and recorded information on 36, 067 elasmobranch specimens from 21 different taxa. The hooking mortality proportions were species-specific, with some species having relatively high percentages of live specimens {{at time of}} haulback (e. g., blue shark, crocodile shark, pelagic stingray, manta, devil and eagle rays), while others had higher percentages of dead specimens (e. g., <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> silky <b>shark,</b> bigeye thresher). For the most captured species, logistic GLMs were carried out to compare the mortality rates between sexes, specimen sizes and the regions of operation of the fleet. The sex-specific proportions of hooking mortality were significantly different for blue and crocodile sharks, with the males of both species having higher proportions of hooking mortality than the females. Specimen size was significant for predicting the hooking mortality for blue and shortfin mako sharks: in both cases, the larger specimens had lower odds of dying due to the fishing process. There were differences in the hooking mortality depending on the region of operation of the fleet, but those differences were also species-specific. For blue and crocodile sharks, the hooking mortality was higher in the Equatorial and southern Atlantic areas (when compared to the NE Atlantic region), while the opposite was observed for the shortfin mako, with lower mortality rates in the NE tropical area compared with the other regions.
