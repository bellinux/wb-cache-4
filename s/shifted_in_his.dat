25|$|Until {{at least}} 2001, polls showed that at most 2% of the {{electorate}} contemplated voting for Uribe and that the Liberal Party's Horacio Serpa would probably win. But public mood <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favor after the peace process with the guerrillas degenerated. The administration of President Andrés Pastrana had failed for four years to secure a ceasefire, and Álvaro Uribe began {{to be seen as}} the candidate who may provide a viable security program. Former General Harold Bedoya, a candidate with a superficially similar program, remained marginalized.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> {{evolution}} {{as a photographer}} of public personalities, Seeff realized that to accomplish the vitality and authenticity {{he was looking for}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> images required a paradigm <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> interaction with artists and innovators.|$|R
50|$|Grove also {{experimented with}} forms of modernism, both in staging fictionalized selves <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiographical fiction, and in experimenting with {{unreliable}} narrators and time <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late novel, The Master of the Mill.|$|R
6000|$|Flower <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat. [...] "I’d trust Joe anywhere," [...] he said, uneasily, [...] "but I don’t {{know about}} the other chap. If he starts talking at Seabridge I’m done. I thought Joe was alone when I sent in for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. One glance he {{gave the}} countess, then smiled. [...] "I have sought at your hands the reasons why you should desire my death," [...] said he slowly. [...] "You {{withhold}} them. Be it so. I take it that you are ashamed of them; and so, their nature {{is not difficult to}} conjecture." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Bowers <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and, {{convinced}} {{that such a}} superficial observer must have overlooked many things, pointed out several admirable qualities in Edward Tredgold which he felt sure must have escaped her notice. The surprise with which Miss Drewitt greeted them all confirmed him in this opinion, and {{he was glad to}} think that he had called her attention to them ere it was too late.|$|E

60|$|After he had finished, the rector sat {{for so long}} a {{time that}} the banker nervously <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. The clergyman's look had a {{cumulative}} quality, an intensity which seemed to increase as the silence continued. There was no anger in it, no fanaticism. On the contrary, the higher sanity of it was disturbing; and its extraordinary implication--gradually borne in upon Eldon Parr--was that he himself were not in his right mind. The words, when they came, were a confirmation of this inference.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Gunnill {{tossed her}} head, {{but after a}} little demur consented; and Drill, {{ignoring}} the impatience of the constable, picked up his bag {{and led the way}} into the kitchen. Messrs. Gunnill and Jenkins, left behind in the living-room, sought for some neutral topic of discourse, but in vain; conversation would revolve round hard labour and lost pensions. From the kitchen came sounds of hammering, then a loud [...] "Ooh!" [...] from Miss Gunnill, followed by a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands. Mr. Jenkins <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat and exchanged glances with Mr. Gunnill.|$|E
50|$|Rembrandt's own {{interest}} in effects of darkness <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mature works. He relied {{less on the}} sharp contrasts {{of light and dark}} that marked the Italian influences of the earlier generation, a factor found in his mid-seventeenth-century etchings. In that medium he shared many similarities with his contemporary in Italy, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, whose work in printmaking led him to invent the monotype.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s Lüpertz {{began making}} sculptures, a marked <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> practice. He created monumental figurative works in {{weathered}} bronze representing heroes, gods, and musicians that played on distortion and disproportion. Small-scale abstract sculptures in polychrome wood {{also began to}} appear <b>in</b> <b>his</b> oeuvre this year.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{precisely}} to these ideal categories of social autonomy, or civil society, that Arato <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> third stage. Such {{a change in}} intellectual direction was clearly sparked by rising opposition movement of Solidarność in the exciting developments in Poland in 1980-81, resulting in Arato’s early articulation of the category of civil society in his oft-cited 1981 essay “Civil Society vs. the State: Poland 1980-1981.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Journalist Michael C. Moynihan wrote:When Wechsler {{testified before}} McCarthy’s Senate committee, the senator’s deep {{paranoia}} was on prominent display. He suggested that Wechsler’s well-documented hostility to Stalin was an elaborate ruse. As his quarry <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, McCarthy speculated that Post editorials critical of his committee were planted by the Manchurian editor: 'Perhaps {{the most effective}} way of for communism would be to claim that we deserted the party and, if we got in control of the paper, use that paper to attack and smear anybody who actually was fighting Communism.' ...|$|E

"Samuel Bookatz has {{recently}} made a radical <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{point of view}} toward painting... and has entered a period of experimentation, intensifying his color and breaking up <b>his</b> line. <b>In</b> a sense, he has made his painting more impersonal, the better to express his emotional response to what he sees." ...|$|R
50|$|Abraham Schalit {{wrote his}} major works on Herod and Josephus. The {{discovery}} of his lost 1925 Vienna dissertation on Josephus shows a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> views. He originally saw Josephus {{as a bad}} historian but a patriot, sincerely seeking to further the rebels' cause against Rome. Later he regarded him as a pragmatist.|$|R
5000|$|Page <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{position}} on the granting of patents. As an examiner of patents, he was scrupulous and fair. Through his own experience as an inventor and association with other inventors, he allied with their concerns. On his resignation from the patent agency, Page used the journal he founded and edited as a forum to critique and even lambast the agency and policies which he had upheld for 10 years prior. [...] Having {{had much to do}} with shaping policy from inside the (patent) office, he also played a crucial role in reshaping it from the outside(Post, 1976a, p. 151).|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being an Independent minister, Petto was also a well-respected theologian. His first work was on Pneumatology (doctrine of the Holy Spirit) and it dealt primarily with the doctrine of assurance of salvation and the Spirit’s work of sealing. Following mainstream Puritan thought, Petto believed that sealing of the Spirit was a separate act from the indwelling of the Spirit. The sealing of the Spirit granted to individual believers the confidence that God was their Father {{and that they were}} truly converted. [...] Later in life Petto seemed to have <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> view and like Owen began to see that sealing and indwelling were more closely related, and that both were given to believers upon their initial salvation.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{all of this}} is {{complicated}} by the fact that The Cantos themselves contain very little evidence of Pound's otherwise blatant antisemitism: in fact, in a close study of the poem, Wendy Stallard Flory concluded that it contained only seven passages of antisemitic sentiment in the 803 pages she read. [...] Further, when Allen Ginsberg visited him in Rapallo in October 1967, Pound described his previous work to Ginsberg as: [...] "A mess ... stupidity and ignorance all the way through." [...] And later (as they dined in the Pensione Alle Salute da Cici restaurant in Venice) he even admitted to Ginsberg, Peter Russell, and Michael Reck that: [...] "... my worst mistake was the stupid suburban anti-Semitic prejudice, all along that spoiled everything ... I found after seventy years that I was not a lunatic but a moron ... I should have been able to do better ..." [...] Even his views on usury <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> later years: two weeks before his 87th birthday he read for a gathering of friends at a café: [...] "re USURY / I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is AVARICE." [...] However, even despite his earlier views, Pound still had defenders: Louis Zukofsky (who was Jewish) defended Pound on the basis of his personal knowledge of antisemitism on the level of human exchange — even though (according to William Cookson) their correspondence contained some of Pound's offensive views. Thus, although Pound indeed distrusted the masses, [...] "foreigners," [...] and so forth, The Cantos themselves (with their references to Confucius, the agrarian populism of Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democracy, and even the [...] "enlightened despotism" [...] of Leopold II) reflect the underlying conservative sentiment behind his more well-known social and economic views (including his antisemitism.) ...|$|E
40|$|Jerry Fodor {{has long}} held that natural {{language}} has no semantic content {{of its own}} apart from what it derives from thought. 1 He argues that this asymmetry holds, in part, because thought is semantically compositional but language is not (Fodor, 2001). 2 That last claim represents a major <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> thinking, give...|$|R
