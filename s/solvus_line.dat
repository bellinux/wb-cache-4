40|$|The phonon {{densities of}} states for pure {{vanadium}} and the solid solutions V- 6. 25 % Ni, Pd, Pt were determined from inelastic neutron scattering measurements. The solute atoms caused a large stiffening of the phonons, resulting in large, negative vibrational entropies of mixing. For V- 6. 25 %Pt, the negative vibrational entropy of mixing exceeds the conventional positive chemical entropy of mixing. This negative total entropy of mixing should extend to lower concentrations of Pt, {{and the effect}} on the bcc <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> is discussed. The experimental data were inverted to obtain interatomic force constants by using a Born–von Kármán model with an iterative optimization algorithm. The stiffening of bonds responsible for the decrease of entropy was found to occur mainly in first-nearest-neighbor solute-host bonds, and correlates in part with the solute metallic radius...|$|E
40|$|The AM 60 alloy was {{thermodynamically}} examined using chemical analysis, {{thermodynamic calculation}} made by ThermoCalc program, “in situ” thermal analysis and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), whereas the microstructure constituents were confirmed using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the eutectic temperature of 437 °C the equilibrium solubility of Al in Mg is 12. 6 wt. % Al. On {{the boundaries of the}} primary Mg grains the intermetallic compound of Al 12 Mg 17 is precipitating according to the <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> of the Mg-Al phase diagram. Solidification of the AM 60 alloy has been investigated using “in situ” simple thermal analysis.

The ordering of the precipitate phase particles formed during ageing at a sequence of temperatures has been observed. The <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> of the Al-rich end of the Al-Sc phase diagram is determined by measuring the intensity of the signal from the Sc atoms in the matrix relative to the signal from the Sc atoms in the precipitate phase for an Al- 0. 29 at. % Sc alloy homogenized at different temperatures.

Precipitates with radii {{as small as}} 0. 45 nm are characterized fully by three-dimensional atom-probe (3 DAP) microscopy. Contrary to what is often assumed by theory or in models, the average precipitate composition is shown to evolve with time, such that solute concentrations decrease toward an equilibrium value given by the <b>solvus</b> <b>lines.</b> Power-law time dependencies of the number density, mean radius, and supersaturations of Al and Cr are discussed in light of theoretical predictions for Ostwald ripening...|$|R
40|$|Low-temperature (below 100 °C) ageing {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} ice-water quenched and on slowly cooled Al-Mg alloys with 11, 14 and 16 at% Mg. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) generally reveals two overlapping endothermic events in the range 50 - 150 °C which are identified {{to be due to}} the dissolution of Guinier - Preston (GP) zones and the spherically shaped L 12 ordered b. beta'' phase precipitates. Data on the stability limits of GP zones and b. beta'' phase are obtained from isothermal calorimetry and DSC experiments. Our data on the solvi agree well with literature values provided that resistometry data, which are inconsistent with all other data, are not considered. Possible reasons for the unreliability of the latter are discussed and new <b>solvus</b> <b>lines</b> for GP zones and b. beta'' phase are presented...|$|R
40|$|The <b>solvus</b> <b>lines</b> of the PbTe and Ag_ 2 Te phases in the pseudo-binary PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te {{system have}} been {{determined}} using diffusion couples and unidirectional solidification by the Bridgman method. The solubilities of both Ag_ 2 Te in PbTe and PbTe in Ag_ 2 Te decrease with decrease in temperature. For the former, {{this change is}} from 14. 9 at% Ag (694 °C) to 0. 5 at% Ag (375 °C), while for the latter it is from 12. 4 at% Pb (650 °C) to 3. 1 at% Pb (375 °C). The decrease in solubilities leads {{to the formation of}} precipitates of Ag 2 Te in PbTe and PbTe in Ag_ 2 Te. In particular, fast atomic diffusion in Ag_ 2 Te results in the precipitation of PbTe even in quenched samples. From the temperature dependence of these solubilities, heats of solution have been determined. In the diffusion couple, the phase boundary moves toward PbTe. In the region between the phase boundary and the initial interface, PbTe transforms to β-Ag_ 2 Te (cubic) retaining the cube-on-cube orientation relationship...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} research was the development of a thermo­ mechanical procedure to process Aluminum- Magnesium alloys and testing effects of alloying additions on these alloys. Magnesium contents of eight and ten weight percent and the alloying effects of copper and manganese were studied. Microstructures and mechanical properties at six warm rolling temperatures located above and below the <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> of these alloys were examined. Ultimate tensile strengths in excess of 680 MPa (99 KSI) were obtained. Microstructural evidence indicated that the precipitation of the "beta" intermetallic phase {{was one of the most}} important mechanisms in controlling the strength of the alloy. Furthermore, precipitation is so rapid at higher temperatures that it becomes the strongest force within the microstructure and its presence prevents any possible recrystallization of the alloy. However, when the temperature exceeds the solvus temperature for the alloy, recrystallization does occur with large losses in both yield and ultimate tensile strength. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} zinc {{additions}} on the corrosion susceptibility {{of aluminium alloys}} in varying concentrations of NaCl solution have been studied. Virgin aluminium alloys containing 1. 0, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 5 and 4. 0 % Zn by weight were cast and machined into cylindrical coupons of average surface area of 12. 71 cm 2. The initial weights of the coupons were determined and immersed in beakers containing 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 M NaCl solution. The set-ups were allowed to stand for six days with a set withdrawn 24 h for corrosion rate determination using standard procedures. The results showed that although the normal corrosion rate profile (for passivating metals) was observed as the reinforcing phase increased, the samples gained weight; indicating an all-through passivation, especially in the 2. 5 % Zn alloy. It is concluded that the passivation {{is a consequence of}} media supersaturation and preferential oxide (Al 2 O 3) adsorption on the metal surface and that the 2. 5 % Zn composition may well represent the <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> in Al -Zn binary systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of zinc additions on the corrosion behaviour {{of aluminium alloys}} in H 2 SO 4 solution of varying concentrations has been investigated. Aluminium-zinc alloys of 1. 0, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 5 and 4. 0 % zinc by weight were cast and machined to cuboidal test coupons of initial surface area averaging 12. 71 cm 2. The coupons were then weighed and immersed into beakers containing 0. 5 M and 1. 0 M H 2 SO 4 solutions. The set-ups were allowed to stand for six days with a set withdrawn daily for corrosion rate characterization using standard procedures. The results showed that although, the normal corrosion rate profile (for passivating metals) of an initial steep rise, then a progressive decline was observed in all the media as the fraction of the solute in the alloy increased, there was severity of attack on the 2. 5 % Zn alloy. It is concluded that the severity of attack on the 2. 5 % Zn alloy is due to increased grain boundary concentration possibly implying a maximum solid solubility (<b>solvus</b> <b>line)</b> in Al-Zn binary systems within this range...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{pathways}} {{resulting from}} the formation of coherent L 12 -ordered y'-precipitates in the g-matrix (f. c. c.) of Ni- 7. 5 Al- 8. 5 Cr at. % and Ni- 5. 2 Al- 14. 2 Cr at. % alloys, aged at 873 K, are investigated by atom-probe tomography (APT) over a range of aging times from 1 / 6 to 1024 hours; these alloys have approximately the same volume fraction of the y'-precipitate phase. Quantification of the phase decomposition {{within the framework of}} classical nucleation theory reveals that the y-matrix solid-solution solute supersaturations of both alloys provide the chemical driving force, which acts as the primary determinant of the nucleation behavior. In the coarsening regime, the temporal evolution of the y'-precipitate average radii and the y-matrix supersaturations follow the predictions of classical coarsening models, while the temporal evolution of the y'-precipitate number densities of both alloys do not. APT results are compared to equilibrium calculations of the pertinent <b>solvus</b> <b>lines</b> determined by employing both Thermo-Calc and Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulation.

The line determines a solid solubility limit which changes {{as a function of}} temperature. It is a locus of points on the equilibrium diagram. An example is the formation of perthite when an alkali feldspar is cooled down. It defines the limit of solid solubility in an equilibrium diagram.|$|R

40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} study of Cu-Co alloys containing 0. 3 to 5. 0 wt % Co are presented. A series of solution annealed Cu-Co alloys were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Each Ka doublet was resolved by fitting a Pearson Type VII profile. Precise lattice parameter {{as a function of}} cobalt content deviated significantly from Vegard’s law but was in reasonable agreement with King’s analysis. VSM measurements showed that the alloys with cobalt I 2 % were paramagnetic, and their initial magnetic susceptibility was a parabolic function of the cobalt content. Alloys containing cobalt in excess of 2 % showed presence of a ferromagnetic phase. Solution annealed specimens containing 1. 5 % Co were aged at 700 °C and 750 °C for various times to precipitate sub-micron size Co-rich particles. In addition to XRD and VSM measurements, the precipitate particles were analyzed by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The amount of magnetic precipitate determined from VSM measurements is in good agreement with Servi and Turnbull’s mathematical description of the <b>solvus</b> <b>line.</b> VSM and MFM results indicate that initially the precipitate particles are superparamagnetic that grow into single domain ferromagnetic particles. At the higher aging temperature, some of the single domain particles grow and become multi-domain.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the nature of defects in the B 2 (h) and B 2 (l) regions of Fe–Al phase diagram, two alloys with aluminum contents of 40 at. % and 45 at. % have been quenched from temperatures in the range 950 °C– 600 °C. Positron annihilation spectroscopy and Vickers microhardness {{have been used to}} follow the changes produced by the quenching treatments. Two different behaviours could be distinguished {{in the evolution of the}} positron lifetime for both alloys. Between 950 °C and 800 °C the lifetime remains constant and it drastically falls down at 750 °C. Between 600 °C and 750 °C the lifetime monotonically increased with the quenching temperature. A dependence with the Al content was also observed; higher positron lifetimes were obtained for the alloy with a 45 at. % of Al over all the temperature range. The constant lifetime value obtained between 800 °C and 950 °C has been assigned to the presence of a triple defect formed by two Fe vacancies bound to a Fe on an Al site as main defect. The stage from 600 °C to 750 °C has been assigned to the presence of Fe vacancies and an increasing number with the quenching temperature of triple defect. The detected step between 750 °C and 800 °C is in good agreement with the <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> between B 2 (h) and B 2 (l) regions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{phenomena}} of radiation-induced precipitation and solute segregation effects in a W- 25 at. % Rc alloy {{have been investigated}} using the atom-probe field-ion microscope. This alloy is super-saturated with respect o the <b>solvus</b> <b>line</b> of the primary /l-solid solution. The specimens had been irradiated in the Experimenta Breeder Reactor (EBR-II) to a fast neutron fluence of- 4 x lo = neutrons crnm 2 (E> 0. 1 Mev) at 575, 625 and 675 °C. This ffuence corresponds to 8. 6 dpa and an awroge displacement-rate, forthe 2 year irradiation time, of 1. 4 x IO- ’ dpa s-l. The {{results of the present}} work show significant alteration of the microstructure of this alloy as a result of neutron irradiation. Coherent, semicoherent and incoherent precipitates with the composition-WRe, were detected; the precipitate’s number density is N 10 ’ 7 cm- 3 with a mean diameter of- 40 A. The coherent WRe, precipitates were nof associated with either line or planar defects or with any impurity atoms. Therefore, a true homogeneous radiation-induced precipitation occurs in this alloy. The semicoherent and incoherent WRe, precipitates were associated with ‘He atoms; i. e. these precipitates may have been heterogeneously nucleated. Voids at a number density of- lOI 7 cmw 3 and a mean diameter of- 90 A were detected. Neither a significant enrichment or enhancement of Re was found at these voids. A two-dimensional WRe, phase has been observed at a grain boundary. A physical argument is presented for the nucleation of WRe 3 precipitates in the vicinity of displa&ment cascades.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of cobalt in mixed metal carbonates {{is a possible}} route to the immobilization of this toxic element in the environment. However, the thermodynamics of (Ca,Co) CO 3 solid solutions are still unclear due to conflicting data from experiment and from the observation of natural ocurrences. We report here {{the results of a}} computer simulation study of the mixing of calcite (CaCO 3) and spherocobaltite (CoCO 3), using density functional theory calculations. Our simulations suggest that previously proposed thermodynamic models, based only on the range of observed compositions, significantly overestimate the solubility between the two solids and therefore underestimate the extension of the miscibility gap under ambient conditions. The enthalpy of mixing of the disordered solid solution is strongly positive and moderately asymmetric: calcium incorporation in spherocobaltite is more endothermic than cobalt incorporation in calcite. Ordering of the impurities in (0001) layers is energetically favourable with respect to the disordered solid solution at low temperatures and intermediate compositions, but the ordered phase is still unstable to demixing. We calculate the <b>solvus</b> and spinodal <b>lines</b> in the phase diagram using a sub-regular solution model, and conclude that many Ca 1 -xCoxCO 3 mineral solid solutions (with observed compositions of up to x= 0. 027, and above x= 0. 93) are metastable with respect to phase separation. We also calculate solid/aqueous distribution coefficients to evaluate the effect of the strong non-ideality of mixing on the equilibrium with aqueous solution, showing that the thermodynamically-driven {{incorporation of}} cobalt in calcite (and of calcium in spherocobaltite) is always very low, regardless of the Co/Ca ratio of the aqueous environment...|$|R
