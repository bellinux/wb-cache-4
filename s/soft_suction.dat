50|$|Another suction hose, {{called a}} <b>soft</b> <b>suction,</b> is {{actually}} a short length of fabric-covered, flexible discharge hose used to connect the fire pumper suction inlet with a pressurized hydrant. It is not a true suction hose as it cannot withstand a negative pressure.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} 27 {{patients with}} pancreatic abscess treated since 1975 at hospitals {{affiliated with the}} University of Louisville School of Medicine. Treatment consisted of careful debridement, abscess drainage, and multiple antibiotics in all patients. Overall mortality was 33 %; however, only three of 17 patients treated since 1980 have died. Patients who died {{were more likely to}} have bacteremia, a residual abscess, multiple organ system failure, and/or polymicrobial growth on culture of the abscess. The proper use of <b>soft</b> <b>suction</b> drains in a dependent position reduced the rate of residual abscess to 19 % compared to 67 % in patients not treated in this fashion. The results identify factors that are correlates of death in patients with pancreatic abscess and emphasize the importance of prompt diagnosis and proper treatment...|$|E
40|$|Esophageal {{foreign bodies}} (FB) {{are common in}} adults and children. These are rarely {{reported}} in infants and neonates. A 2 -day-old newborn was referred to our hospital with history of accidental intrusion of <b>soft</b> silicone <b>suction</b> catheter into the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT). X-ray chest and abdomen confirmed the presence of suction tube in esophagus and stomach. The suction catheter was retrieved successfully at direct laryngoscopy...|$|R
30|$|Other {{important}} elements in <b>soft</b> robotics are <b>suction</b> cups. Three types of suction cups can be currently {{found in the}} literature: suction cups that are actuated by a dielectric elastomer [23], suction cups that are actuated by negative [24], and suction cups that are actuated by positive air pressure [25]. The latter type {{is based on the}} pneu-net principle from [6].|$|R
25|$|A <b>soft</b> corneal <b>suction</b> ring {{is applied}} to the eye, holding the eye in place. This step in the {{procedure}} can sometimes cause small blood vessels to burst, resulting in bleeding or subconjunctival hemorrhage into the white (sclera) of the eye, a harmless side effect that resolves within several weeks. Increased suction causes a transient dimming of vision in the treated eye. Once the eye is immobilized, a flap is created by cutting through the corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer. This process is achieved with a mechanical microkeratome using a metal blade, or a femtosecond laser that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea. The process of lifting and folding back the flap can sometimes be uncomfortable.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{the relationship of}} gag and cough reflexes to Glasgow coma score (GCS) in Chinese adults requiring critical care. Method: Prospective observational study of adult patients requiring treatment in the trauma or resuscitation rooms of the Emergency Department, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. A long cotton bud to stimulate the posterior pharyngeal wall (gag reflex) and a <b>soft</b> tracheal <b>suction</b> catheter were introduced through the mouth to stimulate the laryngopharynx and elicit the cough reflex. Reflexes were classified as normal, attenuated or absent. Results: A total of 208 patients were recruited. Reduced gag and cough reflexes {{were found to be}} significantly related to reduced GCS (p= 0. 014 and 0. 002, respectively). Of 33 patients with a GCS ≤ 8, 12 (36. 4 %) had normal gag reflexes and 8 (24. 2 %) had normal cough reflexes. 23 / 62 (37. 1 %) patients with a GCS of 9 - 14 had absent gag reflexes, and 27 (43. 5 %) had absent cough reflexes. In patients with a normal GCS, 22. 1 % (25 / 113) had absent gag reflexes and 25. 7 % (29) had absent cough reflexes. Conclusions: Our study has shown that in a Chinese population {{with a wide range of}} critical illness (but little trauma or intoxication), reduced GCS is significantly related to gag and cough reflexes. However, a considerable proportion of patients with a GCS ≤ 8 have intact airway reflexes and may be capable of maintaining their own airway, whilst many patients with a GCS > 8 have impaired airway reflexes and may be at risk of aspiration. This has important implications for airway management decisions. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
