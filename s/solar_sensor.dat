The highest grade one can receive is an [...] "S", and the lowest a [...] "C-". A number of other factors also determine the grade received, such as total time taken to complete the level. While playing the game, the player goes through a number of levels called dungeons. After a certain amount of these dungeons, the player will encounter a monster that is somewhat bigger than the others. These levels all called Immortal, because the four Immortals reside inside these levels. The player will have to fight his way to the boss creature, or Immortal, of the level. The player must defeat the [...] "Bosses" [...] and return them outside the dungeon level, to bathe and battle the Immortals into sunlight, called a Battle Drive (this is from the name of the device, used to defeat the Immortals, called the Pile Driver, summoned by Master Otenko).

40|$|Good {{air quality}} and {{temperature}} {{is not only}} pleasant but also a health issue and since the cabin of a truck is a work environment, the same demands as in other working spaces should be met. Volvo Group is a company which has the will of continuously improving their technology and has a strong safety culture, therefore the climate in the cabin is hence considered an important issue. There are four truck brands within the Volvo Group: Volvo Trucks, Mack Trucks, Renault Trucks and UD Trucks. The intention is that this thesis can contribute with knowledge to all the truck brands within the Volvo Group. To control the climate inside the cabin of a truck several sensors can be used. This master thesis aims at increasing the knowledge, mainly concerning a possible future <b>solar</b> <b>sensor.</b> A <b>solar</b> <b>sensor</b> in combination with a Climate Control Unit (CCU) {{can be used to}} forecast an increase in temperature in the cabin and to compensate for the thermal discomfort felt by a person situated in sunlight. The thesis started with a simulation of the heat balance of the truck in order to find the required accuracy and time constant of the <b>solar</b> <b>sensor.</b> Tests were performed to evaluate how a <b>solar</b> <b>sensor</b> would be affected by the windshield and finally a benchmark of the <b>solar</b> <b>sensor</b> was performed. The simulations show that the time constant of a <b>solar</b> <b>sensor</b> should be shorter than two seconds and that the accuracy should be within ± 6 W. There are several manufacturers of solar sensors with shorter time constants than required, however the accuracy of solar sensors is difficult compare between the manufacturers. The design of the sensors and their casing has a great impact on the performance of the sensor, as well as the placement of the sensor and the materials in the near surrounding. It is difficult to predict exactly how a specific sensor will perform in a particular application, hence physical tests will be needed to get exact results...|$|E

Based on the geometric coordinate transformation principle, the relationship equations of solar light orientation between measured powers with respect to various facets can be conducted. As a result, the solar orientation can be precisely achieved without needing any assistance of electronic compass and extra orientation angle corrector.
