25|$|Keating {{followed}} up on 2015’s winning success with his most successful IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season yet in 2016. Racing the full season with Bleekemolen for the third-straight year, Keating once again kicked-off the schedule with double duty in the season-opening Rolex 24 At Daytona. He and co-drivers Jeff Mosing, Eric Foss, Gar Robinson and Damien Faulkner put the No. 93 Viper on the GTD-class podium for the second-straight year after the 2015 Daytona victory. The No. 93 gained three positions in the race’s final hour for a third-place finish. Keating and the No. 33 team in turn recovered from a Saturday night accident to finish 10th which made ViperExchange.com the only two-car GTD team in the Rolex 24 to place both of its entries in the top 10. Keating focused solely on the No. 33 Viper with Bleekemolen {{for the rest of}} the year after Daytona but encountered some tough going one race later in the 12 Hours of Sebring for the third year in a row. Bleekemolen was leading in the race’s opening hour when the No. 33 suffered a rear <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> failure. The entry returned after some lengthy repairs and soldiered home to a 12th-place finish with Marc Miller co-driving with Keating and Bleekemolen.|$|E
2500|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body. The block's vertical movement was controlled by coil springs. The front suspension was upgraded with a hydraulic shock absorber ...|$|E
2500|$|During development, the Mark C had {{utilised}} {{the same}} sliding pillar suspension {{on the rear}} as the Mark B, but by September 1952, this had been changed for Flexitor suspension units produced by George Spencer Moulton & Co. Ltd. The Flexitor units were a type of lever arm shock absorber which used bonded rubber in torsion as the shock absorber. On these units a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> is mounted upon a trailing-arm with the pivot point being a steel rod. This rod is bonded inside a rubber tube which runs through and is also bonded to an external steel housing. The housing is bolted to {{the underside of the}} car. The units provide about [...] of vertical movement to each independent rear axle.|$|E
50|$|Hamster {{wheels are}} {{exercise}} devices. Most {{of these devices}} consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel {{moves forward}} as it rises, {{can also be}} poor for impact {{harshness}} (this can be negated by designing the beam with the mounts higher than the <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> which impacts on the floorpan height, and causes more roll oversteer) ...|$|R

2500|$|The Trainer's {{undercarriage}} {{was unusual}} and possibly vulnerable. [...] Each wheel was {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle,</b> independent of the other and swung on a V member formed from heavy duty square tubing, with its ends hinged to front and rear spar towards the outer end of the centre section, so the assembly could swing laterally. [...] Each V plus wheel was restrained by a radius arm hinged on the front spar near the fuselage, allowing {{a small amount of}} upwards and outward travel for the wheel. [...] The radius arms were sprung inside the fuselage. [...] In order to get the very wide track of 93 in (2.36 m), both the V and radius arms were heavily splayed and the angle between them was much smaller than normal, a cause for some concern. [...] The tailskid was mounted without a fuselage aperture, to avoid the trapping of grass and dirt.|$|E
2500|$|Boulton & Paul were {{encouraged}} by the responses {{to go ahead with}} a production version, the Phoenix II. This used the same flight surfaces but had a spot welded steel fuselage frame. [...] When covered this had much the same shape as the earlier wooden one apart from the nose, where a [...] uncowled nine-cylinder Salmson radial replaced the ABC. There were changes to the minor struts including those at the centre section, with the struts ahead of the cockpits gone; but the most obvious alteration was to the undercarriage. The main wheels were now on wing mounted vertical legs, each on a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> that had a pair of vee struts to the lower fuselage; the revised aircraft sat higher above the ground. The Phoenix II, still registered as G-AAIT made its first flight on 12 June 1930 and this was followed by another period of amateur testing. Despite its low price the Phoenix failed to attract buyers aiming below the Moth and no further machines were built. G-AAIT remained in use as Rea's personal hack until the end of 1935.|$|E
2500|$|GIIRs were {{powered by}} several {{different}} engines, some radial engines and some inverted inlines, but the prototype first flew with a [...] Salmson 9 AD, a small, nine cylinder radial. Later this first example flew with a [...] five cylinder BMW X. The Salmson was installed with its cylinder heads completely exposed but the wider spaced {{heads of the}} BMW protruded from a rounded cowling. [...] The G-IIRB and RC production aircraft had four cylinder Hirth HM 60 inverted inlines, producing , or the [...] Hirth 60 R racing version. [...] Behind the nose the G I and GIIR fuselages were similar, with flat sides and rounded tops, apart from the increased inter-cockpit spacing. [...] The G I and GIIRB empennages also shared the same constant chord surfaces with semicircular tips. Early GIIRs had the same single axle main undercarriage and tailskid as on the G I but this was altered on from the GII B onwards to one where each main wheel was mounted on a V-form strut mounteded on the central lower fuselage, with a bungee shock absorber from the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> to the upper longeron. The tailskid was replaced with a small wheel on a sprung strut.|$|E
25|$|The main {{undercarriage}} was a robust split-axle construction with the legs joining the wings {{at the bottom}} of the X-form centre-section struts. Braced <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> carried the arrester claws required by the longitudinal arrester wires of Royal Navy aircraft carriers up to 1926. The undercarriage assembly was designed so that it could be easily removed with the aircraft on trestles, and replaced with a pair of aluminium single-step, V-bottomed round-topped floats. These carried water rudders for manoeuvring afloat.|$|R
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> attached to the suspension on the right.|$|R
5000|$|Hamster wheels or [...] {{running wheel}} are {{exercise}} devices used primarily by hamsters and other rodents, {{but also by}} other cursorial animals when given the opportunity. Most of these devices consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined. The earliest dated {{use of the term}} [...] "hamster wheel", located by the Oxford English Dictionary, is in a 1949 newspaper advertisement.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is one of}} the {{two front}} axles that carries a wheel in a rear wheel drive vehicle. The axle is capable of limited angular {{movement}} about the kingpin for steering the vehicle. The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> consists of wheel bearings which support the wheel hub.|$|E

50|$|In 1909 H.F.S. Morgan {{introduced}} a fundamentally similar system using a sliding <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{on a fixed}} pillar, used first on Morgan Motor Company cyclecars, then on their cars up to the current time. The Morgan design is an inverted sliding pillar, as are most of the later designs; the pillar {{is attached to the}} chassis and the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> is carried by the sliding sleeve over this.|$|E
2500|$|In 1883 Starbucks {{supplied}} {{a further}} two single deck cars, {{similar to the}} original batch, followed in 1884 by two more. These were known as summer cars, they were painted all over green, and were of the [...] "toast-rack" [...] design, being extremely low, with the foot-boards only just off the ground. The seats were built immediately above the wheels, which were mounted or <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Two further standard single deck cars were bought from Starbucks in 1885 {{and in the same}} year Car No.19 (being a Starbuck of 1881) was converted into a double decker.|$|R
2500|$|The Harrow {{had to have}} a clear space {{below the}} {{fuselage}} to allow torpedo dropping. The main legs were attached to the front spar at the ends of the centre section, and pairs of bracing struts ran from the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> to the lower fuselage longerons. [...] Snap link hooks were fitted to the inner ends of the axles to engage with the longitudinal arrester wires of the time. The specification required that the land undercarriage could be replaced rapidly with floats. [...] These were long, single stepped and fitted with water rudders, built by Short Brothers.|$|R
50|$|The axle passes {{beneath the}} loadbed {{of the cart}} but was cranked upwards at each side. This allows the load to be carried low, for {{stability}} and ease of loading with heavy objects such as churns or barrels. The high position of the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> allow large wheels, giving a smooth ride. The box body is open at the rear, {{with no more than}} a chain across for safety. Rather than a driving seat or box, they are driven from a standing position, alongside the load. Floats were drawn by a single horse or, especially in Ireland, a donkey.|$|R
50|$|Some {{trailers}} {{support a}} normal axle on two sides, others mount the wheel off one {{side with a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (a one sided axle).|$|E
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered wheels {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} axle assemblies.|$|E
50|$|The Week-End had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} with each mainwheel {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{provided}} with a torsional shock absorber. Each axle was at the convergence of three struts from the lower fuselage. There was a small tailskid.|$|E
5000|$|In 1883 Starbucks {{supplied}} {{a further}} two single deck cars, {{similar to the}} original batch, followed in 1884 by two more. These were known as summer cars, they were painted all over green, and were of the [...] "toast-rack" [...] design, being extremely low, with the foot-boards only just off the ground. The seats were built immediately above the wheels, which were mounted or <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Two further standard single deck cars were bought from Starbucks in 1885 {{and in the same}} year Car No.19 (being a Starbuck of 1881) was converted into a double decker.|$|R
50|$|The smooth, oval section {{fuselage}} was ply {{and fabric}} covered, tapering towards the tail. The pilot sat low {{down in a}} small open cockpit with narrow streamlined dorsal fairings in front and behind. His view forward was severely restricted by the central inline bank of four cylinders of the W-12 Lorraine-Dietrich 12E water-cooled piston engine. The engine was cooled by radiators in the wings, assisted for the first flight by a bank of radiators mounted between the undercarriage legs. These backward leaning legs were wide chord, faired cantilevers with large, unfaired wheels mounted on individual <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> The V.1's conventional undercarriage was completed by a small tailskid.|$|R
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is named}} so because it resembles {{the shape of}} a stub, like a {{truncated}} end of an axle, short in shape and blunt.There are four following method those are1. Elliot strub axle2. Reversed elliot3. Lemoine4. Lemoine inverted ...|$|E
50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length {{half-shaft}} universally jointed at each end. The universal joints act as {{inner and outer}} pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at {{the output of the}} differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (for knock-off wheels) or a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947 Earle MacPherson {{patented}} the MacPherson strut {{for use on}} the Chevrolet Cadet. [...] This was {{the first}} true strut suspension for cars: the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through a swivelling joint as for Stout's Scarab.|$|E
50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly mounted axle beam in which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|R
50|$|H-drive {{was first}} {{developed}} by Hub van Doorne of the Dutch truck maker DAF. It was a derivative of their Trado conversion {{to produce a}} 6×4 off-road truck from a commercial 4×2 chassis. The Trado used a bogie rear suspension for both sets of rear wheels. This suspension, best known through the Scammell Pioneer of 1927, uses a single central axle, or driveshaft, that in turn drives two walking beams (balanceur, in Dutch) one on each side. The wheels are supported by overhung <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> The conversion added the walking beams {{to the ends of}} the original truck beam axle. From that point, the drive between the axles of each side was separated side by side.|$|R
50|$|This {{principle}} of divided drive already being {{established for the}} front of the Trado, it was a minor step for van Doorne to divide the drive to the rear wheels as well. The DAF YA-328 used walking beams where the axle {{was no more than a}} pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external longitudinal drive shafts, one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and right-angle drive to the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the worm shaft as an output.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body. The block's vertical movement was controlled by coil springs. The front suspension was upgraded with a hydraulic shock absorber ...|$|E
50|$|The D.480 had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage with a {{track of}} 2.80 m. Each mainwheel was {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> at the vertex of a V-strut hinged on the lower fuselage longeron, with a near-vertical sprung leg, with an oleo strut shock absorber, to the wing spar. The tailwheel was on a long, hinged leg close to the rear fuselage with a short, vertical shock absorber.|$|E
50|$|The Peitz had a {{tail skid}} {{undercarriage}} with each wheel on a steel <b>stub</b> <b>axle,</b> hinged on a V-strut {{from the lower}} fuselage and with a short vertical elastic shock absorber leg to the forward wing strut This junction was strengthened by extra struts to the forward fuselage and {{to the top of}} the forward, vertical cabane strut and by another long strut outwards {{to the top of the}} rear wing spar.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1920s the {{carriage}} was upgraded; first to Mk 1R (solid rubber tyres) then to Mks 1P or 1PA (new wheels, axles, brakes and pneumatic tyres) for vehicle towing. [...] The Mk 1P was a British conversion which involved {{cutting off the}} ends of the axle and fitting a new axle beneath {{the carriage}} which utilized 9.00 X 16 tyres. The Mk 1PA was the American Martin-Parry (Buquor) conversion in which 'drop down' <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> were fitted, secured by means of sleeves fitted over {{the ends of the}} original axles. These had larger 7.50 X 24 tyres. [...] The No. 26 artillery trailer was similarly converted. Unlike most other guns and howitzers in British service, calibrating Probert sights were not fitted to the 4.5-inch howitzer.|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} high-performance, light-weight {{components for}} car transmission and suspension systems, {{it is important}} to know the component life-time under normal, random load as well as the safety against failure. The fracture behaviour under impact loads plays a major role in this context. An experimental study into the influence of material properties on the fracture behaviour of automobile <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> and specimens of comparable geometry is described in this article. For the highly stressed components of the vehicle suspensions beside the fatigue life under normal operational loads also the safety against total failure is a decisive criteria. The fracture behaviour under impact loads plays a major role in this context. An experimental study into the influence of the geometric design of automobile wheels and wheel hubs is described in this article...|$|R
