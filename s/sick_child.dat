5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the <b>sick</b> <b>child.</b> All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E

Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden).

In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped {{the depths of his}} feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The <b>Sick</b> <b>Child</b> (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893–94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes).|$|E
