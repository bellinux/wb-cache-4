40|$|Based on the {{structural}} {{analysis of sample}} knitted fabrics and the knit geometric theory, we have built an algorithm that can make three-dimensional structure models for weft knitted fabrics such as welt stitches, tuck <b>stitches,</b> cross <b>stitches,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>stitches</b> and purl stitches. In order to reduce computational complexity, we have set the anchoring point on the diametral plane of yarn in the knitting chart. Drawing from the beginning knitting point to the finished knitting point, a smooth knit curve model can be obtained with the cardinal spline curve. Using this algorithm, we have developed the weft knit three-dimensional structure modeling software that can display the three-dimensional model of knitted fabrics including welt stitches; tuck <b>stitches,</b> cross <b>stitches,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>stitches</b> and purl stitches. Our work confirms 3 -D modeling of three foundation knits of weft knit (plain <b>stitches,</b> purl <b>stitches,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>stitches),</b> tuck stitches, welt stitches and cross stitches with a commercially available PC. This software {{can be used by}} someone with no understanding of knitting to gain an understanding of the knitting process, and determine the structure of a knitted fabric product. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} texture for a knitted garment is that {{generated}} by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and T-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl. [...] Other simple textures {{can be made with}} nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter <b>stitch,</b> <b>ribbing,</b> and moss and seed stitches. [...] Adding a [...] "slip stitch" [...] (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows {{for a wide range of}} textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.|$|R

30|$|In general, high <b>stitch</b> density <b>Rib</b> showed better impact {{resistance}} and had better tensile strength {{and work of}} rupture in both directions as appose to other patterns which is {{in compliance with the}} results driven from genetic algorithm prediction.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} knit and purl stripes (wales) are {{generally}} equal, although {{they need not}} be. When they are equal, the fabric has no tendency to curl, unlike stockinette <b>stitch.</b> Such <b>ribbing</b> looks the same {{on both sides and}} is useful for garments such as scarves.|$|R
50|$|Ribbing is notated by (number of knit stitches) &times; (number of purl <b>stitches).</b> Thus, 1&times;1 <b>ribbing</b> has one knit stitch, {{followed}} by one purl stitch, {{followed by}} one knit stitch, and so on.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Knitted fabric using acrylic/wool {{blended yarn}} (A/W) is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} knit industry; subsequently, research on knitted fabric using A/W has increased. This study presents an scientific database from evaluating physical properties of 1 × 1 <b>rib</b> <b>stitch</b> using A/W. In this study, 1 × 1 <b>rib</b> <b>stitch</b> using A/W were made at various knitting tensions (dial no. 2 - 6) and the number (4 - 6) of ply yarn. The physical properties of 1 × 1 <b>rib</b> <b>stitch</b> using A/W were measured and ana-lyzed. The density was in the range 5. 5 - 6. 4 wales/cm and 4. 0 - 5. 6 courses/cm, respectively. The density increased when less plying yarns and more knitting tension were added during knitting. The thickness was {{in the range of}} 1. 592 - 2. 362 mm and the tensile strength was in the range 32. 75 - 53. 63 Kgf/mm. The burst strength was in the range 107. 8 - 139. 2 N/cm 2. Thickness, tensile strength, and burst strength increased as the number of ply yarn and the knitting tension increased. The elongation and the recovery extension rate were in the range 102. 29 - 112. 13 % and 96. 4 - 97. 7 %, respec-tively. The heat retention rate was in the range 59. 3 - 65. 1 %. There was no difference of the elongation and the recovery extension rate and the heat retention rate by the knitting tension and the number of the ply yarn. The permeability was in the range 170. 5 - 396. 3 cm 3 /c...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{waviness}} and <b>rib</b> <b>stitching</b> {{have been}} investigated {{as part of a}} series of tests to determine the effects on wing drag of common surface irregularities. The tests were made in the N. A. C. A. 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel at Reynolds Numbers up to 17, 000, 000. The results of the tests showed that the waviness common to airplane wings will cause no serious increase in drag unless the waviness exists on the forward part of the wing, where it may cause premature transition or premature compressibility effects. Waves 3 inches wide and 0. 048 inch high, for example, increased the drag 1 percent when they covered the rear 67 percent of both surfaces and 10 percent when they covered the rear 92 percent. A single wave 3 inches wide and only 0. 020 inch high at the 10. 5 -percent-chord point on the upper surface caused transition to occur on the wave and increased the drag 6 percent. <b>Rib</b> <b>stitching</b> increased the drag 7 percent when the rib spacing was 6 inches; the drag increment was proportional to the number of ribs for wider spacings. About one-third of the increase was due to premature transition at the forward ends of the stitching...|$|R
5000|$|Each knitter {{has her own}} {{method of}} making a shawl collar, using garter stitch, basket <b>stitch,</b> or <b>ribbing,</b> and {{knitting}} in one colour or incorporating stripes. [...] A common technique is to pick up {{two of the four}} base stitches, start on one side and work up the neck edge to the shoulder by picking up a stitch from the lapel edge on each row and increasing the width of the collar as it is worked. The top ends in line with the shoulder seam. The same is done for the other side. The knitter then picks up stitches from the neck edge and knits back and forth, increasing on each row and picking up stitches form the top of the lapel, then casts off the collar back. Some skilled knitters are able to pick up stitches all around the neckline and knit the collar all at one time by increasing and decreasing for shaping.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric. Alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette pattern/stocking <b>stitch.</b> Vertical stripes (<b>ribbing)</b> are possible by having alternating wales of knit and purl stitches. [...] For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.|$|R
