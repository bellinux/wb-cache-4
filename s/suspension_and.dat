5|$|The body shell, <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> {{electrics}} of the GM Zeta platform {{have been}} thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{received}} an early opportunity to {{start for the}} Roughriders after Ray Jacobs was suspended for missing practice in the preseason. Adams made his CFL debut as a defensive end on June 19, 2003 against the Toronto Argonauts. He went on to play in nine regular season games and record 13 tackles in his rookie season, both due to Jacobs' continued <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> injuries to other defensive linemen later in the season.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, thanks to a superior goal difference, {{they went into the}} game as underdogs due to a number of their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> because they had lost to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw they needed to go to the next stage of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|E

Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E

The Chevrolet SS Sedan was imported to the United States (but again, not to Canada) again for 2015 with only minor changes, notably the addition of Magnetic Ride Control <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> a Tremec TR-6060 manual transmission. For the 2016 model year, the SS sedan received a facelift based on the VF Series II Commodore unveiled in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Berger {{played in}} two major tournaments for the Czech Republic. He played an {{important}} part in his nation's Euro 1996 campaign, scoring in the final as the Czech Republic finished runners-up to Germany. He took a 17-month break from the national team between 1997 and 1998 after a dispute with manager Dušan Uhrin, returning to the setup following Uhrin's departure from the post. His second and final major tournament was Euro 2000, but due to <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> his country's early exit, he only played one game. He retired from the national team in 2002 at the age of 28 with a total of 44 senior international caps and 18 goals.|$|E

Front discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
