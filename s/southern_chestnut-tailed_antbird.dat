50|$|Many {{research}} {{projects in the}} Amazon basin aimed to test {{the validity of the}} hypothesis. The <b>southern</b> <b>chestnut-tailed</b> <b>antbird</b> (Myrmeciza hemimelaena) is a species that exemplifies the hypothesis in nature. The antbirds' diversification and distribution were examined throughout the Amazon, three monophyletic, genetically distinct, populations of the bird were found; two of them are currently valid subspecies. Two of the clades existed {{on either side of the}} Madeira River and the third one had a range in between the Madeira River and two small tributaries Jiparaná and Aripuanã. This shows evidence of how these birds diversified due to possible riverine barriers, causing a limitation in gene flow. Another study found that saddle-back tamarins follow the premise that variant gene flow occurs at different parts of a river. Gene flow was found to be restricted to the narrower headwaters of rivers, while a decrease was observed toward the mouth. This is consistent with the hypothesis. Yet, some speculate that using a single mechanism to explain diversification in the tropics would be an oversimplification. For example, there is evidence that genetic variation in the Blue-crowned Manakin may have been influenced by river barriers, Andean uplift, and range expansions.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>chestnut-tailed</b> <b>antbird</b> {{is located}} within the Serrania de Huanchaca in Bolivia. Within this region exists an fringe patch of forest (see figure 3c) {{estimated}} to have been isolated for 1000-3000 years. The population of antbirds that reside in the isolated patch express significant song divergence; thought to be an [...] "early step" [...] {{in the process of}} peripatric speciation. Further, peripheral isolation [...] "may partly explain the dramatic diversification of suboscines in Amazonia".|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} divergence of mating signals {{provides a}} powerful basis for animal speciation. Divergence in sympatry strengthens reproductive isolation, and divergence in allopatry can {{reduce or eliminate}} gene flow between populations on secondary contact. In birds, {{the first of these}} processes has empirical support, but the second remains largely hypothetical. This is perhaps because most studies have focused on oscine passerines, whose song learning ability may reduce the influence of vocalizations in reproductive isolation. In suboscine passerines, the role of learning in song development is thought to be minimal, and the resultant signals are relatively fixed. To investigate the role of song {{in the early stages of}} peripatric speciation, we therefore studied a suboscine, the <b>chestnut-tailed</b> <b>antbird</b> Myrmeciza hemimelaena. We recorded male songs in a natural forest island (isolated for < 3000 years) at the southern fringe of Amazonia, and at two nearby sites in continuous forest. A previous study found the isolated population to be weakly differentiated genetically from the ancestral population suggesting that peripatric speciation was underway. In support of this, although we detected minor but significant differences in song structure between each site, the most divergent songs were those of island birds. On simulating secondary contact using playback, we found that pairs from the forest island responded more strongly to island (i. e. local) songs than to those from both non-island sites, and vice versa. This pattern was not observed in pairs from one non-island site, which responded with equal strength to local songs and songs from the other non-island site. Island females were more likely to approach and sing after hearing local male songs, rather than songs from the non-island populations, and vice versa; non-island females did not appear to discriminate between local songs and those from the other non-island site. These findings are consistent with the idea that vocal divergence arising in small populations at the edge of Amazonia may result in partial reproductive isolation when contact is resumed. They also suggest the possibility that song divergence in peripatry may, after much longer time-frames, act as a barrier to gene flow in suboscines, perhaps because of an inability to learn or recognize divergent songs on secondary contact. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R
