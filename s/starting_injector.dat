40|$|Being able {{to ignite}} or reignite a {{gas turbine engine}} in a cold and rarified {{atmosphere}} is a critical issue for many manu-facturers. In the Vesta combustor of Turbomeca, 18 main burners are ignited by two pilot flames. The success of an ignition attempt depends on the completion of three steps. In a first step, a spark plug must ignite the fuel spray produced by each starting burner to generate the pilot flames. In a second step, these two flames must provide a sufficient amount of energy to initiate a stable combustion in the main burners located in their vicinity. Finally, the reactive zone must propagate from one main burner to its nearest neighbour until the whole chamber is ignited. These three steps are strongly influenced by the topology of the flow {{as well as the}} two-phase turbulent combustion phe-nomena. To represent properly the physics involved in such a complex and unsteady process, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) seems to be a powerful tool. This technique has been successfully applied to turbulent reactive flows (Selle et al. 1) and recently extended to two-phase combustion in gas turbines (Pascaud et al. 2). The numerical tool {{used in the present study}} couples an eulerian solver for the liquid spray with a LES solver for the gas flow. Thanks to the use of unstructured grids, it can be applied to complex geometries. This work focuses on the propagation of the flame from the starting burners to the whole chamber but not on the ignition of the starting burners themselves: the spray flame produced by the <b>starting</b> <b>injector</b> is simply replaced by a hot gases jet. First, two-phase flow calculations will be presented in which this jet ignites one isolated burner. Then, some results will be shown from a single-phase flow calculation done on the IBM supercomputer BlueGene/L- cited by TOP 500 as the world’s fastest machine- where the use of 2048 parallel processors have enabled to start computing on the full combustor domain (i. e. 18 main injectors + 2 pilot flames).

50|$|A small {{heater coil}} {{is built into}} the thermotime switch, which {{effectively}} gives a timed output to the cold <b>start</b> <b>injector</b> with the timing duration dependent on the temperature of the engine. If the engine is started whilst warm the bimetallic strip remains open due to the higher temperature, meaning the cold start routine is not entered.|$|R
50|$|This {{duration}} {{is controlled}} by the thermotime switch, which is a bimetallic strip based device placed in the water jacket {{or in the case of}} an air-cooled engine, in the engine/timing case. When an engine first starts, the coolant temperature is cold and the bimetallic strip is closed, which in turn supplies the cold <b>start</b> <b>injector</b> with current.|$|R
50|$|A thermotime switch, or TTS, is {{a sensor}} {{used to control}} the cold start {{enrichment}} process in some older fuel injection systems. An extra injector {{is placed in the}} inlet manifold designed to feed all of the cylinders, and whilst the other injectors have flow rates controlled by pulse duration, the cold <b>start</b> <b>injector</b> stays on during the initial cold starting procedure.|$|R
5000|$|Cold engines also {{typically}} {{require more}} fuel and a richer mixture when first started (see: cold <b>start</b> <b>injector),</b> because fuel does not vaporize as well when cold and therefore requires more fuel to properly [...] "saturate" [...] the air. Rich mixtures also burn slower and decrease {{the risk of}} spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) when the engine is under load. However, rich mixtures sharply increase carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.|$|R

LE2 (1984-), featured cold start functionality integrated in the ECU, {{which does not}} require the cold <b>start</b> <b>injector</b> and thermo time switch used by older systems. LE3 (1989-), featuring miniaturised ECU with hybrid technology, integrated into the junction box of the mass airflow meter.|$|R
50|$|The 5S-FE was {{available}} in several variations each being distinguished by valve cover design. The first generation, introduced in the 1990-92 Celica GT/GT-S and MR2, had a power rating of 130 hp and 144 lbs-ft/torque. The second generation was introduced in 1993 with the fifth generation (ST184) Celica, and continued through the sixth generation (ST204) Celica. The second generation was also used in the MR2 (SW21) and Camry/Scepter (XV10) series and had a power output of 135 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque. It had slightly less aggressive cams, no cold <b>start</b> <b>injector,</b> a knock sensor, and more aggressive tuning to give it slightly more power. In states that had adopted California emission standards the 5S-FE was rated at 130 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque due mainly to emission equipment used to meet those emission regulations. The third generation was the last 5S-FE engine produced and {{was used in the}} 1997-01 Camry XV20 and 1999-01 Camry Solara; however, from 1996 onward, the engine received a crank angle sensor instead of a cam angle sensor for a smoother idle. From 1997 to 1999 the engine produced 133 hp at 5,200 rpm and 147 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. From 2000 to 2001, the engine received modest improvements to increase power output to 136 hp at 5,200 rpm and 150 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. The 5S-FE was replaced in all applications by the 2.4 L 2AZ-FE.|$|R

5000|$|Stiction is a {{commonly}} used term when diagnosing diesel fuel powered engines. The Ford Powerstroke 6.0-L and 7.3-L engines {{are the most}} prevalent to experience cold <b>start</b> or <b>injector</b> stiction issues. The 7.3-L was produced between 1994 and 2003, while the 6.0-L was produced between 2003 and 2007. Both engines were manufactured by Navistar International and incorporated the HEUI injector system. These injectors use the engine oil to lubricate themselves and over time the sticky friction build up causes the injector to malfunction and fail. Alternatively to replacing injectors with new units, products are available that rid the injector, turbos and transmission of stiction and prevent build up. Leading engineers in the field have found in their research that 9 out of 10 failing injectors in diesel trucks are cases of stiction, and once removed are still in optimal working condition. [...] Stiction is also the same threshold at which a rolling object would begin to slide over a surface rather than rolling at the expected rate (and {{in the case of}} a wheel, in the expected direction). In this case, it's called [...] "rolling friction" [...] or μr.|$|R

30|$|The water flood {{began in}} 1995. Three <b>injectors</b> <b>started</b> injecting in this year. The oil {{production}} rate was increased by 60 %. During the water flood, the imbalance of pressure {{and a low}} sweep volume factor also existed. The recovery factor was 36.13 % {{at the end of}} the history match of the primary and secondary phases. According to the outcomes of simulations, only some of the producers responded to the injected water. Others were still dominated by the solution gas drive. Some un-swept areas were left, especially the north part of the reservoir, which has not been swept well by the water flood. There were two factors which formed the rich zone of the remaining oil in the central reservoir: (1) the unevenness of production and injection and (2) the heterogeneous nature of the reservoir. There is also a blind side on the boundary of the reservoir where it is difficult to form a circulation of the reservoir fluids in a closed region.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{illustrates}} {{an investigation}} about {{the potentialities of}} injection rate shaping coupled with an after injection. A pilot shot can either be absent or present before the rate-shaped boot injection. The experimental tests have been performed on a partial PCCI Euro 5 diesel engine endowed with direct-acting piezoelectric <b>injectors.</b> <b>Starting</b> from optimized triple pilot-main-after injection strategies, boot injection was implemented by maintaining the direct-acting piezo injector needle open at part lift. The results of two steady state working conditions have been presented in terms of engine-out emissions, combustion noise and brake specific fuel consumption. In addition, in-cylinder analyses of the pressure, heat-release rate, temperature and emissions have been evaluated. Considering the in-cylinder pressure traces and the heat release rate curves, the injection rate shaping proved to influence combustion {{in the absence of}} a pilot injection to a great extent. A pilot shot, added before the boot injection, determined a mitigation of the influence of rate shaping. A simultaneous reduction in NOx and soot can be achieved for small quantities of fuel injected during boot injection, compared to the optimized triple injection strategies. However, a trade-off exists between emissions and combustion noise when boot injection is applied. On the other hand, the variations in bsfc were only minor. The advantages of the application of boot injection are greater for low to medium loads than for medium to high loads. However, it was not possible to find a working condition in which boot injection provided simultaneous advantages on emissions, noise and consumption, compared to the optimized triple injection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{numerical}} investigation {{and discussion of}} a cryogenic injection test case. This {{is a first step}} towards a numerical model for high pressure liquid rocket engine injection. Experiments with nitrogen injection at supercritical pressures are an accepted way of studying flow phenomena relevant for high pressure liquid rocket engines without introducing the complexities of mixing and combustion. CFD simulations of these cryogenic injection cases are found to typically agree on predicting a region of constant high density, extending some 10 injector diameters downstream into the chamber. This is in agreement with the traditional interpretation of liquid injection where instabilities on the phase boundary grow until the jet disintegrates. However, many experiments do not show this behavior: exceeding the critical pressure of the injected fluid, phase interfaces seize to exist, the jet tends to behave more like a dense gas jet with a rapid drop off of density <b>starting</b> at the <b>injector</b> exit. It is thus unclear whether the concept of a liquid core length is still true for thermodynamic states at temperatures near the critical point and supercritical pressures. To study this, experimental and numerical boundary conditions have been analyzed. Computations have been carried out using the DLR TAU code extended by a treatment for real gas thermodynamics. It has been found that the absence of a dense core, as found in experiments, can be reproduced numerically if numerical boundary conditions are chosen appropriately: taking into account heat transfer inside the injector leads to a preheating of the cryogenic stream {{and the development of a}} distinct radial density profile. This preheated jet then shows the more realistic immediate reduction of density instead of a dense core. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current thesis work could be basically summarized as {{the realization of the}} flight version designs for the injector assembly and the combustion chamber head of a 500 N liquid bipropellant rocket engine. The work is embedded in the German Space Administration(DLR) -STERN project “SMART ROCKETS” consisting in the design, manufacture and flight campaign of a Liquid Oxygen-Ethanol propelled rocket. Both design problems were carried on in parallel, with the aim of not only realize a functional design capable of satisfying the driving requirements, but also amenable of being incorporated in the evolving engine concept, whose components interface features represent crucial aspects for the whole assembly realization and validation. The path toward the definition of the flight version coaxial swirl <b>injector</b> <b>started</b> with the characterization of the existing test injectors built within the project, based on existing flow models and experimental data gained through a series of cold flow and combustion tests. Those tests evidenced that the available fluid dynamic models, based on the strong hypothesis of inviscid flow, were only capable of accurately describe the behavior of the oxidizer injector while gave unacceptable prediction errors for the fuel injector, leading to the difficulty in find a reliable massflow-pressure correlation for the injection assembly. Therefore the focus shifted in enhancing the flow model including the viscosity effects believed to be the reason of the fuel injector discharge capability drop. The characterization of the Boundary Layer structure inside the swirl injector chamber under some simplifying hypotheses brought to a close form analytical solution of the viscous swirler problem. Thus, further cold flow tests were planned and conducted in order to verify the validity of the obtained solution: the test results matched with great accuracy the predictions of the built viscous model over a wide range of measurements, leading to the assessment of the enhanced injector flow model and the building of the operative map for both injectors. This gave the possibility to design the flight version injectors meeting the baselined requirements. The definition of the flight version combustion chamber head also started considering the analysis of the current project process: the interface nature of this element forced its design to be subject to several constraints coming from the other subsystems development. The optimization process of the flight version focused on the choice of the combination of geometric and material features of the designed concept, facing the compromise between weight saving and thermal-structural integrity. The use of lightweight materials such Aluminum alloys seemed to be the most promising solution for a lightweight design and an active cooling strategy has been implemented in order for the lightweight structure to withstand the thermal loads coming from combustion. A thermal model has been built for the convective heat transfer of burning gases and coolant beside the injector plate and coupled with a structural analysis, through which the optimum “leading thickness” of the structure has been obtained as the outcome of a thermal/stress analytical optimization, then validated through the use of FEM codes. Tuned the interface features together with the other mattering subsystems, a final lightweight design has been assessed with the choice of a High Temperature Aluminum Alloy, ready to be manufactured and capable of satisfying both thermal-structural and interface requirements...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Sıvı yakıtlı roket motorlarında yakıt atomizasyonun istenilen karakteristikte ve performansta olması; roket motorunun beklenen özgül itki değerlerini yakalaması açısından hayati önem teşkil etmektedir. Literatürde yapılan incelemelerde sıvı yakıtlı roket motorları için geliştirilen ilk enjektörlerde Rus tasarımı ürünlerin daha çok analitik ifadelerin türetilmesi ile belirlendiği, ABD tasarımı ürünlerde ise deneysel veriler kullanılarak türetilen ampirik bağıntılar kullanılarak atömizör tasarımları yapıldığı görülmüştür. Yapılan ilerlemeler ile analitik ve ampirik bağıntıların geliştirildiği, var olan sonuçların nümerik çalışmalarla da simule edilerek doğrulandığı görülmüştür.   Sıvı yakıtlı roket motorlarında kullanılan yakıtlar genellikle kriyojenik özelliktedir ve yanmanın gerçekleşmesi için sıvı kütlenin hızlıca buhar fazına geçirilmesi bir gerekliliktir. Bu sebepten yanma odası girişinde yakıtlar enjektörlerde farklı metodlar kullanılarak küçük taneciklere ayrışması sağlanmaktadır. Küçük taneciklere ayrışan sıvının moleküllerinin yüzey alanı ciddi oranda artmaktadır ve buharlaşması için gerekli olan enerji ihtiyacı düşmektedir. Buharlaşma için gerekli olan enerji ihtiyacının azalması, sıvının buharlaşma hızını arttırmaktadır. Buhar fazına geçen yakıt (yanıcı+yakıcı) bir enerji kaynağı ile reaksiyona girmesi sağlanır ve yanma başlar. Burada kritik olan buharlaşmanın enjektör çıkışından sonra hangi mesafede en yoğun şekilde gerçekleşeceğinin belirlenmesidir. Çünkü ilgili mesafe, aynı zamanda yanmanın nerede başlayacağını, dolayısı ile motor performansını direkt etkilemektedir. Bu sebepten sıvı yakıtlı motor yanma odası tasarlanıyorken, enjektörün ortalama tanecik çapı, sprey koniklik açısı ve tanecik parçalanma boyununda tasarıma girdi parametre olarak göz önünde tutulması gerekmektedir. Yapılan çalışmada, atomizör için ister olarak belirlenen parametreler; verilen girdi parametreleri kullanılarak hem analitik olarak türetilmiş hem de nümerik olarak doğrulanmıştır. Girdi parametresi olarak verilen yaktı debisi ve basınç düşüm değeri kullanılarak ortalama tanecik çapı, sprey koniklik açısı ve tanecik parçalanma boyu analitik olarak belirlenmiştir.

Thrust {{request of}} aerial vehicles is provided from {{different type of}} propulsion systems for atmospheric and exoatmospheric application. In atmospheric operations, air breathing or propeller engine systems {{could be used for}} a propulsion request; however rocket engines are the only choice for exoatmospheric operations since there is no air in that environment. Rocket engines could be classified into the two main types: One is the solid rocket engine and the other is liquid rocket engine. In liquid rocket engines (LRE), both fuel and oxidizers are stored in liquid phases and general configuration includes tanks, pump systems, valve system, injection systems, combustion chamber, nozzle and cooling passage for LRE’s. Liquid fuel and oxidizers are both pressurized with pumps and transferred to the injection system. After atomization starts, the following step is the vaporization of liquid components. Finally, combustion takes place from fuel and oxidizers vapor mix. Both liquid and solid rockets have some advantages and disadvantages. Liquid rocket engines have higher thrust level, led to adjust the thrust level and have stop-restarting features. Besides these advantages, liquid rocket engines have also some disadvantages. Cryogenic liquid storage, complex flow control systems and high maintenance costs are the basic disadvantages of this type of engines. Conversely, solid rocket engines have less complex systems and this gives an advantages to solid engines such as storing propellant is simple and firing system of propellant is simple. Adjustable thrust level and restarting is not applicable for solid rocket engines.   Liquid rocket engines are used most of space shuttle and launching vehicles as the main thrust system. Combustion performance of liquid engines has directly effect on total motor performance. Key issue for high combustion efficiency is to fine atomization and mixing of propellants. Hence, atomization quality and stability of injection system has a critical role on the total performance of rocket engine. Liquid atomization is the process that is the disintegration of bulk liquid into the small droplets. Liquid atomization is widely used in different industries like thrust chambers, pharmaceutical industry and agriculture industry for different aims. Obtaining the expected design characteristics and performance parameters of injectors in liquid-propellant rocket engine have critical role on rocket engine performance output. Russian researchers had a first studies on coaxial injectors to express the phenomena inside the atomizer by deriving analytical expressions. Besides researchers from US expressed the empirical equations derived from experimental data to clarify the inside flow of an atomizer. Progress in both analytical and empirical studies resulting more precise and controlled injector design. Liquid-propellant rocket engines mostly use cryogenic propellants and the rapid vaporization of liquid bulk is a necessity for high performance combustion in thrust chamber. Hence, different types of injectors could be used according to the requests in combustion chamber to disintegrate the bulk liquid propellant. After disintegration of bulk liquid, droplets have much higher surface area than bulk liquid and this led them a lower energy needs to vaporization. Decreasing requested energy for vaporization of droplets led to increase the vaporization speed. Combustion starts with igniting when the both propellant are in vapor phase. Critical parameter for the combustion is the distance between the injector and vaporization zone since this distance says where the combustion <b>starts.</b> Therefore, <b>injector</b> droplet mean diameter, spray cone angle and break-up length parameters take into consideration when designing a combustion chamber of liquid-propellant rocket motor. In liquid rocket engines, there are different types of injectors, which could be used. Coaxial and impinging types are two main classification and both of them have some advantages and disadvantages. Coaxial types of injectors are widely used especially in liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellant engines. Coaxial injectors are can be divided two sub-group: Shear Coaxial and Swirl Coaxial. Swirl coaxial types of injectors have two swirl type injectors located coaxially. Inner swirl injector atomizes the liquid oxygen and the outer swirl injector atomizes the fuel. Coaxial swirl injector can classified as a sub-type of swirl atomizers. These type atomizes have been started to develop since beginning of twentieth century. Studies on this type injector were mostly focused on the inner flow phenomena of atomizer at early times. Analytical equations were derived for the swirl atomizers with the assumption of inviscid liquid. Derived equations were improved by using the experimental data and could be useful for swirl atomizers with the different geometries. Droplet size, spray cone angle, flow rate, and most of other important parameter effect the flow could be determined by the derived equations. Swirl atomizers used in rocket engines have some basic characteristic than used in other application like gas turbine. Higher flow rate and cryogenic flow condition in rocket engines are the main differences than the other applications. This situation led the designer to use a different design procedure especially on materials and mechanical sides. Nowadays numeric analysis used in computer led to designer to characterize the atomizer rapidly and the modern test facilities are give valuable characterization data to the designer. Swirl atomizers could be named as the simplex atomizer or pressure-swirl atomizer literally. Working principle of swirl atomizer is quite simple; however, hydrodynamic and aerodynamic flow phenomena of swirl atomizer are highly complex. In swirl atomizer, fluid is entering swirl chamber via the tangential port to increase the swirl velocity component. After entering swirl chamber, fluid is directed in to the conical surface to reach the exit orifice. Highly swirled fluid exits atomizer with the high relative speed to the stationary gas phase into the atomizer environment and this led to fluid to starting the disintegration. In this study, pre-determined performance output of the injector are find out according to giving input parameters via the analytical and empirical equation, and numeric validation. Injector input parameters (propellant mass flow rate and pressure dropt) are used in analytical equations to calculate the internal geometry of injector and spray performance characteristics (mean droplet diameter, spray cone angle and break-up length). Analytical equations are derived according to the inviscid theory and derived by using the Bernolli, mass, energy and angular momentum conservation equations. GAMBIT mesh generator program is used in this study as a part of numeric works to create the mesh in the interior face of injector. Numerical analysis are performed in Fluent and for an injector realistic analysis, numerical solution is solved transiently in two-phase flow. Geometric dimensions, mesh geometry and fluid velocity are directly affecting the convergence criteria, and time steps for injector numerical analysis are found around the microseconds.
