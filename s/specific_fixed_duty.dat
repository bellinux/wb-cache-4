40|$|Abstract. Most of sensor MAC {{protocols}} have a <b>fixed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle, which performs poorly {{under the}} dynamic traffic condition observed in eventdriven sensor {{applications such as}} surveillance, fire detection, and objecttracking system. This paper proposes a traffic-aware MAC protocol which dynamically adjusts the duty cycle adapting to the traffic load. Our adaptive scheme operates on a tree topology, and nodes wake up only for the time measured for successful transmissions. By adjusting the duty cycle, it can prevent packet drops and save energy. The simulation results show that our scheme outperforms a <b>fixed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle scheme [5] and B-MAC [9], hence, it can achieve high packet fidelity and save energy. Key words: adaptive duty cycle, MAC, sensor networks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a {{comparative study of}} the spectral characteristics of four random-switching schemes that apply to the basic pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) dc/dc converters operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). They include randomized pulse position modulation, randomized pulsewidth modulation, and randomized carrier frequency modulation with <b>fixed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle and with <b>fixed</b> <b>duty</b> time, respectively. Mathematical models that characterize the input current and output voltage of the three basic PWM converters operating in DCM are derived. In particular, the effectiveness of spreading the dominant switching harmonics in the input current that normally exist in the standard PWM scheme {{and the introduction of}} low-frequency harmonics in the output voltage with respect to the randomness level are investigated. The validity of the models and analyses are confirmed experimentally by using a dc/dc buck converter. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|More panels {{electroformed}} with intentional {{variations of}} pulse plating parameters are being made. Pulse plating frequency was noted {{to have a}} significant effect regarding mechanical properties. The use of a high pulse frequency (assuming <b>fixed</b> <b>duty</b> cycles) results in an increase in ductility and a decrease in ultimate and yield strengths. Electroforming to intermediate frequencies is being done to obtain the best possible combination of ductility and strength. Results of some tests from high frequency specimens are tabulated...|$|R

The example consisting of DC transformers in a distributed generation system based on DC grid is shown. Finally, simulation results verify the feasibility...|$|R
