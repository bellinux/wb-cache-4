2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Abraham thus {{established}} his {{title to the}} land through purchase, and he buried Sarah in the cave. Abraham was old, and instructed his <b>senior</b> <b>servant</b> to put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swear by God {{that he would not}} take a wife for Isaac from the Canaanites, but would go to the land of Abraham's birth to get Isaac a wife. The servant asked if the woman did not consent to follow him to Canaan, should he take Isaac back to the land from which Abraham came? Abraham told him on no account to take Isaac back there, for God — who took Abraham from there and promised Abraham the land of Canaan for his offspring — would send an angel before the servant and allow him successfully to get a wife for Isaac from there, and if the woman did not consent to follow him, he would then be clear of his oath. So the servant put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swore to him as Abraham had asked. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with my life because of the Hittite women.
