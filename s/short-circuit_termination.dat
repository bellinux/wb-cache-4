40|$|Abstract—We {{have applied}} the phase unwrapping {{technique}} {{to resolve the}} phase ambiguity problem arising from complex expressions of scattering parameters, for reflection-only measurement configurations, since, at some instances, only {{one side of the}} sample under test is accessible for electromagnetic measurements. We considered two different measurement configurations for testing the applicability of the phase unwrapping technique as: 1) two identical samples with different lengths flushed by a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>termination</b> and 2) one sample shorted by a varying <b>short-circuit</b> <b>termination.</b> For each measurement configuration, the underlying expressions for the reflection scattering parameters are derived. For both cases, we evaluated the suitability of the phase unwrapping technique by considering a highly-dispersive medium (distilled water) as our test sample. We note that continuity of the real part of the complex wavelength is a key issue in the unwrapping technique for (one-port) reflection-only measurements. 1...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{efficient}} This article {{explains the}} operation of the design procedure for power amplifier implementing a practical can generally be obtained output network for Class-F by applying bi-harmonic and inverse Class-F or polyharmonic modes, power amplifiers when an additional single-resonant or multi-resonant circuit tuned to the odd or even harmonics of the fundamental frequency is added into the load network. An infinite number of odd-harmonic resonators results in an idealized Class F mode with a square voltage waveform and a half-sinusoidal current waveform at the device output terminal, while an infinite number of even-harmonic resonators results in an idealized inverse Class F mode with a half-sinusoidal voltage waveform and a square current waveform at the device output terminal [1, 2]. In conventional Class F or inverse Class F power amplifiers analyzed in frequency domain, the fundamental and harmonic load-network impedances are optimized by <b>short-circuit</b> <b>termination</b> and open-circuit peaking to control the voltage and current waveforms at the device output to obtain maximum efficiency. They are equal respectively to Z net (ω) = R...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the research activities {{that have been}} investigated for improving the 3 rd order intermodulation distortion products (IM 3) and power added efficiency (PAE) and bandwidth performance of microwave GaAs MESFET power amplifiers. Two novel circuit techniques, one for improving the 3 dB bandwidth performance {{and the other for}} improving the IM 3 and PAE performance, were proposed and verified through simulation and practical measurements. The technique of including lumped elements matching networks within the package encapsulation (Close-to-Chip lumped element matching) of a 2 GHz MESFET device is described for the first time. Simulation results showed that the amplifier using this technique had a 3 dB bandwidth 3 times wider than the amplifier with Off-Chip distributed element matching. The linearity and efficiency performance of a 2 GHz MESFET was improved significantly by presenting a difference frequency shunt <b>short-circuit</b> <b>termination</b> across the drain terminal. A 16 dB reduction in IM 3 and an improvement of 4 % in PAE performance was measured on the bench. Success with this technique was further demonstrated with digitally modulated signals...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented {{on the use}} of <b>short-circuit</b> <b>terminations</b> in two-wire transmission lines employed as probes in standard time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) setups. Experimental permittivity results are given for different configurations and materials, and these data are compared with those achievable using conventional open-type terminations. The possibility of both improving the accuracy and simplifying the procedures of TDR measurements using shorted-end probes is illustrated...|$|R
25|$|The S-parameters {{are members}} of a family of similar parameters, other {{examples}} being: Y-parameters, Z-parameters, H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters. They differ from these, in the sense that S-parameters do not use open or short circuit conditions to characterize a linear electrical network; instead, matched loads are used. These terminations are much easier to use at high signal frequencies than open-circuit and <b>short-circuit</b> <b>terminations.</b> Moreover, the quantities are measured in terms of power.|$|R
40|$|In a {{waveguide}} slot array, it {{is sometimes}} required to introduce bent <b>short-circuit</b> <b>terminations</b> in the feeding network. This significantly affects {{the behavior of the}} coupling slots used in this network, with a very large variation in the coupling coefficient with respect to the standard case. A procedure to accurately evaluate the effect of such bends is presented, thus allowing to include them without any loss in the overall design accuracy. It is based on the method of moments, using a magnetic-field integral equation expressed in terms of the vector potential, which appears to be the most efficient way for waveguide problems. The development is aimed at a very effective implementation, which allows to include it in design tools for waveguide slot arrays without increasing the total computational load, and has been assessed through comparison with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In this paper, {{a unified}} theory for frequency-domain simula-tion and {{sensitivity}} analysis of linear and nonlinear circuits is presented. An elegant derivation expands the harmonic balance technique from non-linear simulation to nonlinear adjoint sensitivity analysis. This provides an efficient {{tool for the}} otherwise expensive but essential gradient calcula-tions in design optimization. The hierarchical approach, widely used for circuit simulation, is generalized to sensitivity analysis and to computing responses in any subnetwork at any level of the hierarchy. Therefore, important aspects of frequency-domain circuit CAD such as simulation and sensitivity analysis, linear and nonlinear circuits, hierarchical and nonhier-archical approaches, voltage and current excitations, or open- and <b>short-circuit</b> <b>terminations</b> are unified in this general framework. Our theory provides a key for the coming generation of microwave CAD software. It {{will take advantage of}} the many existing and mature techniques such as the syntax-oriented hierarchical analysis, optimization, and yield driven design to handle nonlinear as well as linear circuits. Our novel sensitivity analysis approach has been verified by a MESFET mixer example exhibiting a 90 percent saving of CPU time over the prevailing perturbation method. I...|$|R

We measure mode's propagation length, effective index and field distribution and directly evaluate the relative coupling efficiencies for various couplers configurations. We report 26 - and 15 -fold improvements in the coupling efficiency with two serially connected dipole and modified bow-tie antennas, respectively, as {{compared to that of}} the <b>short-circuited</b> waveguide <b>termination...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} basis is {{provided for the}} estimation of the electrotonic length of a membrane cylinder, or the effective electrotonic length of a whole neuron, from electrophysiological experiments. It depends upon the several time constants present in passive decay of membrane potential from an initially nonuniform distribution over the length. In addition to the well known passive membrane time constant, τm = RmCm, observed in the decay of a uniform membrane potential, there exist many smaller time constants that govern rapid equalization of membrane potential over the length. These time constants are present also in the transient response to a current step applied across the membrane at one location, such as the neuron soma. Similar time constants are derived when a lumped soma is coupled {{to one or more}} cylinders representing one or more dendritic trees. Different time constants are derived when a voltage clamp is applied at one location; the effects of both leaky and <b>short-circuited</b> <b>termination</b> are also derived. All of these time constants are demonstrated as consequences of mathematical boundary value problems. These results not only provide a basis for estimating electrotonic length, L = [unk]/λ, but also provide a new basis for estimating the steady-state ratio, ρ, of cylinder input conductance to soma membrane conductance...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{radiation}} losses from high frequency parallel-wire transmission lines was first realized {{as early as}} 1900, {{and has become a}} matter of controversy ever since. Many writers have investigated the problem from a theoretical standpoint, but very little has been done in the way of measuring these losses experimentally. At low frequencies radiation losses are negligible, but they become appreciable at high frequencies thus affecting the design of parallel-wire lines for use in the higher portion of the frequency spectrum. In order that the controversy may be wholly or at least partially settled, and to correct existing data, this treatise has therefore been prepared. This paper describes the measurement of radiation resistance from resonant parallel-wire lines in the frequency range 300 Mc/sec. to 1200 Mc/sec. To determine the dependence of radiation losses on line length, lines varying in length from one-quarter wavelength to four wavelengths, with open and <b>short-circuited</b> <b>terminations</b> have been investigated. The results obtained agree with theory in some ways whereas they disagree in others. Radiation losses are similar in some respects to ohmic losses and as such are undesirable in many engineering applications. Methods of decreasing these losses have been devised, and the amount by which these methods remedy the losses is determined. If it ever becomes necessary to increase the radiation losses, the methods by which this may be attained also are investigated. [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|All of the {{components}} of a coaxial system should have the same impedance to avoid internal reflections at connections between components. Such reflections may cause signal attenuation and ghosting TV picture display; multiple reflections may cause the original signal to be followed by more than one echo. In analog video or TV systems, this causes ghosting in the image. Reflections also introduce standing waves, which cause increased losses and can even result in cable dielectric breakdown with high-power transmission (see Impedance matching). Briefly, if a coaxial cable is open, the termination has nearly infinite resistance, this causes reflections; if the coaxial cable is <b>short-circuited,</b> the <b>termination</b> resistance is nearly zero, there will be reflections with the opposite polarity. Reflection will be nearly eliminated if the coaxial cable is terminated in a pure resistance equal to its impedance.|$|R
