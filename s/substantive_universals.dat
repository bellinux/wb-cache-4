40|$|The {{object of}} this article is to explain, that Transformational Grammars take Linguistic Universals as Grammar Universals. From the point of view of this hypothesis, a {{discourse}} identification with its object is implied, and it shows one of the common characteristics of the empirical conception of knowledge, which operates by means of extraction, abstraction and practice techniques, in order to make a distinction between formal and <b>substantive</b> <b>universals.</b> The transformational cycle as a project is devised according to this empirical conception and, consequently, the transformational order does not occur in the reality of language. The Rule of Tree-Pruning bears no connection with reality, since the meta-rule that eliminates those sentences which have not undergone pruning is a mere artefact of Grammar, and not a reflection of the actual organization of language in the human brain. Finally, the Universalist Unitarian Hyphotesis considers as a priori forms both formal and <b>substantive</b> <b>universals,</b> the first being syntactic and the second semantic, the two of them coming from the same source: the Idea. But such forms are not available in language...|$|E
40|$|We propose <b>substantive</b> <b>universals</b> in the {{relationship}} between social evolution and language change. Social anthropologists have categorized societies into roughly four broad types by social organization: bands, tribes, chiefdoms and states. This classification is evolutionary {{in the sense that the}} society types arose in human history in the sequence given above. We compare these society types to a broad classification of types of language change: divergence and several types of interference (borrowing, convergence, and contact languages—lingua francas, pidgins, creoles and stable mixed languages). Divergence results from social fission and communicative isolation; it is found in all society types, though less so with states. Interference is a result of the three main loci of societal contact: marriage, trade and political integration. Extralinguistic exogamy can occasionally lead to significant borrowing. Trade involves different types of multilingualism depending on the society type; lingua francas and trade pidgins are associated with state societies and a few chiefdoms involved in long-distance riverine/marine trade. Intensive borrowing and stable mixed languages occur with incorporation into a state society in situ, and creoles with state-driven migration (including slavery); there may be examples in chiefdoms, where incorporation sometimes occurs. Thus, certain types of language change are a recent phenomenon in human history and the uniformitarian hypothesis for language change must be abandoned, at least for contact-induced change. The implications of comparing society types with respect to linguistic processes are explored for language history and language endangerment. 1 1. Introduction: language an...|$|E
40|$|The CC-Theory is, if correct, an {{attractive}} theory: Almost all of (3 b) is explained {{from a very}} small evolutionary change. The character of the evolutionary change is biologically and evolutionary plausible. Also Chomsky needs a second evolutionary event to account for externalization. The CC-Theory makes a specific proposal for this, with a far wider scope than just externalization. GM is evolutionary young, but since it is modeled after C-I, which is evolutionary much older, GM gets a rich evolutionary history 'for free'. It provides a basis and a rationale for <b>substantive</b> <b>universals</b> involving formal grammatical categories. It offers possibilities to merge insights from Cognitive Grammar ([Langacker 1999]) with grammar frameworks that assume autonomy of syntax. It is falsifiable since it describes the components involved in language in the human mind/brain. Our direct ancestor can be approximated by investigating contemporary primates. Evidence {{can be obtained from}} linguistics, cognitive science, psycholinguistics, biology/ neurophysiology /neuro-imaging of the human brain itself and as compared to animal brains, etc. etc. If it can be established for a significant set of grammatical categories, it might lead to new opportunities for investigating the C-I component via the G-M component. However, research on it is not easy: (a) It attempts to explain properties of GM (of which we think we know something) on the basis of properties of C-I (of which we know that we know hardly anything). (b) What we know of C-I often comes through language (so there is a danger of circularity here). (c) It is essential to obtain evidence on C-I that is independent of language i. by showing that it plays a role in nonlinguistic beings such as primates or other animals, or ii. in prelinguistic beings such as very young children, or iii. at the very least that there is evidence for a conceptual category independent of the correlating grammatical category (e. g in a language that does not distinguish the relevant grammatical category) ...|$|E

40|$|Military service places demands upon serving members unparalleled in {{civilian}} life. Serving in the Canadian Forces (CF) is no different. The sacrifice required {{to wear a}} CF uniform extends far beyond the commonly understood injuries and fatalities of military combat, peacekeeping and routine training accidents. Like all militaries, the CF employs complex cultural, psychological and socialization processes that molds and reconditions civilians into highly disciplined and moralized individuals willing to enter harm’s way and kill or be killed. Although these complex processes may be beneficial to military objectives, they can be highly detrimental to successful reintegration into civilian society. Yet Canada has never articulated a tangible universal obligation to assist CF veterans in overcoming or compensating for the consequences of military service. Do we have a universal obligation to our CF veterans? Why? What would be {{the nature of a}} universal obligation to our CF veterans? This thesis seeks to answer these questions. Contrary to popular perception, military life is a moral life. Such morality is the bitter enemy of duplicitous rhetoric and government inaction. These deeply indoctrinated moral values are also the measuring stick for the highly unequal sacrifice that CF members have endured on behalf of Canada and Canadians and the complete absence of any obligation we have reciprocated for their service. For these reasons and more, as a nation and as individuals, we have a <b>substantive</b> <b>universal</b> obligation to all our CF veterans to comprehensively assist them in making their life out of uniform at least as successful and rewarding as it was in military service...|$|R
40|$|In his {{influential}} monograph {{on child}} language, aphasia, and phonological universals, Jakobson (1941 / 1968) made several claims {{that continue to}} shape how we think about acquisition today. The most general claim was that there are <b>universal</b> <b>substantive</b> principles that structure the phoneme inventories of all spoken languages, and that these principles also determine how children acquire speech. More specifically, Jakobson assumed {{that there is a}} clear discontinuity between the rich set of consonant- and vowel-like sounds that children produce randomly in their preverbal babbling and the initially impoverished but reliable inventory of phonemes that they produce in their first words. Moreover, the consonants and vowels that are first to be mastered are the same for all children everywhere, and each child expands this initial inventory in a rigid universal order. Both of the more specific claims are wrong. Arguing against a constant order of acquisition is mounting evidence of variability. For example, Ingram (1999) summarizes studies of five or more children acquiring each of English, Quiché, Turkish, and Dutch to show that “typical ” consonant inventories at 20 - 27 months differ for these four differen...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the character of kinds in human somatic pathology and the relation that these kinds and their members have with function-based explanations. More precisely, {{in the first part of}} the thesis I investigate whether diseased organisms, grouped together on grounds of their shared pathological features, could form natural kinds, taking into account that the paradigmatic natural kinds are the kinds of the exact sciences. The second part of the thesis has as a backdrop the Humean/anti-Humean debate over causation (and the specific construal of explanations according to which to explain is to pinpoint causes). In this backdrop, I enquire into what sort of function-based explanations we could provide for the symptoms and pathological behaviours exhibited by diseased organisms, if we construe such organisms as members of natural kinds. I argue in the first part of the thesis that from a metaphysical point of view, the organisms dealt with in somatic medicine form natural kinds in the same sense in which we take the kinds dealt with in the exact sciences as natural. By comparing a 'classical', exact science kind with a kind of disease, I show that whatever features are associated with natural kind membership (e. g, involvement in laws or inductions, explanatory relevance, possession of 'essential' properties, instantiation of <b>substantive</b> <b>universals,</b> etc.) there is no 'ontological gap' between disease kinds and the kinds in the exact sciences. The conclusion that diseases are natural kinds has a certain proviso regarding the question of whether the identity of the individual members of natural kinds is dependent upon their kind membership. Should diseases not be natural kinds, the proviso says, it would be because the properties characteristic of natural kinds must have an identity-influence over the kind members. I present in addition serious problems posed by outlining such identity bearing properties. In the second part of the thesis, I argue that function based explanations concerned with diseased organisms - if we construe such organisms as being members of natural kinds - should illuminate positive causes for the symptoms and pathological behaviours they exhibit. We could obtain such function-based explanations, I suggest, if we interpret the functioning of biological items as the manifesting of causal powers. Against the background of the Humean vs. anti-Humean debate on causation, I show that Nancy Cartwright's capacities are a plausible variant for the powers at work in 'pathological' functioning. I argue that one could track down these capacities if one viewed healthy organisms as nomological machines, in the sense in which Cartwright understands this notion. I also suggest that capacities are necessary in order to vindicate general and, more importantly, singular causal claims involved in medical diagnosis and hence to found satisfactory functional explanations.

40|$|Substantive interoperability, {{technical}} interoperability, ontology, net-centricity ABSTRACT: <b>Universal</b> <b>substantive</b> interoperability among {{an arbitrary}} collection of heterogeneous live, virtual, constructive (LVC) systems for an arbitrary purpose is not attainable. The Open Netcentric Interoperability Standards for Training and Testing (ONISTT) project has applied and extended the Department of Defense Netcentric Data Strategy and semantic web concepts {{to the more}} limited but attainable objective of “purpose-aware ” interoperability. The core of the ONISTT approach for purpose-aware interoperability comprises (1) a formal description of exercise needs and confederation resources, captured in domain-specific ontologies expressed via the Web Ontology Language; and (2) an Analyzer written in XSB Prolog that applies general logical reasoning and domain-specific rules {{to determine whether a}} candidate confederation can satisfy the requirements of a proposed exercise. In the ONISTT knowledge capture phase, knowledge bases (KBs) are constructed by populating the ontologies with instance data. In the Analyzer employment phase, an exercise planner identifies the specific exercise tasks and primary training audience, and may assign specific resources (both operational and LVC systems) to roles derived from the exercise tasks. For each required interaction between two roles, the Analyzer assesses whether the capabilities provided by the assigned resources are likely to provide a satisfactory level of substantive interoperability. The Analyzer also discovers and ranks potential resources for unassigned roles. The exercise planner may adjust assignments in response t...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Participant self-report data play an {{essential}} role in the evaluation of health education activities, programmes and policies. When questionnaire items do not have a clear mapping to a performance-based continuum, percentile norms are useful for communicating individual test results to users. Similarly, when assessing programme impact, the comparison of effect sizes for group differences or baseline to follow-up change with effect sizes observed in relevant normative data provides more directly useful information compared with statistical tests of mean differences and the evaluation of effect sizes for <b>substantive</b> significance using <b>universal</b> rule-of-thumb such as those for Cohen’s ‘d’. This article aims to assist managers, programme staff and clinicians of healthcare organisations who use the Health Education Impact Questionnaire interpret their results using percentile norms for individual baseline and follow-up scores together with group effect sizes for change across the duration of typical chronic disease self-management and support programme. Methods: Percentile norms for individual Health Education Impact Questionnaire scale scores and effect sizes for group change were calculated using freely available software for each of the eight Health Education Impact Questionnaire scales. Data used were archived responses of 2157 participants of chronic disease self-management programmes conducted by a wide range of organisations in Australia between July 2007 and March 2013. Results: Tables of percentile norms and three possible effect size benchmarks for baseline to follow-up change are provided together with two worked examples to assist interpretation. Conclusion: While the norms and benchmarks presented will be particularly relevant for Australian organisations and others using the English-language version of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire, they will also be useful for translated versions as a guide to the sensitivity of the scales and the extent of the changes that might be anticipated from attendance at a typical chronic disease self-management or health education programme...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{construct}} a conceptual framework for characterising the relationship between duties to refugees and duties to fellow nationals. The need for such a framework is generated by the current impasse on the policy debate {{about the nature and}} scope of refugee rights. The thesis examines a range of liberal political theories {{to see if they can}} provide an adequate account, evaluating them on three criteria: normative desirability; practical feasibility; and internal coherence. The discussion criticises liberal theories on two levels. Firstly, it shows how liberal universalist theories raise a problem of moral motivation: they impose overly stringent ethical demands, and risk being counter-productive. Attempts to incorporate some notion of the significance of national ties or to justify a national social contract simply produce an incoherent amalgam of universalist and particularist premises. Secondly, the thesis argues that these problems reflect a more profound weakness in liberal theories of moral agency and motivation. Liberal theory relies on an assumed dichotomy between a personal and an impartial perspective. The moral agent is assumed to abstract from her personal characteristics to adopt an "ethical" view-point. This notion of impartiality is descriptively implausible, and produces a highly problematic rationalist theory of motivation. The thesis argues instead for an account that sees the agent as motivated by her personal disposition and community values to respect refugee rights. On this account there is no necessary conflict between particularism and duties to non-nationals. I develop this non-rationalist account by providing (1) a philosophical theory of motivation; substantiated by (2) a theory of the psychology of moral development. The thesis shows how this non-rationalist account is consistent with a <b>substantive</b> commitment to <b>universal</b> duties. Moreover, it fulfils the two additional criteria of internal coherence and feasibility, thus providing a superior conception of the relationship between duties to compatriots and to refugees...|$|R
