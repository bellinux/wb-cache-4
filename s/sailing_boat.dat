5|$|The main {{cargo carried}} was coal. In 1788, {{a group of}} {{shareholders}} set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the Forest of Dean. This profitable business continued until 1833. Boats that worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> which was fitted with ketch, cutter or sloop rigging. Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts, but none {{are known to have}} survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.|$|E

25|$|There {{has always}} been a need for small tender boats for {{transporting}} goods and personnel to and from anchored sailing ships. Together with other smaller work craft such as fishing and light cargo, small inshore craft have always been in evidence. Charles II of England had a private <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> presented to him when he returned from exile to England in the 17th century, and he sailed for recreation and competition.|$|E
25|$|Later that century, the American Nathanael Herreshoff {{constructed}} a double-hulled <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> {{of his own}} design (US Pat. No. 189,459). The craft, Amaryllis, raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876, and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded to catamarans over the standard monohulls. It was {{as a result of}} this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The nobby is an inshore <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> {{which was}} used as a {{traditional}} fishing boat around Lancashire and the Isle of Man. The Lancashire nobby originated in Morecambe Bay about 1840 and around Southport. It subsequently came into widespread use down the north west coast of England. The Manx nobby first appeared in the 1880s and was used around the Isle of Man. Many localities on the coast of Great Britain developed their own type of fishing boat adapted to local fishing and sea conditions, and the nobbies are examples of this.|$|E

The obverse depicts a combination of Tove Jansson portrait with several objects: the skyline, an artist's palette, a crescent and a <b>sailing</b> <b>boat.</b> The reverse design features three Moomin characters. In 2014 she was again featured on a commemorative coin, minted at €10 and €20 values, being the only person other than the former Finnish president Urho Kekkonen to be granted two such coins. She was also featured on a €2 commemorative coin that entered general circulation in June 2014.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 {{while he}} was living in Glendalough, he bought a Dublin Bay Water Wag, a 13-foot type of <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> usually sailed in Dun Laoghaire, pear-shaped with a single gaff-rigged sail. He sailed this boat on Lough Dan, close to Glendalough, and he and his brother Henry used to take friends for a sail in the Water Wag. Bigger and better boats followed: by 1895 he was taking the half-deck Marguerite across the Channel and in 1897 there was a long cruise to the Frisian Islands, Norderney and the Baltic with Henry in the thirty-foot cutter Vixen: a voyage he {{repeated}} in the following spring.|$|E

25|$|A Bristol Channel pilot cutter is a {{specialised}} <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> {{the style}} and design of which {{is derived from the}} single-masted cutter. Based upon bulkier, less nimble, fishing boats but modified for use in the strong tides, winds, currents and coastline of the Bristol Channel its purpose was to quickly ferry local maritime pilots to and from large ships to assist in safe navigation into or out of any of the port cities in the Channel. The speed and manoeuvrability of the cutters allowed a minimal crew, in almost any weather, to quickly arrive at and easily lie alongside larger ships for easy and safe transfer of pilots. The craft was also equipped to stay 'on station' for days or even weeks, awaiting arrivals just outside the channel.|$|E
25|$|In July 2004 Kennedy {{collided}} with a dhow in the Persian Gulf, leaving no survivors on the traditional Arab <b>sailing</b> <b>boat.</b> After the incident the Navy relieved the commanding officer of Kennedy. The carrier itself was unscathed, but two jet fighters on the deck were damaged when an F-14B Tomcat assigned to VF-103 slid into an F/A-18C Hornet assigned to VFA-81 damaging the wing of the F-14 {{as well as the}} upper section of the radome and forward windscreen of the F/A-18 as the ship made a hard turn to avoid the tiny vessel. A popular misconception is that the Kennedy captain waited to make the turn at the last possible moment to recover aircraft critically low on fuel returning from airstrikes. The official review board determined {{this was not the case}} and the aircraft could have remained safely aloft until Kennedy maneuvered to avoid the dhow.|$|E
25|$|Merten {{was posted}} {{to the light}} cruiser Karlsruhe (21 September 1935– 7 March 1937), serving as the 2nd {{artillery}} officer and watch officer. On 1 April 1936, Merten was promoted to Kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) and on 2 October 1936 received the Wehrmacht Long Service Award 4th Class, which had been created on 16 March 1936, for four years of military service. In back-to-back assignments, he was briefly transferred to the light cruiser Leipzig (8 March– 20 May 1937), serving as the anti-aircraft artillery officer, and then again on Karlsruhe (21 May– 11 June 1937). On Karlsruhe and Leipzig he participated in the Kriegsmarines non-intervention patrols of the Spanish Civil War. For this service he received the Spanish Cross in Bronze on 20 April 1938. Merten led a Star <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> training course (21 July– 29 September 1937) and was then given command of the escort ship F-7 (30 September 1937– 12 February 1939).|$|E

500|$|On 22 February, it was OUBC's turn to {{race against}} Oxford Brookes, in two {{segments}} over the Championship Course. [...] After an even {{start to the}} first contest, the Dark Blues held a slight advantage heading into the first bend. Oxford Brookes recovered, and were two-thirds of a length ahead as the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge. [...] OUBC took advantage of a caught blade to move back into contention but the race was ended prematurely as a <b>sailing</b> <b>boat</b> intervened on the course. [...] The Dark Blues took an early lead in the second race, but despite being a length up, failed to take a clear water advantage. [...] Oxford Brookes drew back and by Barnes Bridge held a small lead, one which they capitalised on in the rough water to finally pass the Finish Post two lengths clear of OUBC.|$|E
500|$|The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams {{the chance}} to enjoy their [...] "perfect plaything for the summer", a new <b>sailing</b> <b>boat.</b> The boat had been {{designed}} by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny, an admirer of Byron's who had joined the party in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, Edward Ellerker Williams, and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno. There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal. On 8 July, he and Edward Williams {{set out on the}} return journey to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never reached their destination. A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, [...] "pray write to tell us how you got home, for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday & we are anxious". [...] "The paper fell from me," [...] Mary told a friend later. [...] "I trembled all over." [...] She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive. Ten days after the storm, three bodies washed up on the coast near Viareggio, midway between Livorno and Lerici. Trelawny, Byron, and Hunt cremated Percy Shelley’s corpse on the beach at Viareggio.|$|E
