5|$|Margot Robbie {{auditioned for}} the role of Donna in 2008. The actress {{believed}} that she had performed badly in the audition and decided to leave for a five-week snowboarding holiday in Canada. Robbie had been in Canada for two days when she received a phone call telling her that she had been successful and that she had to return to Australia. Robbie began appearing on-screen in June of that year. Donna was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> guest character role, but Robbie was promoted to regular cast member shortly after her debut.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Psaltis was {{informed}} that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) employee Buh Buh Ray Dudley was interested in bringing her into ECW. At the behest of Dudley, Psaltis traveled to the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where ECW promoter Paul Heyman {{told her that he}} would book her for several appearances in an angle with Lance Storm. She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998 as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Psaltis and Storm and offered her a contract, which she accepted. Psaltis created her character to be in love with Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous.|$|E

5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E

25|$|Burgher arms used to {{be common}} in France, but they {{disappeared}} in the French Revolution, which was hostile to heraldry. In {{the end of the}} 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in Armorial général as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients. In France burgher arms are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> helmet.|$|E
25|$|The {{floating}} {{power stations}} {{need to be}} refueled every three years while saving up to 200,000metric tons of coal and 100,000tons of fuel oil a year.

25|$|Consider a {{heat engine}} working between two {{temperatures}} TH and Ta. With Ta we have ambient temperature in mind, but, in principle {{it may also}} be some other low temperature. The heat engine is in thermal contact with two heat reservoirs which are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very large heat capacity so that their temperatures do not change significantly if heat QH is removed from the hot reservoir and Qa is added to the lower reservoir. Under normal operation TH > Ta and QH, Qa, and W are all positive.|$|E

25|$|In The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln posit the {{existence}} of a secret society known as the Priory of Sion, which is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long history starting in 1099 and had illustrious Grand Masters including Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton. According to the authors' claims, the Priory of Sion is devoted to installing the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Franks from 457 to 751, on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. It is also said to have created the Knights Templar as its military arm and financial branch.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} season, 30 contestants were {{separated}} {{in groups of}} 10 and every week three contestants from each group were chosen to the Top 10 or The Spectacular Show. Audiences vote their favorites by SMS and Premium Calls. After 9 contestants were chosen, there was a wild card round. Only one contestant from the Wild Card round could join the 9 contestants at the Spectacular Show. Karen Theresia Pooroe won the most audience votes, advancing to the Top 10.

25|$|There are {{proposals}} to construct monorails in Penang, Johor Bahru, and Malacca but opposition has been vociferously expressed by Penang and Malacca residents {{concerned about the}} system being {{out of place in}} the historic downtown areas.

The federal administrative centre of Putrajaya was also <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> monorail network and the main station and several metres of track have been built. However, the project has been postponed because of costs and the Malaysian government felt {{that it was not a}} priority project for the time being even though good public transportation would attract many Malaysians to re-locate to this new underpopulated city.|$|E
25|$|Bruckner's symphonies are scored for {{a fairly}} {{standard}} orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, {{two or three}} trumpets, three trombones, tuba (from the second version of the Fourth), timpani and strings. The later symphonies increase this complement, but not by much. Notable {{is the use of}} Wagner tubas in his last three symphonies. Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the Seventh is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cymbal crash at the exact moment Wagner died). Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the pipe organ, i.e., alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.|$|E
25|$|The {{behavior}} and appearance of UDS and its bright companion {{were similar to}} Neptunian Great Dark Spots (GDS) and their bright companions, respectively, though UDS was significantly smaller. This similarity suggests {{that they have the}} same origin. GDS were hypothesized to be anticyclonic vortices in the atmosphere of Neptune, whereas their bright companions were thought to be methane clouds formed in places, where the air is rising (orographic clouds). UDS is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similar nature, although it looked differently from GDS at some wavelengths. Although GDS had the highest contrast at 0.47μm, UDS was not visible at this wavelength. On the other hand, UDS demonstrated the highest contrast at 1.6μm, where GDS were not detected. This implies that dark spots on the two ice giants are located at somewhat different pressure levels—the Uranian feature probably lies near 4bar. The dark color of UDS (as well as GDS) may be caused by thinning of the underlying hydrogen sulfide or ammonium hydrosulfide clouds.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s the Italian {{colonial power}} in Eritrea started the first {{attempts}} {{to found a}} separate Eritrean Orthodox Church. Until then the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was practically part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with a strong link to Aksum in Tigray as the traditional centre of the Church structure. This was, however, against {{the interest of the}} colonizer: Eritrea as a separate colony was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> church independent from the neighbor's influence, in order to be fully integrated into the colonial system. The separate Eritrean Church was short-lived. When it was still not fully established, the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and then formed a unified territory, Africa Orientale Italiana, encompassing Eritrea, Ethiopia and Italian Somalia. Eritrea was unified with the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray, and both Orthodox Churches unified. This unification remained valid even after the defeat of the Italians and their loss of the whole territory in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Rats, {{like most}} mammals, also form family groups {{of a mother}} and her young. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are {{territorial}} animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming; and nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck.|$|E
25|$|In 468, Leo {{organized}} a grand {{campaign against the}} Vandals in Africa in which the East and West would commit substantial forces. Marcellinus was given command of the forces from the western empire and the campaign {{was to be a}} three-pronged assault. Marcellinus by this time had expelled the Vandals from Sicily and had also retaken Sardinia and was to be taken by fleet to Africa. Basiliscus, Leo's brother-in-law, with the main army in an armada of over 1,000 ships would land at a distance from Carthage and link up with the comes rei militis Heraclius advancing from Egypt and Tripolitana. Marcellinus was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> command of some 10,000 to 20,000 troops. Marcellinus never sailed for Africa, perhaps due to Ricimer's veto; either he would not spare so many troops to become bogged in a campaign in Africa hoping the East would do the job for him, or he resented the military capabilities of Marcellinus who was obviously the favorite of Anthemius. Regardless of the reason, Marcellinus, not able to participate in the campaign and Basiliscus blundering in the Battle of Cape Bon, assured that the operation would result in failure and the West lost its only chance to regain Africa from the Vandals and possibly stave off its demise.|$|E
