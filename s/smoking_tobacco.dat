Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in <b>smoking</b> <b>tobacco,</b> gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. <b>Smoking</b> <b>tobacco</b> products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in <b>smoking</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E
40|$|Introuduction: <b>Tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> is {{considered}} to be the key preventable risk factor for morbidity and mortality at the global level. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> and factors associated with the initiation of smoking among university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with 264 students of Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2015. A standard, self-administered questionnaire consisting of questions on socio-demographic variables, <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> status, family and peer <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> history, attitudes and beliefs about <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking,</b> as well as knowledge about the negative health consequences of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> was administered to participants. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models, chi square, and Fisher exact tests. Results: The overall prevalence of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> was 60. 2 %, where males smoked at higher rates than females (68. 81 % and 19. 56 %, respectively). The influence of friends was the most significant reason for initiating <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> (OR: 0. 862; CI: 0. 810 - 0. 917). Perception regarding <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> was significantly related to continuing tobacco use. Logistic regression models identified that smoking-related attitudes, potential health problems, and family members dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer were significantly associated with <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking.</b> Conclusion: The current <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> prevalence among university students in Bangladesh is over 60 %. We suggest adopting WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) policies, especially for university students...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{authenticity}} and true status of tobacco use, {{especially in the}} form of smoking among the patient clientele is always a matter of concern for their physicians. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the authenticity of self-reported habit of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> among a population sample of male respondents in rural India. Methods: Respondents were asked to complete oral questionnaires that assessed their status of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> (if any) as well as duration of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking,</b> type of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking,</b> and frequency of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking.</b> Subsequently, exhaled breath carbon monoxide analysis was performed to detect their amounts of exhaled carbon monoxide. Results: In 175 respondents, the Smoke Check color indicators were significantly different (P < 0. 0001) in the respondents who were diagnosed smokers per oral questionnaires (n = 92) versus diagnosed nonsmokers per oral questionnaires (n = 83). The probability statistics of authenticity of oral questionnaires for assessing smoking status showed that self-reporting was only 75 % sensitive and 76 % specific with 80 % positive predictive value and 70 % negative predictive value. Conclusion: True status of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> with exhaled breath carbon monoxide analysis can be an easy clinical maneuver with community health screening and health promotion implications among patient populations in rural India...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Using a {{water pipe}} to smoke tobacco is {{increasing}} in prevalence among US college students, {{and it may}} also be common among younger adolescents. The purpose of this study of Arizona {{middle and high school students}} was to examine the prevalence of water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking,</b> compare water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> with other forms of tobacco use, and determine associations between sociodemo- graphic variables and water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> in this population. METHODS. We added items assessing water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> to Arizona's 2005 Youth Tobacco Survey and used them to estimate statewide water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> prevalence among various demographic groups by using survey weights. We also used multiple logistic regression to determine which demographic characteristics had independent relationships with each of 2 outcomes: ever use of water pipe to smoke tobacco and water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> in the previous 30 days. RESULTS. Median age of the sample was 14. Accounting for survey weights, among middle school students, 2. 1 % had ever smoked water-pipe tobacco and 1. 4 % had done so within the previous 30 days. Among those in high school, 10. 3 % had ever smoked from a water pipe and 5. 4 % had done so in the previous 30 days, making water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoking</b> more common than use of smokeless tobacco, pipes, bidis, and kreteks (clove cigarettes). In multivariate analyses that controlled for covariates, ever <b>smoking</b> of water-pipe <b>tobacco</b> was associated with older age, Asian race, white race, charter school attendance, and lack of plans to attend college. CONCLUSIONS. Among Arizona youth, water pipe is the third most common source of tobacco after cigarettes and cigars. Increased national surveillance and additional research will be important for addressing this threat to public health. Copyright © 2009 by the American Academy of Pediatrics...|$|R
