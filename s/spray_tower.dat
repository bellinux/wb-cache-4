2500|$|Air {{is pumped}} through the CO2 {{absorber}} {{as the first}} step of this process. [...] CO2 absorber for DAC are designed either as a counter-current <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> or as a counter-current thin-falling-film contractor to maximize the contact area between the air and the solvent and thus maximize the absorption driving force. [...] The solvent is regenerated in the causticization unit by reacting the Na2CO3 with Ca(OH)2, which also transfers the captured CO2 to the form of CaCO3 solid crystals. [...] A mechanical filter is then used to separate the CaCO3 crystals form the water. [...] Since the crystals come out wet from the filter, they are dried in a steam dryer. [...] Then the dry crystals are heated in a furnace to produce CaO and pure CO2 gas. [...] The CaO is then hydrated to regenerate the Ca(OH)2 used for the causticization reaction. [...] The pure CO2 stream is then compressed and ready to be transported for geologic sequestration, EOR, or other commercial applications.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>spray</b> <b>tower,</b> {{absorption}} can {{be increased}} by decreasing {{the size of the}} liquid droplets and/or increasing the liquid-to-gas ratio (L/G). However, to accomplish either of these, an increase in both power consumed and operating cost is required. In addition, the physical size of the <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> will limit the amount of liquid and the size of droplets that can be used.|$|E
50|$|In {{particular}} {{heat and}} mass transfer velocity is higher for equipment with higher values of gas-liquid interface surface area, so gas-liquid contactors with high surface area (e.g. packed column, <b>spray</b> <b>tower)</b> are often preferred {{when it is}} important to lower the cost of the equipment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to a countercurrent-flow configuration, the flow in <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> can be either a cocurrent or [...] in configuration. In cocurrent-flow <b>spray</b> <b>towers,</b> the inlet gas and liquid flow in the same direction. Because the gas stream does not [...] "push" [...] against the liquid sprays, the gas velocities through the vessels are higher than in countercurrent-flow <b>spray</b> <b>towers.</b> Consequently, cocurrent-flow <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> are smaller than countercurrent-flow <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> treating {{the same amount of}} exhaust flow. In crosscurrent-flow <b>spray</b> <b>towers,</b> also called horizontal-spray scrubbers, the gas and liquid flow in directions perpendicular to each other.|$|R
50|$|For example, <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> {{are used}} to remove HCl gas from the tail-gas exhaust in {{manufacturing}} hydrochloric acid. In the production of superphosphate used in manufacturing fertilizer, SiF4 and HF gases are vented from various points in the processes. <b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> {{have been used to}} remove these highly soluble compounds. <b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> are also used for odor removal in bone meal and tallow manufacturing industries by scrubbing the exhaust gases with a solution of KMnO4.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> can be {{used for}} gas absorption, but they are not as {{effective}} as packed or plate <b>towers.</b> <b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> can be very effective in removing pollutants if the pollutants are highly soluble or if a chemical reagent is added to the liquid.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> is the {{simplest}} type of scrubber. It {{consists of a}} tower with spray nozzles, which generate the droplets for surface contact. Spray towers are typically used when circulating a slurry (see below). The high speed of a venturi would cause erosion problems, while a packed tower would plug up if it tried to circulate a slurry.|$|E
5000|$|A {{quenching}} {{system can}} be as simple as spraying liquid into the duct just preceding the main scrubbing vessel, or it can be a separate chamber (or tower) with its own spray system identical to a <b>spray</b> <b>tower.</b> Quenchers are designed using the same principles as scrubbers. Increasing the gas-liquid contact in them increases their operational efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclonic spray {{scrubbers}} {{are more}} efficient than spray towers, but not as efficient as venturi scrubbers, in removing particulate from the inlet gas stream. Particulates larger than 5 µm are generally collected by impaction with 90% efficiency. In a simple <b>spray</b> <b>tower,</b> the velocity of the particulates in the gas stream is low: 0.6 to 1.5 m/s (2 to 5 ft/s).|$|E
5000|$|To promote maximum gas-liquid {{surface area}} and {{residence}} time, {{a number of}} wet scrubber designs have been used, including <b>spray</b> <b>towers,</b> venturis, plate towers, and mobile packed beds. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently {{with respect to the}} liquid. The chief drawback of <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent [...] removal than other absorber designs.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} low gas velocities, <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> must be larger than other scrubbers that handle similar gas stream flow rates. Another problem occurring in <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> is that after the droplets have fallen a short distance, they tend to agglomerate or hit {{the walls of the}} tower. Consequently, the total liquid surface area for contact is reduced, reducing the collection efficiency of the scrubber.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> are {{constructed}} in various sizes - small ones to handle small gas flows of 0.05 m³/s (106 ft³/min) or less, and large ones to handle large exhaust flows of 50 m³/s (106,000 m³/min) or greater. Because {{of the low}} gas velocity required, units handling large gas flow rates tend to be large in size. Operating characteristics of <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> are presented in the following table.|$|R
50|$|Like a <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> {{an ejector}} venturi {{scrubber}} uses a preformed spray. However, in an ejector venturi scrubber {{only a single}} nozzle is used instead of many nozzles. This nozzle operates at higher pressures and higher injection rates than those in most spray chambers. The high-pressure spray nozzle (up to 689 kPa or 100 psig) is aimed at the throat section of a venturi constriction.|$|E
50|$|Limestone slurry is {{sprayed with}} single fluid spray nozzles to control acid gas {{emissions}} especially sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from {{coal-fired power plants}} with liquid scrubbers. Calcium hydroxide (lime) is atomized into a spray dryer absorber to remove acid gases (SO2 and HCl) from coal-fired power plants. Water is sprayed to remove particulate solids using a <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> or a cyclonic spray scrubber Cooling towers use spray nozzles to distribute water.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> (or spray column or spray chamber) is gas-liquid {{contactor}} used {{to achieve}} mass and heat transfer between a continuous gas phase (that can contain dispersed solid particles) and a dispersed liquid phase. It {{consists of an}} empty cylindrical vessel made of steel or plastic, and nozzles that spray liquid into the vessel. The inlet gas stream usually enters {{at the bottom of}} the tower and moves upward, while the liquid is sprayed downward from one or more levels. This flow of inlet gas and liquid in opposite directions is called countercurrent flow.|$|E
5000|$|Spraying {{reagents}} {{to enhance}} dispersion {{and to increase}} liquid-gas mass transfer. Many systems are used, including <b>spray</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stripping {{is mainly}} {{conducted}} in trayed towers (plate columns) and packed columns, and less often in <b>spray</b> <b>towers,</b> bubble columns, and centrifugal contactors.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} ability to handle large gas volumes in {{corrosive}} atmospheres, <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> are also used in a number of flue-gas desulfurization systems as the first or second stage in the pollutant removal process.|$|R
5000|$|Ammonia {{is used in}} its {{anhydrous}} form (i.e., gas form) and the {{nitric acid}} is concentrated. This reaction is violent owing to its highly exothermic nature. After the solution is formed, typically at about 83% concentration, the excess water is evaporated to an ammonium nitrate (AN) content of 95% to 99.9% concentration (AN melt), depending on grade. The AN melt is then made into [...] "prills" [...] or small beads in a <b>spray</b> <b>tower,</b> or into granules by spraying and tumbling in a rotating drum. The prills or granules may be further dried, cooled, and then coated to prevent caking. These prills or granules are the typical AN products in commerce.|$|E
50|$|As {{explained}} above, alkaline sorbents {{are used}} for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO2. Depending on the application, {{the two most important}} are lime and sodium hydroxide (also known as caustic soda). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda. The problem is that it results in a slurry being circulated through the scrubber instead of a solution. This makes it harder on the equipment. A <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> is typically used for this application. The use of lime results in a slurry of calcium sulfite (CaSO3) that must be disposed of. Fortunately, calcium sulfite can be oxidized to produce by-product gypsum (CaSO4 · 2H2O) which is marketable for use in the building products industry.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> are {{inexpensive}} {{control devices}} primarily used for gas conditioning (cooling or humidifying) or for first-stage particle or gas removal. They {{are also used}} in many flue-gas desulfurization systems to reduce plugging and scale buildup by pollutants.|$|R
50|$|These {{devices are}} used {{much the same}} as <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> - to preclean or remove {{particles}} larger than 10 μm in diameter. However, they will tend to plug or corrode if particle concentration of the exhaust gas stream is high.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> {{have been}} used {{effectively}} to remove large particles and highly soluble gases. The pressure drop across the towers is very low - usually less than 2.5 cm (1.0 in) of water; thus, scrubber operating costs are relatively low.

40|$|AbstractA {{computer}} model characterizing {{the performance of}} a <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> oxygen absorption system was developed based on finite difference mass transfer calculations.

40|$|The micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT) {{has proven}} to have the highest {{potential}} of all mixed air/water micro Gas Turbines (mGTs). Turning a mGT into a mHAT however requires the installation of a saturation tower. Most common saturation towers use packing material to increase the contact area between compressed air and water. The packing material however causes a pressure drop, which has a severe {{negative effect on the}} mGT performance. To limit this pressure drop, we have developed a <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> without packing that uses nozzles to inject water in the compressed air. In this paper, we propose a design for the <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> based on 2 -phase flow simulations. The two major constraints during the design were minimal pressure loss and tower size. A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to indicate the key parameters to obtain fully saturated air from the tower. Results of simulations showed that using a <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> reduces the pressure losses when compared to a classic saturation tower. Sensitivity analysis showed that droplet diameter and injected water mass flow rate have the largest effect on the final size of the <b>spray</b> <b>tower.</b> Finally, a cross-current <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> design was proposed for a Turbec T 100 mGT because the sensitivity analysis showed that cross-current droplets injection meets the design constraints best. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
5000|$|Baffle spray {{scrubbers}} are {{a technology}} for air pollution control. They {{are very similar}} to <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> in design and operation. However, in addition to using the energy provided by the spray nozzles, baffles are added to allow the gas stream to atomize some liquid as it passes over them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>towers</b> are {{low energy}} scrubbers. Contacting power {{is much lower}} than in venturi scrubbers, and the {{pressure}} drops across such systems are generally less than 2.5 cm (1 in) of water. The collection efficiency for small particles is correspondingly lower than in more energy-intensive devices. They are adequate for the collection of coarse particles larger than 10-25 µm in diameter, although with increased liquid inlet nozzle pressures, particles with diameters of 2.0 µm can be collected.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> over other scrubbers is their completely open design; {{they have no}} internal parts except for the spray nozzles. This feature eliminates many of the scale buildup and plugging problems associated with other scrubbers. The primary maintenance problems are spray-nozzle plugging or eroding, especially when using recycled scrubber liquid. To reduce these problems, a settling or filtration system is used to remove abrasive particles from the recycled scrubbing liquid before pumping {{it back into the}} nozzles.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} strain {{selection}} {{is an important}} step in the development of insect pathogens for biological control. Bioassays were conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the efficacy of different methods of inoculation using Rhipicephalus pulchellus Gersta¨cker (Acari: Ixodidae) as a model. Initially, an oil-based formulation of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorok. (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) titred at 109 conidia ml- 1 was applied to R. pulchellus adults using a Burgerjon <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> or a microapplicator. Inoculation by microapplicator yielded poor results (25. 0 % tick mortality) compared to Burgerjon’s <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> (52. 3 % tick mortality), although the mean number of fungal conidia on R. pulchellus adults was lower (1. 5 9 104 ± 1. 1 9 103 conidia ml- 1) after spraying by Burgerjon’s <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> compared to 1 9 106 conidia ml- 1 obtained with the microapplicator. Thus, inoculation by Burgerjon’s <b>spray</b> <b>tower</b> was selected for further investigations. Different modes of inoculation were tested and included direct spray of inoculum on the tick and substrate (SS), direct spray on the substrate and tick followed by transfer of the tick to clean uncontaminated Petri dish (SP) or indirect inoculation of ticks through substrate (SW). The LC 50 values following contamination of nymphs (LC 50 = 1. 4 9 107 conidia ml- 1) and adults (LC 50 = 6. 7 9 107 conidia ml- 1) in SS were significantly lower compared to SP; nymphs (LC 50 = 5. 7 9 108 conidia ml- 1) and adults (LC 50 = 5. 3 9 109 conidia ml- 1) and SW; nymphs (LC 50 = 5 9 108 conidia ml- 1). Although the LC 50 value in SS was the lowest, it recorded the highest tick mortality among control ticks (24. 2 % at 2 weeks post-treatment) and (23. 3 % at 3 weeks post-treatment) in nymphs and adults respectively compared to SP (2. 5 and 5. 8 %, respectively) and SW (0. 0 and 0. 0). Results show that among the modes of inoculation tested, SP was the most appropriate for inoculating R. pulchellus adults.

50|$|A wet scrubber's {{ability to}} collect small {{particles}} is often {{directly proportional to}} the power input into the scrubber. Low energy devices such as <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> are used to collect particles larger than 5 micrometers. To obtain high efficiency removal of 1 micrometer (or less) particles generally requires high-energy devices such as venturi scrubbers or augmented devices such as condensation scrubbers. Additionally, a properly designed and operated entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiencies. The greater the number of liquid droplets that are not captured by the mist eliminator, the higher the potential emission levels.|$|R
5000|$|Theoretically, {{the smaller}} the {{droplets}} formed, the higher the collection efficiency achieved for both gaseous and particulate pollutants. However, the liquid droplets must {{be large enough to}} not be carried out of the scrubber by the scrubbed outlet gas stream. Therefore, <b>spray</b> <b>towers</b> use nozzles that produce droplets that are usually 500-1000 µm in diameter. Although small in size, these droplets are large compared to those created in venturi scrubbers that are 10-50 µm in size. The gas velocity is kept low, from 0.3 to 1.2 m/s (1-4 ft/s), to prevent excess droplets from being carried out of the tower.|$|R
