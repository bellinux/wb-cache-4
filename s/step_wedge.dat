40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and test a new tool for {{radiographic}} densitometry by combining periapical films and aluminum <b>step</b> <b>wedge.</b> Materials and Methods: We reviewed 50 Kodak E-speed intraoral films. An aluminum <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> consisting of 16 steps was constructed. Each step was 1 mmx 3 mx 10 mm. The <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> was exposed to varying exposure times, ranging from 0. 05 second to 0. 5 second, increasing in 0. 05 second increments. Films were digitalized after processing and the MATLAB software algorithm was ran subsequently. Density of the films was measured again using a digital densitometer. In order to compare the two imaging techniques, three steps were selected. Output data from the MATLAB algorithm were compared with data obtained from the digital densitometer. Results: The new method could detect significant differences between subsequent exposure times in step 7, while the densitometer did that in steps 7 and 12. The new method’s sensitivity in determining density changes was 5. 26 %, 84. 1 % and 93. 02 % in steps 2, 7, and 12 respectively. Conclusions: Our new method has an acceptable sensitivity for determining density changes of at least 7 mmEq/Al.

40|$|Continuous tone printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a continuous tone original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a negative working plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative working plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a continuous tone <b>step</b> <b>wedge.</b> In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A continuous tone <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the <b>step</b> <b>wedge.</b> These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the continuous tone effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment continuous tone <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a continuous tone image with a negative working plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative working plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> {{randomised}} trial designs involve sequential roll-out of {{an intervention}} to participants (individuals or clusters) {{over a number}} of time periods. By the end of the study, all participants will have received the intervention, although the order in which participants receive the intervention is determined at random. The design is particularly relevant where it is predicted that the intervention will do more good than harm (making a parallel design, in which certain participants do not receive the intervention unethical) and/or where, for logistical, practical or financial reasons, it is impossible to deliver the intervention simultaneously to all participants. <b>Stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> designs offer a number of opportunities for data analysis, particularly for modelling the effect of time on the effectiveness of an intervention. This paper presents a review of 12 studies (or protocols) that use (or plan to use) a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design. One aim of the review is to highlight the potential for the <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design, given its infrequent use to date.

Results This review identified 102 trials which employed the <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design compared to 37 from the most recent review by Beard et al. 2015. Forty six trials were cohort designs and 45  % (n[*]=[*] 46) had fewer than 10 clusters. Of the 42 articles discussing the design methodology 10 covered analysis and seven covered sample size. For cohort <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> designs there was only one paper considering analysis and one considering sample size methods.

40|$|X-ray based {{evaluation}} of {{different stages of}} fracture healing is a well established clinical standard. However, several studies have shown plain radiography alone to be an unreliable method to assess healing. The advent of digital X-ray systems provides the potential to perform quantitative analysis on X-ray images without disrupting normal clinical practice. Two aspects were explored in this study. The first was the measurement of mechanical fracture stiffness under four point bending and axial loading. The second was the inclusion of an Aluminium <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> to provide Aluminium-equivalent thickness calibration information. Mechanical sti ness studies involved the development of equipment to perform four point bending on intra-medullary (IM) nailed tibial fractures, equipment to perform axial loading on conservatively treated humeral fractures, and fracture models to ex- amine the developed systems. Computational procedures to automatically measure the angle and offset occurring at the fracture site by comparing loaded and unloaded X-ray images were developed utilising cross-correlation. The apparatus and procedures were tested using the fracture models both in X-ray and using the Zwick materials testing machine. The four point bending system was applied clinically {{to a series of}} IM nailed tibial fracture patients and the axial loading system to two conservatively treated humeral fracture patients. Mechanical stiffness results showed that the apparatus worked well in the clinical radiography environment and was unobtrusive to normal practice. The developed X-ray analysis procedure provided reliable measurements. However, in the case of IM nailed tibial fractures, both angular and displacement movements were too small to be accurately assessed or to provide reliable stiffness measurements. This indicated that this patient group was possibly unsuitable for mechanical stiffness measurements or that higher loads needed to be applied to the fracture site. The case studies of conservatively treated humeral fractures showed potential in detecting movement between loaded and unloaded X-rays and using this to provide sti ness information. Further investigation is required to show that this technique has the potential to aid fracture healing monitoring. Investigation into Aluminium <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> calibration began with the design of different step wedges and X-ray phantoms. Initial image analysis involved studying the automatic processing applied by a digital Computed Radiography (CR) Fuji sys- tem and modelling of the inhomogeneities in X-ray images as well as investigation into the effect of and correction for scatter, overlying soft tissue and bone thickness. Computational procedures were developed to semi-automatically detect the steps of the <b>step</b> <b>wedge,</b> form an exponential Aluminium step thickness to grey level calibration graph, measure soft tissue and bone thickness, and correct for the heel effect and scatter contributions. Tests were carried out on pre-clinical models and results compared to ash weight and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). A clinical study of radial fractures was used to investigate the effectiveness of the <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> calibration system in monitoring fracture healing changes. Results using the <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> indicated that the calibration technique was e ective in detecting and correcting for aspects in uencing Aluminium-equivalent thickness measures. With careful processing, useful information was obtained from digital X- rays that included the Aluminium <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> and these correlated well with existing density measures. The use of the wedge in patient images showed that small increases in Aluminium-equivalent thickness of the fracture site could be detected. This was most useful for intra-patient comparisons throughout the course of healing rather than providing quantitative measurements which were comparable to other density measures. In conclusion, this thesis shows the potential for accurate analysis of digital X- rays to aid the monitoring of healing changes in fracture patients, particularly with application of axial loading and the use of <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> calibration.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the radiopacity of six restorative materials using a direct digital image system, comparing them to the dental tissues (enamel-dentin), expressed as equivalent thickness of aluminum (millimeters of aluminum). Five specimens of each material were made. Three 2 -mm thick longitudinal sections were cut from an intact extracted permanent molar tooth (including enamel and dentin). An aluminum <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> with 9 steps was used. The samples of different materials were placed on a phosphor plate together with a tooth section, aluminum <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> and metal code letter, and were exposed using a dental x-ray unit. Five measurements of radiographic density were obtained from each image of each item assessed (restorative material, enamel, dentin, each step of the aluminum <b>step</b> <b>wedge)</b> and the mean of these values was calculated. Radiopacity values were subsequently calculated as equivalents of aluminum thickness. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences in radiopacity values among the materials (P< 0. 0001). The radiopacity values of the restorative materials evaluated were, in decreasing order: TPH, F 2000, Synergy, Prisma Flow, Degufill, Luxat. Only Luxat had significantly lower radiopacity values than dentin. One material (Degufill) had similar radiopacity values to enamel and four (TPH, F 2000, Synergy and Prisma Flow) had significantly higher radiopacity values than enamel. In conclusion, to assess the adequacy of posterior composite restorations it is important that the restorative material to be used has enough radiopacity, in order to be easily distinguished from the tooth structure in the radiographic image.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> cluster {{randomised}} trials frequently {{involve a}} relatively small number of clusters. The most common frameworks used to analyse data from these types of trials are generalised estimating equations and generalised linear mixed models. A topic of much research into these methods has been their application to cluster randomised trial data and, in particular, the number of clusters required to make reasonable inferences about the intervention effect. However, for <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials, which have been claimed by many researchers to have a statistical power advantage over the parallel cluster randomised trial, the minimum number of clusters required has not been investigated. METHODS: We conducted a simulation study where we considered the most commonly used methods suggested in the literature to analyse cross-sectional <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> cluster randomised trial data. We compared the per cent bias, the type I error rate and power of these methods in a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trial setting with a binary outcome, where there are few clusters available and when the appropriate adjustment for a time trend is made, which by design may be confounding the intervention effect. RESULTS: We found that the generalised linear mixed modelling approach is the most consistent when few clusters are available. We also found that none of the common analysis methods for <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials were both unbiased and maintained a 5 % type I error rate when there were only three clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used analysis approaches, we recommend the generalised linear mixed model for small <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials with binary outcomes. We also suggest that in a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design with three steps, at least two clusters be randomised at each step, to ensure that the intervention effect estimator maintains the nominal 5 % significance level and is also reasonably unbiased...|$|R

40|$|The <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> cluster {{randomised}} {{trial is}} a novel research study design that is increasingly {{being used in the}} evaluation of service delivery type interventions. The design involves random and sequential crossover of clusters from control to intervention until all clusters are exposed. It is a pragmatic study design which can reconcile the need for robust evaluations with political or logistical constraints. While not exclusively for the evaluation of service delivery interventions, it is particularly suited to evaluations that do not rely on individual patient recruitment. As in all cluster trials, <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials with individual recruitment and without concealment of allocation (or blinding of the intervention) are at risk of selection biases. In a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design more clusters are exposed to the intervention {{towards the end of the}} study than in its early stages. This implies that the effect of the intervention might be confounded with any underlying temporal trend. A result that initially might seem suggestive of an effect of the intervention may therefore transpire to be the result of a positive underlying temporal trend. Sample size calculations and analysis must make allowance for both the clustered nature of the design and the confounding effect of time. The <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> cluster randomised trial is an alternative to traditional parallel cluster studies, in which the intervention is delivered in only half the clusters with the remainder functioning as controls. When the clusters are relatively homogeneous (that is, the intra-cluster correlation is small), parallel studies tend to deliver better statistical performance than a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trial. However, if substantial cluster-level effects are present (that is, larger intra-cluster correlations) or the clusters are large, the <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design will be more powerful than a parallel design, even one in which the intervention is preceded by a period of baseline control observations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Three {{arguments}} are usually invoked {{in favour of}} <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> cluster randomised controlled trials: the logistic convenience of implementing an intervention in phases, the ethical benefit of providing the intervention to all clusters, and the potential to enhance the social acceptability of cluster randomised controlled trials. Are these alleged benefits real? We explored the logistic, ethical, and political dimensions of <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials using case studies of six recent evaluations. Methods: We identified completed or ongoing <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> evaluations using two systematic reviews. We then purposively selected six {{with a focus on}} public health in high, middle, and low-income settings. We interviewed their authors about the logistic, ethical, and social issues faced by their teams. Two authors reviewed interview transcripts, identified emerging issues through qualitative thematic analysis, reflected upon them {{in the context of the}} literature, and invited all participants to co-author the manuscript. Results: Our analysis raises three main points. First, the phased implementation of interventions can alleviate problems linked to simultaneous roll-out, but also brings new challenges. Issues to consider include the feasibility of organising intervention activities according to a randomised sequence, estimating time lags in implementation and effects, and accommodating policy changes during the trial period. Second, <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials, like parallel cluster trials, require equipoise: without it, randomising participants to a control condition, even for a short time, remains problematic. In <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials, equipoise is likely to lie in the degree of effect, effectiveness in a specific operational milieu, and the balance of benefit and harm, including the social value of better evaluation. Third, the strongest arguments for a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design are logistic and political rather than ethical. The design is advantageous when simultaneous roll-out is impractical and when it increases the acceptability of using counterfactuals. Conclusions: The logistic convenience of phased implementation is context-dependent, and may be vitiated by the additional requirements of phasing. The potential for <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trials to enhance the social acceptability of cluster randomised trials is real, but their ethical legitimacy still rests on demonstrating equipoise and its configuration for each research question and setting...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the growing}} {{attention}} to quality improvement, comparative effectiveness research, and pragmatic trials embedded within learning health systems, {{the use of the}} cluster randomization design is bound to increase. The number of clusters available for randomization is often limited in such trials. Designs that incorporate pre-intervention measurements (e. g. cluster cross-over, repeated parallel arm, and <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> designs) can substantially reduce the required numbers of clusters by decreasing between-cluster sources of variation. However, there are substantial risks associated with few clusters, including increased probability of chance imbalances and type I and type II error, limited perceived or actual generalizability, and fewer options for statistical analysis. Furthermore, current sample size methods for the <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design make a strong underlying assumption with respect to the correlation structure-in particular, that the intracluster and inter-period correlations are equal. This is in contrast with methods for the cluster cross-over design that explicitly allow for a smaller inter-period correlation. Failing to similarly allow for the inter-period correlation in the design of a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trial may yield perilously low sample sizes. Further methodological and empirical work is required to inform sample size methods and guidance for the <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trial and to provide minimum thresholds for this design...|$|R

Jaw {{bone density}} {{measurements}} are applicable in many clinical situations to assess bone tissue. To {{be able to}} implement research findings in clinical reality, tools must be simple and low cost. Intra-oral radiographs including a reference material perform well as a densitometric tool. However, {{the inclusion of a}} reference material, usually {{in the form of a}} metal wedge, is an additional burden for the dentist. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a reference <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> is required for accurate densitometric results. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements and densitometric measurements on intra-oral radiographs using a custom-made software were performed on bone samples from the premolar region of the mandible. Observer agreement of bone density expressed as grey value was high. The correlation between mandibular bone mineral density and the densitometric values on intra-oral radiographs was substantially higher when the aluminium <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> was included. The Wilcoxon test revealed no significant difference between the density measurements using nine or three steps of the Al reference wedge. Density determination of grey value and mm Aleq thickness value both have good intra- and inter-observer agreement. However, jaw bone densitometry is far more accurate when including a reference wedge. PMID: 17668257 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> cluster {{randomized}} trials are {{a class of}} unidirectional crossover studies that have historically been limited to evaluating a single intervention. This design is especially suitable for pragmatic trials where the study feasibility can be improved with a phased introduction of the intervention. We examined variations of <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> designs that would support evaluation of multiple interventions. Methods: We propose four different design variants for implementing a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> trial with two interventions: concurrent design, supplementation, replacement, and factorial designs. Analyses were conducted comparing the precision of the estimated intervention effects for the different designs. Results: Concurrent, supplementation, and factorial variants provide equal precision for estimating the treatment effect within a design {{for each of the}} interventions. However, in the replacement design, the effect of the first introduced intervention is generally estimated more precisely than the second intervention. Surprising and nonintuitive changes in the precision of the intervention effect estimates are observed when additional observation time intervals are included in multiple intervention designs. Conclusion: These <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design variations offer alternative methods for studying two interventions using a cluster-randomized trial. The selection of the appropriate variants should be driven by the research question with consideration given to the trade-off in number of steps, number of clusters, restrictions for concurrent implementation based on intervention characteristics, lingering effects of each intervention, and desired ability to compare interventions within clusters or within the same steps...|$|R
40|$|The <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> {{design is}} a unique {{clinical}} trial design that allows for a sequential introduction of an intervention. However, the statistical analysis is unclear when this design is applied in survival data. The time-dependent introduction of the intervention in combination with terminal endpoints and interval censoring makes the analysis more complicated. In this paper, a time-on-study scale discrete survival model was constructed. Simulations were conducted primarily to study the performance of our model for different settings of the <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design. Secondary, we compared our approach to continuous Cox proportional hazard model. The {{results show that the}} discrete survival model estimates the intervention effects unbiasedly. If the length of the censoring interval is increased, the precision of the estimates is decreased. Without left truncation and late entry, the number of steps improves the precision of the estimates, whereas in combination of left truncation and late entry, the number of steps decreases the precision. Given the same number of participants and clusters, a parallel group design has higher precision than a <b>stepped</b> <b>wedge</b> design. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The waiting list for the “Girls on the Go!” program was used to generate the control period. The intervention program was designed to be delivered to a group of participants from the same school at the same time, thus randomising students in clusters (school) was seen as an appropriate unit of randomisation.|$|R

Disk specimens 6 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick (N = 220, n = 10) were prepared from the following restorative materials: · eight shades of nanofilled composite (Aelite Aesthetic Enamel), · seven shades of nanohybrid composite (Grandio Universal), · six shades of photopolymerized polyacid modified compomer (Glasiosite), and · one shade of hybrid composite (X-tra fil U). Human canine dentin (n = 10), bovine enamel (n = 10), and an aluminum (Al) <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> were used as references. The optical density values of each material were measured from radiographic images using a transmission densitometer. Al <b>step</b> <b>wedge</b> thickness and optical density values were plotted, and equivalent Al thickness (eq Al) values were determined for radiopacity measurements of each material. The {{data were analyzed using}} a non-parametric one-way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis), and multiple comparisons were made with a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (a = 0. 05). Different shades of resin-based restorative materials tested did not reveal statistically significant differences within each material group (p > 0. 05). Radiopacity values of the resin-based restorative materials investigated varied depending on their types; however, within different shades of one material type, radiopacity values were comparable. Every shade of nanocomposite material other than Aelite Aesthetic Enamel Incisal LT Gray showed comparable radiopacity to human dentin. Other materials tested demonstrated higher radiopacity compared to human dentin and bovine enamel...|$|E

40|$|In x-radiography, {{filters are}} often used {{in order to improve}} the overall image quality. Filters achieve this by making the x-ray beam have less energy spread, {{resulting}} in a cleaner image. <b>Step</b> <b>wedges</b> of different materials were used to compare radiographic density with and without a copper filter to identify the effect of the copper filter at different energies and exposure times. The <b>step</b> <b>wedges</b> used were CRS 1018 (cold rolled steel), Stainless Steel 304 L, Al 1100, Al 6061 T 6, titanium, copper, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon), brass, carbon, magnesium, phenolic, tungsten, and tantalum. Out of the 14 <b>step</b> <b>wedges</b> tested, only 12 produced useful data, as tungsten and tantalum were both too dense to produce any useable images and data points. In the given time, we were able to run a total of 6 different series of tests at the following parameters: 130 kV for 15 min, 130 kV for 5 min, and 70 kV for 5 min; all with and without a copper filter. From the resulting data we were able to identify certain trends and patterns of the copper filter that held true across all materials.
