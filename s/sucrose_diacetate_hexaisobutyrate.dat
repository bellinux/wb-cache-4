The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} insecticidal effect of an array of synthetic sucrose esters with the aliphatic and aromatic groups on whitefly adults. Sucrose butyrate, caprate, octanoate, palmitate, oleate, octaacetate, phthalate, benzoate, and <b>sucrose</b> <b>diacetate</b> <b>hexaisobutyrate</b> were tested. The solutions were prepared and applied on the adults caught on yellow sticky traps using the Potter spray tower. Long-chains sucrose aliphatic esters were more effective against the silverleaf whiteflies and the highest mortality was obtained with sucrose oleate and sucrose octanoate. Since these compounds were tensoactive, sodium dodecylsulphate was also tested for the comparison but no effect was observed. Sucrose butyrate and other aliphatic and aromatic sucrose polyesters showed negligible effect on the silverleaf whiteflies...|$|E

O biótipo B de B. tabaci Gennadius tem se destacado como uma praga-chave de diversas culturas. O controle químico tem sido a principal tática de controle utilizada, embora já se tenha observado redução na eficiência dos produtos devido ao desenvolvimento de resistência. Assim, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de diversos ésteres de sacarose com grupos alifáticos ou aromáticos sobre adultos de mosca-branca. Butirato de sacarose, caprato, octanoato, palmitato, oleato, actaacetato, ftlato, benzoato e diacetato hexaisobutirato de sacarose foram testados. Soluções de éster de sacarose foram preparadas e aplicadas sobre adultos capturados em armadilhas adesivas utilizando Torre de Potter. Ésteres alifáticos de sacarose com longas cadeias foram mais efetivos contra mosca-branca e as maiores taxas de mortalidade foram obtidas com oleato e octanoato de sacarose. Uma vez que estes compostos são caracterizados como tensoativos, dodecilsulfato de sódio foi testado para comparação e não se observou qualquer efeito. Butirato de sacarose e outros poliésteres de sacarose alifáticos ou aromáticos foram praticamente inócuos para mosca-branca...|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{cells of}} photoperiod-sensitive genic {{male-sterile}} rice (PGMR) were isolated from pollen tubes using two step osmotic shock with BSA and sucrose solution, which were separated and purified using a micromanipulator. The highest ratio of viable sperm cells was obtained when pollen grains cultured {{in a medium}} containing 1. 5 mM BSA and 10 % <b>sucrose</b> solution. Fluorescein <b>diacetate</b> (FDA) stain {{was used to determine}} the viable sperm cells. The size of two sperm cells of PGMR nongken 58 S were different but the dimorphism of sperm cells in 58 S needs to be confirmed by further work...|$|R
