50|$|The {{flexibility}} of the Dickerson Press allows numerous approaches not possible with other machines. When using the top roller, the user can adjust {{it so that the}} thickest blocks will pass under it. It is not necessary to pad the relief from below because once brought down to the surface to be printed, the roller (or <b>scraper</b> <b>bar</b> in certain techniques) holds its position before, during, and after the print is made. Since the roller can be made to cant about 15 degrees, it will conform to uneven or warped surfaces. Sensitive pressure adjustment allows a range of printing from the richest blacks to the most velvety grays. Reliefs can be printed either face up or face down, to provide perfect color registry.|$|R

40|$|Research and {{development}} of a reliable dry land production system for common bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) based on low-cost direct seeding and direct harvest methods was initiated at the Crop Development Centre at the University of Saskatchewan in the late 1980 s. The target production area is a dry land spring wheat farming region in which lentil and pea production is well established. Effort is focussed on production of the pinto class. Three major potential improvements to the production system were identified: harvest equipment modification to improve direct harvest capability, development of early maturing germplasm with reliable expression of a crop canopy suitable for direct harvesting systems, and appropriate agronomy to improve the reliability of production. The research effort in harvest equipment modifications resulted in commercialization of a new design of lifter and reel assembly for combines equipped with floating cutter bar headers. Field scale evaluations showed that a 50 % reduction in cutter bar loss is possible with cultivars with Type III growth habit. Agronomy research for new production systems has been limited to development of improved rhizobial strains, but new areas of research will be explored as appropriate cultivars become available. Research {{in the area of}} germplasm development is specifically focussed on gains in early maturity and improvements in canopy structure, particularly for the pinto class. The ideal canopy structure for the production system is one in which all pods are situated above the combine cutter bar at the time of harvest. Specific improvements to the canopy structure include development of early maturing genotypes with elongated Type I growth habit, Type II growth habit or Type III growth habit without basal clustering of pods. In addition, an effort is underway to develop genotypes with shorter pods to maximize cutter <b>bar</b> <b>clearance</b> are under development and with pods with reduced lignin to minimize shattering and maximize cutter <b>bar</b> <b>clearance.</b> Reduction of lignin in pods may help reduce shattering at the time of harvest due to reduced dehiscence. Pods with reduced lignin tend to curve upward at the time of maturity, allowing better clearance of the cutter bar. Agronomic comparisons of F 2 -derived F 4 and F 5 lines showed that in some populations cutter bar losses can be reduced by up to 50 %...|$|R

40|$|Mental {{training}} {{has been studied}} extensively for the past century but we are still not completely sure how it affects brain and behavior. The aim of this doctoral thesis was to examine one aspect of mental training i. e. motor imagery. In Study I, active high jumpers were trained for 6 weeks using a motor imagery mental training program. We measured behavioral effects in motor parameters such as total height, false attempts, take off angle, and <b>bar</b> <b>clearance.</b> A significant improvement {{was found on the}} <b>bar</b> <b>clearance</b> component compared to a control group of high jumpers that did not participate in the mental training program. The results emphasize the importance of using appropriate outcome measures since mental training may affect distinct features of the movement rather than the entire movement. Study II used fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to examine the neural correlates of imagery for active high jumpers, and also how imagery training affects brain activity. Active high jumpers were compared to a control group of high jumping novices and the results showed that high jumpers were able to activate motor regions, whereas controls used parts of the visual system to perform imagery of the high jump. Thus, we were able to show how important well established motor representations are in order to achieve a neural overlap between imagery and action. In study III we examined the effects after motor, mental and combined motor and mental training on a finger tapping task. Behaviorally, even though mental training improved performance, adding mental training to motor training did not improve the results beyond only using motor training. Imaging results showed that motor and mental training engaged different neural systems, with motor training associated with motor activity and mental training with visual activity. The combination of motor and mental training activated both motor and visual systems. Additionally combining motor and mental training resulted in transfer to an untrained motor sequence and neural data indicated that cerebellum mediated the transfer. The overall findings explain how mental training can be used to improve motor performance and motor parameters. Moreover, it also illustrates that the neural processes underlying such improvements may be distinct from motor training and that the brain may react differently during mental training depending on prior physical experience of the action...|$|R

25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of <b>scraper</b> <b>bars</b> fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|R

40|$|Run-up, {{plant and}} {{take-off}} directly affect the aerodynamics and the <b>bar</b> <b>clearance</b> in the pole vault event. The {{purpose of this}} study was to show the biomechanical features of the last two strides of run-up and take-off performed by China’s elite women pole vault athletes. Two synchronized PEAK video cameras operating at 25 Hz were used to film the pole vaults of the subjects and films were digitized by an Engine 3 D Video Analysis System. Kinematics data was obtained on change of length in two last strides, velocities of last foot in contact with ground, take-off parameters and body position during foot pushing-off ground. Comparing their performance with that of world elite athletes, all subjects in the study should improve the run-up velocities in order to be more successful. Based on the results from this study, it is suggested to increase the horizontal velocities during take-off and to reduce the take-off angle. In addition, the poles should be lowered earlier and the knee angles should be increased.

40|$|Abstract: For the {{innovative}} TUM-Hydro Shaft Power Plant concept, we investigated the downstream passage of fish that can physically {{pass through the}} screen. Experimental investigations with live fish have already confirmed fish protection and fish downstream migration {{for a number of}} fish species and sizes bigger than the <b>bar</b> <b>clearance</b> at the TUM-Hydro Shaft Power Plant prototype. This investigation continues to evaluate the concept’s qualification for fish protection and its downstream migration efficiency. The 35 kW prototype allowed nature-like but controlled open-air laboratory conditions for behavior studies with brown trout, grayling, barbell, minnow, and bullhead with body lengths from 5 – 20 cm. The passage distribution between the turbine and the fish downstream migration corridor as well as the injury and mortality rates during turbine passage were recorded for different flow velocities towards the screen and for different arrangements of the bypass. The results reveal that portions of the downstream migrating or drifting fish did not pass through the turbine. Instead, they traversed the provided migration corridor. With regard to facility passage, the injury and mortality rates of the fish were smaller than the turbine specific injury and mortality rates. This was due to the passage distribution between turbine and bypass; however, detailed statements on migration distributions and damage rates depend on the respective fish species, fish sizes and facility configurations. Additionally, general influences of the parameters were assessed and the results were compared with literature references. With regard to ecological requirements of specific river sites, the findings can be useful for the future design of hydro power plants; the methodology offers prospect for a more targeted adaption of these criteria for fish protection...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In high jumping, the Fosbury Flop technique is currently used by all elite high jumpers throughout the world. The technique involves an acrobatic <b>bar</b> <b>clearance</b> {{at the end of}} a curved approach run. Initially the curved approach was considered to be no more than an idiosyncrasy of Dick Fosbury. However, the curved approach remains the preferred approach among elite jumpers, and therefore can be expected to be advantageous in high jumping. Speculations on the possible advantages of the curved approach have been made, but most are not based on experimental data and all lack convincing mechanical explanations. In order to understand the contribution of the curved approach to high jumping technique, the characteristics of the approach needed to be examined. Analysis of the 15 m approach phase of the high jump posed a. challenge in terms of obtaining the appropriate size of image and field of view. A number of image analysis systems were evaluated before one with the appropriate accuracy was selected. A total of 15 jumps performed by two elite high jumpers in two competitions were analysed. It was found that the curve through the foot placements tightened towards the end of the approach. Concurrently the inward body tilt towards the centre of the curve decreased resulting in an angular velocity about the frontal axis of the body. This suggested that the curved approach was used to provide the somersault rotation over the bar. In order to test this hypothesis a computer simulation model of the approach phase was developed and evaluated using the data from the image analyses. The model was used to explain the mechanics underlying the curved approach in the Fosbury Flop. It was found that tightening of the foot placement curve towards the end of the approach generated somersault rotation and also contributed to twist rotation at takeoff...|$|R

We classify freight vehicles into trucks and vans: a freight vehicle with height above 2.5  m is defined as a truck, while below 2.5  m is defined as a van (right of Fig. 1). We introduce this definition to distinguish between those vehicles that are able to enter a passenger’ carpark from those that are not able to.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{shortage}} of labors in Taiwan's livestock farming is an apparent problem now. How to mechanize {{to help the}} daily works in the farm using limited labors becomes a very important issue. Meanwhile, cleaning and managing the livestock's waste take time and {{cost a lot of}} labors. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a scraping shovel with movable flanks to replace the traditional shovels attaching on the shovel loaders and it could be used in both livestock and poultry houses. Utilizing this scraper with a shovel loader on cleaning floors in either livestock or poultry houses is able to improve the percentages of cleaning floors as well as to save labors. The direction of this research starts with basic analysis in the prototype of a scraping shovel with movable flanks. To find the geometric relationship of a scraper with movable flanks is able to ensure the functioning of open and close when the size of scraper is increased. A commercially available program of finite element analysis method, ANSYS, was used to analyze the stresses that resulted from the changes of the structures associated with various loads. The load for the scraper with movable flanks was considered to be loaded as the same volume of a traditional shovel carried, 200 kg. The result confirmed the safety of this new scraper. When we increase the volume of the shovel <b>scraper</b> having three <b>bars</b> under the bottom plate, the load goes up to 300 kg. The safe design of plate components holds firmly as well as other components in the scraper with movable flanks. To scale up the model of scraper using the methods developed in the research, thus, is possible. 摘 要 目前臺灣畜牧工作人力短缺，能使用的人力資源有限，所以如何將工作機械化是很重要的課題，而現今處理畜禽舍的排泄物乃是一項既費時且耗費人力的工作。中興大學農機系開發一組改良式蛋雞舍適用之活動鏟斗雛型機，功能佳，但容量小，部份強度不足，因此本研究之目標為改良一套二段式活動鏟斗，替代人力並取代一般傳統的鏟斗，來從事畜禽舍的清潔，以提高清潔率及節省勞力為主要目標，且使用鏟裝車及二段式活動鏟斗，收集動物所產生的糞尿，可以減少直接用水沖洗畜禽舍所耗費寶貴的水資源。 本研究的方向是從二段式活動鏟斗的雛型斗之基礎分析著手，研究二段式鏟斗的幾何關係，得到改變鏟斗尺寸時，其兩臂為了保持正常開合之動作，兩臂製作前所需之步驟，以及使用有限元素法分析軟體ANSYS研究鏟斗負載時，所承受應力之變化。經設計分析結果顯示：當二段式活動鏟斗負載量以傳統工程用鏟斗容量為考量時，在承載量為 200 kg下，其分析結果是合乎安全標準，當鏟斗容量加大，負載達 300 kg時，在鏟斗下方支撐架增加至三支，其分析結果同樣達到安全標準，進而分析二段式活動鏟斗其餘重要部分，分析結果也都符合設計上之要求。依本研究之方法可以將此活動鏟斗尺寸放大，而兼顧運轉之平順性與結構之安全性。目 錄 中文摘要I 英文摘要II 目 錄III 圖目錄VI 表目錄IX 第一章 前言 1 1. 1 畜禽舍糞尿處理之簡介 1 1. 2 畜禽舍糞尿處理之方法 1 1. 3 研究項目 4 1. 4 研究目的 5 第二章 文獻探討 6 2. 1 牛舍清潔的探討 6 2. 1. 1 牛舍環境對牛隻之影響 6 2. 1. 2 牛糞尿之處理方式 7 2. 2 豬舍清潔的探討 8 2. 2. 1 豬舍環境對豬隻之影響 8 2. 2. 2 豬糞尿之處理方式 8 2. 3 雞舍清潔的探討 9 2. 3. 1 雞舍環境對雞隻之影響 9 2. 3. 2 雞糞之處理方式 10 2. 4 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對環境的污染 11 2. 4. 1 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對空氣品質的影響 11 2. 4. 2 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對對水源的影響 12 2. 5 畜禽舍產生的糞尿與有機農業的關係 13 2. 5. 1 何謂有機農業 13 2. 5. 2 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對有機農業的影響 14 2. 6 有限元素法在農業力學方面的應用 17 第三章 實驗原理 19 3. 1 何謂有限元素法 19 3. 2 有限元素法的簡史 19 3. 3 有限元素法和有限差分法之比較 20 3. 4 有限元素法之基本學理 21 3. 5 電腦輔助分析軟體ANSYS之源由 23 3. 6 電腦輔助分析軟體ANSYS之基本架構 24 3. 6. 1 元素、截面及材料的定義 24 3. 6. 2 建構幾何模型 25 3. 6. 3 分割網格 25 3. 6. 4 夾持及負載 25 3. 6. 5 分析 25 3. 6. 6 結果 26 第四章 實驗設備 27 4. 1 山貓牌鏟裝車 27 4. 2 二段式活動鏟斗之雛型斗 28 4. 3 電腦主機 29 4. 4 Working Model軟體 29 4. 5 Auto Cad軟體 30 4. 6 有限元素法軟體ANSYS 30 第五章 實驗步驟 31 5. 1 研究二段式活動鏟斗之幾何關係 31 5. 2 使用有限元素分析軟體ANSYS模擬受力狀況 31 5. 3 建構模組及其邊界條件之設定 32 5. 3. 1 底板模組及其邊界條件 32 5. 3. 2 前刮板模組及其邊界條件 35 5. 3. 3 前刮板及側擋板模組及其邊界條件 37 5. 3. 4 後機箱關節模組及其邊界條件 37 第六章 結果與討論 39 6. 1 二段式活動鏟斗之幾何關係 39 6. 1. 1 測出鏟斗開啟之軌跡 39 6. 1. 2 逆推滑槽型板元件鑿孔所需之不規則曲線 40 6. 1. 3 比對所得結果 42 6. 2 利用ANSYS分析二段式活動鏟斗之應力 44 6. 2. 1 建構鏟斗底板之模組 44 6. 2. 2 鏟斗底板分析結果 47 6. 2. 3 更改底板尺寸之分析 50 6. 2. 4 前刮板之分析 52 6. 2. 5 前刮板與側擋板組合分析 56 6. 2. 6 後機箱關節之分析 58 第七章 結論與建議 68 參考文獻 71 附錄 75 附錄 1 雞糞的平均密度 75 附錄 2 鏟斗前刮板前端點開合的 18 個點座標 76 附錄 3 二段式活動鏟斗零件圖 7...|$|R
