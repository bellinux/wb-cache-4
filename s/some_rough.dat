Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> patches.|$|E
5|$|Mind Games was {{recorded}} between July and August 1973 in Lennon's characteristic quick fashion, and was mixed over a two-week period. Lennon produced the album by himself, following his previous three-year partnership with Phil Spector. When {{the album was}} remixed in 2002, many audio anomalies hidden in the original mixing were uncovered. <b>Some</b> <b>rough</b> mixes appear on bootlegs and on 1997's John Lennon Anthology.|$|E

50|$|Grinding is used {{to finish}} {{workpieces}} that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high accuracy of shape and dimension. As the accuracy in dimensions in grinding is {{of the order of}} 0.000025 mm, in most applications it tends to be a finishing operation and removes comparatively little metal, about 0.25 to 0.50 mm depth. However, there are <b>some</b> <b>roughing</b> applications in which grinding removes high volumes of metal quite rapidly. Thus, grinding is a diverse field.|$|R

Outside are two more cells and a chamber or chapel {{at the end of}} a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> {{chapters}} to read. I {{was appalled}} {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

25|$|For a {{coherent}} {{depiction of a}} whole landscape, <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in Ancient Greece in the Hellenistic period, although no large-scale examples survive. More ancient Roman landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of Pompeii, Herculaneum and elsewhere, and mosaics.|$|E
25|$|The 1961 {{series was}} a {{personal}} triumph for skipper Richie Benaud, whose match-winning bowling and astute leadership in the fourth Test at Old Trafford {{proved to be the}} decisive factor in the series. With the series square, England needed 256 to win and were expected to get them, but Benaud, by bowling his leg breaks round the wicket into <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> created by footmarks, took 6-70 to secure an Australian victory by 54 runs. The key moment came when he bowled the England captain Peter May behind his legs for a duck. The bemused May had to be told by Aussie keeper Wally Grout that he had been bowled.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} this claim has been {{difficult}} to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years, McMasters has backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book [...] by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found [...] their flight was impossible, but [...] "One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality".|$|E

500|$|The {{households}} {{of medieval}} peasant families were naturally smaller {{than those of}} the aristocracy, and as such resembled modern households more. The patterns of marriage fluctuated greatly {{over the course of the}} Middle Ages. Even though most of the available evidence concerns the higher classes, and the source material for southern Europe is richer than for the rest, it is still possible to make <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> generalisations. It seems clear that the average age of marriage during the Early Middle Ages was comparatively high, in the early twenties, and quite equal for men and women. The reason for this can be found in traditions brought forward from the Germanic tribes, but equally in the fact that habitation was confined to small areas, a factor that enforced restrictions on population growth.|$|E
500|$|On October 30, 2006, {{before a}} crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter {{announced}} {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, [...] "his {{is going to be a}} long road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> and tumble, but I think it's the right thing to do for our country." [...] He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise." [...] Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find [...] "something to do" [...] in preparation for his loss of the Armed Services Committee chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success. Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and [...] "no following within the party", Hunter [...] "faces extremely long odds".|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Fall Out Boy began searching for {{potential}} producers. The band sought out R singer/producer Babyface, as they admired {{his work on}} the soundtrack to the 2001 film version of Josie and the Pussycats. Babyface saw one of the interviews in which the band discussed its desire to work with him and contacted the group. Babyface produced two of the songs, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)" [...] and [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs". Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous album, handled production for eleven of Infinity on Highs fourteen tracks. Before recording, the band began with six weeks of pre-production, which was encouraged by Avron. This period included both rehearsals and writing, as well as working out all the sounds and arrangements. It began in Chicago before the group relocated to the Swing House studios in Los Angeles. Additionally, <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> recordings of songs were created {{to be used in the}} studio as a future reference.|$|E

5000|$|After having sailed from Great Britain by {{the ships}} Melazzo and Emperor, the British Legion landed in Naples on 15 October 1860 and {{took part in}} a fight, under the command of John Whitehead Peard in Sant'Angelo up to the wall of Capua, where 2 volunteers were killed and 8 wounded. Even if a half of the volunteers were {{enthusiastic}} and behaved properly, there were <b>some</b> <b>roughs,</b> principally from Glasgow and London who lacked discipline, so the Legion acquired a name for disorder similar to that which the Pope’s Irish had acquired in Rome.

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{forthcoming}} season, Arsenal played a series of friendlies across Western Europe. Their first match ended in defeat against Peterborough United of the Second Division; goalkeeper Stuart Taylor was forced {{to come off the}} field after colliding with Peterborough substitute Lee Clarke in the second half. Arsenal then played out a draw against Barnet, where trialist Yaya Touré – the brother of Kolo, was included in the team. In a 2011 interview, Wenger recalled Yaya's performance as being [...] "completely average on the day" [...] and noted his impatience stopped him from joining Arsenal; Touré went on to play for Barcelona before joining Manchester City in 2010. Arsenal undertook a tour in Austria, a year after crowd troubles forced their match in Eisenstadt to be abandoned. Wenger was absent with a stomach upset so assistant manager Pat Rice took charge of Arsenal against SC Ritzing on 22 July 2003; the team came from two goals down to draw their second consecutive friendly. Rice was pleased with Philippe Senderos' cameo in defence and said: [...] "Still <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> edges but he will only get better working with Martin Keown and Sol Campbell." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{weather for}} the race was good, as was the tide, but a strong breeze made for <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> water. [...] Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. [...] Making the better start of the two crews, Cambridge were a length ahead by Walden's Wharf and had {{extended}} that by another half-length by the time they passed the Crab Tree pub. [...] Oxford came back into contention {{and by the time the}} crews shot Hammersmith Bridge there was [...] "little or no daylight between the boats." [...] The other side of the bridge the crews hit rough water and as Cambridge had the advantage of shelter on their side of the river, they pulled away quickly to be three lengths clear by Chiswick. [...] As the bend of the river began to favour the Dark Blues, they drew up once again and were almost level by Barnes Bridge when their number seven Douglas McLean broke his oar in two, effectively ending his participation in the race. Cambridge pulled away again and won by two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 52 seconds. [...] It was their second consecutive victory and their fastest time since the 1876 race. The win took the overall record to 2320 in Oxford's favour.|$|E
500|$|In {{the form}} of an {{extensive}} series of callbacks, Larkin returned to the studio on several different occasions over the next few months. While the audience of studio executives and filmmakers continued to increase, the amount of actresses competing for the role gradually decreased accordingly as the audition process neared completion. Larkin's final audition lasted a total of four hours, during which she read through the entire script for the first time. The animators were also provided with an opportunity to animate to Larkin's voice for the first time. The actress was finally cast several months later, by which time she had nearly forgotten she had ever auditioned. Six months into recording, however, Larkin was forced to re-audition for the role by Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who felt that the actress' voice lacked the authority required to voice a princess. However, Clements and Musker disagreed with him, and managed to trick Katzenberg into not firing Larkin by staging a fake recording session during which they had the actress speak lower and slower in Katzenberg's presence, only to have her return to her natural voice thereafter. Larkin recorded only one scene alongside her co-stars Williams and Scott Weinger, voice of Aladdin. Apart from <b>some</b> <b>rough,</b> unfinished storyboards and drawings, Larkin did not see much of her character until the film was finally screened at the Museum of Modern Art.|$|E

50|$|The Senators faced {{elimination}} {{again in}} game five in Montreal. Again, Ottawa {{took the lead}} in the first, this time with two goals by Bobby Ryan and Patrick Wiercioch. The Senators increased their lead in the second period with a power play goal by Erik Karlsson to lead by 3-0 after two. In the third, Tom Gilbert scored to narrow the gap to 3-1. Erik Condra made a critical takeaway and scored on a breakaway. After <b>some</b> <b>roughing</b> between Anderson and Brandon Prust led to a Senators power play, Mike Hoffman scored in the final minute to make it a 5-1 romp. In the game, Montreal out shot Ottawa 46-25 but was repeatedly stymied by Anderson.|$|R

500|$|Like part one, {{the second}} part premiered to {{critical}} acclaim. IGN's Ramsey Isler wrote that it [...] "changed the whole landscape of the show's main plot arc. Although there were <b>some</b> <b>rough</b> spots in the execution of this story, overall it's {{one hell of a}} way to end the season." [...] He rated the episode 8.6/10. While praising Noble's performance, Isler criticized some plot aspects. He was [...] "kind of torn" [...] on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday device had been set up more for the third season, and believed the Olivia-Fauxlivia interaction to be [...] "a little strange," [...] as the two went from discussing their respective families to [...] "ass kicking". Isler did praise the fight itself. Ken Tucker praised the acting and the writers, noting [...] "The fact that the series can accommodate a fan like me only confirms what a well-wrought piece of pop culture Fringe has become." [...] Tucker included {{the second part}} of the season in his mid-year [...] "Top 10" [...] list for 2010, partly attributing this ranking to Fringe [...] "offer the season's best cliffhanger", alongside Breaking Bad. Noel Murray declared that he enjoyed part two slightly more, grading it an A. He praised Torv and Noble's performances for [...] "inhabiting their respective worlds so well", and Goldsman for [...] " [...] this episode with an emphasis on the characters more than the setting".|$|E
500|$|Nick de Semlyen from Empire {{considered}} it an average film, saying [...] "It's familiar ground for anyone who's seen Black Book or Sophie Scholl, but director Ole Christian Madsen steers a skilful course, keeping things grim {{but not to}} an off-putting extent, bringing a David Lynch-esque vibe to Flame's hotel dalliances with a shady lady and pulling off an incredible death scene {{for one of the}} leads." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club criticized it for [...] "hammer too hard on the shopworn theme of how war sickens souls. Far more interesting is Flame & Citrons other theme: the idea that war turns the notion of 'shades of gray' into a luxury". V.A. Musetto, for the New York Post, commented that, although it [...] "features well-choreographed shootouts and assassinations", its [...] "script is too melodramatic and complicated for its own good". Burr mostly praised it but said that [...] "Madsen eventually loses his way", stating that there was [...] "not enough" [...] information about Citron and that the film [...] "feels packed with events and frustratingly unfocused". Derakhshani argued that it [...] "has <b>some</b> <b>rough,</b> tedious patches– at 130 minutes, it's simply too long. And its reiteration of Hollywood cliches isn't always successful. Regardless, it is, along with Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, one of the most accomplished films {{to come out of the}} recent wave of neoclassic and revisionist WWII films".|$|E
