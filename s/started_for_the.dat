5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Rosický {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Czech Republic {{national}} side, replacing the retiring Pavel Nedvěd {{in advance of the}} UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying process. After a defeat to Germany during the campaign in March 2007, he was among a group of players fined 1 million koruna (£25,000) by the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) for his part in a party involving prostitutes, for which he later apologised in a press conference. His last appearance of the qualifying campaign was against Slovakia in November 2007. Rosický missed Euro 2008 due to injury, announcing his absence in May 2008. He returned to international football when he <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic on 9 September 2009, in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino, following a 20-month absence due to injury. The game finished 7–0 to the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1863, Longstreet {{suggested}} to Lee that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee, where Gen. Braxton Bragg was being challenged in Middle Tennessee by Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, Longstreet's roommate at West Point. It is possible that Longstreet believed that an independent command in the West offered better opportunities for advancement than a corps under Lee's shadow. Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps, but ordered them to Richmond, not Tennessee. Seaborne movements of the Union IX Corps potentially threatened vital ports on the mid-Atlantic coast. The division of George Pickett <b>started</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capital in mid-February, was followed by John Hood's, and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments of North Carolina and Southern Virginia.|$|E

50|$|Rhodes {{made his}} first <b>start</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Scots in the {{friendly}} against Australia at Easter Road.
