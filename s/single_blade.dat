5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 <b>single</b> <b>blade</b> classes to be separated in future events, as <b>single</b> <b>blade</b> runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a <b>single</b> <b>blade</b> of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

500|$|... "A <b>Single</b> <b>Blade</b> of Grass" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, calling it [...] "yet another adventure in weird, Native American mysticism from {{the folks at}} 1013 Productions". VanDerWerff felt that although the episode contained several plot holes, it worked with [...] "a kind of dream sense, following its own weird, nightmare logic". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5. Gibron found that the episode contained several overly-unbelievable moments but was overall [...] "another great episode, even with some rather minor flaws". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "A <b>Single</b> <b>Blade</b> of Grass" [...] one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode was [...] "tedious", citing a lack of any real action and a [...] "banal" [...] ending which he described as having been poorly foreshadowed. However, Shearman felt positively about the episode's attempt to {{stand on its own}} rather than imitating sister show The X-Files, which he saw several prior episodes as having done.|$|E
500|$|The Dorrigo waratah is a {{rainforest}} {{tree that}} reaches [...] high, with a non-buttressed trunk of [...] diameter at breast height (dbh). The bark is greyish brown {{and covered in}} many small pimples, rendering it sandpaper-like in texture. The green foliage consists of several distinct juvenile and adult leaf forms, which are arranged alternately along the stems. Juvenile leaves are light green and at first simple, with a <b>single</b> <b>blade.</b> Successive leaves on more mature plants become more complex, or , with deep lobes; these leaves are up to [...] long with 2–11 leaflets. Some adult leaves are simple—with a single lanceolate leaf blade—and up to [...] long; these are generally located near the flower heads. Among the green foliage there are occasional yellow leaves. New branchlets and leaves are covered in brown hair.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated several episodes across the season highly, {{awarding}} five stars out of five to [...] "The Curse of Frank Black", [...] "Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense", [...] "Midnight of the Century", [...] "A Room with No View", [...] "The Fourth Horseman" [...] and [...] "The Time Is Now". However, several episodes rated poorly, with [...] "Beware of the Dog", [...] "A <b>Single</b> <b>Blade</b> of Grass", [...] "The Hand of St. Sebastian", [...] "Roosters", [...] "In Arcadia Ego" [...] and [...] "Anamnesis" [...] being seen as particularly poor. In all, Shearman singled out the season's climactic two-part episodes [...] "The Fourth Horseman" [...] and [...] "The Time Is Now" [...] as {{the highlight of the}} season, finding that Morgan and Wong took a considerable risk with the storyline as they believed the series would be cancelled {{at the end of the}} season, but believing that the episodes gained from this additional level of attempted closure.|$|E

50|$|These are {{herbs and}} shrubs growing upright, {{sometimes}} with climbing stems, or spreading prostrate upon the ground. They have woody rhizomes. The leaves have <b>single</b> <b>blades</b> or are pinnate, {{divided into three}} leaflets. The plants sometimes produce their leaves after flowering. The flowers are solitary or in racemes of several. The flowers are white or purple, or occasionally yellow. The fruit is a flattened legume pod.|$|R
5000|$|Cores {{from which}} blades {{have been struck}} are called blade cores and the tools created from <b>single</b> <b>blades</b> are called blade tools. Small {{examples}} (under 12 mm) are called microblades and {{were used in the}} Mesolithic as elements of composite tools. Blades with one edge blunted by removal of tiny flakes are called backed blade. A blade core becomes an exhausted core when there are no more useful angles to knock off blades.|$|R

The cells are normally made from discarded cardboard or a <b>single</b> <b>blade</b> of coconut leaf bent several times inside the matchbox. Some trainers assemble a [...] "langsaranan" [...] where the spider is released to a plant enclosed by a net or a plastic bottle with tiny holes.|$|E
2500|$|Characteristic {{features}} of Ukiyo-e woodprints include their ordinary subject matter, the distinctive cropping of their compositions, bold and assertive outlines, absent or unusual perspective, flat regions of uniform colour, uniform lighting, absence of chiaroscuro, and {{their emphasis on}} decorative patterns. One {{or more of these}} features can be found in numbers of Vincent's paintings from his Antwerp period onwards. Van Gogh wrote, [...] "If we study Japanese art, we see a man who is undoubtedly wise, philosophical and intelligent, who spends his time… studying a <b>single</b> <b>blade</b> of grass. [...] But this blade of grass leads him to draw every plant, and then the seasons, the wide aspects of the countryside, then animals, then the human figure… isn't it almost a true religion which these simple Japanese teach us, who live in nature as though they themselves are flowers. [...] And you cannot study Japanese art, it seems to me, without becoming much gayer and happier." ...|$|E

25|$|Kayaks are {{generally}} differentiated from canoes by the sitting {{position of the}} paddler {{and the number of}} blades on the paddle. In a kayak the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double bladed paddle. In a canoe the paddler faces forward and sits or kneels in the boat, using a <b>single</b> <b>bladed</b> paddle. In some parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom, kayaks are considered a subtype of canoe. Continental European and British canoeing clubs and associations of the 19th Century used craft similar to kayaks, but referred to them as canoes.|$|R
