500|$|Ishii {{instructed}} Moore {{to include}} an emphasis on General MacArthur's spiritualism and faith in divine guidance. He told Moore to include three separate love stories in the film, [...] "one between two Americans, one between two Koreans, and one between an American and a Korean". Moore explained that [...] "the love stories were supposed {{to tell the story}} of the tragedy of Korea, the tragedy of the Korean War". Ishii stated to Moore that he did not wish for the movie to turn into an [...] "anti-Communist tract". Prior to the completion of the film's screenplay, the film's producers encountered difficulties obtaining an affiliation with a movie studio. Ishii said that North Korea placed pressure on Toho Studios through labor unions in Japan, requesting that the studio pull out of its affiliation with Inchon. The labor unions criticized the film's production, saying that it was influenced by Moon and his Unification Church, in addition to the Korean CIA and was part of an effort to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of South Korea. Because of this criticism, Toho Studios canceled its participation in the Inchon project.|$|E

2500|$|More than 100 people {{gathered}} at the Texas State Capitol in downtown Austin for the march, and a smaller group came to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> The demonstration was organized by Sharyn Richardson with assistance from Karan Barnett Shirk, and sponsored by Donna Howard, a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives, representing the 48th District. It was held one day after a pro-Trump rally at Wooldridge Square Park, called the [...] "1776 Freedom March". The impeachment march at the Capitol became tense, with heated exchanges and counter-protesters carrying bullhorn sirens. Counter-protestors were able to [...] "match the impeachment rally", according to KWQC-TV. Al Green, a U.S. Representative from Texas's 9th congressional district {{who was the first}} to call for Trump's impeachment back in May, was among the featured speakers.

2500|$|In March 2007 the CIA {{stationed}} Snowden with diplomatic {{cover in}} Geneva, Switzerland, {{where he was}} responsible for maintaining computer-network security. Assigned to the U.S. mission to the United Nations, Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment near Lake Geneva. According to Greenwald, while there Snowden was [...] "considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert" [...] in that country and [...] "was hand-picked by the CIA to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania". Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative, stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. Snowden said that when the latter was arrested, a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant. Ueli Maurer, President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, in June of that year publicly disputed Snowden's claims. [...] "This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it," [...] said Maurer. In February 2009 Snowden resigned from the CIA.|$|E

A medical practitioner who had failed to obtain the post of House Surgeon at the Hospital, owing to the <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had given to another competitor for the post, had alluded to him bitterly as a blatant ass; and a leading publican who had been fined before the magistrates for diluting his spirits, was in the habit of darkly uttering his opinion that Jerry Brander was a deep card and up to no good.|$|E
60|$|Gomez {{started when}} {{he was given the}} note, for Evelyn had made an {{unexpected}} move; but he saw the importance of what it implied and lighted a cigarette while he thought the matter out. He had suspected the Enchantress for some time and knew that Grahame was her owner. Since the yanqui was in communication with a dangerous revolutionist, he must be engaged in smuggling arms, and if he had landed many, the rebels would be ready to fight. For all that, Gomez was puzzled. Grahame was a friend of the señorita Cliffe's--perhaps even her lover--and he was helping the rebels, while her father had {{spent a good deal of}} money to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> This suggested that Cliffe might be playing a crooked game, and bore out some suspicions Gomez had entertained. The President must be informed at once; but in the meantime Gomez saw how the note could be made use of.|$|E
60|$|Judging {{from this}} announcement, the President seems {{prepared}} to condemn boldly all the rotten timbers {{of the social}} structure that have outlived their usefulness--a position that hitherto no responsible politician has dared to take. Politicians, on the contrary, have revered the dead wood, have sought to shore the old timbers for their own purposes. But so far as any party is concerned, Mr. Wilson stands alone. Both of the two great parties, the Republican and the Democratic, {{in order to make}} a show of keeping abreast of the times, have merely patched their platforms with the new ideas. The Socialist Party in the United States is relatively small, is divided against itself, and has given no evidence of a leadership of broad sanity and vision. It is fortunate we have been spared in this country the formation of a political labour party, because such a party would have been composed of manual workers alone, and hence would have tended further to develop economic class consciousness, to crystallize class antagonisms. Today, however, neither the Republican nor the Democratic party represents the great issue of the times; the cleavage between them is wholly artificial. The formation of a Liberal Party, with a platform avowedly based on modern social science, has become essential. Such a party, to be in harmony with our traditions and our creed, to arrest in our democracy the process of class stratification which threatens to destroy it, must not draw its members from the ranks of manual labour alone, but from all elements of our population. It should contain all the liberal professions, and clerks and shopkeepers, as well as manual workers; administrators, and even those employers who have become convinced that our present economic system does not suffice to meet the needs of the day. In short, membership in such a party, as far as possible, should not be based upon occupation or economic status, but on an honest difference of view from that of the conservative opposition. This would be a distinctly American solution. In order to form such a party a campaign of education will be necessary. For today Mr. Wilson's strength is derived from the independent vote representing the faith of the people as a whole; but the majority of those who <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> while they ardently desire the abolition in the world of absolute monarchy, of militarism and commercial imperialism, while they are anxious that this war shall expedite and not retard the social reforms in which they are interested, have as yet but a vague conception of the social order which these reforms imply.|$|E
