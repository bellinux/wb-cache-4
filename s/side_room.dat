5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, with a <b>side</b> <b>room</b> called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room {{was found for}} them. The front lodge led to a {{courtyard}} known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed {{by the sight of}} abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E

25|$|Minus the goats, Thor, Loki, {{and the two}} {{children}} continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in Jötunheimr. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a <b>side</b> <b>room,</b> they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building {{turns out to be}} the huge glove of Skrymir, who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.|$|E

50|$|The {{house was}} {{probably}} built by Isaac Davis sometime after {{he bought the}} land in 1716. Its oldest section is the chimney and right <b>side</b> <b>rooms,</b> with the left <b>side</b> <b>rooms</b> added not long afterward. The house exterior was refashioned in Federal style c. 1800, {{about the time the}} right-side addition was built. A later 18th-century resident was Benjamin Adams, a militia officer who served in the American Revolutionary War, and represented Rowley in the state legislature.|$|R
25|$|The {{basement}} proper was {{one hundred}} {{feet long and}} forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sized on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With {{the exception of the}} two rooms at the West end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each <b>side</b> <b>room</b> rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down {{to the center of the}} room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.|$|E
25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a <b>side</b> <b>room</b> to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E
25|$|In the {{southwest}} {{portion of the}} yard was a temple of the god Khaldi. The temple had a large oblong plan with a staircase {{that led to the}} roof of a ziggurat type tower and a <b>side</b> <b>room</b> on the lower floor. Surrounding the hall was a double-rowed twelve-column open portico with benches along the walls. An altar for sacrifices was located at the left wall. The walls were decorated with colorful frescoes depicting representations of human figures, gods, geometric and floral designs. One of the frescoes uncovered depicts the god Khaldi standing on a lion with a warder in his left hand and a horned crown upon his head. It is typical of other representations of Khaldi found at other sites. The floor of the temple contrasted greatly {{from the rest of the}} complex in that it had wood floors composed of small planks, compared to the clay-coated adobe floors that were faced with stone slabs found in the rest of the citadel's rooms.|$|E

2500|$|Taoist alchemical {{practice}} involves {{creation of}} an energy body by breathing meditations, drawing energy into a 'pearl' that is then [...] "circulated". [...] "Xiangzi ... with a drum as his pillow fell fast asleep, snoring and motionless. His primordial spirit, however, went straight into the banquet room and said, [...] "My lords, here I am again." ... When Tuizhi walked ... with the officials to take a look, there really was a Taoist sleeping {{on the ground and}} snoring like thunder. Yet inside, in the <b>side</b> <b>room,</b> there was another Taoist beating a fisher drum and singing Taoist songs. The officials all said, [...] "Although there are two different people, their faces and clothes are exactly alike. Clearly he is a divine immortal who can divide his body and appear in several places at once. ..." ... At that moment, the Taoist in the <b>side</b> <b>room</b> came walking out, and the Taoist sleeping on the ground woke up. The two merged into one." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Playboy Mansion" [...] {{starts out}} with mellow, kitsch guitar playing from Edge. Along with Mullen's drumming, there are breakbeats and hip-hop beats on the rhythm track, which were {{recorded}} as loops by Mullen. Howie described the loops thus; [...] "Larry went {{off into a}} <b>side</b> <b>room</b> and made some sample loops of him playing his kit, and gave the loops to me and Flood. It was {{the same with the}} guitars; there's a guitar riff which comes in the verse and chorus, which is a sample of Edge playing." [...] Bono's lyrics are a tongue-in-cheek account of pop culture icons.|$|E
2500|$|The Hotel Martinique was {{designed}} originally as an apartment house. Later, {{it was found}} that the needs of the location would be better suited for a hotel. This was done and still there was not room enough for the growing demand of the neighborhood. A first small expansion occurred 1901-03, followed by a larger one in 1907-11, which, with the exception of the small piece of property on the corner of 33rd Street and Broadway, gave the hotel a frontage of two streets and the Avenue with a concourse running through the hotel the entire length of Broadway between the two blocks. The 1910 addition included a continuation of the original hotel, situated on 33rd Street, which ran around a small plot of ground on which were low buildings and thence across to Broadway halfway down to 32nd Street. The new addition began where the old one left off and continued to 32nd Street, running for some distance down Thirty-second Street with the main entrance on that <b>side.</b> <b>Room</b> prices in 1910 ranged from US$3.50-$6.00 and up per day. The Omar Khayyam room served as the venue for the Gus Edwards Revue's [...] "1918 Version of a Night with Omar Khayyam", a twice-nightly performance.|$|E

2500|$|Xu Chu {{was known}} to be a {{cautious}} and serious person who did not talk much and was very mindful of rules and regulations. Once, Cao Cao's cousin Cao Ren came from Jing Province to meet Cao Cao – who had recently received the title of a vassal king, King of Wei (魏王), from Emperor Xian – in the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). Cao Cao was still in his personal chambers, with Xu Chu standing guard outside, when Cao Ren arrived. Cao Ren asked Xu Chu to join him in the <b>side</b> <b>room</b> for a chat. However, Xu Chu replied, [...] "The King is coming out soon." [...] He then entered Cao Cao's chambers. Cao Ren was very unhappy with Xu Chu. Later, someone told Xu Chu, [...] "The General (Cao Ren) is a close relative and important subject of the King. He lowered himself when he asked to chat with you. How could you reject him?" [...] Xu Chu responded, [...] "He may be a close relative and important subject of the King, but he's in charge of external defences at the borders. I, Xu Chu, am in charge of internal security. If he wanted to chat with me, we could do so in public. Why did he ask to chat with me in private?" [...] Cao Cao was impressed and he favoured Xu Chu even more after he heard about the incident, so he promoted him to Central Resolute General (中堅將軍).|$|E
2500|$|Empress Dowager Longyu {{endorsed}} the [...] "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" [...] (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Prime Minister Yuan Shikai (a {{general of the}} Beiyang Army) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. At the crucial meeting in the Forbidden City, Puyi watched the meeting between Longyu and Yuan, which he remembered as: [...] "The Dowager Empress {{was sitting on a}} kang [...] in a <b>side</b> <b>room</b> of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief while a fat old man [...] knelt on a red cushion before her, tears rolling down his face. I was sitting {{to the right of the}} Dowager and wondering why the two adults were crying. There was nobody in the room besides us three and it was very quiet; the fat man was sniffing while he talked and I could not understand what he was saying ... This was the occasion Yuan directly brought up the question of abdication". Under the [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication" [...] (清帝退位 優待條件), signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. This was similar to Italy's Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi himself was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic and continued to believe that he was the still the Emperor for sometime afterwards. In 1913, when the Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan Shikai arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afloat.|$|E

50|$|A Nightingale ward {{is a type}} of {{hospital}} ward, which contains one large room without subdivisions for patient occupancy. It may have <b>side</b> <b>rooms</b> for utilities and perhaps one or two <b>side</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{that can be used for}} patient occupancy when patient isolation or patient privacy is important. Nightingale wards contain about 24 to 34 beds usually arranged along the sides of the ward. Modern wards tend to separate patients into bays, each usually containing 4 to 6 beds. Observation of the patients by the nursing staff tends to be easier in a Nightingale ward than in bays. In one study, 75% of patients preferred being nursed in a bay rather than in a Nightingale ward.|$|R
50|$|The Hastings-Morse House is a {{historic}} First Period house at 595 E. Broadway in Haverhill, Massachusetts. The oldest portion of the 2.5 story wood frame house, its central chimney and right <b>side</b> <b>rooms,</b> were probably built c. 1706 {{by a man named}} Hastings. Left <b>side</b> <b>rooms</b> and a partial leanto section {{on the back of the}} house were added during the 18th century. The house underwent a major restoration in the late 1957, which included raising the roof on the leanto section. Another 20th century addition is the sunroom on the left (west) side of the house. Evidence of the building's First Period origins is still visible in the right front room.|$|R
