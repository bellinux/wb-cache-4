30|$|Vermilion is {{the only}} red pigment found in either painting. In The Blue Room, pure {{vermilion}} is used primarily as an accent in the <b>sofa,</b> <b>rug,</b> and flowers. It is also blended with zinc white in the pink tones of the bathing figure’s torso and May Milton’s skirt, rather than the more expected use of a lake pigment in these regions. RIS {{analysis was used to}} assign vermilion based upon spectra having a sharp transition edge at ~ 590  nm (Fig.  9).|$|E
50|$|The P. Luche {{apartment}} is the setting {{most of the}} time. It is an apartment in a tall building where its exterior appears in an animation piece. Inside, the <b>sofa</b> and <b>rug</b> are made of plush, and the home's walls are covered in brightly colored wallpaper.|$|R
6000|$|CANDIDA. Yes: he's {{struggling}} with my luggage, poor boy. Go out, dear, at once; or he {{will pay for}} the cab; and I don't want that. (Morell hurries out. Candida puts down her handbag; then takes off her mantle and bonnet and puts them on the <b>sofa</b> with the <b>rug,</b> chatting meanwhile.) Well, papa, how are you getting on at home? ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} ritual purity in Judaism a midras (lit. [...] "trampled on" [...] object) is a Hebrew {{term used to}} denote an object {{that can be a}} carrier of ritual impurity. Common objects that could {{potentially}} become unclean, and become a such midras object, include a chair, <b>sofa,</b> mattress, and <b>rug.</b> Once a person becomes unclean, he or she is categorized as a [...] "father of uncleanliness".|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} the boys {{said that they}} would go for a stroll, before lying down for the night. They were out upwards of an hour; and returned, {{at the end of that}} time, with serious but {{resolved}} faces. The colonel was out, when they returned; and found them stretched on the <b>sofa</b> and hearth <b>rug,</b> when he came in. They gave him a sleepy good night, and no other word was exchanged.|$|R
