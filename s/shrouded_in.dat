5|$|Even {{with the}} data {{provided}} by the Voyagers, Titan remained a body of mystery—a large satellite <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult. The mystery that had surrounded Titan since the 17th-century observations of Christiaan Huygens and Giovanni Cassini was revealed by a spacecraft named in their honor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from exile, Æthelbald of Mercia succeeded Coelred and afterwards endowed {{the church at}} Crowland. Ælfwald's friendly stance towards Æthelbald helped to maintain peaceful relations with his more powerful neighbour. The Life of Guthlac, which includes information about Æthelbald during his period of exile at Crowland, is dedicated to Ælfwald. Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign. He was a literate and devoutly Christian king: his letter written to Boniface in around 747 reveals his diplomatic skills and gives a rare glimpse {{into the life of}} a ruler who is otherwise <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Booth's {{body was}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> {{a blanket and}} tied {{to the side of}} an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for {{identification}} and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{mentioned}} that the first certain historical record dates from 1353 or 1357. However {{the presence of the}} Turin <b>Shroud</b> <b>in</b> Lirey, France, is only undoubtedly attested in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a memorandum to Antipope Clement VII, stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed. Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed {{in the small town of}} Lirey around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of a French Knight, Geoffroi de Charny, who died at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. However the correspondence of this <b>shroud</b> <b>in</b> Lirey with the <b>shroud</b> <b>in</b> Turin, and its origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors, with statements of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart. Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer.|$|R

50|$|From 2014 the {{sanctuary}} {{has had an}} exact replica of the Shroud of Turin, {{of which there are}} only two exact copies in Spain. This reproduction was donated by the Delegation in the Canary Islands of the Centro Español de Sindonología (Spanish Center Sindonology) and is {{the only one in the}} Canary Islands. It is currently the most accurate replica of the original. In 2000, the Shrine of the Cristo de La Laguna witnessed the first mass veneration of the <b>Shroud</b> <b>in</b> the Canary Islands, commemorating the exposition of the <b>Shroud</b> <b>in</b> Turin Cathedral on the occasion of the Jubilee Year.|$|R
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E
5|$|Russell {{was married}} to his college {{sweetheart}} Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children, namely daughter Karen Russell, the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced. In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968, but they divorced in 1980. The relationship was <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> controversy because Anstett was white. In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault; their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009. He has been a resident of Mercer Island, Washington for over four decades. His older brother was the noted playwright Charlie L. Russell.|$|E

5|$|The Wailers were {{scheduled}} to open 17 shows in the US for Sly and the Family Stone. After four shows, the band was fired because they were more popular than the acts they were opening for. The Wailers disbanded in 1974, {{with each of the}} three main members pursuing a solo career. The reason for the breakup is <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Wailer and Tosh simply preferred solo work.|$|E
5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
5|$|After the February 1917 {{revolution}} that toppled the Tsarist government, Mikoyan and other Bolsheviks fought against anti-Bolshevik {{elements in the}} Caucasus. Mikoyan became a commissar in the newly formed Red Army and continued to fight in Baku against anti-Bolshevik forces. He {{was wounded in the}} fighting and was noted for saving the life of fellow Party-member Sergo Ordzhonikidze. Afterwards, he continued his Party work, becoming one of the co-founders of the Baku Soviet, which lasted until 1918, when he and twenty-five other commissars fled Baku and were captured by the Transcaspian Government. Known as the Baku 26, all the commissars were executed with the sole exception of Mikoyan; the circumstances of his survival are <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> mystery. In February 1919 Mikoyan returned to Baku and resumed his activities there, helping to establish the Baku Bureau of the Caucasus Regional Committee (Kraikom).|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{regarding how}} Ray came into {{possession of the}} Gretzky T206 Wagner have been <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> mystery. He tried to avoid answering any questions regarding the matter but, in a 2001 interview, claimed to have received it from a relative, whose name he did not disclose. Inside the memorabilia community, there was speculation that the card had been cut from a printing sheet during the deal made with Mastro. Mastro has told colleagues in the memorabilia circuit that he purchased the card from a printer, which was not Ray's profession. Ray personally stated that Mastro might {{have been doing this}} to prevent others from trying to trace the card. Some also claim that Mastro bought the card from Sevchuk, not Ray.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The story of how the clan made its way to the mainland and settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> myth and magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for their cattle they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their perseverance and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E
5|$|A BBC {{documentary}} entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, {{aired in}} August 2004, investigated {{the taking of}} bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed {{it was possible to}} bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe) of breaking the bid rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement. The allegation was never fully explored. The Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> controversy. A prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{themselves}} T2 Productions, James and co-producers Stephanie Austin and B.J. Rack rented {{an office}} in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, before starting to assemble the crew for Terminator 2. Adam Greenberg, who worked on The Terminator and Ghost (1990), became director of photography, while Joseph Nemec III, {{who had worked with}} Cameron on The Abyss, was tasked with production design. The team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for the film's climax, eventually selecting a dormant mill in Fontana, California, after weeks of negotiations. Locating a potential Cyberdyne building was more difficult, as the site was to host numerous stunts, shootouts, and explosions. An industrial park in Fremont, California, was eventually rented {{for the duration of the}} film's production. Cameron and William Wisher completed the 140-page screenplay draft on May 10, 1990, and by July 15, the first shooting draft had been distributed to the cast and crew; particulars of the technically detailed scripts were <b>shrouded</b> <b>in</b> secrecy.
