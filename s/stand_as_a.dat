5|$|As a {{prominent}} {{member of his}} local community, Bruxner became involved in emerging movements to have a political force for regional areas and joined and was convinced by friends to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Progressive Party candidate in the 1920 New South Wales state election. Bruxner was elected under proportional representation with 23% as the second member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly district of Northern Tablelands alongside his friend David Drummond.|$|E
5|$|By 1996, various {{prominent}} {{public figures}} were arguing {{for the implementation}} of directly-elected mayors for large UK cities like London. The idea of a London mayor of a Greater London Authority had been included in Labour's 1997 election manifesto, and after their election a referendum was scheduled for May 1998, in which there was a 72% yes vote with a 34% turnout. With the first mayoral election scheduled for May 2000, in March 1998 Livingstone stated his intention to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential Labour candidate for the position.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the first}} Liverpool City Council {{election}} in which women <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> candidates : Miss Harriet Mary Johnson <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> independent in the Dingle ward and Miss Ellen Robinson <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Liberal in the West Derby ward.|$|R
50|$|Del Prado Chávez <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{candidate}} in several elections. In 1962 he <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> National Liberation Front (FLN) candidate. He was elected <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{member of the}} 1978 Constituent Assembly and again elected as senator in the 1980, 1985 and 1990 elections.

5|$|Following the {{formation}} of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government on 11 May 2010, Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Deputy Leader Harriet Harman took over as Acting Leader and became Leader of the Opposition. On 14 May, Miliband announced that he would <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candidate in the forthcoming leadership election. He launched his campaign during a speech given at a Fabian Society conference and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs. The other candidates were left-wing backbencher Diane Abbott, Shadow Education Secretary Ed Balls, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Miliband's elder brother, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Miliband.|$|E
5|$|Harding, as a {{politician}} respected by both Republicans and Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address. He urged delegates to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> united party. The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the November 1916 presidential election, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh was {{appointed}} High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1830. In 1831 {{he was invited}} to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Tory Party candidate for the constituency of Preston. He had similar views to Tory statesman Robert Peel and readily agreed to stand. Hesketh-Fleetwood opposed monopolies, slavery and capital punishment and was in favour of reforming the Corn Laws. At the 1832 general election, he was elected—along with his friend, Henry Stanley—Member of Parliament for Preston, in the first parliament following the Reform Act. He made his maiden speech to parliament in 1834.|$|E
50|$|At the 1935 General Election, {{just one}} {{candidate}} <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Independent Progressive, {{and that was}} Gerald Bailey at Aldershot. Bailey, <b>a</b> Quaker, had <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Liberal in 1929 and since 1930 had run the National Peace Council.|$|R
50|$|In the 2006 London {{borough council}} elections, Malvin Brown <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{candidate}} in the South Hornchurch ward and received 186 votes. He also <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candidate at a by-election in that ward on 3 July 2008 and received 17 votes.|$|R
50|$|Wingfield also <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Liberal {{candidate}} for public office. She <b>stood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{candidate for}} the London County Council.

5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he {{was purchased}} by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head against the wall of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
5|$|Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783, with Wilberforce a key {{supporter}} of his minority government. Despite their close friendship, {{there is no}} record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments. This may have been due to Wilberforce's wish to remain an independent MP. Alternatively, Wilberforce's frequent tardiness and disorganisation, as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible, may have convinced Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material. When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, Wilberforce decided to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election. On 6 April, he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|The West Stand, which {{initially}} had {{a capacity}} of 6,500, was built in 2001. A reception area, club offices, media centre, banqueting suites, hospitality area and changing rooms {{are located in the}} West Stand. The capacity of the West Stand was reduced slightly when the new East Stand was constructed in 2010, as the pitch was widened during this development. The East Stand, which is the newest part of the stadium, was built in 2010. It is the only stand that is not split into two tiers and has {{a capacity of}} 6,400. The decision to build the East <b>Stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single tier was taken to maintain the character of the old terrace, which had been a simple viewing area without many facilities.|$|E

5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar was not {{unaffected}} by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections {{in the months following}} the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.|$|E
5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in The <b>Stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the linchpin of existence—so he can claim it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand.|$|E

5|$|However, by {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{quarries}} slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries infilled, though the sandstone properties at St Alban's Place and Co-Operative Terrace <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reminder to Windy Nook's industrial history. The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady decline in population and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane, the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached Windy Nook, so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size. Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that Windy Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E
5|$|Marek Španěl, CEO of ARMA 2 {{developer}} Bohemia Interactive, {{said the}} mod was directly driving {{sales of the}} game and applauded it for an addictive and thrilling experience, saying that it could <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gaming experience on its own. The mod was also praised by video game developers not involved with the series. Kristoffer Touborg from CCP (EVE-Online) said it was the best game he has played in several months and called it particularly innovative given the first-person shooter genre, which he considered to be one of gaming's least innovative genres. Game designers Erik Wolpaw and Tim Schafer stated at PAX Prime 2012 that they believe that player-driven experiences such as DayZ are the future of gaming, commenting on what the title achieved without having a driving narrative.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe {{was greeted}} by a {{supportive}} crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage {{as it had in}} Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election {{on the basis of the}} country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.|$|E

5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E
5|$|While the {{election}} was being scheduled, the PPP completed five-year election term in March 2013, so the government {{was replaced by a}} caretaker prime minister and cabinet, in which Khar was not a member, until {{the election}} took place. This ended Khar's two year role as Foreign Minister. In April 2013, Khar announced that she was standing down at the next general election, so that her father, who had previously been ineligible to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> candidate, could succeed her. The condition requiring parliamentary candidates to hold a university degree, which had led to Khar replacing her father in 2002, had been lifted since the most recent general election. The PPP came second in the election, losing 74 seats; Khar's father was defeated in his bid to regain his former seat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the island}} village of Mandwa, the school teacher Dinanath Chauhan (Chetan Pandit) is highly {{respected}} by the villagers. The {{chief of the}} village, extremely jealous of Dinanath's popularity {{in the eyes of}} citizens, summons his evil son Kancha to destroy Dinanath's image in citizen's eyes. Kancha also has plans to start a drug cartel from Mandwa, knowing that the soil of Mandwa is rich for cultivation of cocaine. When Kancha requests the people to lend their lands to him under the pretext of expanding the salt industry of Mandwa, Dinanath dissuades the villagers from doing so. Knowing this, Kancha decides {{to get rid of the}} school teacher. He ambushes and murders a young girl inside the school, framing Chauhan for the murder. With the support of the villagers, Kancha then kills Chauhan by hanging him to death from a tree which is witnessed by young Vijay Chauhan (Arish Bhiwandiwala), the son of the teacher. Vijay Chauhan along with his pregnant mother Suhasini Chauhan (Zarina Wahab) leaves the village. Destitute, they find shelter in the city of Dongri,Mumbai but Vijay harbours intentions to go back to Mandwa and kill Kancha. While in Mumbai, Vijay's mother delivers a baby girl named Shiksha. Vijay is attracted to Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor), a local girl-trafficker and importantly an enemy of Kancha and wants to get into his company. He earns his favour by refusing to <b>stand</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> witness in court to a crime committed by Lala and joins his gang. Meanwhile, his mother along with his baby sister leave Vijay's side as he kills a corrupt cop at a young age and resorts to violence.|$|E
