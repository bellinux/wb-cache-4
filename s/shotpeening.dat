This investigation examines the respective effects of influencing parameters such as pressure, angle of impingement, nozzle distance and the exposure time in enhancing micro hardness, tensile strength and average surface roughness. Further, statistical analysis software such as MINITAB is used to predict the optimal process parameters for the responses such as tensile strength, hardness and impact strength {{on the basis of}} taguchi analysis.

Design improvements, supporting analyses, and test results of the SSME Phase II development program are presented. The HPFTP improvements include reduction of turbine operating temperature by 110 to 130 R by reconstructing the seals and the flow contours; modifications of the first- and second-stage turbine blades by recontouring the shank, <b>shotpeening</b> the shank surface, and applying a multilayered, plasma-spray coating to the shank on the downstream side to reduce {{the effect of the}} disk coolant; and reduction of the tendency for thermal cracks in the turbine by changing weld configuration to avoid the concentration of stresses in local areas.

40|$|The {{effects of}} shot peening on the {{critical}} stress for crack-healing of Si 3 N 4 /SiC composite ceramics were investigated. Shot peening was carried out on a Si 3 N 4 /SiC composite with a surface crack by using yttrium-stabilized zirconia beads. <b>Shotpeened</b> specimens were crack-healed at 1100 °C for 5 h under a tensile stress (?app) in the range 09 ̆ 6500 MPa. The results clearly showed that the surface cracks in <b>shotpeened</b> specimens were healed completely for ?app ? 450 MPa. Thus, the critical stress for crack-healing (?C app) {{was determined to be}} 450 MPa. This ?C app value was 2. 3 times that for an unpeened specimen. Furthermore, the ?C app values for both specimens showed a proportional relationship with the bending strength of the cracked specimen ?c (?C app ? 0. 64 ?c). Therefore, it can be concluded that the increase in ?C app of the peened specimen is due to the compressive residual stress and the consequently increase in ?c...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the study of a compressor disc made of α-β titanium alloy of a typical fighter aero-engine having a TBO (Time Between Overhaul) of 550 hours and TTL (total technical life) of 1500 hours. In general, the failure of most of compressor discs is attributed to low cycle fatigue (LCF) due {{to the presence of}} residual tensile stresses at the dovetail slots. In the present study, shot peening was carried out to introduce compressive residual stress at the dove tail slots in order to enhance fatigue life of the disc. The local stress at the longitudinal and transverse edge of the slot generally increases upto 450 MPa and 230 MPa, respectively, during service. In the present study, the introduced residual compressive stresses measured by XRD technique on the slot and face of the disc {{has been found to be}} of the order 650 MPa & 770 MPa, respectively. Stress controlled LCF tests (R= 0. 1, maximum stress = 85 % Yield Strength, frequency = 0. 33 Hz) have been conducted at room temperature. The LCF life of <b>shotpeened</b> disc was observed to be nearly three times as compared to that of unpeened disc. Following this surface treatment, life of the disc has been revised from 800 to 1500 hours, thereby eliminating the need of disc replacement at operating units. This has improved the reliability and serviceability of the fleet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the relationship between feedrate and fatigue life of Al 7075 -T 6 specimens before and after <b>shotpeening.</b> For this purpose, six groups of specimens, each of which consists of eight specimens, were first machined at six different feedrates (0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 15, 0. 20, 0. 25, 0. 30 mm/rev). Half of eight specimens in each group were then peened and the others remained un-peened. Next, the fatigue life was measured by using 4 -point rotary bending machine. One observation was that the fast the feedrate was, the large the mean diameter of a specimen was. To apply the same bending stresses in all cases, different loading conditions were thus recalculated and applied to specimens based on their mean diameters. Finally, the effect of feedrate on the fatigue life was estimated by comparing twelve sets of specimens (six groups times two sets, peened and un-peened) ...|$|E

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} {{have been}} built in steel or concrete. With steel, new design concepts are necessary as the water depths increase. The so called hybrid' design of tubular joints with cast steel inserts moves the fatigue critical welds away from a highly stressed region. The object of the present research project was an investigation of this design concept for higher strength steels and reduced wall thickness under offshore-typical corrosive and fatigue loading. Compared to previous investigations with StE 355 for the tubulars and GS - 8 Mn 7 for the cast insert (wall thickness 38 mm), this investigation employed the high- strength steel StE 500 for the tubulars and the new cast steel GS - 12 MnMo 7 4 (wall thickness 28 mm). Large scale hybrid tubular joints were fatigue-tested under constant and variable amplitudes in artificial seawater. The results were: Despite of the reduced wall thickness the fatigue life to crack initiation was increased {{by a factor of}} two. Supplimentary inves tigations of tubular joints without cast inserts showed, that TIG- dressing plus <b>shotpeening</b> of the welds result in improved safety against crack initiation, albeit at high cost. The results of the present investigation can be employed for the design of tubular joints, also for other geometries with the help of finite-element-models developed. Even for greater water depths the construction of offshore structures made of steel employing the hybrid design of higher strength materials remains a technical and economical alternative to concrete structures. This concept {{can also be used to}} advantage in other fields of engineering for example in mining construction, steel buildings, bridges and vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Life {{assessment}} {{is of great}} importance to component repair and replacement scheduling of turbine systems which experience cyclic start-up and shut-down operations during their service lives. As vital parts where a severe stress concentration exists, the fir tree blade-disc interfaces are typically shot-peened. Their fatigue resistance {{is considered to be}} improved subsequently due to the surface compressive residual stress (CRS) field and strain hardening resulting from shot peening. However, current life assessment models are relatively conservative, merely considering shot peening as an additional safety factor rather than taking account of the benefits derived from the process. The objective of this research is to develop a life assessment method considering the effects of shot peening in the component lifing protocols. Successful development of this approach will achieve a more cost effective scheduling of repair or replacement of the assets while ensuring sufficient safety margins. In this study, a low pressure steam turbine material, FV 448, has been selected. The shot peening induced residual stress profiles as well as their evolution during fatigue loading were measured using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. In the modelling work, a 3 D finite element (FE) modelling approach has been developed to predict the residual stress relaxation behaviour during fatigue loading. Both the CRS and the strain hardening fields arising from shot peening have been reconstructed in the FE model as pre-defined conditions: The reconstruction of residual stresses was realised by the inverse eigenstrain approach. In this study, the application of this approach has been extended from a flat surface to a notched geometry. The strain hardening field was reconstructed by modifying the material parameters at different depths based on the shot peening induced plastic strain distribution, which was evaluated utilising an approach based on previous measurement of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) local misorientations. By allowing for both beneficial effects of shot peening, the simulated quasi-static residual stress relaxation occurring during the first cycle correlated well with corresponding experimental data. The retention of the CRS field in the notched sample during fatigue loading has been highlighted. The application of total life approaches in predicting the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of the shot-peened specimens has been investigated. The Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) and the Fatemi-Socie (FS) critical plane fatigue criteria have been selected in the present study. The developed FE models incorporating shot peening effects have been used to generate the stress and strain data required by the SWT and FS criteria. A good agreement between experiments and predictions was obtained using this FE-based approach. In addition, the FE analysis shows that the degree of the shot peening benefit in improving fatigue life can be reasonably related to the degree of the reduction in the mean stress level within the shot peening affected layer. The application of a critical distance method considering the stress and strain hardening gradients near the <b>shotpeened</b> surface has been found to effectively increase the accuracy of the life prediction. Damage tolerant approaches have also been employed to assess the fatigue life of the shot-peened notched specimens by predicting the short crack growth behaviour through the shot peening affected layer. This analysis was carried out using both 2 D and 3 D FE models containing a crack emanating from the notch root. The FE models have been upgraded from the models used to study the residual stress relaxation behaviour. The crack driving force has been appropriately characterised using both linear-elastic and elasto-plastic fracture mechanics (LEFM and EPFM), allowing for the effects of shot peening. An accurate quantification of the retardation of the short crack growth behaviour resulting from shot peening has been subsequently realised. Additionally, the associated crack shape evolution has also been predicted using the developed FE model, which explains the experimentally observed significant differences in crack shape evolution between varying surface conditions. The importance of taking the crack shape effects into account when evaluating the short crack growth behaviour has been emphasised. Overall, a FE tool has been developed in this study which has been demonstrated to be effective in analysing the benefits of shot peening in improving fatigue life. It also helps unveil the mechanism behind this life improvement, which contributes {{to the development of a}} robust and convenient lifing method that can be applied to shot-peened components and can be used to guide shot peening optimisation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{this paper}} aims {{to present a}} simple method to {{synthesize}} an empirically-based model that permit to estimate the maximum displacement of a plate when a <b>shotpeening</b> process values are known. Design/methodology/approach: This approach regards the difficulty to develop a mathematical model to describe {{the relationship between the}} shot peening process variables (shot diameter, impact velocity, static preload and coverage) and the curvature of the piece. Such a model was generated through the application of statistical inference methods – multivariable regression and neural networks – to a set of experimental data concerning the application of peen forming processes to a group of 215 aluminium 7050 alloy rectangular plates. Findings: Although the estimated displacements from both models comply reasonably well with the experimental data, the obtained results exposed the superiority of the regressive model concerning accuracy. Research limitations/implications: Shot peen forming, a die less forming process, {{is one of the most}} successful methods to produce slight and smooth curvatures on large panels and plates. Through the application of a regulated blast of small round steel shot on the piece surface, a thin internal layer of residual compressive stress causes the elastic stretching of the shotted surface, giving rise to a permanent non-plastic deformation of the whole piece. Although this forming process has been used since the fifties, especially by the aerospatial industry, a scientific method for peen forming process planning has not been developed yet. Originality/value: The referred model can be used as an engineering tool to aid setting up a peen forming process in order to produce a desired curvature on a given plate...|$|E
40|$|The {{quest for}} energy {{efficiency}} {{leads to the}} development of highly efficient power transmissions for vehicles. Gears {{are some of the most}} rugged and durable torque transmitters among machine elements. Friction between sliding surfaces at gear teeth is one major source of power loss. To increase efficiency and reduce damage accumulation in gears has always been a background motivation to this thesis. It focuses on the frictional performance of manufactured gear surfaces with emphasis on the effect of surface topography and the orientation of its lay. To achieve the goal of this work, a test rig was designed and constructed. The rig makes it possible to examine gear tooth friction on double crowned rollers. Five alternative gear-finishing processes are implemented in roller surface preparation. They comprise grinding, <b>shotpeening,</b> phosphating, chemical deburring and DLC coating. Theoretically, a friction model is suggested which helps to explain some of the testing results. Advanced surface metrology techniques and statistical tools are implemented in identifying surface features that influence friction. The result demonstrates that surface topography is a significant factor affecting the lubricated frictional behaviour. For ground-finishing, the smoother the surfaces are finished, the lower friction coefficient they show. Chemical deburring and DLC coating as well as certain degrees of phosphating provide minimum friction coefficient and improved load carrying capacity, which are competitive to fine-ground finishing. Properly designed lay combinations of meshing gear surfaces can minimise friction and improve gear transmission efficiency. Theoretically, the friction coefficient can be explained by means of a combination of the slide-to-roll ratio and the real mean contact pressure within the range of loads considered in this thesis. Finally, features that correlate surface topography to friction are identified...|$|E
