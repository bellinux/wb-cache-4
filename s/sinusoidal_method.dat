With this characteristic, it can {{be modeled}} referring by sinusoidal form. By the sinusoidal model,signal can be quantized in order to encode the speech signal at the lower rate. The recent <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>method</b> isimplemented in speech coding. By using this method, a block of the speech signal with 20 ms to 30 ms width is codedbased on Fourier series coefficients. The new method proposed is quantization and reconstruction of speech signal bythe segmental sinusoidal model. A segment {{is defined as a}} block of the speech signal from certain peak to consecutivepeak. The length of the segment is variable, instead of the fixed block like the recent <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>method.</b> Coder consistsof the encoder and the decoder. Encoder works to code speech signal at variable rate. Then coded signal will betransmitted to receiver.

We developed a new method using non-invasive ultrasonography to measure soleus and gastrocnemius lateralis muscle atrophy in the hindlimb-unloaded rat, a well-Accepted model of muscle disuse. Soleus and gastrocnemius volumes were calculated using the conventional truncated-cone method and a newly-designed <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>method.</b> For Soleus muscle, the ultrasonographic volume determined in vivo with either method was linearly correlated to the volume determined ex-vivo from excised muscles as muscle weight-To-density ratio. For both soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, a strong linear correlation was obtained between the ultrasonographic volume and the muscle fiber cross-sectional area determined ex-vivo on muscle cryosections. Thus ultrasonography allowed the longitudinal in vivo evaluation of muscle atrophy progression during hindlimb unloading.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of fatigue crack growth due to turbulent mixing of {{hot and cold}} coolants presents significant challenges, in particular to determine the thermal loading spectrum and the associated crack growth. The <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>method</b> is a simplified approach for addressing this problem, in which the entire spectrum {{is replaced by a}} sine-wave variation of the temperature at the inner pipe surface. The loading frequency is taken as that which gives the shortest crack initiation and growth life. Such estimates are intended to be conservative but not un-realistic. Several practical issues which arise with this approach have been studied using newly-developed analytical solutions for the temperature and stress fields in hollow cylinders, in particular the assumptions made concerning the crack orientation, dimensions and aspect ratio. The application of the proposed method is illustrated for the pipe geometry and loadings conditions reported for the Civaux 1 case where through wall thermal fatigue cracks developed in a short time, but the problem is relevant also for fast reactor components.

The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) {{was used for the}} quantitative comparison of the temporal and the time-frequency representations of the original and the reconstructed signals. The matching pursuit method was found to be more suitable to the properties of both the transient heart sounds and the noise-like heart murmurs of the PCGs, therefore providing better analysis-synthesis results than the damped sinusoid model. It was applied to the transformations of the PCG signals, including time-scale expansion, frequency-scale expansion, and joint time-frequency expansion. A scaling/inverse-scaling process was set up for quantitative evaluation of the scaling performance. The spectrogram was used to calculate the NRMSE for the quantitative comparison of the PCG energy in the time-frequency domain, and both the spectrogram and the Wigner distribution were used for visual comparison. The results showed that the matching pursuit method is an effective technique for the time-frequency scaling transformations of PCGs, although its effectiveness is strongly related to the optimization of the parameters for the decomposition of the signals...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of direct numerical simulations of incompressible, homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic turbulence without a mean magnetic field, subject to different mechanical forcing functions {{commonly used in}} the literature. Specifically, the forces are negative damping (which uses the large-scale velocity field as a forcing function), a nonhelical random force, and a nonhelical static sinusoidal force (analogous to helical ABC forcing). The time evolution of the three ideal invariants (energy, magnetic helicity and cross helicity), the time-averaged energy spectra, the energy ratios and the dissipation ratios are examined. All three forcing functions produce qualitatively similar steady states {{with regards to the}} time evolution of the energy and magnetic helicity.

40|$|Excessive {{behaviour}} {{of vehicles}} {{is often the}} subject of study, motivated by either the development of active safety systems uch as ESP, or the improvement of vehicle performance such as for racecars. In all of these cases, combined slip {{needs to be taken}} into account. In many cases however, the full set of tyre characteristics is not available. Consequently, one needs to work with inaccurate combined slip properties based on estimated slip stifnesses and friction levels. It would be a great advantage if combined slip characteristics could be estimated accurately, especially for truck tyres and racecar tyres, where facilities are rare and testing is very expensive. For passenger cars and light van tyres, about 60 % of the testing effort is spent in combined slip. This means time and costs which could be saved by this accurate estimation. Moreover, apart from this reduction of the testing effort, the estimation could be a tool for assessment in testing tyres in combined slip leading to better quality tests results. Anyhow, it will permit to derive combined slip characteristics when no test-data are available. First, some fundamental aspects in tyre modelling are given with the MF-Tyre Model (Magic Formula) treated in detail. Combined slip as described by the MF-Tyre model is discussed with the characteristics derived and compared with different passenger car tyres. In parallel, combined slip is also studied from a more fundamental scope using the physical Brush Model, with special focus on the ratio between tyre forces under pure slip and combined slip conditions (the weighting functions). Various methods to derive these weighting functions based on pure slip characteristics without testing are treated. Among these, two methods lead to satisfactory results, the Slip Circle <b>Sinusoidal</b> <b>Method</b> (SCS) presented by Pottinger and especially the Practical Slip Similarity Method (PSS), derived and developed by the authors. Among others, these methods will be compared with the Magic Formula fits and the experimental results with observed deviations for the PSS-method in shear force with measurement results bounded by 5 % for large tyre load and less than 8 % for low tyre load. A comparision of the SCS-method and PSS-method with the MF-fits for large slip suggests improvements of the Magic Formula tyre model, Between the various estimations for the prediction of the combined slip based on pure slip characteristics, the Slip Circle Method and the Practical Slip Similarity Method, derived and developed by the authors will lead to a satisfactory prediction with respect to measurement data. In addition, estimated combined slip outside of the measurement range is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of fatigue crack growth due to cyclic thermal loads arising from turbulent mixing presents significant challenges, principally {{due to the}} difficulty of establishing the actual loading spectrum. So-called <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>methods</b> represents a simplified approach in which the entire spectrum is replaced by a sine-wave variation of the temperature at the inner pipe surface. The amplitude can be conservatively estimated from the nominal temperature difference between the two flows which are mixing; however a critical frequency value must be determined numerically so as to achieve a minimum predicted life. The need for multiple calculations in this process has lead to the development of analytical solutions for thermal stresses in a pipe subject to sinusoidal thermal loading, described in a companion report. Based on these stress distributions solutions, the present report presents a methodology for {{assessment of}} thermal fatigue crack growth life. The critical sine wave frequency is calculated for both axial and hoop stress components as the value that produces the maximum tensile stress component at the inner surface. Using these through-wall stress distributions, the corresponding stress intensity factors for a long axial crack and a fully circumferential crack are calculated for a range of crack depths using handbook K solutions. By substituting these in a Paris law and integrating, a conservative estimate of thermal fatigue crack growth life is obtained. The application of the method is described for the pipe geometry and loadings conditions reported for the Civaux 1 case. Additionally, finite element analyses were used to check the thermal stress profiles and the stress intensity factors derived from the analytical model. The resulting predictions of crack growth life are comparable with those reported in the literature from more detailed analyses and are lower bound, as would be expected given the conservative assumptions made in the model.

40|$|The current {{method for}} phonetic {{landmark}} detection in the Spoken Language Systems Group at MIT is performed by SUMMIT, a segment-based speech recognition system. Under noisy conditions the system's segmentation algorithm has difficulty distinguishing between noise and speech components and often produces a poor alignment of sounds. Noise robustness in SUMMIT {{can be improved}} using a full segmentation method, which allows landmarks at regularly spaced intervals. While this approach is computationally {{more expensive than the}} original segmentation method, it is more robust under noisy environments. In this thesis, we explore a landmark detection and segmentation algorithm using the McAulay-Quatieri Sinusoidal Model, in hopes of improving the performance of the recognizer in noisy conditions. We first discuss the sinusoidal model representation, in which rapid changes in spectral components are tracked using the concept of "birth" and "death" of underlying sinewaves. Next, we describe our method of landmark detection with respect to the behavior of sinewave tracks generated from this model. These landmarks are interconnected together to form a graph of hypothetical segments. (cont.) Finally, we experiment with different segmentation algorithms {{to reduce the size of}} the segment graph. We compare the performance of our approach with the full and original segmentation methods under different noise environments. The word error rate of original segmentation model degrades rapidly in the presence of noise, while the sinusoidal and full segmentation models degrade more gracefully. However, the full segmentation method has the largest computation time compared to original and <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>methods.</b> We find that our algorithm provides the best tradeoff between word accuracy and computation time of the three methods.
