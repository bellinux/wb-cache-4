The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many {{were killed by}} velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> {{the leader of the}} Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E

5|$|The new coins {{began to}} enter {{circulation}} in late 1965, and alleviated the shortages. They passed <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> their silver counterparts for a time, but the precious metal coins were hoarded beginning in 1967 as the Treasury ended {{its efforts to}} keep silver prices low. The act also banned the production of silver dollars until at least 1970.|$|E

5|$|Between 1880 and 1895 {{the city}} {{experienced}} a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> {{elected officials and}} the police to control elections, gambling, and bunco gangs. The city also experienced a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second-largest city west of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver's population.|$|E

A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping {{at each other and}} pecking. Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an interest in them.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiments}} with the 184-inch magnet {{led to the}} construction of a prototype calutron called the XA. It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security. Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley. The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection. The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering.|$|E
5|$|The smooth, dextrinoid spores are in {{side view}} {{triangular}} with a spurred base, in frontal view oblong, and typically measure 5–9 by 3–4μm. Staining with Cresyl blue shows them to be somewhat metachromatic, and binucleate. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are club-shaped to cylindric or sometimes spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem), and have dimensions of 20–44 by 6.5–13.5μm. Basidia are 18–30 by 5–8μm, mostly four-spored, and are absent on the gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The cap cuticle is a hymeniderm (lengthened cells arranged <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side)</b> <b>with</b> mostly colorless elements of different lengths, measuring 16–62 by 8–18μm. The stipitipellis (outer covering of the stem) comprises a layer of colorless hyphae measuring about 2–3μm wide. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of all parts of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> the greatest.|$|E

5|$|Within Singapore, the {{national}} flag {{takes precedence over}} all other flags, subject to international practice.

When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Jolin was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called Mot strömmen (Against the Tide). According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, densification, and centuries of eager renovation. Jolin wanted {{to bring out the}} beautiful and the genuine in the cityscape, as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory. According to Palmgren, perhaps it was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm. At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> Modernists, old with young, seasoned pursuers of the established view of the city and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin. By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the cityscape to other motifs such as chinoiserie settings, but in his youth, he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.|$|E
