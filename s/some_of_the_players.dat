5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored {{the custom of}} playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet among <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.|$|E
5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had their wages halved {{early on in}} the season, and by January 1886 the payments made to reserve players were withdrawn altogether, although there was a possibility of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> were suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated.|$|E
5|$|For the 1938 season, Constantine {{played for}} Rochdale in the Central Lancashire Cricket League, {{although}} {{he continued to}} live in Nelson. He received £812 for the season, and performed successfully, but did not enjoy the experience. The nature of the pitches was different in his new league; furthermore, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> seemed resentful of his high earnings. There was also an incident of racial abuse which Constantine believed the Central Lancashire League committee effectively covered up. This season ended Constantine's career in the Lancashire Leagues, although during the war he returned to play for Nelson as an amateur.|$|E

5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> The article interviewed players' parents {{who believe that the}} game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{successive}} championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined {{as their}} side aged. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott {{had been in}} the side since 1912. The club began the 1923–24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth place. They achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the offside rule in the 1925–26 season resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish.|$|E
5|$|In September and October 2008, by-elections in the Port Macquarie area at both {{federal and}} state level gave a new forum to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> in the controversy. When the member for the federal seat of Lyne, Mark Vaile, retired from {{politics}} on 30 July 2008, Oakeshott and Drew, the latter standing as the endorsed National Party candidate, emerged as the major candidates in the resulting by-election on 6 September. With the Glasshouse as a major issue, Oakeshott won 63.80% of the primary vote to Drew's 22.88%, with a further 10.07% coming to Oakeshott via preferences. In Oakeshott's old state seat of Port Macquarie, former Councillors Jamie Harrison and Lisa Intemann ran as independents, between them attracting 15.8% of the vote, whilst former Oakeshott staffer Peter Besseling {{went on to win}} the election against the endorsed National candidate.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Rink - A game of Hockey will {{be played}} at the Victoria Skating Rink this evening, between two nines chose from among the members.

Some fears have been expressed {{on the part of}} intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but we understand that the game {{will be played}} with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice.

5|$|The {{club was}} founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from George Salter's Spring Works in West Bromwich, in Staffordshire. They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, {{becoming}} {{the first team to}} adopt the Albion suffix; Albion was a district of West Bromwich where <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> lived or worked, close to what is today Greets Green. The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} the 1883–84 season. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in 1886 they reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. They reached the final again in 1887, but lost 2–0 to Aston Villa. In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites Preston North End 2–1 in the final. As FA Cup winners, they qualified to play in a Football World Championship game against Scottish Cup winners Renton, which ended in a 4–1 defeat.|$|E
5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> out by name.|$|E

25|$|Former player Eddie Hunter {{took charge}} and within two seasons, Queen's had been {{promoted}} as 1980–81 champions. The {{talent in the}} side was obvious. Derek Atkins was an ever-present in goal, John McGregor a high scoring defender and Jimmy Nicholson and Gerry McCoy netted a combined tally of 28 goals. Much of the side was inexperienced, with full-back Bobby Dickson {{one of the few}} who had been a mainstay in previous years. After a highly respectable finish of 8th the following season, Queen's finished bottom and were relegated in 1983. The main reason for this was the loss of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> who had won Queen's promotion.
