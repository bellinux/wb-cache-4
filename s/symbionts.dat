40|$|In {{parasitic}} associations, {{the evolutionary}} interest of a <b>symbiont</b> contradicts {{that of a}} host, which sometimes causes the phenomena so-called ‘parasite manipulation’ wherein <b>symbiont</b> infection alters host behaviour to facilitate its vertical/horizontal transmission. In mutualistic associations, meanwhile, symbiont-induced alteration of host behaviour that enhances its transmission has been little described. Here we report such a case in the stinkbug Megacopta punctatissima associated with an obligate gut bacterium. When female stinkbugs lay eggs, small particles called ‘symbiont capsules’ are deposited underside of the egg mass. Newborn nymphs immediately acquire the <b>symbiont</b> from the capsule, and then aggregate and become quiescent. By manipulating the levels of <b>symbiont</b> supply to newborn nymphs experimentally, we demonstrated that (i) experimental depletion of the <b>symbiont</b> resulted in the occurrence of wandering nymphs, (ii) the less <b>symbiont</b> supply, the more wandering nymphs, and (iii) almost all wandering nymphs were either symbiont-free or symbiont-depleted, whereas the majority of resting nymphs were infected with sufficient titres of the <b>symbiont.</b> These results strongly suggest that the nymphal behaviour is strongly influenced by the success/failure of the <b>symbiont</b> acquisition, thereby ensuring transmission of the essential <b>symbiont</b> and minimizing the energy and time spent for the activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{saw-toothed}} grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Silvanidae), is {{a cosmopolitan}} stored-product pest. Early studies on O.  surinamensis in the 1930 s described {{the presence of}} peculiar bacteriomes harboring endosymbiotic bacteria in the abdomen. Since then, however, the microbiological nature of the <b>symbiont</b> has been elusive. Here we investigated the endosymbiotic system of O.  surinamensis in detail. In the abdomen of adults, pupae, and larvae, four oval bacteriomes were consistently identified, whose cytoplasm was full of extremely elongated tubular bacterial cells several micrometers wide and several hundred micrometers long. Molecular phylogenetic analysis identified the <b>symbiont</b> {{as a member of}} the Bacteroidetes, in which the <b>symbiont</b> was the most closely related to the endosymbiont of a grain pest beetle, Rhyzopertha dominica (Bostrichidae). The <b>symbiont</b> was detected in developing embryos, corroborating vertical <b>symbiont</b> transmission through host generations. The <b>symbiont</b> gene showed AT-biased nucleotide composition and accelerated molecular evolution, plausibly reflecting degenerative evolution of the <b>symbiont</b> genome. When the <b>symbiont</b> infection was experimentally removed, the aposymbiotic insects grew and reproduced normally, but exhibited a slightly but significantly more reddish cuticle and lighter body mass. These results indicate that the <b>symbiont</b> of O.  surinamensis is not essential for the host’s growth and reproduction but contributes to the host’s cuticle formation. <b>Symbiont</b> genome sequencing and detailed comparison of fitness parameters between symbiotic and aposymbiotic insects under various environmental conditions will provide further insights into the <b>symbiont’s</b> biological roles for the stored-product pest...|$|R

5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate <b>symbionts</b> like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative <b>symbionts,</b> like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E

40|$|The broad-headed bug Riptortus clavatus (Heteroptera: Alydidae) {{possesses}} {{a number of}} crypts at a posterior midgut region, which house a dense population of a bacterial <b>symbiont</b> belonging to the genus Burkholderia. Although the <b>symbiont</b> is highly prevalent (95 to 100 %) in the host populations, the <b>symbiont</b> phylogeny did not reflect the host systematics at all. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms underlying the promiscuous host-symbiont relationship despite the specific and prevalent association, we investigated the transmission mode and the fitness effects of the Burkholderia <b>symbiont</b> in R. clavatus. Inspection of eggs and a series of rearing experiments revealed that the <b>symbiont</b> is not vertically transmitted but is environmentally acquired by nymphal insects. The Burkholderia <b>symbiont</b> was present in the soil of the insect habitat, and a culture strain of the <b>symbiont</b> was successfully isolated from the insect midgut. Rearing experiments by using sterilized soybean bottles demonstrated that the cultured <b>symbiont</b> is able to establish a normal and efficient infection in the host insect, and the <b>symbiont</b> infection significantly improves the host fitness. These results indicated that R. clavatus postnatally acquires <b>symbiont</b> of a beneficial nature from the environment every generation, uncovering a previously unknown pathway through which a highly specific insect-microbe association is maintained. We suggest that the stinkbug-Burkholderia relationship may be regarded as an insect analogue of the well-known symbioses between plants and soil-associated microbes, such as legume-Rhizobium and alder-Frankia relationships, and we discuss the evolutionary relevance of the mutualistic but promiscuous insect-microbe association...|$|R
40|$|A {{monophyletic}} {{group of}} freshwater and brackish ciliate species {{belonging to the}} genus Euplotes is known to harbor bacterial endosymbionts of the class Betaproteobacteria permanently in the natural environment. One or other of 2 different species of bacteria {{have been shown to}} be present: the obligate <b>symbiont</b> Polynucleobacter necessarius or a recently described betaproteobacterium. While the association between P. necessarius and its Euplotes hosts has been well studied in the past, knowledge about the relationship between the newly discovered <b>symbiont</b> and its Euplotes hosts is still very poor. Here we present the SSUrRNA gene characterization of both host and <b>symbiont</b> for an additional brackish-water population of Euplotes hosting the newly discovered <b>symbiont.</b> We also provide the <b>symbiont</b> genome size determination and ultrastructural description. Attempts to cultivate the new <b>symbiont</b> outside its host, using many different methods, failed. This result indicates that, as in the case of the symbiotic P. necessarius, we are probably dealing with an obligate <b>symbiont,</b> unable to grow outside the cytoplasm of its natural host. On the basis of the results obtained we propose the new <b>symbiont</b> as a candidate new species with the name of ‘Candidatus Protistobacter heckmanni’, according to the current rules of prokaryotic nomenclature...|$|R

5|$|The {{similarity}} of these <b>symbionts</b> in the genus Cryptocercus {{to those in}} termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be {{more closely related to}} termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach. It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its <b>symbionts,</b> or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re-examined.|$|E

The <b>symbionts</b> live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn <b>symbionts</b> have previously been married to each other.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae.

40|$|This study {{quantified}} {{variation in}} net photosynthetic carbon gain {{in response to}} natural fluctuations in <b>symbiont</b> density for the Mediterranean coral Cladocora caespitosa, and evaluated which density maximized photosynthetic carbon acquisition. To do this, carbon acquisition was modeled as an explicit function of <b>symbiont</b> density. The model was parameterized using measurements of rates of photosynthesis and respiration for small colonies with {{a broad range of}} zooxanthella concentrations. Results demonstrate that rates of net photosynthesis increase asymptotically with <b>symbiont</b> density, whereas rates of respiration increase linearly. In combination, these functional responses meant that colony energy acquisition decreased at both low and at very high zooxanthella densities. However, there was a wide range of <b>symbiont</b> densities for which net daily photosynthesis was approximately equivalent. Therefore, significant changes in <b>symbiont</b> density do not necessarily cause a change in autotrophic energy acquisition by the colony. Model estimates of the optimal range of cell densities corresponded well with independent observations of <b>symbiont</b> concentrations obtained from field and laboratory studies of healthy colonies. Overall, this study demonstrates that the seasonal fluctuations, in <b>symbiont</b> numbers observed in healthy colonies of the Mediterranean coral investigated, do not have a strong effect on photosynthetic energy acquisition...|$|R
40|$|We {{applied a}} multivariate {{analysis}} {{to investigate the}} roles of host and <b>symbiont</b> on the in situ physiological response of genus Madracis holobionts towards light. Across a large depth gradient (5 - 40 m) and for four Madracis species and three <b>symbiont</b> genotypes, we assessed several variables by measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigment composition, or <b>symbiont</b> population descriptors. Most of the variation is explained by two major photobiological components: light-use efficiency and <b>symbiont</b> cell densities. Two other minor components emphasize photoprotective pathways and light-harvesting properties such as secondary pigments. Statistics highlight the role of irradiance on coral physiology and reveal mechanisms that are either genetically constrained, such as <b>symbiont</b> cell sizes, or environmentally dependent, such as photochemical efficiencies. Other parameters, such as cellular light-harvesting and photoprotective pigment concentrations, are regulated by host, <b>symbiont,</b> and environment. The interaction between host and environment stresses the role of host properties in adjusting the internal environment available for the endosymbionts. Different holobiont strategies, relating to <b>symbiont</b> cell density, vary in their physiological optimization of light-harvesting or photoprotective mechanisms and link to host-species distribution and dominance over the reef slope. <b>Symbiont</b> functional diversity {{appears to have a}} significant role but does not explain host vertical distribution patterns per se, highlighting the importance of species-specific morphological and physiological properties of the coral host...|$|R

5|$|The polyps of {{stony corals}} have {{six-fold}} symmetry while those of soft corals have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In stony corals these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules.

In most corals, the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both stony and soft corals can be zooxanthellate, the corals supplementing their plankton diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these <b>symbionts.</b> The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and <b>symbionts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Interspecific genetic {{interactions}} in host-symbiont systems raise intriguing coevolutionary questions and {{may influence the}} effectiveness {{of public health and}} management policies. Here we present an analytical and numerical investigation of the effects of host genetic heterogeneity in the rate of vertical transmission of a <b>symbiont.</b> We consider the baseline case with a monomorphic <b>symbiont</b> and a single diallelic locus in its diploid host, where vertical transmission is the sole force. Our analysis introduces interspecific disequilibria to quantify nonrandom associations between host genotypes and alleles and <b>symbiont</b> presence/absence. The transient and equilibrium behavior is examined in simulations with randomly generated initial conditions and transmission parameters. Compared to the case where vertical transmission rates are uniform across host genotypes, differential transmission (i) increases average <b>symbiont</b> survival from 50 % to almost 60 %, (ii) dramatically reduces the minimum average transmission rate for <b>symbiont</b> survival from 0. 5 to 0. 008, and (iii) readily creates permanent host-symbiont disequilibria de novo, whereas uniform transmission can neither create nor maintain such associations. On average, heterozygotes are slightly more likely to carry and maintain the <b>symbiont</b> in the population and are more randomly associated with the <b>symbiont.</b> Results show that simple evolutionary forces can create substantial nonrandom associations between two species...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop and {{investigate}} a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model describing the syntrophic symbiotic {{relationship between a}} heterotrophic host and an internal photoautotrophic <b>symbiont.</b> The model specifies the flows of matter and energy among host, <b>symbiont</b> and environment with minimal complexity and uses the concept of synthesizing units to describe smoothly the assimilation of multiple limiting factors, in particular inorganic carbon and nitrogen, and irradiance. The model has two passive regulation mechanisms: the <b>symbiont</b> shares only photosynthate that it cannot use itself, and the host delivers only excess nutrients to the <b>symbiont.</b> With parameter values plausible for scleractinian corals, we show that these two regulation mechanisms suffice to obtain a stable symbiotic relationship under constant ambient conditions, provided those conditions support sustenance of host and <b>symbiont.</b> Furthermore, the <b>symbiont</b> density in the host varies relatively little {{as a function of}} ambient food density, inorganic nitrogen and irradiance. This <b>symbiont</b> density tends to increase with light deprivation or nitrogen enrichment, either directly or via food. We also investigate the relative benefit each partner derives from the relationship and conclude that this relationship may shift from mutualism to parasitism as environmental conditions change. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef.

This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E

The {{brown marmorated stink bug}}, Halyomorpha halys Stål, harbors a <b>symbiont,</b> Pantoea carbekii, within the fourth region of the midgut in specialized crypts. In this dissertation, I explored this insect- microbe relationship. I determined that the brown marmorated stink bug is heavily reliant on its <b>symbiont,</b> and that experimental removal of the <b>symbiont</b> from the egg mass surface prior to nymphal acquisition led to lower survival, longer development, lower fecundity, and aberrant nymphal behavior. Additionally, I determined that even when the <b>symbiont</b> is acquired and housed in the midgut crypts, it is susceptible to stressors. Stink bugs reared at a higher temperature showed lower survival, longer development, and a cease in egg mass production, and when bugs were screened for their <b>symbiont,</b> fewer had successfully retained it while under heat stress. Finally, with the knowledge that the stink bug suffers decreases in fitness when its <b>symbiont</b> is missing or stressed, I wanted to determine if targeting the <b>symbiont</b> was a possible management technique for the stink bug. I tested the efficacy of a number of different insecticidal and antimicrobial products to determine whether prevention of <b>symbiont</b> acquisition from the egg mass was possible, and results indicated that transmission of the <b>symbiont</b> from the egg mass to the newly hatched nymph was negatively impacted when certain products were applied (namely surfactants or products containing surfactants). Additionally, direct effects on hatch rate and survival were reported for certain products, namely the insect growth regulator azadirachtin, which suggests that nymphs can pick up residues from the egg mass surface while probing for the <b>symbiont.</b> I conclude that P. carbekii plays a critically important role in the survival of its host, the brown marmorated stink bug, and its presence on the egg mass surface before nymphal hatch makes it targetable as a potential management technique...|$|R
