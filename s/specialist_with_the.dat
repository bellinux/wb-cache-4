500|$|When British {{scientists}} in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys {{in the early}} 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested {{the presence of a}} liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing <b>specialist</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array {{toward the center of the}} Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys, but these new data were not published in the Journal of Glaciology until 1993. Space-based radar revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and space-based radar altimetry. It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than [...] ice cap. The lake has at least 22 cavities of liquid water, averaging [...] each.|$|E
500|$|When first approved, the {{extension}} of I-70 from Denver to Cove Fort was criticized in some area newspapers as a road to nowhere; an information liaison <b>specialist</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Department of Transportation in Baltimore, Maryland—the eastern terminus of I-70—claims people have asked [...] "did we think Baltimoreans were so desperate to get to Cove Fort that we {{were willing to pay}} $4 billion to get them there?" [...] However, a resident engineer with the USDOT has called {{the extension}} one of the [...] "crown jewels" [...] of the Interstate Highway System.
