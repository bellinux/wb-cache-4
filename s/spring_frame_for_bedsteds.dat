40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a micro-mirror assembly, comprising a mirror plate (2) fastened to a substrate {{by means of}} spring elements, wherein a drive unit (9, 10) {{is associated with the}} mirror plate, which drive unit is designed to drive the mirror plate about at least one axis such that the mirror plate oscillates about said axis. The spring elements are designed as a plurality of <b>spring</b> ring <b>frames</b> (3) that surround the mirror plate (2) substantially in the mirror plate plane of the mirror plate, wherein the innermost <b>spring</b> ring <b>frame</b> (3) adjacent to the mirror plate (2) is connected to the mirror plate (2) at two opposite connection points (4), the <b>spring</b> ring <b>frames</b> are connected among each other at two opposite connection points (7, 8, 13) in each case, and the outermost <b>spring</b> ring <b>frame</b> (3) adjacent to the substrate (4) is connected to the substrate (4) at two opposite connection points (6, 12).
