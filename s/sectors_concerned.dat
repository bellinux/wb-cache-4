50|$|Finally, {{there was}} a Consultative Committee (what is now the Economic and Social Committee) which had between 30 and 50 members, equally divided between producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers in the coal and steel sector. This grouping provided a chamber of professional associations for civil society and was in permanent dialogue with the High Authority on policy and proposals for legislation. Its Opinions were necessary before such action could take place. The threefold division of its members prevented any one group, whether business, labour or consumers, from dominating proceedings, as majority voting was required. Its existence curtailed the activity of lobbyists acting to influence governments on such policy. The Consultative Committee had an important action in controlling the budget and expenditures, drawn from the first European tax on coal and steel producers. The Community money was spent on re-employment and social housing activities within the <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned.</b>|$|E

40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the eighties wage {{inflation}} has slowed down in Austria. The wage setting process during this period was heavily influenced by economic factors that affected only some enterprises or sectors. In contrast to other countries the wage leadership of the <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned</b> (nationalized industries, public sector) was so strong that the difficulties they experienced (or {{in the case of the}} public sector the attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit) also dampened wage growth in other sectors. A comparison of the increase in contractual wages and in earning across some major industries reveals that this pressure on wages was transmitted to other sectors in an even intensified form. Thus, wage differentials between industries have risen rather than narrowed. Die Verlangsamung der Lohninflation seit 1985; The Slowdown in Wage Inflation since 1985...|$|E
30|$|The second tool is {{a context}} assessment. While {{it is not}} {{explicitly}} intended to identify risks, it can nevertheless contribute to their identification. During this study, SNCF Réseau carried out a territorial analysis {{to better understand the}} socio-economic context and the players in the <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned</b> by the rail route. This analysis particularly consists in listing the concerned players (associations, elected representatives, etc.) and their positions with regards the project. This diagnostic makes it possible to identify potential blockages in the decision-making process that could subsequently generate a risk of controversy around the project, its territorial impacts or risk of delay. The client then tries to optimise its infrastructure project by integrating demands or explaining to residents why these cannot be taken into account. This approach can increase the acceptability of the project by local residents.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the presence of}} sectoral convergence of labor productivity between 14 OECD countries. Using the OECD International Sectoral Data Base (ISDB), the paper looks at the developments within 12 distinct sectors during the period 1970 - 1995. The change of the coefficients of variance {{suggests that there is}} strong sectoral convergence within most service sectors while the evidence of convergence for Manufacturing as well as for Communication is rather weak. These findings are in line with most studies undertaken on this subject so far. It is concluded that economic theories at hand to explain growth and convergence (or divergence respectively) are of different importance for the <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned.</b> While models of the New Growth Theory seemed to be useful to explain growth mechanisms within Manufacturing and Communication, traditional models seemed to apply to most other sectors. ...|$|E

The idea of traffic management was raised by an increased number of visitors especially during the high tourist season. The management includes public and forest roads with special emphasis on ownership issues. The strategy foresees two-step management regulation of transport – parking and soft approach – informing. The strategy proposes the regulation of parking lots in the valley and on the plateau of Pokljuka, introducing alternative public transport, fees, providing wider tourist offer on the plateau and providing visitors with information about the natural environment, protected natural and forest areas, national park itself, code of behaviour in the natural environment, etc. The proposed traffic management strategy should be accepted by all <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned</b> in the studied area...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the importance of}} IPRs and examines the factors hindering and those contributing toward enhancing IPRs in Sudan. We find that the inadequacy of IPRs protection in Sudan is attributed to low integration in the international institutions, lack of legal issues, lack of government concern, lack of private <b>sector</b> <b>concern,</b> weak institutions setting, lack of public awareness, lack of resources, weak culture for IPRs, lack of cooperation between universities and industry and lack of coordination. The inadequate IPRs protection in Sudan leads to poor national system of innovation, hindering FDI and hindering transfer of technology. The factors contributing toward enhancing IPRs in Sudan include promotion of adequate IPRs legislations and enforcement; planning, commitment to international IPRs agreements; finance, investment and resources; social partnership to encourage IPRs protection, government <b>concern,</b> private <b>sector</b> <b>concern,</b> public awareness, cooperation between universities and industry, institutions setting, coordination and culture for IPRs protection...|$|R

This paper - based on a large recent report - shows that such a large reduction is technically not only feasible in Germany that there are also a variety of political measures at hand to realise climate protection targets. However, policy should not just rely on very few measures and sectors, as this would lead in the <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned</b> to hardly acceptable interference but on well constructed and targeted bundels of measures covering all sectors. To achieve this target, the initiation of structures for incentives, in particular based on economic leverages - is, in a first place, the task of the political decision makers at all levels...|$|E
40|$|Carey and Friel {{suggest that}} we turn to {{knowledge}} developed {{in the field of}} public administration, especially new public governance, to better understand the process of implementing health in all policies (HiAP). In this commentary, I claim that theories from the policy studies bring a broader view of the policy process, complementary to that of new public governance. Drawing on the policy studies, I argue that time and ideas matter to HiAP implementation, alongside with interests and institutions. Implementing HiAP is a complex process considering that it requires the involvement and coordination of several policy sectors, each with their own interests, institutions and ideas about the policy. Understanding who are the actors involved from the various policy <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned,</b> what context they evolve in, but also how they own and frame the policy problem (ideas), and how this has changed over time, is crucial for those involved in HiAP implementation so that they can relate to and work together with actors from other policy sectors...|$|E
40|$|The actors {{of economy}} and {{politics}} {{all over the}} world have long debated about the effect private equity investments make on economy. The debate focuses on the effect of a narrow group of private equity investments, namely, Leveraged Buyouts (LBO), while nobody questions the positive impact of venture capital investments in the early phase of the development of companies. Amidst the crisis, the question raised has a particular edge to it: is private equity indeed such an ownership model that is able to induce the permanent improvement of the companies purchased, or is it only simple financial engineering, which takes advantage of the tax allowances and merely rearranges incomes. All in all, research did not confirm that private equity investors cash in on huge yields through ripping off the portfolio companies. Nor do they prove that the buyouts {{have a negative effect on}} the growth or competitiveness of the <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned,</b> or that they would make the financial and economic systems unstable...|$|E
