2500|$|Ballast {{was also}} a {{component}} used in early model automobiles engine [...] that lowered the supply voltage to the ignition system after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires {{a significant amount of}} electrical current from the battery, resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to <b>start,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.|$|E
50|$|The term also {{referred}} to a (now obsolete) automobile engine component that lowered the supply voltage to the ignition system after the engine had been started. Because cranking the engine causes a very heavy load on the battery, the system voltage can drop quite low during cranking. To allow the engine to <b>start,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once cranking is finished, the normal operating voltage would overload the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system.|$|E
50|$|At <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> {{point is}} 10° BTDC. To {{facilitate}} start when coolant temperature is below 0°C the ECU will ground each trigger line 210 times/second between 10° BTDC and 20° ATDC, {{at which a}} “multi spark” will appear. The function is active up to an engine speed of 900 RPM. At idle a special ignition matrix is utilised. Normal ignition point is 6°-8° BTDC. If the engine stalls e.g. cooling fan activation the ignition point is advanced up to 20 ° BTDC {{in order to increase}} the engines torque to restore the idle RPM. In the same way the ignition is retarded if the engines RPM is increased. When the TPS senses an increase in throttle opening the ECU leaves the idle ignition timing map and regulates the ignition timing in respect of load and engine speed.|$|E

Fuel injector is situated such that {{a part of the}} spray impinges head on this surface. Thus ignition is started.

50|$|A car key or an {{automobile}} key {{is a key}} used to open and/or start {{an automobile}}. Modern key designs are usually symmetrical, and some use grooves on both sides, rather than a cut edge, to actuate the lock. It has multiple uses for the automobile with which it was sold. A car key can open the doors, as well as <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition,</b> open the glove compartment and also open the trunk (boot) of the car. Some cars come with an additional key known as a valet key that starts the ignition and opens the driver's side door, but prevents the valet from gaining access to valuables that {{are located in the}} trunk or the glove box. Some valet keys, particularly those to high-performance vehicles, {{go so far as to}} restrict the engine's power output to prevent joyriding. Recently, features such as coded immobilizers have been implemented in newer vehicles. More sophisticated systems make ignition dependent on electronic devices, rather than the mechanical keyswitch. A number of these systems, such as KeeLoq and Megamos Crypto have been demonstrated to be weak and vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks.|$|E

Further use and distribution of this paper requires permission from SAE International. Engines with controlled auto-ignition (CAI) combustion offer a number of benefits over conventional spark ignited (SI) and compression ignited (CI) engines, such as much lower NOx emission due to its relatively low combustion temperature, negligible cycle-to-cycle variation due to its self-ignition nature, higher combustion efficiency at part load than its SI counterpart, and low soot emissions since a homogeneous lean air/fuel mixture is being employed. Unlike conventional SI and CI engines, where combustion is directly controlled by the engine management system, the combustion in CAI engines is controlled by chemical kinetics only. Over the past two decades, a number of technologies {{have been developed to}} initiate such combustion on both 2 and 4 -stroke engines with various fuels, but none of them could maintain the combustion over the wide engine operation range. Remaining problems include control of ignition timing and the heat release rate over the entire engine operation range. This paper reviews some of the engine research results and available data from combustion kinetics studies. It has been observed that the quality of engine charge affects both ignition timing and the heat release rate of CAI combustion, but a certain charge temperature is essential to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> of CAI combustion...|$|E
40|$|Two novel zero-current-switching dc-to-ac inverters: Class-L and Class-M {{resonant}} inverters are presented. They {{are especially}} suitable for high voltage applications {{because of their}} parallel resonant nature. Lamps, particularly fluorescent lamps in the lighting industry, possess a negative impedance feature and require high voltage to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> process, require operating circuits tailored to meet their characteristics. The two inverters are well-suited in these applications. A detailed analysis, systematic design procedure and experimental verification of the two inverters are given. A Fundamental component analysis in the Fourier series expansion is applied {{for the analysis of}} the circuits. Steady state characteristics of the inverters, analytically described by the relationship between the output current and voltage are also graphically represented. This provides insight into the characteristics and design of the inverters. The techniques are extended and applied to analyze the zero-voltage-switching Class-D and Class-E resonant inverters. These four inverters form a family of dc-to-ac resonant inverters in terms of input sources and output characteristics. A unique design procedure is also discussed which is made possible from the construction of constant-gain trajectories in the conductance (impedance) plane, where the conductance (impedance) consists of the resonant tank circuit and the load for a given operating frequency. One of the applications of the dc-to-ac inverters is dc-to-dc converter. The Class-D dc-to-dc converters are illustrated as examples. The analytic techniques are also applied to the analysis of the dc-to-dc converters. The flow of the analysis starts with the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) dc-to-ac inverter and moves to the ZVS dc-to-dc converters, then the ZVS dc-to-dc converters regulated at fixed switching frequency are analyzed, and finally the ZVS dc-to-dc converter is regulated at a fixed switching frequency with a shunt inductor which operates over a wide range of load. A detailed analysis and design procedure for the ZVS Class-D dc-to-dc converter is discussed. An experimental verification of a 1 -MHz ZVS Class-D converter is presented. Good agreement is obtained between experimental and theoretical results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the present study is to explore and {{validate}} the efficiency and accuracy of the predictive capability of CFD models for fully developed natural fires in large compartments. The FDS CFD software was used to simulate three large-scale fire tests. The fire tests (nine in total) had been carried out in 1993 at Cardington UK, in collaboration with BRE/FRS and CORUS (British Steel at that time). The main parameters of the three chosen large-scale fire tests are the compartment's dimensions, the fire load, the ventilation opening, and <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> type. <b>The</b> duration of <b>the</b> fire tests, <b>starting</b> from <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> until <b>the</b> extinction of the fire, was between 70 - 120 min and the fire source was wooden cribs. The simulations were in full time and full scale. The FDS model solves numerically the well known Navier-Stokes equations with emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires. It uses a mixture fraction combustion model assuming that combustion is mixing controlled, and that the reaction of fuel and oxygen is infinitely fast. Turbulence is treated by means of the Smagorinsky form of Large Eddy Simulation, while thermal radiation is computed using a finite volume technique. Despite the assumptions made and the complex phenomena involved, the correlation between the computational and experimental results was in very good agreement. The fire spread was modelled accurately and the difference for the peak temperatures was 5 %- 20 %. However the results are sensitive to some input parameters and so each fire scenario should be treated individually for a robust and accurate solution...|$|R
