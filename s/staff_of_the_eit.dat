40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} and significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Institute <b>of</b> Technology (<b>EIT)</b> in <b>the</b> period since 2005 when the European Union launched a suite of initiatives for higher education, research and innovation, including <b>the</b> <b>EIT,</b> as part <b>of</b> attempts to re-launch its Lisbon Strategy around a ‘growth and jobs’ agenda. <b>The</b> <b>EIT</b> is presented as implicated in European Commission attempts to redefine the mandates and governance of higher education institutions {{as part of a}} knowledge-based economy route to economic and social development. The production and contestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> as it was negotiated within EU institutions is shown as having been conditioned by the interactions between Commission attempts to use <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> to disrupt <b>the</b> governance and financing of higher education and research and national and institutional determination to constrain <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> within extant governance and financing principles. In conclusion, the paper outlines a research agenda for the study and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> in <b>the</b> period up to 2013 which will make it possible to specify <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> for EU integration, <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European higher education, research and innovation fields, <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> EU strategies for capital accumulation and social development and <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU itself...|$|R
40|$|Metamaterial analogues of electromagnetically induced {{transparency}} (EIT) {{have been}} intensively studied and widely employed for slow light and enhanced nonlinear effects. In particular, <b>the</b> active modulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> analogue and well-controlled group delay in metamaterials have shown great prospects in optical communication networks. Previous {{studies have focused}} on <b>the</b> optical control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> analogue by integrating the photoactive materials into the unit cell, however, the response time is limited by <b>the</b> recovery time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excited carriers in these bulk materials. Graphene has recently emerged as an exceptional optoelectronic material. It shows an ultrafast relaxation time on <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> picosecond and its conductivity can be tuned via manipulating the Fermi energy. Here we integrate a monolayer graphene into metal-based terahertz (THz) metamaterials, and realize a complete modulation in <b>the</b> resonance strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EIT</b> analogue at <b>the</b> accessible Fermi energy. The physical mechanism lies in the active tuning <b>the</b> damping rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark mode resonator through <b>the</b> recombination effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductive graphene. Note that the monolayer morphology in our work is easier to fabricate and manipulate than isolated fashion.
