5000|$|To {{ensure that}} {{vehicles}} traded-in under [...] "cash for clunkers" [...] {{will not be}} resold by dealers, the program outlines a procedure for destructively disabling the engine (and thus also precluding the possibility that any mechanical engine components might be salvaged {{to be used in}} the repair of any other vehicles): The motor oil is drained and replaced with a sodium silicate solution, then the engine is started and run until the solution, becoming glass-like when heated, causes engine internals to abrade and ultimately seize. In addition, the salvage or scrap facility which acquires the vehicle cannot sell the engine, cylinder heads or a [...] "rolling chassis" [...] from the <b>scrap</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The salvage or scrap facility can sell any other component (including the transmission and axles) from the <b>scrap</b> <b>vehicle</b> separately and may dismantle and warehouse the parts. The [...] "hull" [...] of the vehicle must be crushed within 180 days. Cut off or unbolt front end assemblies may be saved and sold at a later date,as well as the [...] "top and back" [...] of pickup cabs.|$|E
40|$|Incorporating {{scrap tyre}} rubber {{particles}} as partial replacement for aggregates {{has been found}} to produce concrete with improved ductility, deformability and damping which are desired characteristics of a viable material for enhancing structural response to earthquake vibrations. An analytical study using Drain- 2 dX was carried out to investigate the response of 4 -storey, 3 -bay reinforced concrete frames on innovative rubberised concrete deformable foundation models to simulated earthquake scaled to 5 different peak ground accelerations. Stress-strain properties of 3 -layers aramid fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) -confinement for concrete incorporating waste rubber from <b>scrap</b> <b>vehicle</b> tyres were used to model the elements of this foundation models. With a partial decoupling of the superstructure from the direct earthquake force, the models showed up to 70 % reduction in base shear, an improved overall q-factor of 7. 1, and an estimated frame acceleration of 0. 11 g for an earthquake peak ground acceleration of 0. 44 g. This implies that a non-seismically designed reinforced concrete frame on the proposed rubberised concrete deformable foundation system would provide a simple, affordable and equally efficient alternative to the conventional and usually expensive earthquake resistant concrete frames. A supplementary Arrest System (SAS) was proposed to anchor the frame from the resulting soft storey at the rubberised concrete foundation. A further research is recommended for the design of concrete hinges with rubberised concrete as used in the model with the most impressive response...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{disposal}} of waste tires has become an increasingly important issue worldwide in recent years. Tires not only take up large amounts of valuable landfill space, but also create fire hazards and provide a refuge for disease- carrying creatures. The goal {{of this study was}} to produce activated carbon from scrap tires. Adsorption of Acid Black 1 (AB 1) in aqueous solution as a pollutant by the activated carbon was also investigated. Materials and Methods: Activated carbon was prepared from <b>scrap</b> <b>vehicle</b> tires using a thermo-chemical activation method. The chemical composition and solid structure of prepared activated carbon were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and Nitrogen Sas. Micro pore volumes of the sample were determined by the application of the BET and BJH. Results: Predominant composition of prepared activated carbon was C (83. 274 %) and with area surface of 44. 226 and 35. 747 m 2 /gr observed by BET and BJH methods, respectively. Mean pore diameter was 52 nm. The result of this study showed that increasing of initial dye concentration and pH would lead to decrease of adsorption/removal of dye but by increasing of sorbent dosage and contact time, adsorption/removal of dye increased. Conclusion: As the results of present study it can be concluded that the production of the activated carbon from scrap tires, can provide a two-fold environmental and economic benefit; a recycling path is created for scrap tires of vehicles, and a new suitable adsorbent is produced for pollutants removal...|$|E

40|$|Older {{vehicles}} {{contribute a}} significant and disproportionate share of the pollution in urban areas. Starting in 1990, several areas adopted voluntary accelerated vehicle retirement (VAVR) programs {{to address this problem}} and to respond to demands for flexible, market-based approaches to controlling air pollution. VAVR programs offer owners of older <b>vehicles</b> cash to <b>scrap</b> their <b>vehicles.</b> VAVR programs have been adopted throughout the U. S. and abroad, though not without controversy and uncertainty over the programs’ benefits. This research first examined the roles of older vehicles in U. S. households. Lower income households are more likely to own older vehicles and to rely upon them more for their daily transportation needs. While older vehicles are generally driven less than newer vehicles, they serve a wide range of roles within households. This makes estimating the emissions reduction benefits of VAVR programs more difficult. This research then examined how household characteristics and behavior influence participation in VAVR programs and, therefore, the benefits from the programs. The assumptions used by regulators to estimate the air pollutant reductions from VAVR programs are compared with data from VAVR programs in California. Changing the assumptions did significantly change the estimated benefits. However, in nearly all the scenarios examined, the programs still reduce emissions significantly, particularly of reactive organic gases. Data from surveys of program participants show that the programs are diverting vehicles from the used vehicle market, which is not built into the current assumptions for estimating program benefits. The <b>scrapped</b> <b>vehicles</b> are generally in poorer condition, are worth less, and are driven less than other older vehicles. However, the criticism that most of the <b>scrapped</b> <b>vehicles</b> were headed to the junkyard anyway appears unfounded. Nearly all of the <b>scrapped</b> <b>vehicles</b> were replaced with another vehicle and nearly all of the replacement vehicles were newer than the <b>scrapped</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Policymakers should consider ways to expand, improve, and/or supplement VAVR programs. First, adjustments to the methodology to calculate emissions reductions should be made to make the estimates more conservative. Second, policymakers should explore ways to change and supplement the programs to address key factors that reduce program effectiveness. Current programs are missing certain households that drive older vehicles a lot and have little impact on the vehicle replacement decision. Promising options include repair programs, targeting certain vehicles for participation in VAVR programs, and increasing the incentive for households that replace the vehicle with significantly cleaner alternatives...|$|R
