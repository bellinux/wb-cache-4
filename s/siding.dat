5|$|A small <b>siding</b> {{immediately}} west of {{the station}} originally led to a stable, which housed the Tramway's horses. After the line's mechanisation in 1872 the stables were closed, and the <b>siding</b> served a small cattle pen.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the Great Western Railway Chiltern Main Line was routed {{directly}} through Wood <b>Siding,</b> but no interchange station was built. The GWR was to run in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood <b>Siding</b> station and its <b>siding</b> were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908 and 1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line.|$|E

5|$|Limited by {{poor quality}} {{locomotives}} and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of}} the hills, and stopping at four intermediate stations between Wood <b>Siding</b> and Quainton Road to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly. In 1887 trains took between 15 and 20 minutes to travel approximately one mile from Wood <b>Siding</b> to Brill, and a little over 1hour20minutes from Wood <b>Siding</b> to the junction station with the main line at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out {{at the time of the}} transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Wood <b>Siding</b> to Quainton Road to about 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} <b>siding</b> was provided for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. The <b>siding</b> lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the <b>siding</b> was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the <b>siding</b> and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E
5|$|With {{a railway}} now running near the {{boundary}} of the Wotton House estate at Quainton Road, the 3rd Duke decided to open a small-scale agricultural railway to connect the estate to the railway. The line was intended purely for the transport of construction materials and agricultural produce, and not passengers. The line was to run roughly southwest from Quainton Road to a new railway station near Wotton Underwood. Just west of the station at Wotton the line split. One section would run west to Wood <b>Siding</b> near Brill. A short stub called Church <b>Siding</b> would run northwest into the village of Wotton Underwood itself, terminating near the parish church, and a 1mile 57chain (1mile 1,254yards; 2.8km) <b>siding</b> would run north to a coal <b>siding</b> near Kingswood.|$|E

5|$|Wood <b>Siding</b> {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short <b>siding</b> led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the <b>siding,</b> and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood <b>Siding</b> station and its <b>siding</b> were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood <b>Siding</b> {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood <b>Siding</b> station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm <b>Siding,</b> a single <b>siding</b> on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House <b>Siding,</b> which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new <b>siding</b> located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The <b>siding</b> is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The <b>siding</b> tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{passenger}} facilities, Wood <b>Siding</b> was {{the starting point for}} the first passenger service to operate on the line. On 26 August 1871 an excursion service ran from Wood <b>Siding</b> to London hauled by the Great Western Railway (GWR). It carried around 150 people, for a total of 105 passenger fares (with each child counted as half an adult), and was drawn by horses between Wood <b>Siding</b> and Quainton Road and by locomotive from Quainton Road to Aylesbury where the carriages were attached to the 7.30am GWR service via Princes Risborough to London, arriving at 10.00am. The experiment was not a success. Sharp overhanging branches along the route posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in the week before the excursion. The day itself was extremely rainy, and ticket sales were lower than expected. The return train from London to Quainton Road was delayed in Slough, and the excursion eventually arrived back at Wood <b>Siding</b> at 2.00am.|$|E

5|$|The railway claimed {{its first}} lives when two contractor's {{locomotives}} collided in thick fog near Eastoft on 4 January 1901.

Another inspection train was run on 26 June 1901, starting from Reedness Junction and visiting, according to the Crowle Advertiser, Creyke <b>Siding,</b> Garthorpe and Crowle. The train consisted of two first-class carriages and an open truck. A dinner was held at the Darby and Joan Hotel in Crowle, before the party returned to Reedness. Although Creyke <b>siding</b> was mentioned, this term was normally applied to a <b>siding</b> serving Creyke's peat works on the North Eastern Railway main line to the south of Marshland Junction.|$|E
