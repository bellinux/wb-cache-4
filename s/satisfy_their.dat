5|$|The Pranatoshini Tantra (18th century) narrates two {{tales of}} Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, {{attributed}} to the Narada-pancharatra, tells how once, while bathing in Mandakini river, Parvati becomes sexually excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.|$|E
5|$|The team {{created new}} engines to <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> needs for the game. The {{artificial}} intelligence {{was created to}} coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was {{a major contributor to}} the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|E
5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E

5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough to <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} {{the removal of the}} HNC was a power {{struggle}} within the ruling junta. Khánh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed to <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> wishes to stay in power. The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to sideline them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to compulsorily retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E

Proper job enrichment, therefore, involves more than simply giving the workers extra tasks to perform. It means expanding the level of knowledge and skills needed to perform the job.|$|E

25|$|May we not say that, in the fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist?

A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished....
