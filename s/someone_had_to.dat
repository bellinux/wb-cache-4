Among the few consistent character traits Oswald had developed before moving on to Universal Studios was his near-constant pursuit of potential sweethearts. So for Mickey {{to have a chance to}} emulate his predecessor at flirting, <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> replace Oswald's many love interests. This replacement to Miss Rabbit, Miss Cottontail, Fanny and an uncertain number of unnamed nurses and dancers was to become Minnie Mouse.|$|E

500|$|A lifelong liberal politically, Rimsky-Korsakov {{wrote that}} he felt <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{protect the rights of}} the {{students}} to demonstrate, especially as disputes and wrangling between students and authorities were becoming increasingly violent. In an open letter, he sided with the students against what he saw as unwarranted interference by Conservatory leadership and the Russian Musical Society. A second letter, this time signed by a number of faculty including Rimsky-Korsakov, demanded the resignation of the head of the Conservatory. Partly {{as a result of these}} two letters he wrote, approximately 100 Conservatory students were expelled and he was removed from his professorship. Just before the dismissal was enacted, Rimsky-Korsakov received a letter from one of the members of the school directorate, suggesting that he take up the directorship in the interest of calming student unrest. [...] "Probably the member of the Directorate held a minority opinion, but signed the resolution nevertheless," [...] he wrote. [...] "I sent a negative reply." [...] Partly in defiance of his dismissal, Rimsky-Korsakov continued teaching his students from his home.|$|E

Mothers of young children overwhelmingly work outside of the home, but male housewives remain rare. Tomboys have achieved some acceptance, but boys are still expected to be boys. Actresses needn 2 ̆ 7 t be sultry to be sexy, but actors are still taller, stronger and more silent than their sexual partners-except for Woody Allen. Perversely, the confluence of women 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the workplace {{with the death of}} social democracy resulted in recreating the American worker as a gendered, unencumbered bachelor. Women <b>have</b> been freed <b>to</b> be men, and men <b>have</b> been freed <b>to</b> be single.

2500|$|Simultaneously, the Revolution {{was plagued}} with many problems. [...] In {{addition}} to political divisions, {{they were dealing}} with the hyperinflation of the National Convention's fiat paper currency, the assignats, revolts against authority in the countryside, slave uprisings in colonial territories such as the Haitian Revolution, and no peaceful end in sight.

[...] As Thomas E. Kaiser argues in his article [...] "From the Austrian Committee to the Foreign Plot: Marie-Antoinette, Austrophobia, and the Terror", centuries of Austrophobia was reincarnated into a firm belief in an Austrian led conspiracy aiming to thwart the revolution. [...] Kaiser states that the Foreign Plot: [...] "consisted of a massive, multilayered conspiracy by counterrevolutionary agents abetted by the allies, who allegedly—and quite possibly in reality—sought to undermine the Republic through a coordinated effort to corrupt government officials associated with the more moderate wing of the Jacobin establishment and to defame the government by mobilizing elements on the extreme left."A political faction known as the Jacobins, who had a very active radical faction, the Girondists, genuinely feared this conspiratorial plot. [...] Rousseau, a philosophe influential in the Enlightenment and fellow Jacobin, spread the idea of a [...] "collective will", a singular purpose which the people of a nation must all unequivocally support. [...] If anyone was against the collective will, they were a part of this counterrevolutionary conspiracy, and since the momentum of the Revolution had to be protected at all costs, any and all threats had to be eliminated. [...] This attitude toward dissension only grew more violent and bloodthirsty throughout 1793-1794 when Robespierre enacted the [...] Reign of Terror. [...] In order to preserve the [...] "republic of virtue", Robespierre had to [...] "cleanse" [...] the country of anyone who spoke out or acted against the virtues of the revolution by way of the guillotine.
