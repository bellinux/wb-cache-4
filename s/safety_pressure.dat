50|$|Nespresso's {{hermetically}} sealed capsules {{are made of}} aluminum foil. Depending on the Nespresso machine being used, the flat top of the capsule is pierced when inserted into the machine and the compartment lever is lowered. Some machines make a single large hole, and others make a number of smaller holes. When the machine is activated it pumps hot water under high pressure into injector holes poked into the narrow end of the capsule upon insertion. This causes the flat bottom of the capsule to bow in, as this is made of thinner foil {{than the rest of}} the capsule. The base of the capsule holder (on which the capsule sits) has a number of raised squares which cause the foil to rupture at these points. The brewed coffee exits the capsule through these rupture holes and flows through a funnel nozzle into the coffee cup. As in pressure cookers, a <b>safety</b> <b>pressure</b> release valve inside the brewing chamber prevents an explosion from occurring if the normal coffee exhaust path becomes blocked.|$|E

This paper also introduces a new failure rate evaluation with influencing factors especially developed for safety instrumented systems. The seven-step methodology combines both qualitative and quantitative analyses to compensate for a potential lack of feedback knowledge.

40|$|International audienceA new {{methodology}} for failure rate evaluation with influencing factors is proposed. A quantitative part allows integrating potential available data from feedback. Then, a qualitative analysis deals with influencing {{factors such as}} design, environment, and use to provide more coherent and argued results. The main idea is to use some criteria to fix the failure rate within a prior interval, according to the influencing factor states. To this end, the system is broken up into main component groups. When a component group is susceptible to an influencing factor, its baseline failure rate is multiplied by the relevant influencing coefficient. A seven-step methodology is presented to define the model, identify and rate the influencing factors, set indicator functions taking the uncertainties into account, and calculate the influencing coefficients. The proposed methodology is global enough to be usable for {{a large number of}} safety instrumented systems and influencing factors. For example, an application regarding <b>safety</b> <b>pressure</b> relief valves is given. The prospect is for more efficient risk management by acting both on systems and influencing factors...|$|E

However experiences shows limitations in applications on cryogenic pressure vessels: Set pressure varies in a wide range, unauthorized increase of set pressure, seat not tight etc. Alternatively, in some applications, spring related relief valves with cold seating, so called “Quench Relief Valves” (QRV) are used. Beside their relief function further functionalities like tight seating for system isolation as well as shut-off function for bypass precooling may be requested. So QRV’s shall be used in parallel to a cold or warm bursts disc at higher set pressure because of its rules non-conformity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the CFD simulation {{study on the}} effect of volume ratio on pressure piling. The explosion of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as “pressure piling” and its occurrence is a relevant issue of industrial <b>safety.</b> <b>Pressure</b> piling is a situation where peak pressures much higher than the expected values predicted by thermodynamic are generated in the geometry. The geometric characteristics of the vessels such as the tube area and ratio of volumes of the interconnected vessels play important role in the intensity of the pressure piling. Moreover, pre-compression and violence of explosion are the two main mechanisms affecting pressure piling. A CFD-Ansys and RANS model were used in this paper. The models duplicated experimental explosion behaviours and the results were compared with experimental. Propane-air mixture was used to study pressure piling. In the end it was found that pre-compression and violence of explosion are the two main mechanisms affecting pressure piling, which in turns affect the ratio between reaction and venting time in the second vessel (Brt). Higher the Brt number in the second vessel, lower the occurrence of pressure piling. Lower the volume ratio, higher the violence of explosion. Increasing the volume ratio results in a more intense pre-compression (pressure in the secondary vessel at ignition time increases) thus suggesting that ignition in the second vessel occurs starting from a higher value of pressure. Therefore, low pre-compression and high Brt number can prevent the occurrence of pressure pilin...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: For many years, family blood donors {{have been}} {{considered}} less safe than volunteer non-remunerated blood donors and actively discouraged by international organisations and affluent countries support agencies for developing countries. In addition to <b>safety,</b> <b>pressure</b> and coercion was considered unethical. However these assumptions were not supported by evidence. Aims of the study: To assemble recently collected evidence to reopen the assessment {{whether or not the}} ban of family blood donors is justified. Methods: Review of old and recent literature through Pubmed and references from identified articles. Results and Discussion: Viral marker data comparing confirmed seroprevalence in 1 st time volunteer non-remunerated donors (VNRD) and family/replacement donors (FRD) corrected for gender and age, show {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. Evidence has been provided that for both VNRD and FAD benevolence is more appropriate than altruism. The two groups merge for psychological attitude to donation for which knowing someone needing transfusion is a powerful incentive to give blood. Excluding a life or death situation found in areas where severe blood shortage justifies replacement donation, pressures are exerted on both VNRD and FRD. There is no evidence of coercion of FRD. FRDs therefore meet all criteria for VNRD and are willing to become VNRD and to repeat donation. Ostracising FRD is illegitimate and damaging to the blood supply in resource poor areas. In some countries no difference is made between the two groups of donors representing similar populations asked to give blood in different circumstances. Conclusions: FRDs remain a critical source of volunteer, non-remunerated, blood meeting all classical criteria of VNRD that should be considered legitimate and indispensable at this point in time instead of discouraged...|$|E
40|$|The {{condensation}} rate {{has to be}} high in the <b>safety</b> <b>pressure</b> suppression pool systems of Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) {{in order to fulfill}} their safety function. The phenomena due to such a high direct contact condensation (DCC) rate turn out to be very challenging to be analysed either with experiments or numerical simulations. In this thesis, the suppression pool experiments carried out in the POOLEX facility of Lappeenranta University of Technology were simulated. Two different condensation modes were modelled by using the 2 -phase CFD codes NEPTUNE CFD and TransAT. The DCC models applied were the typical ones to be used for separated flows in channels, and their applicability to the rapidly condensing flow in the condensation pool context had not been tested earlier. A low Reynolds number case was the first to be simulated. The POOLEX experiment STB- 31 was operated near the conditions between the ’quasi-steady oscillatory interface condensation’ mode and the ’condensation within the blowdown pipe’ mode. The condensation models of Lakehal et al. and Coste & Lavi´eville predicted the {{condensation rate}} quite accurately, while the other tested ones overestimated it. It was possible to get the direct phase change solution to settle near to the measured values, but a very high resolution of calculation grid was needed. Secondly, a high Reynolds number case corresponding to the ’chugging’ mode was simulated. The POOLEX experiment STB- 28 was chosen, because various standard and highspeed video samples of bubbles were recorded during it. In order to extract numerical information from the video material, a pattern recognition procedure was programmed. The bubble size distributions and the frequencies of chugging were calculated with this procedure. With the statistical data of the bubble sizes and temporal data of the bubble/jet appearance, it was possible to compare the condensation rates between the experiment and the CFD simulations. In the chugging simulations, a spherically curvilinear calculation grid at the blowdown pipe exit improved the convergence and decreased the required cell count. The compressible flow solver with complete steam-tables was beneficial for the numerical success of the simulations. The Hughes-Duffey model and, to some extent, the Coste & Lavi´eville model produced realistic chugging behavior. The initial level of the steam/water interface was an important factor to determine the initiation of the chugging. If the interface was initialized with a water level high enough inside the blowdown pipe, the vigorous penetration of a water plug into the pool created a turbulent wake which invoked the chugging that was self-sustaining. A 3 D simulation with a suitable DCC model produced qualitatively very realistic shapes of the chugging bubbles and jets. The comparative FFT analysis of the bubble size data and the pool bottom pressure data gave useful information to distinguish the eigenmodes of chugging, bubbling, and pool structure oscillations...|$|E
