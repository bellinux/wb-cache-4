500|$|Walker {{also plays}} twelve bars of <b>single-string</b> guitar solo, which writer Lenny Carlson has {{described}} as [...] "remain {{largely in the}} middle register, but it contains some gems, particularly {{in the use of}} space, phrasing, and melodic development". [...] The horn accompaniment has been compared to that of Count Basie's 1930s Kansas City jazz bands.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Wing" [...] {{was one of}} {{only two}} songs from Axis that the Experience {{regularly}} performed in concert, the other being [...] "Spanish Castle Magic". [...] Except for the glockenspiel and the song's ending, their live performances generally follow the studio arrangement. Since the Axis recording ends on a fade, Hendrix needed to devise a different live ending. Early recordings show a progression to an open chord, while later ones have more elaborate <b>single-string</b> guitar improvisation with effects, such as wah-wah, before a chiming final chord. [...] For one 1968 performance in San Francisco, Hendrix's guitar signal was routed through a Leslie speaker. Writer Dave Rubin commented, [...] "the real Leslie played outdoors [...] like this really gives a very delicate, gentle swirl to the chords and helps the chordal embellishments in the intro". [...] This version was also rendered at a slower (56 bpm) tempo, making it somewhat longer (4:01).|$|E
500|$|Presley was {{a central}} figure in the {{development}} of rockabilly, according to music historians. Katherine Charlton even calls him [...] "rockabilly's originator", though Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that [...] " [...] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly." [...] and, according to Michael Campbell, [...] "Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit." [...] "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. [...] "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old." [...] However, [...] "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as [...] "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": [...] "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [...] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [...] country". In [...] "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, [...] "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, <b>single-string</b> work, is a microcosm of this fusion." ...|$|E

25|$|The rim of a Bösendorfer {{grand piano}} is built quite {{differently}} {{from that of}} all other grands. Instead of veneers bent around a form, the rim is made in solid sections of spruce and jointed together. Spruce is better at transmitting sound than reflecting it. This is perhaps why Bösendorfers {{tend to have a}} more delicate treble and a bass that features the fundamental tone more than the higher harmonics. There are also two other features of Bösendorfers that are shared with only a few other piano brands: one is a removable capo d'astro bar in the treble, which facilitates rebuilding of the instrument and, Bösendorfer says, provides greater acoustic separation from the plate, decreasing tonal absorption; the other is <b>single-stringing,</b> providing each string its own individual hitch pin on the plate instead of connecting it to a neighboring string. This design may slightly improve tuning stability and is an advantage in case of string breakage.|$|R

2500|$|Stig is from Amager. Stig played, in {{the early}} days, in a punk band called ADS. He was founder of the band, but he was {{eventually}} kicked out in 1982, so he founded D-A-D as a [...] "payback". Stig also plays in a band called Hellbetty. Stig's bass guitars only have two strings or three strings. He found out in the late 1980s that he only used the E and A string when he played, and made it his mark, to have funny, good looking basses. He is also seen using a <b>single-string</b> bass at gigs. Stig designs his own bass guitars based on his own ideas and imagination.|$|E

50|$|The nyatiti {{is usually}} played alone. Some players have, in the past, been {{accompanied}} {{by a number of}} male back-up singers (chorus). Though not common, the nyatiti can accompanied by any number of traditional instruments, including a curved horn called the oporo, a <b>single-string</b> violin-like instrument called the orutu, and percussion. Modern day players will often integrate the instrument in with Western-style guitar, bass, keyboards and drums.|$|E
50|$|Carr's {{partnership}} with guitarist Blackwell combined his light bluesy piano with a melodic jazzy guitar {{that was a}} progenitor of urban blues. His vocal style moved blues singing toward an urban sophistication and influenced such singers as T-Bone Walker, Charles Brown, Amos Milburn, Jimmy Witherspoon, Ray Charles, amongst others. Blackwell's jazz <b>single-string</b> guitar lines helped {{pave the way for}} electric guitarists such as Eddie Durham and Charlie Christian.|$|E
50|$|The string {{instruments}} {{include the}} guitar (both acoustic and electrical), bass, oud, sitar, tumbi, violin and sarangi.

5000|$|The Country Gentlemen {{originated}} in Washington, D.C.. The band’s original members were Charlie Waller on guitar and lead vocals, John Duffey on mandolin and tenor vocals, Bill Emerson on banjo and baritone vocals, and Larry Lahey on bass. Soon after Adcock's arrival the band {{settled into a}} somewhat permanent lineup consisting of Waller, Duffey, Eddie Adcock on banjo, and Tom Gray on bass. During his tenure with the Country Gentlemen, Adcock adapted [...] "Travis-style" [...] guitar finger picking and pedal steel guitar playing to the banjo, which remain unique innovations on the instrument. In addition, his driving, percussive and jazz-based <b>single-string</b> licks, which resemble Don Reno's <b>single-string</b> work in the early `60s, were {{at the heart of}} the group's [...] "chamber music" [...] bluegrass instrumental style, as developed in the interplay between Duffey's jazzy mandolin licks, Waller's syncopated guitar picking and Adcock's innovations. The Country Gentlemen's style and repertoire fundamentally changed bluegrass, and the group was arguably the first New Grass band and the forerunner of modern bluegrass as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|René Joseph Hall (September 26, 1912 ‒ February 11, 1988) was an American musician, performer, {{and music}} {{arranger}} whose guitar and arrangements {{can be heard}} on hundreds of enduring rock and roll and R&B recordings released by many of America's most notable labels including Aladdin, Decca, Motown, and RCA Records.

The computers, slow by current personal computer standards, are typical for the radiation requirements needed on the STEREO mission.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1930s, {{he invented}} {{a model of}} guitar with another bass string added to the common six-string guitar. The seven-string guitar allowed him to play bass next to his jazz chords, unlike the <b>single-string</b> style of Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. He called his {{technique}} [...] "lap piano". It anticipated the fingerpicking style of country guitarists Chet Atkins and Merle Travis and inspired jazz guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli, John Pizzarelli, and Howard Alden {{to pick up the}} seven-string.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} a big hit, {{introducing}} the band to mainstream audiences in the United States in 1984 and reaching the top ten in the UK Singles Chart.

Big Country's bassist Tony Butler has also claimed this song to be one of his favorites.|$|E
5000|$|American guitarist Dominic Frasca uses single string [...] "mini capos", {{attached}} by drilling {{through the}} neck of his customized 10-string guitar. These {{are similar to the}} <b>single-string</b> [...] "capos" [...] many Eastern instruments use, in which the string is hooked under the head of the [...] "nail" [...] when one wants to capo it. This is a common capo practice during the performance of a musical piece, so that the tuning {{at the end of the}} piece will sound different from the one used at the beginning.|$|E
5000|$|He {{made his}} mark as a {{pioneering}} rock guitar soloist in 1963, with his hit-record instrumentals, [...] "Memphis" [...] and [...] "Wham!". In those and other tunes, Mack combined fast-picking country technique with soulful, bluesy feeling and form to produce an overall sound that was [...] "savagely wild yet perfectly controlled". [...] His early recordings prefigured the soon-to-appear blues-rock and Southern rock sub-genres and his [...] "aggressive <b>single-string</b> phrasing and seamless rhythm style" [...] {{are said to have}} inspired and guided a legion of superstar rock guitarists.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964 he {{revised the}} Chord Book, {{incorporating}} many more instructional elements, {{and called it}} the [...] "Instructional Chord Book for Guitar".
