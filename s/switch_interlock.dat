The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and electric point machines were controlled from <b>switch</b> panels. The <b>interlocking</b> equipment was unique being a sequence <b>switch</b> <b>interlocking</b> system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact wipers. Each switch had a [...] "home" [...] position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate interlocking circuits through other switches and relays. The installations proved to be remarkably reliable, serving a very useful purpose but were eventually life expired.|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} {{fascinating}} research on charge transport through switchable molecules. In the past decade, detailed investigations {{have been performed}} on {{a great variety of}} molecular <b>switches,</b> including mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>switches</b> (rotaxanes and catenanes), redox-active molecules and photochromic switches (e. g. azobenzenes and diarylethenes). To probe these molecules, both individually and in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), a broad set of methods have been developed. These range from low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) via two-terminal break junctions to larger scale SAM-based devices. It is generally found that the electronic coupling between molecules and electrodes has a profound influence on the properties of such molecular junctions. For example, an intrinsically switchable molecule may lose its functionality after it is contacted. Vice versa, switchable two-terminal devices may be created using passive molecules ('extrinsic switching'). Developing a detailed understanding of the relation between coupling and switchability will be of key importance for both future research and technolog...|$|R
40|$|At the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CBBAF), a 4 GeV {{multipass}} CW {{electron beam}} {{is to be}} accelerated by 338 SRF, 5 -cell niobium cavities operating at a resonant frequency of 1497 MHz. Eight cavities arranged as four pairs comprise a cryomodule, a cryogenically isolated linac subdivision. The frequency is controlled by a mechanical tuner attached to the fist and fifth cell of the cavity which elastically deforms the cavity and thereby alters its resonant frequency. The tuner is driven by a stepper motor mounted external to the cryomodule that transfers torque through two rotary feedthroughs. A linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) mounted on the tuner monitors the displacement, and two limit <b>switches</b> <b>interlock</b> the movement beyond a 400 kHz bandwidth. Since the cavity has a loaded Q of 6. 6. 106, the control system must maintain {{the frequency of the}} cavity to within * 50 Hz of the drive frequency for efficient coupling. This requirement is somewhat difficult to achieve since the difference in thermal contractions of the cavity and the tuner creates a frequency hysteresis of approximately 10 kHz. The cavity is also subject o frequency shifts due to pressure fluctuations of the helium bath as well as radiation pressure. This requires that each cavity be characterized in terms of frequency change as a function of applied motor steps to allow proper tuning operations. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical performance of the cavity tuner during the commissioning and operation of the cryomodules manufactured todate. I...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the construction and}} exploration {{of a variety of}} interlocked structures that exhibit anion-induced molecular motion of their constituent parts. Chapter One provides a brief overview of the field of supramolecular chemistry; in particular anion recognition and the concept of mechanically interlocked molecules and their applications in the fields of nanotechnology. Chapter Two {{describes the}} preparation of a series of bistable [2]rotaxanes followed by thorough investigation of their dynamic properties. Specifically, the success of an iodo-triazoliumÃ¢ÂÂnaphthalene-diimide-based two-station axle component to facilitate halide-stimulated large-amplitude translational motion of the macrocyclic wheel in a [2]rotaxane is demonstrated. Chapter Three expands on the design principles established in the previous chapter with the synthesis of exotic higher-order structures including the first halogen bonding [3]rotaxane. These systems are capable of the recognition and colorimetric sensing of oxoanions via a novel dynamic pincer-like motion of the macrocycle components. Chapter Four further highlights the capabilities of controlled co-conformational <b>switching</b> in <b>interlocked</b> structures, resulting in a unique mechanism to accomplish anion sensing. The incorporation of C 60 fullerene- and ferrocenyl-reporter groups into a four-station [3]rotaxane enables sensing of chloride to be realised by a dual fluorescence response. Chapter Five presents the synthesis of novel interlocked structures containing a substituted perylene diimide motif that functions as a recognition site for macrocycles. Chloride binding stimulates translational motion in a [3]rotaxane and unprecedented rotary motion in a [3]catenane, with co-conformational changes in both systems resulting in a colorimetric response for this anion. Chapter Six describes experimental procedures used throughout this work and details the characterisation of novel compounds. Chapter Seven provides a summary of the major conclusions from the research described in this thesis. ...|$|R

This is a world wide accepted standard that is being adopted by the industry in order to provide for all current and future needs. This standard defines not only the communication protocols but also its own Substation Configuration Language (SCL) and even best practices for related engineering processes. In order {{to keep up with the}} current fast technological developments the substation data model is separated from the communication protocols allowing both to be changed without affecting each other. Also defined in the standard is an extensive conformance testing procedure in order to guarantee that different vendors interpret and implement the standard correctly. The substation and its SAS must undergo thourough testing procedures specificaly in the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) and Site Acceptance Test (SAT). The conformance tests insures that the SAS devices, the Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), conform to the same standard but on its own does not guarantee its interoperability. An automated testing tool capable of, quickly and easily, testing the SAS functions (IEDs interoperability) provides significant savings in both time and money to the testing process. This work aim is to develop such a tool, capable of interoperability testing. In order to achieve such big accomplishment this initial work focus on only two of the most used functions of the SAS: <b>switching</b> and <b>interlocking.</b> A simulation model, built on top of OMNeT++, for both the IEDs and the substation was developed.

The DSS consists of two main components: a PLC-based Front-End and a supervisor Back-End. The two parts communicate via the OPC mechanism. The Front-End is the core of the DSS, to which all the runtime safety-critical actions are delegated.

These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactive contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Adamant circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Adamant was only used during a limited ''test'' on a regular plywood crate due to safety considerations of the tool for this application. The Adamant circular saw, a counter-rotating twin-cutter, constructed with blades that work differently than conventional cutting wheels with twin blades, each rotating in opposite directions. It is used to cut wood and metals. Each blade is approximately 8 3 / 4 inches in diameter with a maximum cutting depth of 2 1 / 2 inches. The machine has two rotation speeds: 1, 900 and 2, 900 rotations per minute (rpm). The saw is operated with an <b>interlocked,</b> guarded trigger <b>switch</b> located at the end of the saw opposite the cutting blades. To operate the saw, the safety interlock must be depressed prior to powering the saw with the trigger control. The saw is supported by a handle at the front of the saw near the cutting blades. The top part of the blades is guarded near the handle, with approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades exposed. The Adamant circular saw is an innovative technology used to cut metals and wood. Its safety features include: <b>interlocking</b> <b>switch</b> for powering the saw, overload indicator and shutoff, and an electronic brake that stops the engine immediately when the start button is released. The top part of the blades is guarded near the motor. With approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades open, the operator is exposed to the potential risk of serious and minor cuts and abrasions when using and handling the saw. There is also potential for damage to the blades if the saw is not stored properly. Without guarding on the lower part of the blades, these can be damaged if the saw is dropped or rested on the cutting blades. Based upon the industrial hygiene sampling conducted for the other four saws demonstrated at FIU, noise levels, nuisance dust, and airborne fiberglass may be a problem when using this technology for the cutting of fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. No industrial hygiene sampling was conducted while the Adamant saw was in use. Engineering controls should be used to eliminate these problems whenever possible. Where this is not possible, administrative controls, training, and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Respirators should be used if engineering controls do not sufficiently control the dust or fiberglass generated. Respirators should be equipped with an organic vapor and acid gas cartridge with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|R
