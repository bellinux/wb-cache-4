40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the studies of}} two recent large and well-recorded earthquakes, the 1999 Hector Mine and Chi-Chi earthquakes. A new procedure for the determination of rupture complexity from a joint inversion of static and seismic data was first developed. This procedure applies a wavelet transform to separate seismic information related to the spatial and temporal slip history, then uses a simulated annealing algorithm to determine the finite-fault model that minimizes the objective function {{described in terms of}} wavelet coefficients. This method is then applied to simultaneously invert the slip amplitude, slip direction, rise time and rupture velocity distributions of the Hector Mine and Chi-Chi earthquakes with both seismic and geodetic data. Two slip models are later verified with independent datasets. Results indicate that the seismic moment of the Hector Mine earthquake is 6. 28 x 10 ^(19) Nm, which is distributed along a "Y" <b>shape</b> <b>fault</b> geometry with three segments. The average slip is 1. 5 m with peak amplitudes as high as 7 m. The fault rupture has an average slip duration of 3. 5 sec and a slow average rupture velocity of 1. 9 km/ sec, resulting in a 14 sec rupture propagation history. The rise time appears to be roughly proportional to slip, and the two branches of "Y" <b>shape</b> <b>fault</b> rupture together. The Chi-Chi earthquake is the best-recorded large earthquake so far. Its seismic moment of 2. 7 x 10 ^(20) Nm is concentrated on the surface of a "wedge shaped" block. The rupture front propagates with a slow rupture velocity of about 2. 0 km/ sec. The average slip duration is 7. 2 sec. Four interesting results are obtained: (1) The sinuous fault plane strongly affects both spatial and temporal variation in slip history; (2) Long-period peak slip velocity increases as the rupture propagates; (3) The peak slip velocity near the surface is in general higher than on the deeper portion of the fault plane as predicted by dynamic modeling [e. g., Oglesby et al., 1998]; and (4) the complex fault geometry and slip distribution are related to the two transfer zones obliquely across Taiwan, which separate Taiwan into three regions with different tectonic activity. The transfer zone in the north {{can be explained by the}} slab breakoff mechanism proposed by Teng et al. [2000] recently. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Explorer Ridge, an {{underwater}} mountain range lying [...] west of Vancouver Island on the Coast of British Columbia, {{consists of a}} north-south trending rift zone.

40|$|Abstract: We use {{geometric}} {{and experimental}} models {{to study the}} development of extensional fault-bend folds. The geometric models how that <b>fault</b> <b>shape,</b> <b>fault</b> displace-ment, and patterns of aggradation/erosion profoundly affect the distribution of growth beds, the magnitude and direction of dipof pregrowth and growth beds, and the location and dip of the outer limit of folding in pregrowth and growth beds. Complex structural and stratigraphic patterns develop if the rate of aggradation/erosion relative to the rate of fault displacement changes through time. The experimental models (with dry sand and wet clay) show that several deformational styles can accommodate extensional fault-bend folding. In sand models, a few, relatively major, secondary antithetic normal faults accommodate most hanging wall deformation. Pregrowth layers, although faulted, remain flat. The effective shear direction parallels the antithetic normal faults, and the shear angle is about 60 ~ ~ In clay models, numerous, relatively minor, secondary normal faults (antithetic and synthetic) and cataclastic flow accommodate most hanging wall deformation. The deformed pregrowth and growth layers dip gently toward the main fault. The effective shear angle (35 ~ ~) is considerably less than the dip of the antitheti...|$|R
30|$|A {{variety of}} {{geophysical}} datasets {{have proven to}} be useful in structural analysis of geothermal systems. 2 D seismic reflection data can provide detailed information about fault structure (e.g., Louie et al. 2011; Queen et al. 2016). General basin <b>shape,</b> <b>faults</b> that control major topographic or structural relief, and the general dip/dip direction of strata, at the very least, are commonly interpretable. Discrete stratigraphic packages may be evident on seismic reflection profiles, especially at shallow levels above any volcanic material. Detailed stratigraphic information at deeper levels (especially, beneath thick volcanics), however, is not typically interpretable from reflection data. This is the result of complex velocity structure in highly faulted areas, high acoustic attenuation due to relatively thick volcanic sections, and/or low impedance contrasts within Cenozoic volcanic rocks or between the Cenozoic section and the pre-Cenozoic basement. Although steeply dipping faults may not be directly imaged, reflector discontinuity and lateral changes in reflection character can reliably indicate faults. Faults are easier to interpret at shallower levels, but they may need to be projected, with their specific locations at depth informed by downhole data or geophysical modeling.|$|R

40|$|Fault-related folds in fold-and-thrust {{belts and}} accretionary prisms are {{commonly}} simulated by three end-member classes of geometric models: décollement folding, fault-propagation folding, and fault-bend folding. A given model produces a fold shape {{that depends on}} the amount of shortening, the <b>fault</b> <b>shape</b> and, eventually, the fault propagation history. The great variety of geometric solutions implies that the final fold shape is adequate to distinguish among different folding mechanisms only in a limited suite of cases. Additional information to better constrain fold kinematics is provided by the analysis of growth strata patterns, which passively register the progressive evolution of deformation in the substratum. Availability of growth strata pattern templates associated with different geometric and kinematic solutions provides a useful tool for inferring the dominant kinematic pathways of natural thrust-related structures. In this paper, we present growth strata patterns associated with double-edge fault-propagation folding. The influence of the sedimentation rate, the <b>fault</b> <b>shape,</b> and the <b>fault</b> S/P ratio (i. e. slip versus ramp propagation rate) on growth strata architectures are investigated. Geometrical modelling and application to natural examples indicate that double-edge fault-propagation anticlines are characterised by growth triangles on both limbs.

40|$|X-ray tomographic image {{reconstruction}} {{consists of}} determining an object function from its projections. In many {{applications such as}} non-destructive testing, we look for a fault region (air) in a homogeneous, known background (metal). The image reconstruction problem then becomes {{the determination of the}} shape of the default region. Two approaches can be used: modeling the image as a binary Markov random field and estimating the pixels of the image, or modeling the <b>shape</b> of the <b>fault</b> and estimating it directly from the projections. In this work we model the <b>fault</b> <b>shape</b> by a deformable polygonal disc or a deformable polyhedral volume and propose a new method for directly estimating the coordinates of its vertices from a very limited number of its projections. The basic idea is not new, but in other competing methods, in general, the <b>fault</b> <b>shape</b> is modeled by a small number of parameters (polygonal shapes with very small number of vertices, snakes and deformable templates) and these parameters are estimated either by least squares or by maximum likelihood methods. We propose modeling the <b>shape</b> of the <b>fault</b> region by a polygon with a large number of vertices, allowing modeling of nearly any shape and estimation of its vertices' coordinates directly from the projections by defining the solution as the minimizer of an appropriate regularized criterion. This formulation can also be interpreted as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate in a Bayesian estimation framework. To optimize this criterion we use either a simulated annealing or a special purpose deterministic algorithm based on iterated conditional modes (ICM). The simulated results are very encouraging, especially when the number and the angles of projections are very limited. Comment: Presented at MaxEnt 97.
