30|$|The {{education}} level is measured {{based on the}} International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). In order to facilitate the comparison and {{in line with the}} literature 16, the educational achievements are categorized in three groups (low, medium and high) taking the values 1, 2 and 3. The low education group comprises of the ISCED levels 0 to 2 (early childhood education to lower secondary education). The medium level covers the ISCED levels 3 to 4 (upper secondary education to <b>short-cycle</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>education)</b> while the high {{education level}} subsumes the ISCED levels 5 and 6 (bachelor or equivalent to doctoral or equivalent). These education variables are constructed as simple averages over the three categories taking the values 1, 2 or 3. With respect to the source countries, the education level is calculated over all individuals living in the EU- 10 countries or EU- 2 countries. For example, the education variable for the 15 - 24 year old EU- 2 source cohort denotes the average education level of the 15 - 24 year old Bulgarians and Romanians together. The same logic applies to the calculation of the proportion of employed persons in the source.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility on crime in Sweden. The hypothesis tested is that continuing to higher education decreases crime rates since it allows young people to escape inactivity and idleness, which are known to trigger crime. However, to qualify for <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> individuals have to meet the eligibility requirements in upper-secondary school. <b>Tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility may therefore affect crime rates. Methods: This paper uses a panel data set of 287 Swedish municipalities over the period 1998 – 2010 to estimate the <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility effect on crime. However, estimating educational effects on crime is challenging, because investment in education is an endogenous decision. In Sweden, substantial grade inflation, increased <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility by more than 6 % points between 1998 and 2003. Thus, since the eligibility increase is exogenous to the educational achievements of a student cohort, i. e. not accompanied by a corresponding knowledge increase, {{we can use the}} increase to identify the effect of <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility on crime. Results: It is found that increasing the <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility rate decreases both property and violent crime substantially. Conclusions: The results show that when young people have the opportunity to attend <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> and thus escape unemployment or inactivity, their propensity to commit crime decreases...|$|R

40|$|Cross-border <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> has {{received}} growing attention {{in recent years}} as more and more students choose to study abroad, enrol in foreign educational programmes and institutions in their home country, or simply use the Internet to take courses at colleges or universities in other countries. This trend has led governments and education stakeholders to reconsider many aspects of their <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> systems and strategies. While many countries focus on the possible benefits of exporting education services, they often overlook the potential benefits of importing such services as a complement to existing domestic <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> offerings; importation of education services can help strengthen or accelerate national development goals. An import strategy for <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> considers the use of foreign education services, and encourages the outward mobility of domestic students and scholars or the inward mobility of foreign educational programmes and institutions. Governments are often ill-prepared to reap the benefits of cross-border <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> as well as to assure education quality. In 2002, in Constructing Knowledge Societies: New Challenges for <b>Tertiary</b> <b>Education,</b> the World Bank analysed how <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> contributes to building up a country’s capacity for participation in an increasingly knowledge-based world economy and outlined policy options for <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> that have the potential to enhance economic growth and reduce poverty.
