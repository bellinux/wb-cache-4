The objective was to determine which reactor, conversion and radiator technologies would best fulfill future Megawatt Class Nuclear Space Power System Requirements. The requirement was 10 megawatts for 5 years of full power operation and 10 years system life on orbit. A variety of liquid metal and gas cooled reactors, static and dynamic conversion systems, and passive and dynamic radiators were considered.

2500|$|The COP {{increases}} {{as the temperature}} difference, or [...] "lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g. underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g. the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional <b>heating</b> <b>radiators</b> require high water temperatures, reducing the COP that can be attained, and affecting the choice of heat pump technology.|$|R
40|$|Low-carbon {{transition}} {{plans for}} temperate and sub-polar regions typically involve some electrification of space heating. This poses challenges to electricity system operation and market design, as it increases overall demand and alters the temporal patterns of that demand. One {{response to the}} challenge is to ‘smarten’ electrical heating, enabling it to respond to network conditions by storing energy at times of plentiful supply, releasing it in response to customer demands and offering rapid-response ancillary services to the grid. Shared operation of domestic electrical heating, in such a scenario, may imply changes in everyday heating practices and will change the number of system stakeholders, their activities and how they relate to each other. This paper sets out some practical and theoretical issues relating to the potential for residential demand response via electric <b>storage</b> <b>heating,</b> drawing on academic and policy-related literature and on material from a current research project. It offers a brief history of residential <b>storage</b> <b>heating</b> and recent developments, paying particular attention to customer experience; considers the role of distributed storage in energy transitions and associated questions of value; outlines how agency and value in a smart system may be distributed between stakeholders; and assesses continuity and change in <b>storage</b> <b>heating.</b> While the paper focuses on <b>storage</b> <b>heating,</b> many of the issue raised apply to heat pumps, given their functional similarities with storage heaters and water heaters. The paper concludes with some conditions to be met if smart <b>storage</b> <b>heating</b> is to succeed in the twin tasks of providing effective customer service and demand response, and sets out questions for further research into demand response and heating practices. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>storage</b> {{for high}} {{temperature}} applications {{can be performed}} by several <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> techniques. Very promising <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> methods are based on thermochemical gas solid reactions. Most known systems are metal oxide/steam (metal hydroxides), carbon dioxide (metal carbonates), and metal/hydrogen (metal hydrides) systems. These <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> materials posses high gravimetric and volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> densities and because of separation of the reaction products and their storage in different locations heat losses can be avoided. The reported volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> densities are 615, 1340 and 1513 [kWh m− 3] for calcium hydroxide Ca(OH) 2, calcium carbonate CaCO 3 and magnesium iron hydride Mg 2 FeH 6 respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> in a <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> units top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit <b>heated</b> from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit <b>heated</b> from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> model was developed to combine <b>heat</b> supply, <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> and <b>heat</b> distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit and the heat transfer rate to the surroundings. The heat supplied to the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit was based on calculations of batch combustion of wood. The results showed that none of the tests for the PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit, or the optimization of the PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit, reached the requirements of heat transfer to the surroundings set for the model. The length of the PCM <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> unit was also proved to be excessive...|$|R
