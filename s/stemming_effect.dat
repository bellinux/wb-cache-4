40|$|Scintillating silica {{optical fibre}} sensors have shown {{interesting}} results for ionizing radiation monitoring {{and therefore can}} be useful for dosimetry applications in medical field. In fact, they enable a remote, punctual and real-time dose assessment (Mones et al., 2008). In addition, the high radiation hardness that characterizes silica optical fibers, makes these systems promising for radiation detection in high energy physics experiments (Chiodini et al., 2014). This work aims to review the recent progresses {{in the development and}} characterization of rare-earth doped silica fibres. The radioluminescent and dosimetric properties of Ce, Eu, Yb and Pr-doped silica matrices are described and the advantages and challenges in the use of these materials for dosimetry in medical and technical applications are shown. In radiation therapy, an effective approach to deal with the <b>stem</b> <b>effect,</b> that is a spurious luminescent signal in the UV-VIS region due to the irradiation of the passive fibre (i. e. Cerenkov light and intrinsic fluorescence) must be considered. The opportunity to use Yb as dopant and to exploit its near infrared emission for the <b>stem</b> <b>effect</b> optical discrimination is presented (Veronese et al., 2014). In the field of high energy physics, radioluminescent optical fibres could find applications in future detectors and calorimeters.

40|$|International audienceObjective:Small animal image-guided irradiators have {{recently}} been developed to mimic the delivery techniques of clinical radiotherapy. A dosemeter adapted to millimetric beams of medium-energy X-rays is then required. This work presents the characterization of a dosemeter prototype for this particular application. Methods:A scintillating optical fibre dosemeter (called DosiRat) has been implemented to perform real-time dose measurements with the dedicated small animal X-RAD® 225 Cx (Precision X-Ray, Inc., North Branford, CT) irradiator. Its sensitivity, <b>stem</b> <b>effect,</b> stability, linearity and measurement precision were determined in large field conditions for three different beam qualities, consistent with small animal irradiation and imaging parameters. Results:DosiRat demonstrates good sensitivity and stability; excellent air kerma and air kerma rate linearity; and a good repeatability for air kerma rates > 1 [*]mGy[*]s− 1. The <b>stem</b> <b>effect</b> {{was found to be}} negligible. DosiRat showed limited precision for low air kerma rate measurements (< 1 [*]mGy[*]s− 1), typically for imaging protocols. A positive energy dependence was found that can be accounted for by calibrating the dosemeter at the needed beam qualities. Conclusion:The dosimetric performances of DosiRat are very promising. Extensive studies of DosiRat energy dependence are still required. Further developments will allow to reduce the dosemeter size to ensure millimetric beams dosimetry and perform small animal in vivo dosimetry. Advances in knowledge:Among existing point dosemeters, very few are dedicated to both medium-energy X-rays and millimetric beams. Our work demonstrated that scintillating fibre dosemeters are suitable and promising tools for real-time dose measurements in the small animal field of interest...|$|R

They also present {{the application of the}} CMRP DMG in the dosimetric verification of a clinical IMRT plan. Results: The detector response changed by 23 % for a 390 -fold change in the dose per pulse. A correction function is derived to correct for this effect. The strip detector depth dose curve agrees with the Farmer ion chamber within 0. 8 %. The <b>stem</b> <b>effect</b> was negligible (0. 2 %). The dose linearity was excellent for the dose range of 3 - 300 cGy. A uniformity correction method is described to correct for variations in the individual detector pixel responses. The detector showed an over-response relative to tissue dose at lower photon energies with the maximum dose response at 75 kVp nominal photon energy. Penumbra studies using a Varian Clinac 21 EX at 1. 5 and 10. 0 cm depths were measured to be 2. 77 and 3. 94 mm for the secondary collimators, 3. 52 and 5. 60 mm for the multileaf collimator rounded leaf ends, respectively. Point doses measured with the strip detector were compared to doses measured with EBT film and doses predicted by the Philips Pinnacle treatment planning system. The differences were 1. 1 %+/- 1. 8 % and 1. 0 %+/- 1. 6 %, respectively. They demonstrated the high temporal resolution capability of the detector readout system, which will allow one to investigate the temporal dose pattern of IMRT and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the dosimetric properties of a synthetic single crystal diamond Schottky diode for accurate relative dose measurements in {{large and small}} field high-energy clinical proton beams. Methods: The dosimetric properties of a synthetic single crystal diamond detector were assessed by comparison with a reference Markus parallel plate ionization chamber, an Exradin A 16 microionization chamber, and Exradin T 1 a ion chamber. The diamond detector was operated at zero bias voltage at all times. Comparative dose distribution measurements were performed by means of Fractional depth dose curves and lateral beam profiles in clinical proton beams of energies 155 and 250 MeV for a 14 cm square cerrobend aperture and 126 MeV for 3, 2, and 1 cm diameter circular brass collimators. ICRU Report No. 78 recommended beam parameters were used to compare fractional depth dose curves and beam profiles obtained using the diamond detector and the reference ionization chamber. Warm-up/stability of the detector response and linearity with dose were evaluated in a 250 MeV proton beam and dose rate dependence was evaluated in a 126 MeV proton beam. <b>Stem</b> <b>effect</b> and the azimuthal angle dependence of the diode response were also evaluated. Results: A maximum deviation in diamond detector signal from the average reading of less than 0. 5 % was found during the warm-up irradiation procedure. The detector response showed a good linear behavior {{as a function of}} dose with observed deviations below 0. 5 % over a dose range from 50 to 500 cGy. The detector response was dose rate independent, with deviations below 0. 5 % in the investigated dose rates ranging from 85 to 300 cGy/min. <b>Stem</b> <b>effect</b> and azimuthal angle dependence of the diode signal were within 0. 5 %. Fractional depth dose curves and lateral beam profiles obtained with the diamond detector were in good agreement with those measured using reference dosimeters. Conclusions: The observed dosimetric properties of the synthetic single crystal diamond detector indicate that its behavior is proton energy independent and dose rate independent in the investigated energy and dose rate range and it is suitable for accurate relative dosimetric measurements in large as well as in small field high energy clinical proton beams. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Intensity {{modulated}} {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) allows {{the delivery of}} escalated radiation dose to tumor while sparing adjacent critical organs.
