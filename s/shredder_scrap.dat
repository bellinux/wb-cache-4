40|$|ABSTRACT: A three-layer {{cover system}} {{consisting}} of a barrier layer, drainage layer, and a cover layer is commonly used to cap abandoned landfills, and {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires could serve as an effective drainage media for such systems. To evaluate the transmissivity (flow capacity per unit cross sectional area in the lateral direction) of a <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tire drainage layer in a landfill cover system, laboratory transmissivity tests were performed using two different size tire shreds, large (TS 1) and small (TS 2), that were subjected to simulated landfill cover conditions. The effects of normal stress and the use of a geotextile at the top, bottom, or at both interfaces of the three layer-simulated cover system were investigated. The transmissivity was high and remained almost the same in the tests when the geotextile was used at both the interfaces. In the case when there was no geotextile at the top interface, however, the amount of soil migration into the voids of the tire shreds from the cover soil layer was high. The absence of the geotextile at the bottom interface had a minimal effect on the transmissivity, but the absence of the geotextile at this interface may cause the protrusion of <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires into the barrier layer. Based on the results and observations in this study, the presence of a geotextile at the interfaces, irrespective of the tire shred size and stress conditions, prevented a reduction in the performance of the drainage layer...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year in the}} United States land slips occur under road {{embankments}} {{because a}} weak plane in the in-situ soil is overloaded and fails. One preferred repair technique is to return the road to its original elevation using a lightweight fill instead of normal soil. When properly done, this technique prevents the road structure from overloading the weak slip plane again. In the past, sawdust or chipped lumber {{has been used as}} the fill material. However, these materials tend to rot in repeated wet/dry cycles and are becoming more expensive with the rising cost of wood fiber. This technology brief provides information on a viable alternative to conventional lightweight fill ⎯ using <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires. Tires As Lightweight Embankments Road embankments have the potential to use an enormous quantity of tires.

40|$|Lateritic unpaved {{roads are}} widely spread in Malaysian territory. These red-yellow {{lateritic}} layers normally have poor engineering properties such as large settlements, low shear strength and bearing capacity. Major difficulties may arise during {{the construction of}} a lateritic layer which are deterioration and diffusion of dust on the road surface, and also durability problems associated with cyclic loading repetition. Waste tires are encountered all over the world in increasing numbers. <b>Shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires and crumbssoil mixtures are currently used {{in a wide range of}} civil engineering structures like lightweight fills for slopes, retaining walls, embankments etc. This thesis presents and discusses the condition of lateritic soil stabilized by using the shredded tires, tire crumbs and traditional active additive materials such as cement and lime for unpaved road application. Experimental tests such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), california bearing ratio (CBR), consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial, permeability, and highway accelerated loading instrument (HALI) tests were carried out to evaluate the microstructures, elements, durability and geotechnical strength properties of tropical laterite soils. These tests were conducted to determine the influence of stabilizers on the surface of the lateritic soil layers in terms of loading cycles, and short term behaviour. The quick undrained triaxial and CBR tests were carried out on samples at different curing times to establish the optimum mix design. The strength parameters were determined from CU triaxial tests on unsoaked samples. The HALI test was used to study the strength, durability and deformation after determination of the best formulation for each stabilizer in combination with laterite soils under accelerated trafficking load, simultaneously. The close range Photogrammetry technique was also used to capture images of deformed untreated and treated surface. The camera data were analysed using software known as Australis, and Surfer 10 were used to evaluate the performance of unpaved road stabilization with traditional active additives and waste tires. After eliciting of results and data and use of the comparison curves, the behaviour of stabilized soil with different combination were determined. The highest and lowest permeability were STc (soil and tire crumbs) and SC (soil and cement) at 14 days, respectively. The highest CBR values occurred for SC on unsoaked condition in 14 days. The HALI test shows that the highest reduction in settlement was exhibited by SL (soil- 6 %lime) after 14 days curing. Also, the experimental results show that 6 % of lime/cement and 6 % of shredded tires/tires crumbs changed the soil strength, durability, and permeability properties of the lateritic soil for unpaved road applications. The results indicate that the <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tire and crumbs mixed with active additive had reduced the settlement significantly and also had increased the strength. The analysis of data by close range Photogrammetry technique shows a close approximation to the data obtained from LVDT’s equipment (less than 4. 5 % variance).

Tests were carried out at vertical stresses up to 600 kPa, representing landfill depths of up to about 60 m. Generally whole tyres and larger-size segments compress more in overall volume terms on initial loading than smaller size shreds. At vertical stresses greater than about 80 kPa, however, the differences on a graph of dry density or porosity plotted against vertical stress are much smaller. The proportion of voids that are not free-draining decreases with compression for whole tyres, as cup-like structures capable of retaining water flatten out. For tyre chips, the proportion of non-drainable voids increases with compression, suggesting that flow pathways are being lost. The dependence of the compressive behaviour of tyres and tyre chips on the particle shape is discussed, and the need for a more detailed and rigorous way of characterising particle size and shape is highlighted...|$|R

However, {{there is a lack of}} studies analyzing potential solutions to this problem, among others, because of a lack of component- and alloy-specific information in the models. In this study, we developed a dynamic model of aluminum in the global vehicle stock (distinguishing 5 car segments, 14 components, and 7 alloy groups). The forecasts made up to the year 2050 for the demand for vehicle components and alloy groups, for the scrap supply from discarded vehicles, and for the effects of different ELV management options. Furthermore, we used a source-sink diagram to identify alloys that could potentially serve as alternative sinks for the growing scrap supply. Dismantling the relevant components could remove up to two-thirds of the aluminum from the ELV stream. However, the use of these components for alloy-specific recycling is currently limited because of the complex composition of components (mixed material design and applied joining techniques), as well as provisions that practically prevent the production of safety-relevant cast parts from scrap. In addition, dismantling is more difficult for components that are currently penetrating rapidly. Therefore, advanced alloy sorting seems to be a crucial step that needs to be developed over the coming years to avoid a future scrap surplus and prevent negative energy use and emission consequences.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a new re-melting process for fine or light gauge aluminum scrap products that exhibits dramatic improvements in energy efficiency. Light gauge aluminum scrap in the form of chips, turnings, and borings has historically been underutilized in the aluminum recycling process due to its high surface area to volume ratio resulting in low melt recovery. Laboratory scale consolidation experiments were performed using loose aluminum powder as a modeling material as well as <b>shredded</b> aluminum wire <b>scrap.</b> The processing parameters necessary to create consolidated aluminum material were determined. Additionally, re-melting experiments using consolidated and unconsolidated aluminum powder confirmed the hypothesis that metal recovery using consolidated material will significantly improve by as much as 20 %. Based on this research, it is estimated that approximately 495 billion Btu/year can be saved by implementation of this technology in one domestic aluminum rolling plant alone. The energy savings are realized by substituting aluminum scrap for primary aluminum, which requires large amounts of energy to produce. While there will be an initial capital investment, companies will benefit from the reduction of dependence on primary aluminum thus saving considerable costs. Additionally, the technology will allow companies to maintain in-house alloy scrap, rather than purchasing from other vendors and eliminate the need to discard the light gauge scrap to landfills...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} the design of vehicles, end-of-life vehicle (ELV) management, and global material production using aluminum as an example. Vehicle manufacturing, material industries and ELV management face different challenges. An important challenge for vehicle manufacturers is the design of lightweight vehicles to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the use phase for which an increased use of aluminum of different alloys is an attractive option. The aluminum industry has an interest in reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions, which can be accomplished effectively through recycling. ELV management must be improved to enable the first two systems to use aluminum scrap in a sustainable manner. Today, the sorting of different alloys is limited. As a result of having mixed scrap at the ELV phase and limited opportunities for aluminum refining, there may be a future scrap surplus that cannot be absorbed by the aluminum-recycling sink, which is passenger cars. These three sectors are connected through material flows, and a change in one of the sectors can severely affect the others' options for reaching their goals. This thesis addresses the following questions: 1) How are the dynamics of the global vehicle stock changing the boundary condition for aluminum recycling? 2) What are the most effective interventions to minimize a future aluminum scrap surplus? 3) What are the options for material substitution in vehicles to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions over time? To answer these questions, a system approach is employed to analyze how these three sectors are linked and to explore options for all sectors to reach their objectives in the long term. This thesis employs global bottom-up stock-driven models of the aluminum cycle. A basic model was used to identify the scrap surplus problem. A refined model with segments, components and alloys resolution combined with a source-sink diagram was used to evaluate different solution options. In addition, a global dynamic fleetrecycling MFA model was developed to simulate the future impacts of material substitutions of conventional steel with high-strength steel (HSS) and aluminum on material cycles, energy use and GHG emissions related to the global passenger vehicle fleet. The main findings in this thesis are: i) a continuation of the current practice of cascadic use would eventually result in a scrap surplus because this practice depends on the continuous and fast growth of the secondary casting stock in the global vehicle fleet, a condition that is unlikely to be met. Model simulation indicated a non-recyclable scrap surplus by approximately 2018 ± 5 if no alloy sorting is introduced. The surplus is potentially substantial and could grow to reach a level of 0. 4 - 2 kg/cap/yr by 2050, thereby significantly reducing the option of the aluminum industry to reduce its energy consumption through recycling. ii) Drastic changes in ELV management practices are necessary {{to make use of the}} growing scrap flow in the future, including further dismantling and efficient component-to-component recycling, alloy sorting of mixed <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap,</b> and designing recycling-friendly alloys that function as alternative sinks for aluminum scrap. iii) Light-weighting has the potential to substantially reduce global emissions of vehicles (9 - 18 gigatons cumulative CO 2 -eq. between 2010 and 2050). In the medium term (5 - 15 years), global emissions reductions from substituting standard steel with aluminum are similar to those achievable by HSS; however, over a longer term (after 15 - 20 years), substitution with aluminum can reduce total emissions more effectively, provided that the wrought aluminum will be recycled back into automotive wrought aluminum. The environmental consequences of products in general and passenger cars in particular have led to an increasing awareness of the dependencies between the shaping of vehicles and the shaping of the environment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies have formulated quality goals for the environment, such as the 2 -degree target, and have introduced emissions standards, thereby extending the responsibility of automobile manufacturers to the use phase. On the materials side, legislation has been introduced to extend producer responsibility, mainly with the goal of avoiding toxic substances and reducing the amount of waste, as is noted in different end-of-life vehicle (ELV) legislation and directives. The current ELV directives do not sufficiently address the management of material systems as a whole or quality issues related to material recovery. To harmonize ELV management with goals for the global aluminum cycle and its impacts for the environment, it is essential to understand how the above-mentioned systems interact...|$|R
