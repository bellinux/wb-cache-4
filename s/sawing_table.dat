The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing. In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves <b>sawing</b> <b>table</b> to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate. The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued {{to be done with}} a mallet and chisel. An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of [...] "slab", thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes, for example flooring, tombstones and billiard tables.|$|E

5000|$|In 1843, the Padarn Railway {{became the}} first quarry railway to use steam locomotives, and the {{transport}} of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852. The Corris Railway opened as the horse-worked Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad in 1859, connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the River Dyfi. The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863, and the Talyllyn Railway was opened in 1866 to serve the Bryn Eglwys quarry above the village of Abergynolwyn. Bryn Eglwys grew {{to be one of}} the largest quarries in mid Wales, employing 300 men and producing 30% of the total output of the Corris district. The Cardigan Railway was opened in 1873, partly to carry slate traffic, and enabled the Glogue quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men.Mechanization was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine.

5000|$|<b>Table</b> <b>saws</b> are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} woodworking tool. In the united States, 10 finger amputations by <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> occur every day.

50|$|For miter joints {{occurring}} at angles other than 90°, for materials {{of the same}} cross-section the proper cut angle must be determined so that the two pieces to be joined meet flush (i.e. one piece's mitered end is not longer than the adjoining piece). To find the cut angle divide the angle at which the two pieces meet by two. Technically, two different cut angles are required; one for each piece, where the second angle is 90° plus the aforementioned cut angle, but due to angular limitations in common cutting implements (hand circular <b>saws,</b> <b>table</b> <b>saws)</b> a single angle is required and is used to cut the first piece {{in one direction and}} the second piece in the opposite direction.|$|R
25|$|In {{a modern}} <b>table</b> <b>saw,</b> {{the depth of}} the cut is varied by moving the blade up and down: the higher the blade {{protrudes}} above the table, the deeper the cut that is made in the material. In some early <b>table</b> <b>saws,</b> the blade and arbor were fixed, and the table was moved up and down to expose more or less of the blade. The angle of cut is controlled by adjusting the angle of blade. Some earlier <b>saws</b> angled the <b>table</b> to control the cut angle.|$|R
5000|$|Power miter saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple miter saws allowed the <b>saw</b> <b>table</b> to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. Compound miter saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound miters to be cut. Miter saws with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
50|$|While {{the blade}} sizes are {{interchangeable}} with <b>table</b> <b>saws,</b> a miter blade is optimized for short cuts {{across the grain}} of the wood with little pull, where as <b>table</b> <b>saws</b> are optimized for long rip cuts with the grain and pulling the material into the blade.|$|R

50|$|Graig Ddu Quarry (sometimes {{known as}} Craig Ddu) (loc.

Although output {{was only about}} 3000 tons a year (3140 tons in 1882), it reputedly has 36 <b>saw</b> <b>tables</b> and {{the same number of}} dressing machines on site. As with others in the area, the quarry suffered from a lack of water, resulting in the siting of the mill some distance away, at a lower level.|$|R
