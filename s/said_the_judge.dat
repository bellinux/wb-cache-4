25|$|The bombing {{occurred}} at 4:58 PM on 19 July 1992, 57 {{days after the}} bombing of Capaci, in which Borsellino's friend, anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, had been killed {{with his wife and}} police escort. The only survivor of the escort in the massacre of Via D'Amelio, Antonino Vullo, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> had stayed in his summer residence outside Palermo from 1:30pm to around 4:00pm, when he and the escort drove to Via D'Amelio in the Sicilian capital, where he was to meet his mother. When they arrived, Vullo and the other agents noticed nothing unusual except some parked cars. The car in which Borsellino had been travelling exploded, along with one of the escort cars, while Vullo was sitting in a third car.|$|E
25|$|After her arrest, she {{was allowed}} to retire early from the LAPD; she {{was held in the}} Los Angeles County Jail. A bail hearing was not held for almost six months. Judge Robert J. Perry {{surprised}} both sides when he set the amount at $10 million in cash, well above what the defense had suggested and more than twice what prosecutors had proposed. The case against her was very strong, he said, and thus she might well be at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> did not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E

California, [...] held that a California extension of the statute of limitations for sex-related child abuse could not be applied to previously time-barred prosecutions.|$|E
2500|$|Houdini became {{widely known}} as [...] "The Handcuff King." [...] He toured England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Russia. In each city, Houdini {{challenged}} local police to restrain him with shackles and lock {{him in their}} jails. In many of these challenge escapes, he was first stripped nude and searched. In Moscow, he escaped from a Siberian prison transport van, claiming that, had he been unable to free himself, {{he would have had}} to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept. In Cologne, he sued a police officer, Werner Graff, who alleged that he made his escapes via bribery. Houdini won the case when he opened the judge's safe (he later <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> had forgotten to lock it). With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for Queen Victoria. He then arranged a grand reception where he presented his mother in the dress to all their relatives. Houdini said it was the happiest day of his life. In 1904, Houdini returned to the U.S. and purchased a house for $25,000 (...) , a brownstone at 278W. 113th Street in Harlem, New York City.|$|E

5000|$|Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, filed {{a motion}} to disqualify Judge Lester, alleging that Lester had made disparaging and {{gratuitous}} remarks about his client in the July 2012 bond order. O'Mara <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge's</b> statement that he believed Zimmerman had misled the court at his first hearing was an indication of bias against Zimmerman and would impact Zimmerman's ability {{to get a fair}} trial.

50|$|The House of Lords allowed Argyll’s {{appeal and}} <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge’s</b> {{exercise}} of discretion was correct {{so that no}} specific performance could be awarded.
