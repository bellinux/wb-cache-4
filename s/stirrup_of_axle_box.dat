40|$|Abstract:Against the {{deficiencies}} of traditional time domain and {{frequency domain analysis}} in detecting wheel-rail (W-R) system hidden risks which wheel flats generate, the time-frequency characteristics of W-R shock caused by wheel flat are analyzed and the vehicle-rail dynamic model with wheel flat is investigated. The 10 degrees of freedom (DOF) vehicle model is built up. 90 -DOF rail model is constructed. The wheel flat excitation model is built up. The vehicle-track coupling dynamic model including wheel flat excitation is set up through nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The vertical accelerations <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> are calculated at different speeds and flat sizes based on the vehicle-track coupling dynamic model with wheel flat. Frequency slice wavelet transform (FSWT) is employed to analyze time-frequency characteristics <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> accelerations to detect the W-R noncontact risks s which the traditional time domain or frequency domain method does not analyze. The {{results show that the}} small flat size and high running speed lead to high frequency W-R impact. Large flat size and high running speed result in momentary loss of W-R contact, and there exist security risks between wheel and rail. The conclusion that the phase <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> accelerations is same to W-R forces lays a theoretical foundation of monitoring W-R contact safety from <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration instead <b>of</b> traditional W-R force detection...|$|R
40|$|Rail welds {{are widely}} used in {{high-speed}} railways and short-wave irregularities usually appear due to limitations in welding technology. These irregularities can excite a high wheel/rail force and are regarded as {{the main cause of}} deterioration in track structures. To measure this fierce force (or deterioration of the rail weld), <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration is treated as an effective and economic measure, though an exact quantitative relation between these two quantities remains elusive. This paper aims to develop such a relation in order to provide a new theoretical basis and an analysis method for monitoring and controlling weld geometry irregularity. To better understand the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, the paper consists of two parts: an observation and a numerical simulation <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration by rail welds. Based on measured data from field tests, <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration at rail welds was found to have high-frequency vibrations in two frequency bands (i. e., 350 – 500 Hz and 1000 – 1200 Hz). Upon analyzing the vibration characteristics in time–frequency domains, the exact location of the rail weld irregularity could be identified. Subsequently, a 3 D high-speed wheel/rail rolling contact finite element model was employed to investigate the effect of rail weld geometry on <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, and led to the discovery that the weld length and depth determine the vibration frequency and amplitude <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, respectively. A quantitative relation between <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration and wheel/rail force has also been determined. Finally, we propose an approach for real-time health detection of rail welds and discuss the influence of other defects and rail welds on the acceleration signal <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box...</b>|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (<b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide). <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide.

The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves down. The downward movement <b>of</b> the <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R

Now, {{condition-based}} maintenance <b>of</b> train <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing {{has been a}} research hotspot around the world. Vibration signals generated by train <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing have nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics. The methods used in traditional bearing fault diagnosis do not work well with the train <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> To solve this problem, an effective method <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing fault diagnosis based on multifeature parameters is presented in this paper. This method {{can be divided into}} three parts, namely, weak fault signal extraction, feature extraction, and fault recognition. In the first part, a db 4 wavelet is employed for denoising the original signals from the vibration sensors. In the second part, five time-domain parameters, five IMF energy-torque features, and two amplitude-ratio features are extracted. The latter seven frequency domain features are calculated based on the empirical mode decomposition and envelope spectrum analysis. In the third part, a fault classifier based on BP neural network is designed for automatic fault pattern recognition. A series of tests are carried out to verify the proposed method, which show that the accuracy is above 90 %...|$|R
50|$|The bottom <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide has a guide {{cap with}} {{perforations}} so {{that during the}} downward movement <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> guide in the lower spring seat, the oil in the dashpot rushes in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide.

40|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>boxes</b> (Fig. 1) {{support the}} weight of the car while {{rotating}} the axles.

Early detection of abnormality of bearings is needed in regions with heavy snowfall too, so we examined functions for cold and snow resistance to apply the system for the greater Tokyo area to cold regions. We installed a prototype system that reflected the examination results at Ugo-Ushijima Station on the Uetsu Line (in Akita City) in the period from December 2010 to September 2011. Using that, we investigated the effects low temperature, snow cover, and snowfall have on performance. Development for System for Cold Regions 2 The developed system measures temperature of components <b>of</b> an <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> that holds bearings. Specifically, it is a system using contactless infrared temperature sensors (infrared radiation thermometers) installed facing <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>of</b> running train cars as shown in Fig. 1. The system measures surface temperature <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> obliquely from below, and it gives an alert if it detects that a designated temperature is exceeded. Wheel detectors that are installed on the rail determine the position <b>of</b> each <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> By using three wheel detectors on each side, velocity of passing trains is calculated to identify the position <b>of</b> the <b>axles.</b> The system has a built-in heater to keep ambient temperature at 5 ºC or higher for stable operation of temperature sensors. As the sensors are an infrared type, {{there should be no}} obstacles between the system and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> to be measured. Furthermore, to apply the current system to cold regions, cold and snow resistance has to be enhanced. Taking into account those conditions and installation to lines along the coast of the Japan Sea (Uetsu Line and Ou Line), we set the following specification values for cold regions based on weather data in the previous five years at Niitsu, Akita, Odate and Hirosaki...|$|R

Not until the 1980s were Trofimoff valves and cylinder safety valves installed on some locomotives at RAW Meiningen. This improved the riding performance hugely when the engines ran without a train, something which was also noticeable in terms of savings in lubricants and fuel.|$|R

The behavior of a locomotive running in a curve is more complicated because the lateral forces appear between a flange of the wheel {{and the head of the}} rail in the contact zone, and the values of wheel slip are higher than for straight sections of track. These two factors are the main reasons for wheel wear. Theoretical and experimental investigations to reduce wear and to improve vehicle dynamics were made, and the results obtained show that an effective solution can be reached by the use of inclined links to the longitudinal axis of a bogie in the horizontal plane.

An attempt to determine a quantitative relationship between the characteristics of the accelerations and the track defects, <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration at a squat and a thermite weld were simulated through finite element modelling [5].

30|$|However, {{the inverse}} methods for {{determining}} the wheel–rail interaction forces described above are usually derived from vehicle system models. Consequently, these methods cannot avoid the complexity of wheel–rail creep force and normal contact force and are not applicable to nonlinear vehicle systems. To identify the nonlinear wheel–rail contact forces, solutions are obtained by combination of instrumented wheelset technology and advanced sensors in Japan. That is, Matsumoto et al.

40|$|A simple linear {{dynamical}} model {{shows that}} at normal running speeds of freight wagons, forced oscillations due to periodic track compliance are {{transferred to the}} overlying unsprung mass and significantly amplified. Due to these oscillations, a small gap opens and closes between the collar of a journal bearing and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> many times every second. The forces between these components reach peaks of over 10 tonnes. This is {{an environment in which}} wear of the soft spherical graphite iron <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> will eventually take place. Due to repeated unloadings of the weight on the bearing during oscillations, the bearing collar may slowly slip against the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wall. Although our calculations show that abrasive wear due to this slippage is negligible, the calculation raises general principles that apply to other possible wear mechanisms. If lifetime is proportional to hardness, we can estimate relative lifetimes of refurbished and new boxes.
