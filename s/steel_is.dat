5|$|Man of <b>Steel</b> <b>is</b> a 2013 superhero film {{featuring}} the DC Comics character Superman. It is a British-American venture produced by Legendary Pictures, DC Entertainment, Syncopy Inc., and Cruel and Unusual Films, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It {{is the first}} installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Zack Snyder, written by David S. Goyer, and stars Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, Ayelet Zurer, Christopher Meloni, and Russell Crowe. Man of <b>Steel</b> <b>is</b> a reboot of the Superman film series that retells the character's origin story. In the film, Clark Kent learns {{that he is a}} superpowered alien from the planet Krypton and assumes the role of mankind's protector as Superman, but finds himself having to prevent General Zod from destroying humanity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E
50|$|Ferritic and {{martensitic}} stainless <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> magnetic. Annealed {{austenitic stainless}} <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> non-magnetic. Work hardening can make {{austenitic stainless steels}} slightly magnetic.|$|R

50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>was</b> born in Ayrshire, Scotland, {{the son of}} John <b>Steel,</b> and <b>was</b> {{educated at}} public schools in Lorne and Dallegles. He worked as a farmer, and resided in Glenboro, Manitoba. In religion, <b>Steel</b> <b>was</b> a Presbyterian.|$|R
5|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>is</b> an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because of its high tensile {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{carbon content}} of <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of iron or <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> a process {{consisting of two}} main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron is converted to wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
50|$|Mushet <b>steel</b> <b>was</b> {{harder than}} {{standard}} water quenched <b>steel.</b> It <b>was</b> found that Mushet <b>steel</b> could <b>be</b> best hardened by submitting {{it to an}} air blast after forging.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crucible}} process {{continued to}} be used for specialty <b>steels,</b> but <b>is</b> today obsolete. Similar quality <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> now made with an electric arc furnace.

5|$|Zinc is most {{commonly}} used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (coating of iron or <b>steel)</b> <b>is</b> the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.|$|E
5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Crucible <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> steel {{that has}} been melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
30|$|The {{next step}} of the {{research}} study is the welding performance tests. Welding tests indicated that generally both <b>steels</b> can <b>be</b> used for Arctic service. The E 500 <b>steel</b> <b>was</b> welded by MMA, FCAW, and SAW, whereas F 500 W 35 -mm <b>steel</b> <b>was</b> welded by MIG/MAG and SAW.|$|R
50|$|Stainless <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> {{corrosion-resistant}} by nature, {{which might}} suggest that passivating them would be unnecessary. However, stainless <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> not completely impervious to rusting. One common mode of corrosion in corrosion-resistant <b>steels</b> <b>is</b> when small spots on the surface begin to rust because grain boundaries or embedded bits of foreign matter (such as grinding swarf) allow water molecules to oxidize some of the iron in those spots despite the alloying chromium. This is called rouging. Some grades of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>are</b> especially resistant to rouging; parts made from them may therefore forgo any passivation step, depending on engineering decisions.|$|R

5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. <b>Steel</b> <b>is</b> used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E
5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

Chaparral <b>Steel</b> <b>was</b> spun off from TXI and later {{purchased}} by Gerdau in 2007 for $4.2 billion. At that time, Chaparral <b>Steel</b> <b>was</b> the second-largest producer of structural steel beams in North America {{and a major}} producer of steel bar product.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{effects of}} {{ferritic}} rolling process on microstructures and mechanical properties especially drawability of ultra-low carbon (ULC) and Ti-stabilized interstitial-free (Ti-IF) <b>steels</b> <b>were</b> investigated and the precipitates of ferritic-rolled Ti-IF <b>steels</b> <b>were</b> also analyzed. The {{results show that}} good deep drawability are achieved as IF <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> ferritic rolled in good lubricant condition; on the contrary, lubricant condition has less influence on the deep drawability of ULC steels. And with the decrease of rolling temperature in ferrite region, deep drawability of Ti-IF <b>steels</b> <b>are</b> improved, but for ULC steels, when ferritic rolled at low temperature, the r-value is still less than one, which means insignificant deep drawability...|$|R
5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E

5|$|In June 2013, David S. Goyer {{confirmed}} that Man of <b>Steel</b> <b>is</b> {{the first film}} in the DC Extended Universe.

Later that year Goyer stated that he had interest in making a new feature film based on the titular character. In July 2015, Warner Bros announced plans to release a solo Green Lantern film titled Green Lantern Corps, with a release date scheduled for June 19, 2020. The film will be the eleventh installment of the DC Extended Universe. Hal Jordan and John Stewart will reportedly be the Green Lanterns focused on in the movie. In January 2016, it was reported that Goyer and Justin Rhodes will be writing the film's script and will also produce the film, with Geoff Johns and Jon Berg as executive producers.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a young Native American man {{is forced}} by several others to ingest snake venom. The venom causes him to hallucinate, {{and one of}} the men, Joe Reynard (Michael Greyeyes) asks him to {{describe}} his visions. However, the poisoned man screams in agony and dies. His body is later found when a construction site is being excavated by archaeologists. A mummified body from centuries earlier is also found; when Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) arrives to investigate, he notices similarities between both corpses.

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when <b>steel</b> <b>is</b> water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
