5|$|The current city flag of Provo, Utah, is {{described}} in section 1.05.010 of the municipal code as consisting of a light blue field and the city's seal at the center.

5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our <b>Sun,</b> <b>for</b> example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>for</b> this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
5|$|Most comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies with {{elongated}} elliptical orbits that take them {{close to the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>for</b> {{a part of their}} orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder. Comets are often classified according to the length of their orbital periods: The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{is based}} on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the <b>sun</b> <b>for</b> {{direction}} involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields (magnetoception), use visual landmarks as well as olfactory cues.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no <b>sun</b> <b>for</b> weeks.|$|E
5|$|The dwarf planet Pluto (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the Kuiper belt. When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the <b>Sun</b> <b>for</b> every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of the asteroid belt varies with {{the distance from the}} <b>Sun.</b> <b>For</b> dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200K (−73°C) at 2.2AU down to 165K (−108°C) at 3.2AU However, due to rotation, the surface {{temperature of}} an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.|$|E

5|$|Final reports {{indicate}} that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or <b>sun</b> <b>for</b> days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the <b>sun</b> <b>for</b> this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly {{visible to the naked}} eye. The star's metal abundance is ten times higher than the <b>Sun</b> <b>for</b> most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely {{visible to the naked eye}} is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E

5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the <b>Sun.</b> <b>For</b> example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts {{have been made to}} determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images {{at the beginning of this}} section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.|$|E
