5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore <b>shape,</b> <b>the</b> species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its setae. Setae are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In <b>shape,</b> <b>the</b> setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E

The study of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> firm seeks to characterise the dependencies between the features of products and the organizational possibilities of new firms. We intersect theories from the fields of management and design theory to examine <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> firm in the entrepreneurship context. From this study, opportunities are identified for research approaches to address the entanglement between <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> product and <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> firm.

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in <b>shape.</b> <b>The</b> overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m.

The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
