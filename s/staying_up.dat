5|$|The 2014–15 season saw Newcastle fail to win any {{of their}} first seven games, {{prompting}} fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before a six-game winning run in all competitions (including knocking holders Manchester City out of the League Cup) saw them climb to fifth in the table. After they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, Pardew left for Crystal Palace. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver {{was put in charge}} {{for the remainder of the}} season but came close to relegation, <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> on the final day with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with Jonás Gutiérrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.|$|E

25|$|Reading went to St James' Park to play Newcastle in the Premier League. The Royals {{were beaten}} 3–0 with goals from Obafemi Martins in the 18th minute, Michael Owen in the 43rd and Mark Viduka in the 57th. This {{was only the}} start of a bad month for the Royals. Reading played fellow relegation rivals Fulham at home. 24,221 fans saw a 2–0 defeat as Brian McBride scored within 25 minutes. The Royals' day was over after Fulham {{substitute}} Erik Nevland scored a 90th-minute goal to see the Reading's hopes of <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> getting harder by the game.|$|E
25|$|September yielded one {{victory in}} seven matches for Glamorgan, {{but as they}} were already relegated in the Championship and almost assured of <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> in the National League it mattered little. It began with an eight-wicket Championship loss and a League no-result with Northamptonshire, before they lost a Championship match inside two days against Sussex. Then {{followed}} two matches in the National League, a 5-run loss to Middlesex first, before C Trophy champions Hampshire were bowled out for 69, giving Glamorgan a 151-run victory. Their Championship season was rounded off on 18 September with another loss, their fourteenth of the season, and they also lost their final League match to Gloucestershire.|$|E

25|$|A strict {{schedule}} and good sleep hygiene are essential in maintaining any good effects of treatment. With treatment, {{some people with}} mild DSPD may sleep and function well with an earlier sleep schedule. Caffeine and other stimulant drugs to keep a person awake during the day may not be necessary, and should be avoided {{in the afternoon and}} evening, in accordance with good sleep hygiene. A chief difficulty of treating DSPD is in maintaining an earlier schedule after it has been established. Inevitable events of normal life, such as <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> late for a celebration or deadline, or having to stay in bed with an illness, tend to reset the sleeping schedule to its intrinsic late times.|$|E
25|$|His daytime job left Wentzel little {{opportunity}} to take photographs. However, he took courses in photography at the Corcoran School of Art and had several mentors at Underwood & Underwood. His friend Eric Menke bought Wentzel a copy of Paris de Nuit (Paris By Night), a book of nighttime photographs of Paris by the renowned Hungarian photographer Brassaï. Inspired by Brassaï's work, Wentzel began taking photographs of Washington, D.C., by night, sometimes <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> until dawn to learn night photography techniques and {{find new ways to}} photograph well-known buildings and landmarks. Wentzel submitted some of these prints to the Royal Photographic Society in early 1936, and {{over the next six months}} they were displayed in galleries throughout Europe—winning several prizes.|$|E
25|$|Cox {{enjoyed the}} {{closeness}} of Cynthia Lennon and Pattie Harrison, as they often went on holiday together, shopping, and celebrated Christmas. Starr promised that he would set up a nationwide hairdressing business for his wife, but the idea was later shelved, as she {{had to deal with}} looking after their children and being the wife of a Beatle. This would entail waiting with other Beatles' partners, at clubs like the Speakeasy Club, the Ad-Lib, or the Scotch of St James, or <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> all night, waiting for Starr to come home after a recording session, with a cooked meal waiting for him. She was also asked to look after voluminous fan club mail, and would personally answer letters. The Starrs were both interested in various arts, and collaborated on photo montages, paintings and simple sculptures together.|$|E

25|$|After arrival, Ronnie becomes miserable, defiant, and {{defensive}} toward all those around her, including handsome, popular Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) whose introduction involved crashing into her during a volleyball match, and accidentally spilling Ronnie's strawberry shake on her. She shrugs {{him off and}} meets Blaze, an outcast who lives with her boyfriend Marcus. While at a beach campfire, Marcus hits on Ronnie and Blaze mistakes this for Ronnie flirting with him. Angered by this, Blaze later frames Ronnie for shoplifting, causing her arrest. Later on, Ronnie discovers a Loggerhead Sea Turtle nest at the beach by her house and while protecting it, she meets Will again on his volunteer work for the aquarium. After a night of <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> to defend the turtle eggs from predators with Will, she discovers he is deeper than she expected, and begins to develop feelings for him.|$|E
25|$|In 1685, {{his only}} {{surviving}} grandson, Louis de Bourbon, married Louise Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes - eldest surviving daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. In mid-1686, Louise Françoise (later {{better known as}} Madame la Duchesse) caught smallpox while at Fontainebleau; it was the Prince himself who helped nurse the little Duchess back to health, {{to the point of}} <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> with her to help her eat. The Prince even forcibly stopped Louis XIV himself from seeing his daughter for his own safety. Despite Louise Françoise surviving and giving her husband ten children, the Prince himself became ill; most said it was from worry about her health. He himself died at the Palace of Fontainebleau. He was buried in the Église at Vallery, the traditional burial place of the Princes of Condé; Claire-Clémence, who outlived her husband, was buried at the Église Saint-Martin at the Château de Châteauroux, France in 1694.|$|E
25|$|However, despite {{constant}} {{success in}} limited overs cricket the county continued to struggle in First class cricket leading to coach Giles White {{moving into a}} Director of Cricket position and Dale Benkenstein being appointed the new coach {{at the beginning of}} 2014. He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over Glamorgan on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their First class performances {{at the beginning of the}} season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. James Vince took over as captain, having already become List A and T20 captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won four of their last five games, meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over Nottinghamshire in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from West Indian Fidel Edwards, and Yorkshire's victory over Sussex meant that Sussex and Worcestershire were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire <b>staying</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} Roman Candle), {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I talked him out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression...

500|$|Strong waves broke over sea {{walls in}} Charleston, {{spilling}} floodwaters onto coastal streets and homes. [...] Damage {{in the state}} was relatively light, and no serious injuries were reported. However, a gas station in Folly Beach was torn apart by the winds, and some structures along the coast sustained roof damage. In the Charleston Harbor, an empty tanker was forced aground on a sandbar by the winds. Throughout most areas, the storm was insignificant; a police sergeant in Summerville commented, [...] "All we've had were some trees blown over, hardly {{enough to make it}} worth <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> so late." ...|$|E
500|$|Lazzara and Nolan {{shared an}} apartment, often <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> talking until 5:00 am, and began showing each other {{compositions}} {{on which they}} were working. Neil Rubenstein, who later became the group's tour manager, would often find them composing songs with acoustic guitars. Taking Back Sunday had a room in Lindenhurst, New York, where they practiced and composed every night; their first song written was [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century". The band frequently recorded demos. The band wrote music together, while Lazzara and Nolan wrote lyrics. One member would typically {{come up with a}} part, which {{the rest of the group}} would expand into a song. Many songs feature Lazzara and Nolan use call-and-response vocals. By December 2001, the group signed to Chicago-based Victory Records and had enough material for an album.|$|E

When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she {{said that it was}} for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would really take a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. [...] "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" [...] Asch [...] "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit". Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.|$|E
500|$|Aged thirteen, Mao left Shaoshan Primary School, {{pleased to}} have gotten away from {{what he saw as}} its oppressive atmosphere. The {{decision}} had been made by his father, who wanted Mao to devote his attentions to the family business by working on the farm and managing the financial accounts. However, relations between him and his father became increasingly strained. Mao continued to read in his free time, often <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> late at night in his bedroom to read by candle light; this angered his father, who saw recreational reading as an unproductive pursuit. At this point he read a book which inspired his interest in politics: Zheng Guanying's Sheng-shih Wei-yen ("Words of Warning to an Affluent Age"). Published in 1893, the book lamented the deterioration of Chinese power in East Asia, and argued for technological, economic and political reform, believing that China could be strengthed if it abandoned its absolute monarchy and politically modelling itself on the representative democracies and constitutional monarchies of the Western world. His political views were shaped by protests [...] led by the Gelaohui, or Elder Brother Society [...] which erupted following a famine in Hunanese capital Changsha; Mao supported the protesters' demands, but the armed forces suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders. The famine spread to Shaoshan, where starving peasants seized his father's grain; disapproving of their actions as morally wrong, Mao nevertheless claimed sympathy for their situation.|$|E
500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E
