60|$|A narrow {{entrance}} was flanked {{on either side}} by a row of brasses, ranging upwards from the shipbrokers and the solicitors who occupied the ground floors, through a long succession of West Indian agents, architects, surveyors, and brokers, to the firm of which they were in quest. A winding stone <b>stair,</b> <b>well</b> carpeted and railed at first but growing shabbier with every landing, brought them past innumerable doors until, at last, just under the ground-glass roofing, the names of Smith and Hanbury were to be seen painted in large white letters across a panel, with a laconic invitation to push beneath it. Following out the suggestion, the Admiral and his companion {{found themselves in a}} dingy apartment, ill lit from a couple of glazed windows. An ink-stained table, littered with pens, papers, and almanacs, an American cloth sofa, three chairs of varying patterns, and a much-worn carpet, constituted all the furniture, save only a very large and obtrusive porcelain spittoon, and a gaudily framed and very somber picture which hung above the fireplace. Sitting in front of this picture, and staring gloomily at it, as being the only thing which he could stare at, was a small sallow-faced boy with a large head, who in the intervals of his art studies munched sedately at an apple.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{entrance to}} this {{building on the}} western end of the southern facade and is through a single half glazed door. This entrance is emphasised externally by a panel of glazing which extends upward over the two storeys of the building and also serves to light the internal <b>stair</b> <b>well</b> which is positioned here. To the north , rear of the building is a brick service wing which houses bathroom and kitchen facilities internally.|$|E

50|$|Generally the {{interiors}} are intact and impressive, particularly {{in view of}} the inadequate system of construction supervision customary at the time. The interior generally has timber framed floors, rendered brick wall, painted panels and lightly detailed timber. The influence of Scandinavian modernism may be seen in the understated blond timber finishes and joinery, and the lightness and precision of the planar composition of court room fittings. The main staircase is light and airy, with grey terrazzo treads and risers and an almost freestanding handrail tracing a playful line within the generous volume containing the stairs. The <b>stair</b> <b>well</b> creates a remarkable focus in a finely contrived sequence of spaces.|$|E
50|$|The {{school is}} {{constructed}} of light red brick with a tiled roof. It has been constructed in three phases, the earliest {{of which is}} to the east and is three stories high. This first section is distinct from the additions and is the part of the school considered to have heritage significance. It has a hipped roof and features brick balconies and a tower containing the <b>stair</b> <b>well,</b> which s lit by glass panels. A marble foundation stone is also located in the stairwell tower on the eastern side. The extensions are sympathetic in form to the original school buildings and are two storeys high. They consist of a central section built in the 1970s and the section closest to the park was built in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|On May 30, 2003, the {{day after}} graduation, {{students}} arrived {{to the high school}} to find that they were not allowed inside. As it turned out, the administrators were inside chasing down and trying to catch barn animals that had been released into the school sometime after the graduation the night before. To make matters worse, pennies were glued over all of the locks of the outside doors. A horse that had been released in the school found its way down a <b>stair</b> <b>well</b> which could have ended very badly if the horse had fallen and broken its leg, it would have had to been put down. The incident led to an investigation by the police, who speculated that a group of people snuck into the on-campus barn and then released the animals inside the school. The incident has become a legendary prank known as the [...] "Lockdown" [...] {{as a result of a}} flag flown from the flag pole with corresponding words. An investigation into the incident was unsuccessful due to the complexity of the prank.|$|E

50|$|A little later, when Nicosia {{comes back}} down the <b>stairs,</b> <b>well</b> dressed in a tuxedo, he finds himself overdressed for the occasion. Very awkwardly, Nicosia sits down at his place {{at the dinner table}} near a very naked Count Dragalescu and his bevy of naked women. The evening gets even more debauched when Nicosia has a little too much to drink, strips off all his clothes too, cavorts with the tree nude women of the {{assembled}} throng, and then passes out cold. The next morning, he wakes up in his bed with the mirthfully grinning Dragalescu laying next to him. Running in horror from the castle, the half-dressed Nicosia catches the first plane back to Italy.|$|R
40|$|Original Copy is an {{on-going}} {{project that}} uses an old windup gramophone as a drawing machine. The original tone arm has been modified {{so that the}} stylus is extended through the cartridge of an ink pen. Paper {{is placed on the}} turntable and the pen is lowered onto the revolving sheet, {{in much the same way}} as the stylus would on a record, and draws a perfect set of concentric circles, whilst the response of the stylus to the movement of the pen can be recorded directly through the tone reflector. For the sound elements of the project Strutton has been collaborating with musician and sound engineer Riccardo Carbone who is also a fellow band mate in Strutton’s group “Arthur Brick”. For this performance the equipment was set up in a unique sound spot on the <b>stair</b> <b>well</b> of the De La Warr Pavilion which, because of its curved glass and low ceiling, created a physical surround sound space...|$|E

40|$|Increasing energy {{efficiency}} of the housing stock {{is one of the}} largest challenges in the built environment today. In line with the international Paris-Climate-Change-Conference 2015, Dutch cities have great ambitions to reduce CO 2 and to transform their cities into smart and climate neutral cities. In accordance with the transition from the use of fossil energy towards renewable energy, Dutch housing association organization Aedes have promised that their average housing stock is going to have Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) B in 2020. The recently published Woonagenda 2017 - 2021 of Aedes speaks about zero carbon housing stock for all housing associations in 2050. Moreover, refurbishment of the existing housing stock is broadening and including more social and feasible themes: providing affordable and attractive housing for young people in the rapid growing Dutch cities; encouraging local and self-governance; improving quality of life; green space, change of behaviour of tenants before and after the transformation and cultural heritage. However, in current practice the emphasis is on energy efficient renovation approaches for row-housing. Besides that, current design solutions are mainly supply-driven, being developed by contractors for professional clients who have a focus on technological aspects. Parameters like aesthetics, heritage, behaviour and user preferences are not explicitly addressed in current innovative programs. The complex transformation of tenement apartment blocks in city regions are not taken into account. There are some risks with the refurbishment of this housing stock. First, there is a performance gap in the prediction of energy consumption before and after the deep renovation because of changing use of the dwelling by tenants. Second, the consequence of transformation is an inevitable house expense increase. Since the renewed Housing Act of 2015, houses are only being assigned to tenants with appropriate low incomes. According to the new Woningwaarderingstelsel, the rent of refurbished dwellings increase could rise above the so-called ‘Social Housing’ limit (€ 592, 55 and € 635, 05). Hence, the apartments will become unaffordable for individual tenants since they will no longer be eligible for state income subsidies when residing in more expensive housing. Third, when speaking about refurbishment, there are issues to be considered like whether a building has heritage or narrative value. In addition, according the Dutch Housing Act 70 % of the tenants of a block must agree to the refurbishment. For this reason there is a need for a more integral vision and approach to deal with deep renovation of tenement apartment blocks. The research group Beyond the Current of Delft University of Technology is aimed to develop a feasible General Transformation Framework (GTF) for affordable tenement apartment blocks of three to five storeys in Dutch city areas from inter war (1916 - 1925) and post war period (1946 - 1965). Characteristics of these tenement blocks are. Each <b>stair</b> <b>well</b> has no lift and between 4 to 8 apartments. The apartments are between 50 and 70 square meter. The different units are always a part of housing block, the housing blocks are always a part of a coherent urban ensemble. All together there is estimated that 480, 000 of these apartments are in the city regions of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag and Utrecht. A more thorough conceptualization of transformation of these blocks and clearer correlation between and within the parameters {{energy efficiency}}, user preferences and cultural heritage is yet to be developed for the coming period. For each time period new goals are established, which means that the transformation of buildings will be adapted to the requirements of that time. Our foremost aim and assumption is that an apartment building stays affordable and can be retrofitted to sustainable housing, instead of being demolished for new building. The present paper describes the first phase and explains the method of the research project. <br/...|$|E
60|$|She {{kissed him}} again, and ran from his room {{up to her}} mother's apartment, taking some back <b>stairs</b> <b>well</b> known to herself, lest she should by chance meet her lover after some undue and {{unprepared}} fashion. And there she could sit down and think of it all! She would be very discreet. He {{should be made to}} understand at once that the purgation must be thorough, the reform complete. She would acknowledge her love to him,--her great and abiding love; but of lover's tenderness there could be but little,--almost none,--till the fire had done its work, and the gold should have been separated from the dross. She had had her way so far, and they should find that she had deserved it.|$|R
50|$|Phase II of {{the park}} {{renovation}} consists of the expansion {{of the park}}, improving connections to the adjacent Roundhouse Parking Lot and the New Haven-Northampton Rail.

40|$|Introduction: Patellofemoral pain {{syndrome}} (PPS) {{is characterized}} as diffuse {{pain in the}} anterior knee. Objective: To evaluate the distribution of plantar pressure during two functional activities: up and down <b>stairs,</b> as <b>well</b> as torque andwork of the flexors and extensors of the knee in one subject with and one without PPS. Method: An evaluation of the plantar pressure distribution during two functional activities: up and down stairs and isokinetic assessment of knee flexors and extensors, and intensity of pain before and after each activity was conducted. Results: The subject with PPS had lower contact time and lower values for the pressure-time integral, as well as lower peak torque and work of the flexors and extensors muscles of the knee. Conclusion: The PPS has led to reducing the load on the affected limb to climb and descend <b>stairs</b> as <b>well</b> as weakness of the flexors and extensors of the knee...|$|R

50|$|Several {{artefacts}} and ruins {{have been}} located above ground and are considered important in-situ elements - i.e. remnant <b>stairs,</b> <b>wells,</b> handmade bricks, brick-paved floors, exotic plantings, structural foundations and remnant wall features. There exists potential for subsurface deposits of archaeological artefacts, especially additional building foundations, footings and domestic refuse, {{to be located}} in the locality of these above-ground elements. Any archaeological artefacts found at this place have potential to provide important information on key aspects of Queensland history, particularly the development of early sugar growing, cultivation, processing and distilling operations, and the role of South Sea Islander peoples in Queensland's sugar industry. The identification of domestic refuse has potential to provide important insights into the everyday lives of those people who lived and worked on the plantation; lives that are not well documented elsewhere. Archaeological investigations of such artefacts would help illustrate the differences in living conditions between Islanders and other labourers who worked in Queensland's early sugar industry.|$|R
