40|$|AbstractCrx {{is a novel}} paired-like {{homeodomain}} {{protein that}} is expressed predominantly in retinal photoreceptors and pinealocytes. Its gene has been mapped to chromosome 19 q 13. 3, the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> locus for autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORDII). Analysis of the proband from a family with autosomal dominant CORD revealed an Arg 41 Trp substitution in the third residue of the CRX homeodomain. The sequence change cosegregated with the disease phenotype and was not detected in 247 normal controls. Recombinant CRX homeodomain containing the Arg 41 Trp substitution showed decreased DNA binding activity. Analysis of another 169 CORD probands identified three additional CRX sequence variations (Arg 41 Gln, Val 242 Met, and a 4 bp deletion in codons 196 / 7) that were not found among the controls. This data suggests that mutations in the CRX gene are associated with photoreceptor degeneration and that the Crx protein {{is necessary for the}} maintenance of normal cone and rod function...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) and the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) is expected to facilitate the {{integration of}} epidemiology data (cancer registries) with basic and clinical research data. We evaluated {{the degree to which}} ICD-O and NCIT provide consistent representations of neoplasms. 1, 550 concepts (515 for topography and 1, 035 for morphology) are shared by ICD-O and NCIT. Only 366 relations (about 1 %) between these topography and morphology concepts are shared between ICD-O and NCIT. Two relationships – Disease Has Primary Anatomic Site and Disease Has Associated Anatomic Site – representing the anatomical <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> account for about 78 % of the 1, 376 relations between shared topography and morphology concepts in ICD-O and NCIT. In addition to these two roles, nine other NCIT relationships are found between topography and morphology concepts. Several issues are discussed, including incomplete representations in NCIT, mapping issues, systematic polysemy, and the use of post vs. precoordinated terms.

40|$|Intensive {{livestock}} production systems {{are particularly vulnerable}} to natural or intentional (bioterrorist) infectious disease outbreaks. Large numbers of animals housed within a confined area enables rapid dissemination of most infectious agents throughout a herd. Rapid containment is key to controlling any infectious disease outbreak, thus depopulation is often undertaken to prevent spread of a pathogen to the larger livestock population. In that circumstance, {{a large number of}} livestock carcasses and contaminated manure are generated that require rapid disposal. Composting lends itself as a rapid-response disposal method for infected carcasses as well as manure and soil that may harbor infectious agents. We designed a bio-contained mortality composting procedure and tested its efficacy for bovine tissue degradation and microbial deactivation. We used materials available on-farm or purchasable from local farm supply stores in order that the system can be implemented at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak.

The effect of amino acid substitutions within A 15 on its antigenicity towards monoclonal antibodies (MAb) raised against antigenic site A, has been studied by means of BIAcore technology, based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Although these antigenicities have previously been determined from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), the SPR-based technique is superior in that it allows a fast and straightforward screening of antigens while simultaneously providing kinetic data of the antigen-antibody interaction. With a view to screening fairly large libraries of individual peptides, we have inverted the typical SPR experiment by immobilizing the MAb on the sensor surface and using peptides as soluble analytes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: "Intestinal-type" mucinous {{carcinoma}} of the vulva is extremely rare with very few cases reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: The authors report two patients who had diagnosis of intestinal-type mucinous adeno{{carcinoma of the}} vulva after excisional biopsy. In both cases, restaging was perfomed with total body computed tomography (CT) scan, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy that showed no other <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>A</b> radical vulvectomy with bilateral systematic inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed, and in both cases no residual <b>disease</b> was found. <b>A</b> patient developed metastatic (liver, bone marrow) colonic cancer 36 months after primary surgery, received multiple lines of chemotherapy, and died of disseminated disease 18 months after diagnosis. The other patient {{was found to have}} dysplastic polyp in the sigmoid colon, and is alive without disease at 39 months after primary diagnosis.

40|$|Graves <b>disease</b> is <b>a</b> {{common form}} <b>of</b> human {{autoimmune}} thyroiditis. It shares many pathological features and HLA associations with other, less easily studied, organ-specific autoimmune {{conditions such as}} insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hence {{it is also a}} useful model for understanding these other diseases. We have previously shown that thyroid-infiltrating T cells in Graves disease that have been recently activated in vivo specifically recognize autologous thyroid epithelial cells. However, the autoantigens involved were not defined. In this study, we have made use of antigen-independent T-cell cloning techniques to show that at least three different thyroid antigens, three different epitopes on a single antigen, and two HLA class II elements are involved in this recognition process in a single individual. This demonstrates that T cells that are present and activated at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human autoimmune <b>disease</b> may show considerable heterogeneity in their recognition of autoantigen on the target tissue. This contrasts with the limited heterogeneity recently reported in some animal models and has potentially important implications for both our understanding of the autoimmune process in humans and the design of immunotherapies to reverse it...|$|R

The peptides used represent different segments or variant sequences <b>of</b> <b>site</b> <b>A,</b> and their reactivities reflect differences in antigenic specificity. The results indicate a remarkable immunochemical similarity between the site A epitopes defined by murine MAbs and those recognized by antibodies elicited in <b>a</b> natural host <b>of</b> FMDV. This similarity further validates previous conclusions, based on analyses with MAbs, on the relevance of amino acid substitutions at a few critical positions on the intratypic antigenic variation of FMDV in the field.

40|$|A simple lateral-flow assay (LFA) {{based on}} a {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb 70 - 17) was developed {{for the detection of}} foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) under nonlaboratory conditions. The LFA was evaluated with epithelial suspensions (n = 704) prepared from current and historical field samples which had been submitted to the Pirbright Laboratory (United Kingdom) and from negative samples (n = 100) collected from naïve animals in Korea. Four FMDV serotypes (type O, A, Asia 1, and C) were detected in the LFA, but not the remaining three FMDV serotypes (SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3). The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFA for FMDV types O, A, C, and Asia 1 was similar, at approximately 87. 3 %, to that of 87. 7 % obtained with antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). The diagnostic specificity of the LFA was 98. 8 %, compared to 100 % for the Ag-ELISA. These results demonstrate that the LFA using the FMDV MAb 70 - 17 to detect FMDV is a supportive method for taking rapid measurements at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suspected foot-and-mouth <b>disease</b> outbreak in Asia before diagnosing the disease in the laboratory, thereby offering the possibility of implementing control procedures more rapidly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAntigenic <b>site</b> <b>A</b> <b>of</b> foot-and-mouth <b>disease</b> virus (FMDV) is an exposed, mobile loop which {{includes}} a central, highly conserved Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide (RGD, VP 1 residues 141 – 143 in serotype C) thought {{to be part of}} the cell attachment site. We have analyzed the contribution of RGD to the interaction <b>of</b> <b>site</b> <b>A</b> with antibodies by incorporating selected amino acid replacements at RGD into synthetic peptides representing site A, and analyzing the reactivity of substituted peptides with site A-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Replacement of Arg- 141, Gly- 142 or Asp- 143 by alanine resulted in the loss of one, three and five epitopes, respectively, out of seven epitopes probed. Other replacements resulted in the loss of even larger numbers of epitopes, suggesting that the amino acids of the RGD region are either directly involved in interaction with antibodies or that they exert an important influence on the interaction of surrounding residues with antibodies. Thus, we explored the ability of tandem repeats of the RGDL sequence (corresponding to FMDV C-S 8 cl) to evoke neutralizing antibodies in rabbits and guinea pigs. Neutralizing activity was generally low but with a broad specificity for different FMDV serotypes and variants. Significant decreases in neutralizing titers were observed with boosting, suggesting <b>a</b> possible suppression <b>of</b> those anti-peptide antibodies which may also be directed to cellular RGD sequences. The results point to <b>an</b> involvement <b>of</b> RGD in the antigenic structure <b>of</b> <b>site</b> <b>A,</b> and open the possibility that broadly neutralizing antibodies might be induced by tandem repeats of the critical, conserved domain...|$|R
40|$|Gout is {{characterized}} by an inflammatory response that is initiated by the precipitation of monosodium urate within and surrounding the joints {{as well as the}} soft tissue. This is {{the most common form of}} inflammatory arthritis and has been showing increasing incidence over recent years in association with increased incidence of the metabolic syndrome 1. Arthritis Ireland believe the same increase is taking place in Ireland with up to 5 % of the Irish population suffering from gout. Many associate alcohol consumption with gout but fructose in non alcoholic soft drinks and beers may also have a contributory role. Male patients who consume over 2 soft drinks daily are thought to have a 1. 85 relative risk for developing gout 2. Typical age of onset is 30 - 50 years old and the initial presentation is often with an acutely painful first metatarsophalangeal joint known as podagra. <b>A</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> gout is usually made on clinical grounds in combination with, serum urate levels and radiologic diagnosis.

30|$|High-dose IL- 2 is {{associated}} with prolonged survival in selected individuals and is a potentially curative therapy in metastatic melanoma; hence, it deserves special consideration. In the metastatic setting, complete response rates approach 6 % with partial response rates of approximately 10 % (Atkins et al. 1999). Prior to initiation of therapy, there is currently no way to select patients who will favorably respond. Moreover, despite its durable efficacy, IL- 2 induces a marked pro-inflammatory cascade responsible for its antitumor effect as well as systemic toxicities, including the systemic capillary leak syndrome. In an effort to better define characteristics of patients who may benefit from IL- 2 therapy, Phan and colleagues (Phan et al. 2001) retrospectively reviewed their experience of 374 patients with stage IV melanoma who were treated with high-dose IL- 2 from 1988 – 1999. Metastatic subset of disease was influential on response rates (RR), with cutaneous or subcutaneous metastatic <b>disease</b> having <b>a</b> RR <b>of</b> 53.6 % compared to 12.4 % for other <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> metastatic <b>disease.</b> <b>A</b> negative trend was noted for intracranial metastases. Other factors significantly related to response included post-treatment lymphocytosis and immunologic toxicity, such as vitiligo. Using gene microarray profiling, Sabatino and colleagues (Sabatino et al. 2009) identified that pre-treatment levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was <b>an</b> independent predictor <b>of</b> clinical response in IL- 2 treated patients. They further defined that patients with VEGF levels > 125  pg/mL exhibit significantly reduced overall survival (OS) (13 versus 23.3  months; p[*]<[*] 0.007) than patients below this cutoff.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMyeloablative {{chemotherapy}} or {{radiation therapy}} supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) {{for the treatment}} of hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma is associated with high rates of relapse. The reasons for this are 1) autologous transplantation lacks the in vivo graft-vs. -tumor (GVT) effect associated with allogeneic SCT, which is effective in controlling or eliminating residual malignant cells remaining in the body after high-dose therapy, and 2) contaminating malignant cells in the autologous graft are reinfused into the body. Some researchers have attempted to administer immunomodulatory cytokines to simulate a GVT effect, and although this has shown some efficacy, it has several disadvantages. These include high toxicity associated with systemic administration, a short in vivo half-life, and insufficient levels reaching the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> residual <b>disease.</b> <b>As</b> an alternative, we investigated whether delivery of the cytokine interleukin (IL) - 2 to the bone marrow can exert an antileukemic effect while avoiding the problems associated with systemic administration. We describe the delivery of IL- 2 to the bone marrow by transplantation of syngeneic bone marrow, retrovirally transduced with the gene for IL- 2, into lethally irradiated mice. We were able to efficiently transduce murine bone marrow with the IL- 2 gene without adversely affecting clonogenic output from hematopoietic progenitors, {{and we were able to}} achieve expression of the transgene in transplanted animals. However, IL- 2 transduction inhibited hematopoietic reconstitution in lethally irradiated mice. Marrow transduced with high-titer, high-expressing IL- 2 retrovirus failed to engraft, and a low-titer, low-expressing IL- 2 retrovirus also demonstrated reduced engraftment, although engraftment was sufficient to support survival of transplanted mice. Long-term, low-level expression of the IL- 2 transgene was detectable in these mice and was effective in exerting an antileukemic effect. Mice transplanted with control marrow and challenged with leukemic cells suffered 100 % mortality within 70 days, whereas mice transplanted with IL- 2 -transduced marrow exhibited 50 % survival over the 175 -day duration of this study. The work shows that delivery of immunomodulatory cytokines to the bone marrow can be achieved by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, low-level IL- 2 expression can exert an antileukemic effect. These data suggest that this may be an effective immunotherapeutic strategy to reduce relapse after autologous transplantation, but the selection and expression of the cytokine must be carefully considered to minimize adverse effects on hematopoiesis.
