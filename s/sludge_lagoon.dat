To quantify the effects of biosolid aging on Cd and Zn bioavailability, two sewage <b>sludges</b> (<b>Lagoon</b> <b>sludge</b> and Filtered sludge) and a garden compost were incubated at 25 °C and 35 °C for 100 days. Changes in availability of Cd and Zn were determined using isotope dilution principles, with the materials being labelled with carrier-free 109 Cd and 65 Zn. We determined isotopically exchangeable metal pools (E values) and plant available metal pools (L values) by measuring specific activities of Cd and Zn in soil extracts and in wheat plants, respectively. Changes in carbon content over time were determined using 13 C-NMR spectroscopy and chemical extraction methods, and related to changes in availability of metal pools as determined by isotopic procedures. Hot-water-extractable carbon content, assumed to represent easily decomposable organic matter, decreased during the 100 days by 80 – 190 mg kg− 1. The Compost and <b>Lagoon</b> <b>sludge</b> showed no change in L values for Cd or Zn with time, but in the Filtered sludge the L values for Cd and Zn increased significantly, by 43 % and 56 %, respectively.

The lagoon {{was part of a}} monitored natural attenuation (MNA) study where natural reduction of PAHs and associated toxicity over time in non-disturbed areas of the <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoon</b> indicated MNA activity. The microorganisms were initially isolated on minimal medium containing naphthalene as the sole carbon and energy source. Fungal isolates were then maintained on MEA and identified based on microscopic examination and BIOLOG{reg_sign}. The analysis identified several of the fungal isolates as belonging to the genera Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Aspergillus, and Eupenicillium. Yeasts included Candida parapsilosis and C. fluvialitis. Further microbial characterization revealed that several isolates were capable of rowing on acidified media of pH 4, 3, and 2. 5. Over twenty percent of the fungi demonstrated growth as low as pH 2. 5. Of the 43 isolates examined, 24 isolates exhibited growth at 5 C. Nine of the fungal isolates exhibiting growth at 5 C were then examined for metabolic activity using a respirometer testing metabolic activity at pH 3. Microcosm studies confirmed the growth of the fungi on PAH contaminated sediment as the sole carbon and energy source with elevated metabolic rates indicating evidence of MNA.

The Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados has a {{wastewater}} treatment plant for “Las Lomas” urbanization in Buenos Aires, Puntarenas. This plant is a single facultative pond which presents microalgae overproduction that generates {{a reduction in the}} effluent quality, causes operational problems and also does not comply with the national legislation. Therefore, current facultative pond was evaluated by major design parameters for facultative ponds, to recommend a potential solution for improvement to optimize the treatment of wastewater. Evaluation of the current facultative pond, based on average daily flow of 40 m 3 /day and 50 m 3 /day maximum daily, resulted in major problems, such as, L/A ratio, the surface loading rate and, most importantly, the detention time. Subsequently, the actual area required for treatment of this wastewater was calculated, based on the maximum daily flow, is 725 m 2. Then, different scenarios were evaluated in the same way. It was evaluated: two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second one a maturation pond); two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second a macrophyte pond) and three ponds (two facultative in parallel and one a maturation pond). Then, was calculated the approximate cost to implement these proposal (including all costs of removing <b>sludge,</b> <b>lagoon</b> waterproofing, structural work, mechanical installation and other indirect and additional costs), which resulted in required an investment of $ 78. 400, 00; $ 118. 300, 00 y $ 90. 100, 00 for the proposals 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Among the most frequent exposes of mining activities belong besides old spoil heaps and <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoons,</b> also the drainage of acidic and highly mineralized mine waters known as the Acid Mine Drainage (thereinafter AMD) from old mine workings. The acid mine drainage presents to the surrounding environment a massive problem. These waters are toxic to the plant and animal life, including fishes and aquatic insects. The primary control of the drainage pH and the metal content is the exposure of sulphide minerals to weathering, the availability of atmospheric oxygen, and the sensitivity of non-sulphide minerals to buffer acidity. A geochemical modeling software is increasingly used to solve evolution of the complex chemical systems such as the interaction of acid mine drainage with wall rocks, migration of AMD components. Beyond the better computer facilities it allows to study of thermodynamic properties substances and to enlarge thermodynamic databases. A model is a simplified version of reality based on its observation and experiments. A goal of the modeling process is the tendency to better understand processes taking place inside of the system, the attempt to assume the systems behaviour in the future or to predict the effect of changed conditions in the systems environment on the system itself...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Maintenance {{and control}} of liquid levels in {{anaerobic}} lagoons and storage ponds is enhanced by pretreatment with liquid‐solid separation or periodic removal of accumulated sludges. Until local disposal or nutrient recycling options become available, sludges can be contained, dewatered, and stored using geotextile filtration. A geotextile filtration testing method termed a hanging‐bag {{test was used to}} treat dairy <b>lagoon</b> <b>sludge,</b> swine <b>lagoon</b> <b>sludge,</b> liquid dairy manure, and liquid swine manure. Hanging‐bag performance was evaluated by: (1) determining solids and plant nutrient mass retention efficiencies (MRE), (2) quantifying the overall volume reduction, and (3) characterizing the dewatered manure. After three fill‐dewater cycles, geotextile filtration performed similarly for the sludges, retaining an average 87. 6 % of total solids (TS), 58. 4 % of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), and 86. 7 % total phosphorous (TP). Geotextile filtration was also effective in dewatering and concentrating the sludges; by highly concentrating the retained solids, it reduced the total influent sludge volume requiring disposal to less than 18. 5 %. Despite relatively high MRE values for liquid swine manure (70. 2 % of TS, 65. 1 % of TAN, and 75. 7 % of TP), geotextile filtration was ineffective as a primary liquid‐solid separation, with 60. 3 % of the total influent volume remaining. For liquid dairy manure (TS = 0. 71 %), geotextile filtration reduced the total influent volume to less than 1 %, concentrated the solids and nutrients in the dewatered material 16 to 21 times greater than the influent, and retained 38. 4 % of TS, 25. 8 % of TAN, and 45. 0 % of TP, making this an effective liquid‐solid separation technique...|$|R
40|$|In 1959, {{approximately}} 20 km to the north-west of České Budějovice {{a construction}} of a chemical uranium ore plant MAPE began. The plant operation started in 1962 and finished in 1991. The premises of the former chemical plant MAPE Mydlovary consisted of a plant in which uranium ore was manufactured and the manufactured material from uranium mines was stored in adjacent sludge lagoons. Uranium ore has never been mined in this area, neither in its surroundings. It has always been imported from uranium mines. Uranium was made from the ores by either acid or alkali leaching. Although this former uranium ore plant MAPE Mydlovary hasn´t been economically active anymore, it is nowadays {{one of the biggest}} environmental burden which results from ore mining and it's processing in the Czech Republic. Therefore, it is important to carry out remediation and recultivation works which are currently provided by the state enterprise DIAMO. DIAMO company, in fact, is also the owner of the former plant MAPE Mydlovary. During the operation of the former ore plant MAPE Mydlovary, about 1, 100 employees took turns in the company. During the uranium ore treating and its consequent waste store in the lunge lagoons, employees of the plant were exposed to the effect of radionuclides. For this reason, my diploma thesis deals with the effect of radiation on employees of the former chemical plant MAPE Mydlovary and aims at the doses which the employees received while working in the plant. The data were gathered from October 2013 to April 2014 and contain figures for a period of 1963 - 1996. These figures were gained from personal dosimetrical files of the employees and these files were provided by the state enterprise DIAMO. The first aim of the thesis was to monitor the rate of radiation and to compare the gained values among individual employees of the plant MAPE Mydlovary. The monitoring of the effect of radiation was carried out from personal files of the employees and the measured values were put into tables of Excel programme. The values were then compared and I also used descriptive figures statistics. The doses at the employees were found not to exceed any dose limits. The second aim of the thesis was to evaluate the measured values at several groups of employees according to the type of the work they do. The division into individual groups was carried out according to the scale of received doses. It deals with a group of employees who worked at least for 6 months with dustiness, another group working in a <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoon,</b> another group of workers who were responsible for the main manufacture but weren´t exposed to any dustiness (according to the type of work, these people were then divided either into the first or the second sub-group) and also a group of other employees who had their own dosimeter- this group served as a comparative reference in a statistic research. The measures values were evaluated by a statistic research. For this type of research, we used a parametric testing and a so-called Fischer´s F-test, which was applied thanks the Statistics function in a table processor MS Excel 2010. For this test, we used the level of significance = 0, 05. Through the statistic research, we have found out that the highest measured values appeared at the employees who were working in the main manufacture but without any dustiness. This group of people was ranked as the first group. The lowest amount of received doses appeared at the employees who worked in the main manufacture, without any dustiness and were put into the second sub-group. The hypothesis that the doses of the MAPE Mydlovary employees are different within the groups has been confirmed. The hypothesis that the doses at the MAPE Mydlovary staff didn´t exceed any dose limits for the staff has been confirmed as well. The hypothesis that the doses at the MAPE Mydlovary staff were different in certain groups was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Global {{sewage sludge}} (biosolids) {{production}} is increasing {{as a result}} of rapidly growing human population and ensuing industrial activities. Land application of this waste is becoming a serious environmental issue because the high levels of heavy metals in biosolids can upset soil microbial activity and nutrient balance when the waste is added to forest or agricultural lands. It is widely accepted that bioavailability, rather than total soil concentration, is more important when assessing the risk associated with metal contamination. The bioavailability of a heavy metal is dependent on the chemical nature of the metal, the chemical, physical and biological properties of biosolids that contain the metal and of soil that receives the biosolids. It also depends on the interaction of the biosolids with soil, plants and soil microorganisms. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess the bioavailability of biosolids–derived Cu and Zn and the comparative effects of these metals on plant and soil microbial activity, with special attention to mycorrhiza, and the effects of application of lime and Al dross as ameliorants for the reduction of bioavailability of these two metals. Biosolids were collected from the Palmerston North City Council Waste Water Treatment Plant (PNCCWTP) <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoon</b> in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Because the metal concentrations were low, for research purposes these biosolids were spiked separately with three levels of Cu (to give final concentrations of 50, 150 and 250 mg/kg soil) and Zn (to give final concentrations of 150, 450 and 750 mg/kg soil) added as metal sulphate salts. The biosolids were anaerobically incubated, and it was found that a shorter period of equilibration (2 months) than the previously used 6 – 9 months was sufficient for Cu and Zn to be fully incorporated into the biosolids matrix. As biosolids in New Zealand are currently applied to forest lands, two important forest plants, poplar and pine, were considered for the study in this thesis. The effects of elevated concentrations of Cu and Zn in a soil amended with metal spiked biosolids on poplar plants were investigated in a 147 day glasshouse pot trial. The findings of this trial showed that at the same total soil metal concentration, biosolids–derived Cu was more toxic than Zn to soil microorganisms, whereas Zn was more toxic to poplar and ECM fungi. In a similar glasshouse study lasting 312 days with pine, Cu did not show a phytotoxic effect, but Zn was phytotoxic to pine. However, both metals were toxic to microorganisms and neither metal influenced ECM fungi colony development. The currently recommended maximum metal concentration limits for New Zealand soils of 100 mg/kg for Cu and 300 mg/kg for Zn appear to be high for both metals with respect to soil microbial activity, but low for Cu and high for Zn with respect to poplar and pine growth. A laboratory incubation trial with Cu– and Zn– spiked biosolids added to eight soils representing the major Soil Groups collected from across the North Island of New Zealand (biosolids added to give final soil concentrations of 150 mg/kg for Zn or 450 mg/kg for Cu), showed that crystalline Fe oxide was the dominant factor explaining 90 % of the variability in exchangeable Cu. For Zn, clay content and pH were the controlling soil factors that together explained 73 % of the variability in exchangeable Zn. An increased content of crystalline Fe oxide increased the soil exchangeable Cu concentration. Decreasing pH and increasing clay content increased the soil exchangeable Zn concentration. The effect of lime (0. 1 and 0. 5 %), Al dross (2 and 6 %) and a combination of lime and Al dross (0. 1 % lime+ 2 % Al dross) as soil amendments for the amelioration of the toxic effect of biosolids–derived Cu (144 mg/kg in soil) and Zn (417 mg/kg in soil) on microorganisms and poplar were also studied. Results revealed that application of lime and Al dross (pH 10) as a mixture (0. 1 % lime+ 2 % Al dross) was able to ameliorate Cu and Zn phytotoxicity, and significantly increase the DM yield of poplar, ECM fungi population and microbial activity in the Cu and Zn contaminated soils. The findings of the studies in this thesis are applicable to environmental regulations with respect to heavy metal limits that seek to protect agricultural and forest land, human and animal health, and soil and drinking water quality, in scenarios where biosolids are applied to soil...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) In {{this study}} a falling film {{apparatus}} {{was used to}} aerate a continuous water stream containing solids. Specifically, {{the aim of the}} research was to investigate the performance of the apparatus, in terms of the oxygen mass transfer rate, overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient, interfacial area and alpha factor, as a function of water volumetric flow rate, initial dissolved oxygen concentration, solids concentration, and apparatus geometry. The falling film apparatus was comprised of a vertical array of horizontal wooden cylinders (0. 035 m diameter and 0. 150 m length); where the number of cylinders and vertical spacing between each cylinder in the array was between 5 - 11 and 0 - 6 mm, respectively. The cylinder array was housed inside an enclosed chamber, of volume approximately 33 L, which was filled with a pure oxygen atmosphere during the experiments. The tap water feed with volumetric flow rate in the range 0. 7 - 4. 5 L/min and corresponding to film Reynolds numbers between 142 - 1135 was introduced via an inlet {{at the top of the}} chamber. The feed was then directed uniformly along the entire width of the uppermost cylinder through a distribution nozzle; and then cascaded over the cylinders below before being discharged through an exit at the bottom of the enclosed chamber. A pressure manometer and dissolved oxygen (DO) meters were used to monitor the chamber pressure and DO of the inlet and outlet streams, respectively. Experiments were performed for feed water solids (MLSS) concentrations of between 0 - 12820 mg/L. The solids used in the study were activated sludge residue that had been stabilised: (1) biologically, with at least 1 year of residence time in a <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoon</b> that was either submerged or had been drained for dewatering purposes; and (2) thermally, in a drying oven maintained at 90 ºC for at least 12 hours. The expectation was that there would be no biological uptake during the mass transfer experiments. Whilst this was the case, chemisorption of the dissolved oxygen onto the heat treated activated (carbon) sludge was found to take place and was accounted for quantitatively when determining the oxygen mass transfer coefficient from the mass transfer experiments. The mass transfer experiments involved filling the aeration chamber with pure oxygen and recording the inlet and outlet DO concentrations of the downflowing water stream both without and with MLSS solids present. The mass of oxygen transferred over the experiment duration was then inputted in Fick’s Law to determine the mass transfer coefficient and alpha value based on measured/computed average falling film thickness and velocity. For experiment with no biosolids and zero vertical spacing between adjacent cylinders, it was found that the oxygen mass transfer rate increased with increasing volumetric feed flow rate and increasing number of cylinders in the vertical array—which corresponded to an increase in the gas-liquid contact time. The mass transfer rate could be adequately fitted to a power law relationship for the volumetric feed rate. Similarly, the computed mass transfer coefficient, using the wetted surface area of the cylinders as the mass transfer area, could be reasonably modelled by a power law where the fitted volumetric feed rate exponent of 0. 82 was independent of the number cylinders in the array. The exponent value of 0. 82 was consistent with published literature values where wavy motion were present on the surface of the falling film—as was observed in this study. Average film thickness and water mean velocity were measured experimentally for a water-only feed and 8 -cylinder array with zero spacing. The measurements were able to be adequately described by existing analysis for vertical falling films as well as the correlation by Rogers and Goindy (1989). A limited number of experiments were performed for a vertical spacing of 3 mm. It was found that there was an increase in the oxygen mass transfer rate when compared with that of zero spacing. However, once the resultant increase in mass transfer area and contact time, due to the increased distance the feed travels whilst the velocity remained relatively unchanged, it was found that there was no statistical difference to that of the mass transfer coefficient for zero spacing. For vertical spacing beyond 5 mm, the integrity of the liquid film was not able to be maintained and not considered further as part of this study. Mass transfer experiments were performed for MLSS in the range 740 - 12820 mg/L for an 8 -cylinder array with 3 mm vertical separation. It was found that the mass transfer coefficient could be fitted to the volumetric feed rate to a power law with the same exponent of 0. 82 as that obtained for the water only experiments. The experimental mass transfer coefficient versus MLSS concentration was compared with the predictions from correlations of Al-Malah (2013) and Seader and Henley (2006) for vertical falling films. In order to apply the correlations the presence of solids on the apparent viscosity was taken into account using the expression of Mooney (1950) for non-aggregating, spherical particles. Good agreement between measurement and predictions from Seader and Henley (2006) was obtained for experimental film Reynolds number average of 865. For experimentally determined mass transfer coefficient values normalised to a film Reynolds number of 25, and corresponding to a smooth film surface, it was found that the model of Al-Malah (2013) provided better agreement, which is not surprising given the analysis was based on a smooth, laminar film. At Re F of 25, the Seader and Henley (2006) correlation over-predicted the k L value by approximately 500 percent. Finally, the computed alpha followed an exponential decay with increasing MLSS concentration, with an exponential decay coefficient of - 0. 3, which compared very favourably with results with all other aeration devices (see Figure 4. 11) considered in this study. The finding supports the original hypothesis that the negative impact of the presence of solids on the mass transfer performance, i. e. reduction in alpha value, commonly experienced in bubble-type aeration devices due to coalescence can be avoided by not having the gas as the dispersed phase. The falling film device has demonstrated that mass transfer is much less sensitive to the presence of solids, and for this reason offers an alternative aeration methodology...|$|E

Sludge samples seeded with eggs were stored at 4 or 25 degrees C or in a container inserted into the ground to simulate lagoon conditions. The number of eggs recovered from the samples decreased with storage time. The viability and infectivity of eggs recovered {{were related to the}} storage temperature; i. e., the eggs stored at 4 degrees C remained viable longer than those stored at 25 degrees C. After 25 months at 4 degrees C, the Toxocara eggs and some Ascaris eggs remained both viable and infective, whereas most of these eggs stored at 25 degrees C were rendered nonviable after 10 to 16 months of storage in sludge. Although storage temperature was found {{to be the most important}} factor affecting the destruction and viability of these eggs, other factors, such as the type of sludge digestion, whether or not the eggs were digested along with the sludge or added later, storage in the soil versus sludge, pH, and egg species also exhibited some minor effects. These controlled laboratory studies suggest that <b>lagooning</b> of <b>sludge</b> can be an effective method for the elimination of parasite eggs, particularly in warmer geographical locations...|$|R

Composting and using of earthworms in this process {{is one of the}} most suitable methods for stabilization and removal of unsuitable {{properties of}} sewage sludge. To investigate the effects of kind and mixing proportion of bulking material and sewage sludge decomposition stage on vermicompost quality, an experiment was carried out in a split plot design with three replications. In this experiment, the stage of sewage decomposition (raw sewage, digested sludge in digester, dewatered <b>sludge</b> in <b>lagoons,</b> and final dried <b>sludge</b> in <b>lagoons)</b> was main factor and kind of bulking materials (woodchips, three leaves, and wheat straw) and mixing proportion of bulking materials to swage sludge (0, 15, 30, and 45 %, V/V) were as subordinate factors. Chemical properties of sewage in different decomposition stages and bulking materials were determined. After 5 months of incubation in the controlled moisture and temperature condition, and in the presence of earthworms, the pot's contents were harvested, and nutrients and heavy metal concentration of vermicomposts were measured. Vermicomposts had relatively low pH and EC. Their nutrients content especially N, P, Fe, and Zn were high. These properties showed vermicompost suitability for use as a soil amendment and organic fertilizer. Heavy metals concentrations of vermicomposts, except for Zn, were lower than recommended values by EPA. Despite no significant difference between the kinds of bulking materials, mixing of these materials with sewage sludge decreased pH, N, and Pb content of produced vermicompost. According to the results, 30 % (v/v) mixing of bulking material and sewage sludge is recommende...|$|R
40|$|In 1959, the {{building}} of chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary was initiated in a small village Mydlovary, near České Budějovice. In October 1962, the operation and processing of the uranium ore started. During operation, about 17 million tons of uranium ore were processed and the material from processed uranium ores was stored into the contiguous <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoons.</b> The operation of this plant was terminated in November 1991. The premises of MAPE Mydlovary were partially liquidated, decontaminated and handed over for privatization, nowadays there are recovery and reclamation works in process. Even though, MAPE Mydlovary is nowadays {{one of the most}} dangerous strains for environment, which emerged after mining and processing of uranium ores in the Czech Republic. The projection is to liquidate the consequences of this process for many more years from now. In immediate closeness to the premises of MAPE Mydlovary there lie the villages Mydlovary, Olešník and Zahájí. It can be assumed that during the processing of uranium ores and subsequent storing of waste into the contiguous <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoons</b> there could have been some impact on the inhabitants of these villages by radio nuclides. The possibility that there are still some sources of contamination and effect on the inhabitants of the three neighboring villages cannot be excluded nowadays, even after almost 23 years after the shutdown of the plant. For this reason this diploma thesis is dealing with the effects of the preparation plant MAPE Mydlovary on the inhabitants of Mydlovary, Olešník and Zahájí, specifically on the amount of deaths due to cancer diseases of inhabitants of these villages. Data was collected from October 2013 till April 2014 and it includes figures from the period 1971 - 2010. It was collected using non-standardized interviews and was provided by practicing physicians of the investigated villages; furthermore, data was collected from websites of the Czech Statistical Office. Aim of this thesis was to analyze and compare the deaths due to cancer diseases of the inhabitants in the surroundings of MAPE Mydlovary and of inhabitants in the whole Czech Republic (whole republic´s cancer disease mortality) and evaluate the possible influence of the radiation load on the number of deaths due to cancer diseases of inhabitants in the surroundings of MAPE Mydlovary. The analysis and comparison of the number of deaths was carried out using statistical research. Non parametric testing was used for the statistical research and the so called Fisher exact test was used, which is carried out by means of statistical software www. ncss. com. For this test the level of significance - = 0, 2 was used. The influence of the radiation load on the number of deaths due to cancer diseases is statistically significant only in the village Mydlovary, where it is possible to prove statistically an increased number of deaths due to cancer diseases in comparison to the number of deaths due to cancer diseases in the whole Czech Republic. Based on the evaluation of the obtained data we can state that the chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary most likely had and still may have a negative impact on the inhabitants of the neighboring villages, especially on the inhabitants of the village Mydlovary. For this reason it is very important to continue with the recovery and reclamation works in the premises of the chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary and their main objective is to protect the inhabitants of surrounding villages against possible exposure to the radio nuclides. Nevertheless, the impacts of processing the former chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary will be eliminated for many more years...|$|R

Effective U(VI) removal is accomplished when a negative potential is applied to the activated carbon fiber (ACF) electrode. For a feed concentration of 100 mg/L, the concentration of U(VI) in the cell effluent is reduced to less than 1 mg/L.

40|$|Possible {{risks of}} using {{radioactive}} materials are a highly discussed topic nowadays. This work {{is dealing with}} this problem and it is focused on possible risks of using radioactive materials from the ex-treatment plant of uranium ores MAPE Mydlovary. In introductory chapters I am describing {{the current state of}} ex-treatment plant of uranium ores. I am dealing with the history of operation of MAPE, information about <b>sludge</b> <b>lagoons</b> and about stored sediments in them and other characteristics concerning this operation. For years, sediments in which radionuclides are contained have been stored in treatment plants and that is why I am dealing with ionizing radiation. Because the topic is the using of radioactive materials which can be used mainly by terrorists, I am also describing this worldwide phenomenon of recent years where I first of all focused on super-terrorism using radioactive weapons, namely so-called ?dirty bombs?. The target of this work is to find out possibilities of using radioactive materials from the ex-treatment plant. Therefore I measured values of radioactivity and exposition of radiation at some places with the help of exploratory research. That meant sampling of soils and water and also measurement of power of dose equivalent of radiation gamma. After gathering information of needed radiation values I carried out simulation of possible using of radioactive materials from the premises MAPE. By means of dirty bomb I used the programme TerEx at using radioactive material. Then I carried out several calculations which were focused on inhalation, ingestion or outdoor radiation from radioactive materials and also calculation how much it is necessary to gain a significant source of ionizing radiation. From these sources I have deduced impacts for individuals, society or environment. Based on analysis and evaluation of given problems, my set hypothesis ?By using radioactive materials from the ex-treatment plant of uranium ores MAPE Mydlovary a serious threat to people will not occur? was confirmed. Results of my work {{can be used as a}} study material for completing and broadening knowledge about risks resulting from using radioactive materials.

To investigate the effects of bulking material on vermicompost quality, an experiment was conducted in a factorial design with three replications. In this experiment, the final dried <b>sludge</b> in <b>lagoons</b> was mixed with bulking materials (woodchips, three leaves, and wheat straw) in four mixing proportion with swage sludge (0, 15, 30 and 45 %, V/V). Chemical properties of bulking materials, sewage sludge, and produced vermicomposts were determined. Vermicomposts had relatively low pH and electrical conductivity (EC). The nutrients content of vermicompost, especially N, P, Fe, and Zn, were high. These properties showed its suitable quality for use in agriculture. Heavy metals concentrations of vermicomposts, except Zn, were lower than recommended values by EPA. Mixing of Bulking materials with sewage sludge decreased pH, N, Pb, Co, and Cd, but increased Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Ni content of produced vermicomposts. In most cases, the concentrations of nutrients were higher in 30 % mixing proportion. Therefore, 30 % (v/v) mixing of bulking material with sewage sludge is recommended for vermicompost production...|$|R
40|$|Biosolids {{refers to}} the {{stabilized}} sewage sludge produced in wastewater treatment which is destined for beneficial purposes as a fertilizer and soil conditioner. In addition to nutrients and organic matter, biosolids may contain pathogens including bacteria, viruses, helminths and parasites. The current Victorian guidelines to produce T 1 treatment grade biosolids (unrestricted use) require the sludge to be stored {{for a minimum of}} three years after the pan drying process to ensure destruction of pathogens. This long term storage is associated with problems such as loss of nutrients in biosolids management costs incurred in maintaining stockpiles of sludge and increased greenhouse gas emissions from the stockpiles. This study evaluates whether microbiological criteria with respect to viruses can be achieved with a shorter treatment time. This data will be provided to regulatory authorities prior to their revision of current Victorian guidelines. In this study, adenovirus was chosen as indicator pathogen for enteric viruses. Primary objectives of this project include: (i) development of standard qPCR method for the detection of adenovirus in sewage sludge, (ii) determining the treatment time required by adenoviruses to achieve prescribed microbiological criteria through laboratory simulation of pan drying and stockpiling processes of sludge collected from both metropolitan and regional wastewater treatment systems (iii) finding the levels of human adenobirus 41 (HAdV 41) in metropolitan sludge at different stages of the treatment process (output from mesophilic anaerobic digester, drying pans of different ages) and regional <b>sludge</b> treatment systems (<b>lagoon</b> <b>sludge)</b> in Victoria.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Sludge {{stage and}} volume were {{monitored}} in two lagoons (OK 1 and OK 2) treating manure from swine breeding farms {{for a period}} of 9 years. Solids management differed between the two <b>lagoons.</b> <b>Sludge</b> was left relatively undisturbed in lagoon OK 1, whereas solids were removed with each irrigation in lagoon OK 2. When left undisturbed, sludge accumulated in a pattern consistent with the complex accumulation model proposed by earlier researchers. Sludge accumulated faster when solids were removed during irrigation compared to the lagoon in which solids were left undisturbed. Accumulation in both disturbed and undisturbed lagoons occurred at a rate less than current ASABE and NRCS standards. Onset of rapid accumulation appears to be related to volumetric organic loading rate rather than separation distance between top of the sludge and the liquid surface. Critical organic loading rates contained in the current standards appear to be adequate to determine the onset of rapid sludge accumulation...|$|R
