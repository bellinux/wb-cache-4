25|$|A second clause {{promotes}} alliance {{by making}} reassurances of aid, most likely military support, if either party is {{attacked by a}} third party or by internal forces of rebellion or insurgency. The other stipulations coincide with Hattušiliš' aims (consult Hittite aims section) in that the Hittite ruler placed great emphasis on establishing legitimacy for his rule: each country swore to the other to extradite political fugitives back to their home country and within the Hittite version of the treaty Ramesses II agreed to provide support to Hattušiliš' successors in order to hold the Hittite throne against dissenters. After {{the conclusion of the}} provision detailing the extradition of emigrants to their land of origin, the two rulers call upon the respective gods of Hatti and Egypt to bear witness to their agreement. The inclusion of the gods is a common feature in major pieces of international law since only a direct appeal to the gods could provide the proper means to guarantee adherence to the treaty. Their noted ability to bestow curses and blessings to people is employed as a <b>serious</b> <b>penalty</b> that would be imposed in case of a violation.|$|E

2500|$|The BCCI lodged {{an appeal}} against the decision. On 29 January 2008, after the {{hearing of the}} appeal, at Adelaide by ICC appeals {{commissioner}} John Hansen, the racism charge on Harbhajan Singh was not proved and the three Test ban was lifted. However, a lesser charge (Level 2.8 offence) of using abusive language was applied and Harbhajan was fined 50% of his match fee. Hansen later admitted that he [...] "could have imposed a more <b>serious</b> <b>penalty</b> if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler's previous transgressions"—including a suspended one Test Match ban. The ICC claimed the [...] "database and human errors ... {{played a part in}} Harbhajan Singh escaping a more severe penalty during his appeal hearing in Adelaide".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between baseball and Test cricket is the primary intent of the batsman. Usually, in Test/First Class cricket, wickets come at a far higher premium, since survival is of primary importance. While nine innings per side are played in a baseball game within a few hours, only two per side are played in Test cricket over five days (thirty hours), so {{the cost of a}} dismissal is far higher in cricket. It should be kept in mind that a batsman in cricket is not obligated to take a run after striking the ball, nor is there any penalty for swinging at the ball and missing unless it hits the stumps (i.e. the wicket) (or, as often happens, makes a glancing contact with the bat and is caught) and there is no limit to the number of deliveries a batsman can face; a batsman with the required concentration, determination and technical ability often bats for several hours (occasionally days) without being dismissed. By contrast, in baseball a batter takes a <b>serious</b> <b>penalty</b> (a [...] "strike") if he swings and misses: three strikes result in an out, and if the batter hits he must run. This contrast means that in cricket, unlike baseball, the quality of a batsman's defensive game and footwork (unlike baseball batters, cricket batsmen are not required to keep their back foot grounded when hitting the ball) are of the utmost importance. The nuances of batting technique are also greater in cricket, since the interplays between bowling variations, field placements and scoring strengths are more dynamic. Since cricket is played over an extended duration, the bowler and the fielding captain have time to [...] "work over" [...] a batsman (e.g. trying several different bowlers). Thus, cricket batting requires a very tight technique and the ability to withstand sustained examinations.|$|E

50|$|In {{the canon}} {{law of the}} Catholic Church, excommunication (Lat. ex, out of, and communio or communicatio, communion, meaning {{exclusion}} from the communion), the principal and severest censure, is a medicinal, spiritual penalty that deprives the guilty Christian of all participation in the common blessings of ecclesiastical society. Being a penalty, it presupposes guilt; and being the most <b>serious</b> <b>penalty</b> that the Catholic Church can inflict, it naturally supposes a very grave offense.|$|E

50|$|The {{prosecution}} of traffickers within Cyprus {{has been identified}} as a point of issue by the US Department of State. According to statistics gathered, there has been a 55 percent decrease in the conviction of traffickers within Cyprus. Furthermore, perpetrators are often being convicted under statutes which prescribe a much less <b>serious</b> <b>penalty</b> than other anti-trafficking laws. This decrease in convictions reflects a negative impact on victims of trafficking, who may lack faith in a system of criminal justice which does not adequately identify and punish offenders.|$|E

50|$|Upon the army's {{return to}} Rome, the class {{tensions}} were reignited when Servilius' colleague Appius issued decrees {{for even more}} <b>serious</b> <b>penalties</b> regarding debts. The senate sided with Appius and the people were angered at Servilius since his promises of debt relief prior to the war went unfulfilled. Servilius was thereby in effect politically isolated and disliked by all, and remained so for the balance of his consulate.|$|R
50|$|Judicial birching in 20th-century Britain {{was used}} much more {{often as a}} fairly minor {{punishment}} for male juveniles, typically for petty larceny, than as a <b>serious</b> <b>penalty</b> for adult men.

By April, Meisner wanted to surrender to the authorities. Meisner was quickly put under the control of several guards.|$|E
