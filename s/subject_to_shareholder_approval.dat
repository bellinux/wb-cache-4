5000|$|Repsol has {{the backing}} of the EU and the US, as both powers {{condemned}} Argentina’s move at expropriation. President Fernández claimed that the state would seize 51% of YPF. [...] In June 2013, Repsol rejected a $5 billion proposal from Argentina to compensate for the 2012 expropriation. The proposal also would have given Repsol drilling rights to 6.4% of the massive Vaca Muerta shale-gas field. The board of the Repsol firm unanimously rejected this offer, as it would have caused them to drop a $10.5 billion lawsuit that was in progress against the Argentine government. Repsol at the time owned 6.4% of YPF oil-and-gas company. On 25 February 2014 the Repsol board announced it had accepted a settlement offer from the Argentine government of an issue of Argentine bonds valued at $5 billion. The deal concluded after 3 months of negotiations in Buenos Aires was <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>approval.</b> The agreement ended two years of legal wrangling and the potential for a long drawn-out legal battle. Repsol Chairman Antonio Brufau described the [...] "friendly" [...] settlement as [...] "extremely positive." ...|$|E
40|$|Shareholder {{lawsuits}} {{have become}} an epidemic, with lawsuits being filed after almost every merger or acquisition, costing corporations and shareholders billions of dollars. With little substantive and successful reform measures at {{the federal and state}} level, corporations have begun to take matters into their own hands, including adopting corporate bylaws to deter these lawsuits. This Note examines the Delaware Supreme Court’s controversial decision in 2014, ATP Tour, Inc. v. Deutscher Tennis Bund, in which the court approved the adoption of fee-shifting bylaws by corporations. It further examines the Delaware State Legislature’s subsequent prohibition of fee-shifting provisions and explores the possibility that ambiguity in the legislation may allow fee-shifting bylaws in securities class action lawsuits. This Note argues that corporations should be statutorily allowed to adopt fee-shifting bylaws <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>approval</b> and a maximum relief standard. With minimal chance that the Delaware legislature will immediately overturn its legislation, it argues alternatively that the Delaware courts should narrowly interpret the current statute so as not to not apply to securities class action lawsuits...|$|E

40|$|Justice, Commercial List (the “Court”) {{extending}} {{the time for}} Canadian Fund and Commercialization Fund to call the next annual meetings of their shareholders to June 30, 2012. On November 10, 2011, Canadian Fund announced that it had adopted a redemption management plan (“RMP”) whereby Canadian Fund closed weekly Class A share redemptions and, subject to regulatory approval, would process redemptions of Class A shares semi-annually in amounts determined by the Board of Directors of Canadian Fund. Canadian Fund has applied for but not received the regulatory approval required to implement semi-annual redemption processing. If Canadian Fund does not secure such regulatory approval, the Board of Directors will examine variations to the RMP, which may be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>approval.</b> Canadian Fund sought {{an extension of the}} time for holding its next annual general meeting in order to allow time for the regulatory application process related to the RMP to be completed. This will allow Canadian Fund to avoid the significant disruption and duplication of cost that would be associated with holding a separate shareholder meeting to seek approvals related to the RMP, if required. Commercialization Fund applied for the same extension of time for calling its annual meeting of shareholders in order to hold its annual meeting of shareholders on the same date and in the same place as Canadian Fund’s annual meeting of shareholders. The Funds have the same manager, the same board of directors and the same officers, and generally hold their annual meetings on the same date and in the same place.
