40|$|An {{extrusion}} process melded with alkaline peroxide chemical pretreatements {{allows the}} lignin and hemicellulose in biomass to be solublibzed, and the cellulose component {{to be made}} available for enzymatic breakdown. This process is called the Xylan Delignification Process (XDP). In this paper, some results of the XDP on promoting enzymatic breakdown and SSF of corn stalks switch grass and straw are reported. It {{was found that the}} XDP process allowed quick (6 hour) and reasonably complete (85 [...] 88 %) hydrolysis of the cellulose fraction of cornstalks, but was less effective in allowing utilization of the switch grass with 76 % yeild noted in 24 hours. Solubilization of the lignin and hemicellulose were not acheived on a first set of corn <b>stalk,</b> <b>switch</b> grass, and straw samples, but was noted on a second straw sample...|$|E
5000|$|The {{facelift}} model Audi A4 came in 2011. It features redesigned LED headlamps {{and tail}} lights, front air dam with fog lamps, and closely set twin exhausts. Interior changes include a {{three-spoke steering wheel}} and a redesigned ignition key. Controls for air-conditioning, infotainment, and power windows gain chrome clasps. Other detail interior changes include larger steering column <b>stalk</b> <b>switches</b> first seen in the D4-series Audi A8 and a simplified layout for the HVAC control panel - for example the temperature setting for the heated seats is now directly set by a single button {{and is no longer}} controlled using the MMI dial. The A4 includes radio with eight speakers as standard, while MMI navigation system with voice dialogue is optional. A new [...] "Drive Select System" [...] allows drivers to choose comfort, dynamic, individual, or efficiency modes for fuel efficiency. Power output of the 1.8 TFSI engine is 170 BHP and 320 Nm of torque - up 10 BHP and 70 Nm from the previous versions. Electro-mechanical power steering is standard.|$|R
50|$|The Picanto {{received}} a facelift in late 2007. Among the minor changes were the light clusters (front and rear), a new bumper and front grille. For the UK and Cyprus markets, the indicator <b>stalk</b> was <b>switched</b> {{to the opposite}} side. For the Italian market, a new bi-fuel LPG version debuted alongside the 1.0 L and 1.1 L engines. This model also saw a change in power steering configuration from hydraulic to electric.|$|R
40|$|A {{feeding trial}} using 121 {{crossbred}} steers {{was conducted to}} evaluate the utilization of untreated mature switchgrass as a roughage source in feedlot diets. Steers were fed either cornstalks (<b>STALK)</b> or switchgrass (<b>SWITCH)</b> as roughage at 14. 2 % of diet DM. Performance and carcass characteristics were evaluated relative to roughage source. Cattle fed SWITCH had lesser marbling scores but backfat, HCW, KPH, ribeye area, and yield grade did not differ between treatments. Cattle fed SWITCH had lesser DMI than did STALK cattle but carcass-adjusted ADG and G:F did not differ between treatments. Untreated switchgrass may replace cornstalks at low inclusions in finishing diets, and digestibility of this low quality roughage may be improved through alkaline treatment...|$|R
