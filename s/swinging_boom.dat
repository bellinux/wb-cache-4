50|$|The Carmila cane lift is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Tracey lift. Cane lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a <b>swinging</b> <b>boom,</b> and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The Tracey lift took the latter form and was powered by a truck backed under the lift so its back wheels engaged with rollers set into the ground. The lift at Carmila is an intact example of this type and includes the roller mechanism, pulley with cable and a hook.|$|E

50|$|Boom furling mainsails {{also must}} {{deal with the issue}} of the leading edge. Most sails attach to the mast with sliders or a rope {{supported}} edge that rides in a track in the mast, and this adds bulk to {{the leading edge of the}} sail as it rolls. This is also an issue when unfurling, as the edge of the sail must be fed smoothly into the mast's track when unfurling. The weight of the sail and furling equipment also increases the boom's mass, which can increase the danger of injury to a crewmember if they are hit by the <b>swinging</b> <b>boom.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a method that measures a torque which an operator applies to the joystick without using a torque/force sensor on a joystick. We dealt with a construction robot teleoperation system which is comprised of two joysticks as the master, and an excavator with four degrees of freedom consisting of fork glove, <b>swing,</b> <b>boom,</b> and arm as the slave. It is necessary to know the torque (force) exerted on the master side in force control. Because the joystick does not have a force/torque sensor in our lab, {{it is not possible to}} directly obtain the torque. To give prominence to the simple and practical construction robot teleoperation system in our lab, we proposed a method that measures the torque exerted on the joystick to existing equipment. Its effectiveness was verified by a reaction torque experiment...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} these early self-unloaders {{was pretty much the}} same as today. The idea is that the [...] "cargo hold" [...] is built with its sides sloping {{toward the center of the}} ship along the keel. Where the two sides come together, a series of steel gates can be opened. This allows the {{material}} to drop onto a conveyor belt running the length of the ship beneath the [...] "cargo hold." [...] The conveyor belt carries the material up to an exchanger, where it is transferred to a second belt which runs up to the main deck, then through a long boom on deck. The unloading <b>swing</b> <b>boom</b> hangs over the ship's side to discharge the material load onto the waiting customer's dock. The advantage of self-unloaders is that they can deliver the limestone material directly to a customer's dock without requiring expensive shoreside unloading rigs.|$|R

50|$|Canadian music genres {{identifies}} musical {{sounds as}} belonging to a particular category and type of music that can be distinguished from other types of music made by Canadians. The music of Canada has reflected the multi-cultural influences that have shaped the country. First Nations people, the French, the British, the Americans and many others nationalities have all made unique contributions to the musical genres of Canada. During the <b>swing</b> <b>boom</b> of the late 1930s and early 1940s, Canada produced such notable bandleaders as Ellis McLintock, Bert Niosi, Jimmy Davidson, and Mart Kenney. In the 1940s, Bert Niosi and Oscar Peterson became widely known. Canada has also produced a number of respected classical music ensembles, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Canadian rock describes a wide and diverse variety of music produced by Canadians, with the most notable Canadian rock band being Rush, who currently place fifth behind The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, KISS and Aerosmith for the most consecutive gold and platinum albums by a rock band. The Canadian hip hop scene was first established in the 1980s. Some of the most well known Canadian rappers and hip-hop artists include Drake and Maestro Fresh-Wes.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the modelling of electrohydraulic actuation systems of a prototype forestry vehicle, the experimental {{identification of the}} dynamic models parameters and control strategies for forestry operations. The linear graph method is selected to derive comprehensive models of three electrohydraulic actuation subsystems, i. e. the <b>swing,</b> <b>boom</b> and stick subsystems, on the vehicle based on modelling of individual components. A new approach is proposed, then, to integrate rigid-body dynamic models with the actuator dynamic models {{to result in a}} complete machine model. Off-line parameter identification procedures are used, including the least-square method. A series of experiments is performed to obtain numerical values for the parameters involved in the system models. The experimental setups are described in detail and new procedures are explained. The model validation studies show that the mathematical models closely represent the dynamic characteristics of the forestry machine. The concept of coordinated control in teleoperation is studied. The resolved motion rate control strategy shows superiority over conventional joint-based control in heavy-duty forestry machines. Two inverse Jacobian manipulator control schemes, based on velocity and on position servo schemes, are introduced and evaluated under various operating conditions. The results provide guidelines for the design and implementation of manipulator controllers on a forestry machine...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{some aspects}} of an ongoing research on a commercial compact excavator. The interest {{is focused on the}} analysis and modelling of the whole hydraulic circuit that, beside a load sensing variable displacement pump, features a stack of nine proportional directional control valves modules of which seven are of the load sensing type. Loads being sensed are the <b>boom</b> <b>swing,</b> <b>boom,</b> stick and bucket, right and left track motors and work tools; instead, the blade and the turret swing users do not contribute to the load sensing signal. Of specific interest are the peculiarities that were observed in the stack. In fact, to develop an accurate AMESim modelling, the stack was dismantled and all modules analysed and represented in a CAD environment as 3 D parts. The load sensing flow generation unit was replaced on the vehicle by another one whose analysis and modelling have been developed using available design and experimental data. Although both the Hydraulic Component Design library as well as the Planar Mechanical library were used extensively in the process of modelling the entire circuit, some simplifications became necessary and are detailed in the paper. As the modelling phase was developing, a number of field experiments on the vehicle were also performed: these served the purpose of providing reference data to the end of progressing with the validation phase of the AMESim model. Regarding predictive simulation results, these are appropriately consistent with gathered experimental outcomes. The AMESim model will be instrumental for upcoming analyses that foresee the substitution of the original stack with other load sensing post-compensated modules so to assess with reasonable confidence the effects on potential energy savings...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theoretical investigation on nature of two-dimensional periodic circular movement of a work-piece {{attached to the}} end of a modernized sawing unit boom.   The boom oscillation axis is established on an elastic suspension that makes forced oscillations along a horizontal axis. The paper provides a calculation model of an oscillatory system of a <b>boom</b> <b>swing</b> block for mathematical description of the point movement trajectory that belongs to the work-piece. The model permits to obtain a system of two connected equations describing this movement. Numerical solution of these equations permits to establish that the work-piece makes a two-dimensional periodic circular movement and it has an elliptical  trajectory. The paper gives data that reveal influence of elastic and inertial and dissipative characteristics of the oscillatory system on the elliptical trajectory parameters of the work-piece movement. The paper demonstrates  that the regulation of the forced oscillation frequency transferred to the <b>boom</b> <b>swing</b> block of the sawing unit is considered as. the simplest in realization and the most efficient method that makes it possible to control the required parameters. </p...|$|R
