It is the sixth Disney animated feature film {{and the first}} of the six package films produced by Walt Disney Productions in the 1940s. <b>Set</b> <b>in</b> <b>Latin</b> America, it is made up of four different segments; Donald Duck stars in two of them and Goofy stars in one. It also features the first appearance of José Carioca, the Brazilian cigar-smoking parrot. Saludos Amigos was popular enough that Walt Disney decided to make another film about Latin America, The Three Caballeros, to be produced two years later. Saludos Amigos premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. At 42 minutes, it is Disney's shortest animated feature to date. It garnered positive reviews and was theatrically reissued in 1949, when it was shown on a double bill with the first reissue of Dumbo.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLatin trades {{are closely}} related to the problem of {{critical}} <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>Latin</b> squares.

A consideration of Latin trades which consist of just two columns, two rows, or two elements establishes that scs(n) ⩾n- 1. We conjecture that a consideration of Latin trades on four rows may establish that scs(n) ⩾ 2 n- 4. We look at various attempts to prove a conjecture of Cavenagh about such trades.

40|$|A {{critical}} <b>set</b> <b>in</b> a <b>latin</b> square is a <b>set</b> of entries <b>in</b> a <b>latin</b> square {{which can}} be embedded <b>in</b> only one <b>latin</b> square.

A critical set is strong if the embedding latin square is particularly easy to find because the remaining squares of the latin square are "forced" one at a time.

No amount research need be referenced to justify the consensus that a power differential exists among women and men. The outcome that this power differential has created, however, varies from one society to another. The role of women in male-dominated societies is deconstructed through two films, each situated in the drug trafficking industry—one <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>Latin</b> America and the other in the United States-Mexico border. While substantial literature explores the gender power differential in the United States and developing countries, little attention is given to the impact of gender participation in the developing world. Each of these countries has diverse expectations with gender politics; that is, some countries have women as leaders in suffrage reforms and corporations, while women in other countries are not even granted the right to divorce. This paper examines the relationship between gender participation of women and their defiance of the power differential as depicted in the Brazilian film City of God and the American film Traffic. While no evidence is independently presented that economic development provides a basis for equal participation, the most important factors such as gender violence and civil liberties provide a means of understanding the gender gap from a sociopolitical perspective...|$|E

The number of critical sets grows super-exponentially as the order of the Latin square increases. It is difficult to find patterns <b>in</b> <b>Latin</b> squares of small order (order 5 or less) which can be generalised in the process of creating new theorems. Thus, I have written many algorithms to find critical sets with various properties <b>in</b> <b>Latin</b> squares of order greater than 5, and to deal with other related structures. Some algorithms used {{in the body of the}} thesis are presented in Chapter 3; results which arise from the computational studies and observations of the patterns and subsequent results are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The cardinality of the largest critical <b>set</b> <b>in</b> any <b>Latin</b> square of order n is denoted by lcs(n).

In Chapter 6 a construction is given which verifies the existence of a critical set of size n²÷ 4 + 1 when n is even and n>= 6. The construction is based on the discovery of a critical set of size 17 for a Latin square of order 8. In Chapter 7 the representation of Steiner trades of volume less than or equal to nine is examined. Computational results are used to identify those trades for which the associated partial Latin square can be decomposed into six disjoint Latin interchanges.
