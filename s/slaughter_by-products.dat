Although they are {{generally}} effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause STDs, because of pores in the material. This {{is based on the}} idea that intestines, by their nature, are porous, permeable membranes, and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores, viruses—such as HIV, herpes, and genital warts—are small enough to pass through. However, there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory.

Two by-products processors using two types of raw materials (poultry and ruminants <b>slaughter</b> <b>by-products)</b> and different levels of sanitation were included in this study. Both processors employed the dry-rendering system for treatment using horizontal steam jacketed apparatuses (cookers). Fifty four samples were taken {{at different stages of}} processing, before cooking (Ground), after cooking (Cooked) and after milling and packing (Packed meals) and used to : 1 -Determine the load and type of bacteria in unprocessed slaughter by-prod ucts. 2 -Determine the load and type of bacteria in <b>slaughter</b> <b>by-products</b> at various stages of processing. 3 -Determine the efficiency of treatment procedures in reducing the bacterial load and recommend the best methods to guarantee the microbiological safety of processed <b>slaughter</b> <b>by-products.</b> An average aerobic plate count of 11 x 107 CFU/gm. was obtained for ground poultry by-products whereas the average coliform count was 1. 9 x 106 CFU/ gm.

After treatment at 230 C for 4 hrs the count was reduced to 1. 4 x 103 CFU/gm. and coliform count declined to Zero, but after packing the average count increased to 5. 5 x 105 CFU/gm and the coliform count was 1. 6 x 106 CFU/gm. This increase in bacterial viable count in packed meal is unacceptable in poultry additives. A total of 196 bacterial isolates were obtained and which were characteri-zed according to their morphology, Gram stain reaction, and biochemical reaction. Isolates included Escherichia coli, Sallmonella spp., Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp., Yersinina spp., Listeria spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphyloco- ccus spp.,Streptococcus spp.,Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp. and aerotolerant Clostridium. The high contamination rate and presence of potential pathogens in unprocessed samples constituted high risks for humans and the environment. The efficiency of the cookers was measured by examining the cooked sam-ples. The detection of aero-tolerant Clostridium tertium and Bacillus mace-rans in cooked ruminants by-products indicated the inefficiency of the procedure employed. Collection of by-products from clean sources and increasing the holding time or repeat cooking will improve the bacterial quality of ruminants <b>slaughter</b> <b>by-products</b> meals. Packed ruminants meal showed contamination by organisms usually found in raw materials such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp. Cory-nebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp., and xix this suggests possible recontamin-tion from raw material during air drying either by direct contact or indirectly by insects and rodents. Poultry feed additives are usually stored for a considerable time in the factory or poultry farms and this permits the multiplication of contaminating bacteria.

40|$|Fur {{animal feed}} {{production}} in Finland Annually approximately 400 million kg fur animal feed is manufactured in Finland. The feed is manufactured mainly from domestic feedstuffs. Vitamins and minerals are also {{added to the}} feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the animals. Fresh feed is composed almost 80 % of meat by-products, fish and cooked or dehydrated barley. In addition, meat and fish meals are also added. Feedstuffs, such as soybean meal or soy concentrate, corngluten and wheatgluten meals, potato protein and are also used when economically viable to do so. Mainly the slaughterhouse by-products and fox carcasses are acidified. Finnish Food Safety Authority controls the use of acids and preservatives. Due to national legislation all <b>slaughter</b> <b>by-products</b> at Finnish slaughterhouses must be acidified to pH 4. 0 or below before the by-products may leave the slaughterhouse. According to national legislation <b>slaughter</b> <b>by-products</b> must be grinded to a maximum particle size of 50 mm and the by-products must be treated with either sorbic acid or benzoic acid to prevent outgrowth of yeast and moulds. The most common combination for preservation is formic acid and Na-benzoate. Also sulphuric acid, formic acid- lactic acid solution and sodium metabisulphite solution have been used. Neutralisation is used in Finland. Most common way of neutralisation is the use of soda (Na 2 CO 3). Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) is also used. Every 15 feed kitchen in Finland take part in a systematic feed quality control by Finnish Fur Breeders Association (FFBA). The quality control requires minimum 2 feed samples per month from each feed kitchen. Feed samples are analysed in an accredited Fur Animal Feed Laboratory (FFBA) and the analysed results are reported monthly to the authorities. The formic acid content (85 % HCOOH) is analysed during March - August twice a month. vo...|$|E

Investigations were {{performed}} in the project „Unfharmfull disposal of inedible animal by-products in the AP of Vojvodina by their technical processing and base parameters of profitability of their processing“that {{was supported by the}} Provincial Secretary for science and technological development, Nr. 114 - 451 - 01458 / 2008. Abstract. In this study, nutritional components that are obtained during poultry slaughtering having significance with respect to processing into animal feeds were investigated. By-products obtained during poultry slaughtering are considered very valuable raw materials for production of highly valuable animal feeds and energetic feeds. Recognition of chemical and physical characteristics of the raw materials represents essential prerequisite for conduction of any technological process, for proper raw materials handling {{as well as for the}} equipment and machines design that are necessary for acceptance and processing of the inedible slaughterhouse by-products. Authors have found that the nitrogen complex of the examined raw materials contains predominantly proteins. Digestible nitrogen for all investigated raw materials equals approximately with total nitrogen content, indicating that all proteins from these raw materials are accessible for utilization in animal organism, with exception of feathers that need special technological processing. Basic chemical composition, nitrogen fractions and amino acid composition of the inedible by-products from poultry slaughterhouses indicate that the processing of these raw materials could be directed into production of swine and pet feeds production, as well in production of bio fuels and biogas. Blood and feathers anyhow represent significant protein source, and soft wastes, heads and legs, as well as the mixed raw material, besides as protein source, can be regarded as raw fat source.

In fact, the use of bone from feed industry is still limited as raw materials in animal feed, therefore bone is still categorized as a low economic value by-product. Since poultry is the largest farm population in Indonesia, chicken???s bone as a waste is still large enough. Structurally, bone is rich in bioactive compounds particularly collagen protein that is bounded strongly with minerals such as calcium and phosphorus [1 - 4].

40|$|The {{consumption}} of animal by-products {{has continued to}} witness tremendous growth over the last decade. This is due to its potential to combat protein malnutrition and food insecurity in many countries. Shortly after <b>slaughter,</b> animal <b>by-products</b> are separated into edible or inedible parts. The edible part accounts for 55 % of the production while the remaining part is regarded as inedible by-products (IEBPs). These IEBPs can be re-processed into sustainable products for agricultural and industrial uses. The efficient utilization of animal by-products can alleviate the prevailing cost and scarcity of feed materials, which have high competition between animals and humans. This will also aid in reducing environmental pollution in the society. In this regard, proper utilization of animal by-products such as rumen digesta can result in cheaper feed, reduction in competition and lower cost of production. Over the years, the utilization of animal by-products such as rumen digesta as feed in livestock feed has been successfully carried out without any adverse effect on the animals. However, there are emerging gaps {{that need to be}} further addressed regarding the food security and sustainability of the products.
