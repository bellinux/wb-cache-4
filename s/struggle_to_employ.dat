The federally imposed cod moratorium which was instituted in 1992 had a heavy impact on the fishing industry as a whole. One of the main employers on the Burin peninsula was Fishery Products International (FPI), with fish processing plants located in Fortune, Marystown, and the largest in Burin.

40|$|This {{research}} project aims {{to improve the}} onsite living conditions for construction workers in Ahmedabad, India. Due to rapid urbanisation, large-scale housing developments litter city margins throughout India, catering to a new middle class. The rate at which these developments are being built thrives off the abuse of unskilled labour. In a science-fiction scene, utopian worlds are being constructed by workers living in dystopic realities. Workers building these developments temporarily live on the construction sites in labour colonies. The exploited labourers are reliant on a financial opportunity, creating a dependent relationship for both them and the developments: a dependency resulting in a juxtaposition of luxury and squalor. The labour colonies belong to a Kinetic City; an incremental city in motion, characterised by recycling materials, constant modification and reinvention through the practise of Jugaad Urbanism. The labour colonies are innovative and productive, but highly susceptible to dysfunction, suffering {{from a lack of}} any basic infrastructure. True solutions go beyond the limits of architecture, but architecture can contribute substantially to improving {{the quality of life for}} the workers. The root of the problem lies in cultural, social and political acceptance of discrimination. The project proposes an immediate remedy attempting to improve quality of life; furthermore, it attempts to suggest an appropriate first move in an incremental process of change. The project harnesses the concept of Jugaad Urbanism and accepts that the labour colonies belong to the Kinetic City. Much of my research took place on site in India, where I documented the materials and spatial configurations used in construction workers’ labour colonies, and throughout the Kinetic City. Drawing on this research, I designed a network of open spaces and housing units that anticipates and makes room for the innovations of Jugaad Urbanism. I then tested this design in accordance with a set of basic guidelines that developed out of my research. The {{research project}} documents a <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> <b>employ</b> architecture as a means of achieving a desired standard of dignity for the construction workers. The project accepts that a realistic way to achieve this is by employing local techniques and incremental improvements, rather than by imposing a one-off, technologically advanced solution. The result is a design that is simple in terms of its spatial configurations, materiality and structure, but complex in terms of the social, cultural and economic barriers it must negotiate...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of how social work practitioners learn about and assess children's identities within the Core Assessment process contained within the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families. A qualitative case study was conducted within one childcare team in a local authority in South Wales with participation from key stakeholders involved in the assessment process: practitioners, parents, carers, and the subject children. Thirteen social work practitioners and eleven parent/carers participated in semi-structured interviews that explored what they understood identity to mean together with their appraisals of assessments of children's identities. Access to children was gained with consent of the parent/carers, with ten children {{taking part in a}} multi-method research strategy aimed at ascertaining children's own accounts of their identities. Core Assessment documents and interview data were analysed utilising textual analysis. The data from the children has been reproduced, wherever possible, verbatim to ensure their voices are made prominent within the study. The key findings are that the assessment of children's identities is an intricate, iterative task that poses practitioners with considerable practical and moral issues. Practitioners appear to utilise artistry in their management of the assessment task, commonly not making explicit the sources upon which their assessments of children's identities are based. It would appear that practitioners prefer to present their assessments of children's identities {{in the form of a}} narrative account, of which ownership of the details remains very much in the hands of the practitioner. Within this thesis subtle yet important differences between how practitioners, parents, carers and children construct identities is unearthed. It is posited that practitioners' assessments of children's identities do not reflect the individuality of the child and the reasons for this are explored. Also the adequacy of the Assessment Framework as a tool for assessing children's identities is questioned. It is suggested that the Assessment Framework restricts practitioners' assessments of children's identities to little more than constrained accounts of any child: thus ignoring the uniqueness of the subject children. It is demonstrated that in using the Assessment Framework, practitioners often <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> <b>employ</b> their own nuanced knowledge of the subject child. The complexities practitioners encounter in managing the task of assessment is considered. Some practitioners appear to invoke some sense of the fluidity and subjectivity of identities, suggesting an appreciation that there may be many different ways to perceive another. Other practitioners assert some singular and true identity that should be unearthed though the assessment process. More generally, the thesis reveals that practitioners typically construct children's identities within the familiar framework of developmental and object-relational theories. The implications of this for children to be constructed as passive objects, whose identities are seen as more simplistic, less sophisticated than adult identities, is critically examined. The limits and potential of contemporary assessment practices with regard to children's identities is also explored. It is suggested that greater inclusion of the views of parents, carers and subject children in assessment is needed if practitioners are to move away from a constrained re-construction of children's identities and to present instead accounts that more authentically reflect the individual identities of the subject children.

40|$|Two current {{perspectives}} within Anglo-American Nietzsche {{studies are}} Nietzsche as radical aristocrat who supports {{the exploitation of}} the masses, and Nietzsche as thinker who revives the ancient understanding of philosophy {{as a way of}} life. A Hellenized Nietzschean way of life, however, shares the liberal concern for the suffering individual that the aristocratic Nietzsche condemns for contributing to modern decadence. This thesis reconciles the two interpretations by examining the way Nietzsche’s way of life is the condition of his politics. Before a new aristocratic order dedicated to the promotion of greatness can arise, there must be philosophers of the future capable of founding it. A repurposing of Christian asceticism, Nietzsche’s way of life assists these creatures become what they are by increasing their will through the intensification of an inner conflict in which a ruling drive <b>struggles</b> <b>to</b> <b>employ</b> the other drives in the service of its task...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{reasoning}} is now {{featured in the}} mathematics curriculum documents of many nations, but this necessitates changes to teaching practice and hence a need for professional learning. The development of children’s mathematical reasoning requires appropriate encouragement and feedback from their teacher who can only do this if they recognise mathematical reasoning in children’s actions and words. As {{part of a larger}} study, we explored whether observation of educators conducting mathematics lessons can develop teachers’ sensitivity in noticing children’s reasoning and consideration of how to support reasoning. In the Mathematical Reasoning Professional Learning Research Program, demonstration lessons were conducted in Australian and Canadian primary classrooms. Data sources included post-lesson group discussions. Observation of demonstration lessons and engagement in post-lesson discussions proved to be effective vehicles for developing a professional eye for noticing children’s individual and whole-class reasoning. In particular, the teachers noticed that children <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>employ</b> mathematical language <b>to</b> communicate their reasoning and viewed limitations in language as a major barrier to increasing the use of mathematical reasoning in their classrooms. Given the focus of teachers’ noticing of the limitations in some types of mathematical language, it seems that targeted support is required for teachers to facilitate classroom discourse for reasoning...|$|R

Diversity has been recognised as a key cornerstone of employing a workforce which enables increased competitiveness, innovation and financial performance (IBEC, 2014) however large technical companies are continually <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> <b>employ</b> a gender diverse workforce within their technical departments (Peck, 2015). Current literary works offer theoretical research around gender differences and diversity within the workforce however little real-life accounts from a technology perspective in Ireland was uncovered. This exploratory research took a qualitative approach for which 6 interviews were conducted in total. Interviews were conducted with 6 professional women employed within the technical Global Support and Deployment (GSD) department of Company X based in Ireland and their perspectives were sought as to why this Gender Gap existed, what experiences they had with a Gender Gap in technology and what could influence a more gender diverse workforce within the Irish office of Company X’s GSD department. The research uncovered that the belief behind this Gender Gap within the technological GSD department of Company X is {{as a result of}} young women not choosing technology as a field of study. This has resulted in few women with the competencies to fulfil the positions available. This choice is believed to be {{as a result of a}} lack of interest and misunderstanding about the field as a consequence of certain influences and encouragement in early childhood which will be explored in more detail throughout the Dissertation...|$|R

Many of Crawford's stage and radio plays included themes of the battler fighting against the establishment; people trying to gain rights, as well as issues within society which he thought may need attention from a larger audience. Joe Harris, a follow Communist Party member, outlined the aim of a progressive writer in a letter of correspondence between himself and Crawford in regards to the manuscript of Billets or Badges: [...] "It will be agreed that the task of progressive writers is to use art as a weapon in the working class <b>struggle.</b> Helping <b>to</b> defeat <b>employing</b> class ideas – helping to bring correct methods of struggle before the working class and so on". The fundamental ideology in Crawford's work is emphasised in this and hence Crawford worked in alliance with a number of groups in order to help provide the working class with equal opportunities.|$|R
