500|$|Menfond Electronic Art adapted Bizenghast into {{animated}} short episodes or [...] "iManga". The iManga episodes [...] featured {{music by}} Divine Madness and Kissing Violet, and premiered on My Space in summer 2007. Overall, LeGrow praised the adaption. She liked the [...] "kooky" [...] background effects and Edaniel's voice actor, but disliked Dinah's [...] "high-pitched" [...] voice which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> as [...] "deeper...with a slight edge to it. Sort of like Mandy from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, {{but without the}} sarcasm." [...] The episodes were also available on Verizon's V CAST. The television network iaTV acquired the seventeen two- to three-minute-long episodes {{as part of a}} [...] "program acquisition deal and strategic ad sales partnership with Tokyopop." ...|$|E
500|$|Like [...] "To Be", {{the next}} track [...] "Seasons" [...] was remastered and mixed by Morimoto. The final {{original}} track, [...] "Voyage", {{was described by}} CD Journal as a midtempo ballad influenced by gospel music, layered with several string arrangements and other instrumentation. [...] "A Song for ××" [...] was re-worked as a live demo, recorded at the Avex Trax studios in Japan. For the promotional track [...] "Who...", Hamasaki asked CMJK {{to create a more}} [...] "warmer" [...] version than the original. The closing track for A Ballads was [...] "Sotsugyō Shashin". According to Hamasaki, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> recording a cover for a studio album, but was unsuccessful at doing so. To compose the track, she and the songs co-composer Tasuku composed it by using a Fender Rhodes Suitcase Mk I electric piano in order to reflect the songs original 1960s–1970s pop influence.|$|E
2500|$|The book's {{publication}} surprised many people, {{especially those}} who knew Sewall, because it revealed a previously unknown side of her life that she had concealed from the public for nearly twenty-five years. Sewall provided two reasons for concealing her involvement in the spiritualism movement until the publication of her book. She claimed those who contacted her from the spirit world told her keep quiet, and the few living friends who did know about her communications with the dead thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> them. Sewall explained her intent in publishing the book was to provide others with the [...] "comfort of knowing the simplicity and naturalness of the life into which they passed" [...] after their life on earth ended.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, Willy Croup, who {{had begun}} to regret that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ever said {{anything}} about blankets,--but how could <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that anybody could be so cut up at what that old Shott woman had said?--brought Mrs. Cliff a letter.|$|R
5000|$|On the children's show Sesame Street episode 3119, Oscar the Grouch meets a British Grouch named Prunella (a Grouch {{performed}} by Louise Gold), who expresses {{desire to go}} the [...] "perfect Grouch place", which doesn't exist, but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> it several times. During {{the course of this}} fantasy, she sings [...] "Wouldn't It Be Yucky", which parodies [...] "Wouldn't It Be Loverly".|$|R
500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone <b>has</b> relaxed or <b>imagined</b> something, or just thinks that he or <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> something while we know that he has not." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lee and Balsamo {{started working}} on the song during a camp session in Florida which lasted for several months; Lee played the music <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> for the song in her room while Balsamo could overhear it from his while {{simultaneously}} working on a very different [...] "heavy riff". Upon hearing his work, Lee proposed that they mix both pieces together {{which led to the}} conception of [...] "Call Me When You're Sober". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing on the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] was written in the key of E minor. It is set in common time and performed in a moderately fast tempo of 96 beats per minute for a total length of 3 minutes and 34 seconds. Lee's vocal range in the song spans from the low musical note of G3 to the high musical note of Eb5. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times identified numerous different genres present in [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] such as nu metal, symphonic rock and electropop. The song starts off as a piano ballad, progresses into a hard rock song with an orchestral pop-infused chorus and contains a bridge before the last chorus. The singer's vocals are doubled for the second verse of the song.|$|E
60|$|She saw his surprise, which {{suggested}} that her task might prove {{more difficult than}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E
60|$|Carrie Denham {{felt her}} cheeks burn, {{for she had}} to make him understand, and it was harder than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E
50|$|It becomes {{obvious that}} he wants Marie to forget Paulie, when the father brings her a cat. The cat and Paulie do not get along. Once again, Warren blames Paulie for Marie's {{speaking}} problems and believes <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> Paulie's ability to speak. Eventually after a dramatic event in which Marie falls off the roof {{in an attempt to}} teach Paulie to fly, Warren convinces Marie's mother Lila (Laura Harrington) to send him away.|$|R
50|$|Hortense, for example, {{sought to}} conduct {{herself as a}} proper woman in Jamaica, {{aspiring}} to some greater cultural standard she perceived as synonymous with Britishness. Upon arriving in the United Kingdom, she finds that despite her greatest efforts to perform Englishness, her cultural origins and skin color bar her from ever becoming completely English. Despite this rejection based on factors entirely out of her control, she remains fond of the idealized Britain <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> for her entire life.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him and it dawned upon her that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> always <b>imagined</b> herself to be afraid of him and that indeed she wasn't. She shook her head obstinately.|$|R
60|$|Once {{astride the}} horse again, Helen had to congratulate herself upon not being so {{crippled}} as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> Indeed, Bo {{made all the}} audible complaints.|$|E
60|$|Very slowly {{emerging}} {{out of a}} {{phase of}} stupefaction, these personal affairs and her personal problem resumed possession of her mind. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> she had drowned them altogether.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked down}} at her from his {{superior}} height with kindling eyes. It was odd how greatly she was surprised in him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> him to be a cynic.|$|E
50|$|Some have {{compared}} {{the story to}} The Turn of the Screw, published just before In the Cage. The unnamed protagonists of both stories do display active imaginations, but the telegraphist seems much better grounded in reality. At least critics do not ask whether <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen. A few critics have amused themselves by trying to guess exactly what the telegraphist deciphered from the telegrams between Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen. James himself said that he didn't know and he didn't want to know.|$|R
60|$|He {{was such}} a boy, this big giant of a millionaire who had half the rich men of San Francisco afraid of him. Such a boy! <b>She</b> <b>had</b> never <b>imagined</b> this side of his nature.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth, with {{a triumphant}} sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that Bingley <b>had</b> {{received}} his sanction to be happy, <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, {{with an expression}} of half-laughing alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a {{very busy}} woman," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Jackson sharply, thinking that James was not treating her with proper seriousness. He was {{not so easy to}} tackle as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{felt that}} {{henceforth}} {{she would have}} less faith in what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> was her love of the elements. What little she knew! If this iron-nerved man feared a storm, then {{there was something about}} a storm to fear.|$|E
60|$|And {{there it}} was already, looming up grey and amorphous, patched with snow. It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> Boulogne gay and brilliant. Whereas it was more grey and dismal than England. But not that magical, mystic, phantom look.|$|E
60|$|The query {{once heard}} {{was not so}} {{embarrassing}} to Jane as <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> <b>imagined.</b> Moreover, it established in her mind a fact that there existed actually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him. And as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been bold, so she determined to be both honest and brave.|$|R
60|$|All {{her fears}} {{seemed to be}} melting away. Never could <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> a more harmless-looking, benevolent, and {{handsome}} old gentleman. He was thin and of only moderate stature. His white hair, of which he still had plenty, was parted {{in the middle and}} brushed away in little waves. He was clean-shaven, and his grey eyes were at once soft and humorous. He had a delicate mouth, refined features, and his slow, distinct speech was pleasant, almost soothing to listen to. She felt suddenly an immense wave of relief, and she realized perhaps for the first time how much <b>she</b> <b>had</b> dreaded this meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to my knowledge," [...] said Melissa, who, of course, {{only knew}} the Wax-moth as a lady with principles, {{and had never}} thought to report her presence. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> always <b>imagined</b> Wax-moths to be like blood-red dragon-flies.|$|R
60|$|In truth she did {{not know}} whether to be angry, or frightened, or glad of the truth that she read there; or mortified that it had awakened in her a {{realization}} that possibly an analysis of her own interest in this young stranger might reveal more than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E
60|$|Wilmet {{was near}} enough to hear, and colour. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> the last night's {{conversation}} unknown to all; but Underwood reticence was so incapable of guessing at Harewood communicativeness, that it never entered her brain to suspect the topic of conversation between the three juniors as they walked up the drowsy street.|$|E
60|$|Mercedes again paused, and {{appeared}} to muse deeply. Her eyes had brightened under the soothing asseverations of her lover, and, spite of the generous self-devotion with which she had determined to sacrifice all her own hopes to what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> would make her lover happy, the seductive influence of requited affection was fast resuming its power.|$|E
50|$|She pro-actively seeks sexual {{satisfaction}} after she {{is left with}} a void when Kenny has to move away. She also begins to realise {{that there is more}} to her father's extended stays in Canada than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> previously <b>imagined.</b>|$|R
60|$|He turned {{aside and}} leaned against a tree, as if not daring to watch {{the effect of the}} {{agitated}} words that had broken from him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> little <b>imagined</b> whither his last sayings had been tending, and stood still, breathless with the surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure we {{are very}} glad--and we wish you all {{possible}} happiness," [...] said Anne, very flatly and inadequately, as she felt. She was not prepared for such an occasion. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> never <b>imagined</b> herself offering betrothal felicitations to Miss Cornelia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say you so?" [...] she exclaimed, {{raising her}} eyebrows, {{and looking at}} me more closely than hitherto. And then {{it seemed to me}} that into her face crept a shade of disappointment. If this Bardelys were not more {{beautiful}} than I, then he was not nearly so beautiful a man as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> She turned to Saint-Eustache.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had looked}} forward to her coming almost as if to the return of her mother. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> her looking strange and {{beautiful}} because {{she came out of}} the mystical, far-off land her father often spoke of. Instead of these things Mrs. Diehl was a strong-featured, mild-voiced woman, rather large and ungraceful, who looked upon the motherless child and clicked her tongue--tch! ...|$|E
60|$|JOAN HARTLEY’S {{letter to}} her father was {{not so easy to}} write as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> She tore up draft after draft, and at last, in despair, wrote him a brief and dutiful epistle, informing him that she had changed her name to Tremblett. She added—in a postscript—that she {{expected}} he would be surprised; and, having finished her task, sat trying to decide whether to commit it to the post or the flames.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been her fancy then; {{and yet it was}} strange, that, without {{anything}} in her previous thoughts to lead to it, <b>she</b> should <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> this figure so very distinctly. She was still wondering and thinking of it, when a girl came to light her to bed.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{he expresses}} his true {{feelings}} for Jin, but she’s {{become obsessed with}} a hippie farang, whom she's seen reading the same white book <b>she</b> <b>has.</b> <b>She</b> <b>imagines</b> the man is named Peter and believes he is an environmental activist {{who was killed in}} a protest in Washington, D.C.. Inspired, she starts collecting plastic bottles, gathering enough to create a mountain that towers over the city, and joins an environmental protest movement calling for a ban on plastic.|$|R
60|$|Grace {{felt the}} calm soothing, for her {{thoughts}} {{were not a}} little disturbed. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> met Thorn {{in the afternoon and}} noted a puzzling change in his manner. So far, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been able to check his cautious advances, but she now remarked a new confidence that seemed to indicate he had some power in reserve. She admitted that <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> this, but it troubled her.|$|R
