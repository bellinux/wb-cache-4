5|$|The British No. 1 {{sustained}} {{tendon damage}} {{during his first}} round match at the German Open in Hamburg. Murray was up 5–1 when he hit a forehand {{from the back of}} the court and <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> tendons in his wrist, leaving him out of action from 15 May until 7 August, thereby missing Wimbledon. During this rest period, Murray rose to world No. 8, but by 7 August, he had dropped to no 14.|$|E
5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury. A collision with Wycombe Wanderers' Jason Cousins on 20 February 1999 spelt {{the beginning of the}} end for Swan's career, as the result of a scan showed he had <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> cruciate ligament in his right knee.|$|E
5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{on their first}} {{possession}}s, Arkansas long snapper Will Coleman <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> ball {{over the head of}} punter Dylan Breeding that gave Alabama possession at the Razorbacks' six-yard line. On the next play, Eddie Lacy scored on a six-yard run for a 7–0 Crimson Tide lead. The Razorbacks responded with an eight-play, 51-yard drive, but failed to score any points after a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal hit the left upright. Each team again traded punts before the Crimson Tide extended their lead to 10–0 early in the second quarter on a 51-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E
5000|$|On most plays, <b>the</b> {{center will}} <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball {{directly}} into the quarterback's hands. In a shotgun formation, <b>the</b> center <b>snaps</b> <b>the</b> ball to the quarterback lined up several yards behind him. In punt and field goal formations, <b>the</b> center also <b>snaps</b> <b>the</b> ball several yards behind him to the punter or holder on the field goal unit. Because bad snaps can ruin special teams plays and cause turnovers, most teams have a center who is specifically trained for <b>snapping</b> <b>the</b> ball in punt and field goal formations. This player {{is referred to as}} the team's long snapper. Also, the center does not have to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball to the quarterback, holder, or punter. He is allowed to <b>snap</b> <b>the</b> ball to anyone behind him. Because of this, some plays involve snaps directly to running backs instead of the player generally expected to receive <b>the</b> <b>snap,</b> hoping to fool the defense.In slang, the player receiving <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> is said to be [...] "under center" [...] if he receives the ball directly from the center (not in shotgun). This phrase is typically applied to quarterbacks, but has been used in reference to other positions as well.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the quarterback}} {{commands}} the ball, it is <b>the</b> center's <b>snap</b> that renders <b>the</b> ball in play; {{the defensive line}} may not cross {{the line of scrimmage}} until <b>the</b> center <b>snaps</b> <b>the</b> football. An astute center can help draw an opposing team offside prior to <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> or potentially trick the other team into a penalty by quickly <b>snapping</b> <b>the</b> ball while the opposing team attempts to substitute players.|$|R

5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat <b>snapped.</b> <b>The</b> lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
5|$|HMS Empress of India, {{named after}} a regnal title of Queen Victoria, was the first ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. She was ordered under the Naval Defence Act Programme of 1889 with the name of Renown and was laid down on 9 July 1889 at Pembroke Dockyard. The ship was renamed before she was {{launched}} on 7 May 1891 by Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn. One man was killed when a cable <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> following day. The ship was then transferred to Chatham Dockyard, where she was completed in August 1893, at a cost of £912,612.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{two teams}} won a {{combined}} six national championships, with Maryland dominating {{the first part of}} the decade and Johns Hopkins the latter. Between 1951 and 1956, Maryland posted a 5–0–1 record against Hopkins, with three games won by at least six points. The Terps won consecutive national titles in 1955 and 1956, while posting a combined record of 21–0. In 1957, the Blue Jays <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> Terrapins' 31-game winning streak with an upset win, 15–10. Two years later, both teams shared the national title with Army. Between 1955 and 1959, Maryland compiled a 48–3 record, with all three losses at the hands of Johns Hopkins.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wild}} card playoffs, the Giants built a 38–14 3rd-quarter lead against San Francisco. However, the 49ers rallied, scoring a field goal, and three touchdowns to take a 39–38 lead with a minute left in the game. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds left, setting up a {{potential}} game winning 41-yard field goal attempt for Matt Bryant. On the final play of the game, 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin — {{who had just been}} signed for this playoff game — <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> ball low, and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball properly for the attempt. Allen picked the ball up and threw an unsuccessful pass downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert as time expired, and the Giants lost 39–38.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not <b>snapped.</b> <b>The</b> defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

5|$|In Super Bowl XLVIII, Manning's Broncos {{lost to the}} Seattle Seahawks by a {{score of}} 43–8. Manning was up against the Seahawks' young {{starting}} quarterback Russell Wilson, who idolized Manning and attended one of Manning's passing camps as a teenager, and later met Manning at a Broncos pre-draft interview. The Seahawks' number one ranked defense proved {{too much for the}} Broncos' number one ranked offense to overcome, while the Broncos' defense also struggled due to injuries. The Broncos' first play from scrimmage {{set the tone for the}} game. While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible, center Manny Ramirez <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> ball too early and it flew past Manning's head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno downed it for a safety. Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLIX), but the record-setting offense did not record a first down until the second quarter, and did not score any points until the final seconds of the third quarter. While Manning threw one touchdown pass and one successful two-point conversion, he also threw two costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon <b>snapped,</b> <b>the</b> camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children <b>snapped</b> <b>the</b> teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E

50|$|In most offenses the {{tailback}} was {{the main}} ball handler and generator of offense; however, the fullback could also take <b>the</b> direct <b>snap</b> due to his proximity to the tailback.
