40|$|Technical BriefTechnical Brief 1 : This {{paper will}} discuss the {{challenges}} with contamination of <b>gas</b> <b>seals.</b> The reliability of <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> is largely dependent on having a continuous supply of clean and dry <b>seal</b> <b>gas.</b> In dynamic mode, gas supply systems take product gas from a higher pressure level in the compressor, filter it {{and use it to}} create the ideal environment for the <b>gas</b> <b>seal.</b> This typically ensures that the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> is provided with effective protection against contaminated process <b>gas.</b> Compressor <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> are very robust sealing devices, but need to be operated in a dry and clean environment. The leading root cause of <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> failures is contamination. One of the most common sources of contamination is during compressor start up, slow-roll, standstill, or shutdown modes or because the conditioning skid is not sufficient. In these modes {{there is a lack of}} <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow, which suggests no means to produce <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow is available, such as a high pressure gas source or booster for the <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> supply. This is where it pays to have a reliable, clean <b>gas</b> supply. Without <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow, sufficient <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> cannot be provided to the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> and results in the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> being contaminated. This paper will describe contamination to the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> by process <b>gas,</b> during commissioning, by particle and by liquids, which are caused by inadequate <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> supply. Then it will focus on different methods of providing <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow during transient conditions. And finally, it will discuss solutions to ensure a reliable, clean gas flow to the seal at all relevant conditions together with additional possibilities to add robustness to <b>gas</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R

There are other systems that saw success in earlier days of the sport, such as blow-forward (AGD Automag) and pneumatically actuated recocking (WorrGames Autococker); elements of these designs were carried forward into modern electropneumatic designs but the original examples of these mechanisms are rarely seen today.|$|E

Another class of appliances introduced were apparatuses - and ultimately, machines - for retort loading and unloading. Retorts were generally loaded by using an elongated scoop, into which the coal was loaded - a gang of men would then lift the scoop and ram it into the retort. The coal would then be raked by the men into a layer of even thickness and the retort <b>sealed.</b> <b>Gas</b> production would then ensue - and from 8 - 12 hours later, the retort would be opened, and the coal would be either pulled (in the case of [...] "stop-ended" [...] retorts) or pushed (in the case of [...] "through" [...] retorts) out of the retort. Thus, the retort house had heavy manpower requirements - as many men were often required to bear the coal-containing scoop and load the retort.|$|E

The plates are separated by a <b>sealed</b> <b>gas</b> space that consists of a spacer material that surrounds the perimeter of each plate.

IG must consist of at least two plates of glass, but can be expanded to three plates of glass where there would be two <b>sealed</b> <b>gas</b> spaces. As a result of the configuration of IG units, the load that is distributed between the plates will vary based on the properties of the glass, the initial conditions of the unit, and the properties of the spacer material.

These factors include the thickness of the plates, temperature variations in the <b>sealed</b> <b>gas</b> space, and atmospheric pressure differences between the <b>sealed</b> <b>gas</b> space and the current atmospheric pressure. Computer software was used to write a program that accurately modeled existing experimental data on tests completed for double pane IG units.

A triple pane IG model was developed to evaluate the effects of extreme pressure drops in a hurricane as well as gas space temperature variations.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double <b>seals</b> with a <b>gas</b> buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double <b>gas</b> buffered <b>sealing</b> system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> device. The double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> leaks to process and the inside <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional <b>gas</b> <b>seal.</b> The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> face. With the configuration described, the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R
