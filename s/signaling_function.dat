40|$|Although most {{developing}} countries monitor {{the proportion of}} births attended by skilled birth attendants (SBA), they lack information on the availability and performance of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> by different cadres of health care providers (HCPs). The World Health Organisation <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> are set of key interventions that targets direct obstetric causes of maternal deaths. Seven <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> are required for health facilities providing basic EmOC and nine for facilities providing comprehensive EmOC. Our objectives were to describe cadres of HCPs who are considered SBAs in Tanzania, the EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> they perform and challenges associated with performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCPs offering maternity care services at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District in northern Tanzania. A questionnaire and health facility assessment forms were used to collect information from participants and health facilities. A total of 199 HCPs working at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District met the inclusion criteria. Out of 199, 158 participated, giving {{a response rate of}} 79. 4 %. Ten cadres of HCPs were identified as conducting deliveries regardless of the level of health facilities. Most of the participants (81 %) considered themselves SBAs, although some were not considered SBAs by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Only two out of the eight facilities provided all of the required EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> While Assistant Medical Officers are expected to perform all the <b>signal</b> <b>functions,</b> only 38 % and 13 % had performed vacuum extraction or caesarean sections respectively. Very few registered and enrolled nurse-midwives had performed removal of retained products (22 %) or assisted vaginal delivery (24 and 11 %). Inadequate equipment and supplies, and lack of knowledge and skills in performing EmOC were two main challenges identified by health care providers in all the level of care. In the district, gaps existed between performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> by SBAs as expected by the MOHSW and the actual performance at health facilities. All basic EmOC facilities were not fully functional. Few health care providers performed all the basic EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> Competency-based in-service training of providers in EmOC and provision of enabling environment could improve performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> in the district...|$|R

Readiness of the facilities is essential to provide all the basic and comprehensive <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC to ensure emergency services from the designated facilities. The study assessed population coverage and availability of EmONC services {{in public and private}} facilities in Bangladesh. An assessment was conducted in all the public and private facilities providing obstetric care in to in-patients 24 districts. Data were collected on the performance of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC from the study facilities {{in the last three months}} prior to the date of assessment. Trained data-collectors interviewed the facility managers and key service providers, along with review of records, using contextualized tools. Population coverage of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> was assessed by estimating the number of facilities providing the <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC compared to the United Nations requirements. Availability was assessed in terms of the proportion of facilities providing the services by type of facilities and by district. Caesarean section (CS) delivery and blood transfusion (BT) services (the two major components of comprehensive EmONC) were respectively available in 6. 4 (0. 9 public and 5. 5 private) and 5. 6 (1. 3 public and 4. 3 private) facilities per 500, 000 population. The <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for basic EmONC, except two (parental anticonvulsants and assisted vaginal delivery), were available in a minimum of 5 facilities (public and private sectors combined) per 500, 000 population. A major inter-district variation in the availability of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> was observed in each public- and private-sector facility. Among the various types of facilities, only the public medical college hospitals had all the <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> The situation was poor in other public facilities at the district and sub-district levels as well as in private facilities. In the public sector, CS delivery and BT services were available in the minimum required number of facilities. However, to ensure basic EmONC services, participation of the private sector is necessary.

Methods and Findings Key personnel in the Ministries of Health, teaching institutions, referral, regional and district hospitals completed structured questionnaires in nine SSA countries in 2009 – 2011. A total of 21 different cadres of health care providers (HCP) were reported to be SBA. Type and number of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> reported to be provided, varied substantially between cadres and countries. Parenteral antibiotics, uterotonic drugs and anticonvulsants were provided by most SBAs. Removal of retained products of conception and assisted vaginal delivery were the least provided <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> Except for the cadres of obstetricians, medical doctors and registered nurse-midwives, there was lack of clarity regarding <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> reported to be performed and whether they were legislated to perform these.

40|$|Objective: To provide clear policy {{directions}} for {{gaps in the}} provision of <b>signal</b> <b>function</b> services and sub-regions requiring priority attention using data from the 2010 Ghana Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) survey. Methods: Using 2010 survey data, the fraction of facilities with only one or two <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> missing was calculated for each facility type and EmONC designation. Thematic maps were used to provide insight into inequities in service provision. Results: Of 1159 maternity facilities, 89 provided all the necessary basic or comprehensive EmONC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> 3 months prior to the 2010 survey. Only 21 % of facility-based births were in fully functioning EmONC facilities, but an additional 30 % occurred in facilities missing one or two basic signal functions—most often assisted vaginal delivery and removal of retained products. Tackling these missing <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> would extend births taking place in fully functioning facilities to over 50 %. Subnational analyses based on estimated total pregnancies in each district revealed a pattern of inequity in service provision across the country. Conclusion: Upgrading facilities missing only one or two <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> will allow Ghana to meet international standards for availability of EmONC services.

This is important because in MS, the body's immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of <b>signaling</b> <b>function</b> and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body's own cells, and instead attack invaders.|$|E

50|$|At the organismic level, {{mechanical}} stress has {{a profound impact}} on extracellular matrix integrity and probably causes induction of a number of ECM genes for repair and remodeling of ECM in tissue stroma and basement membranes. One study examined the in vitro effects of pressure on global gene transcription using a microarray approach and a cell stretching system meant to simulate intraocular pressure in the lamina cribosa (connective tissue) of the optic nerve head. Their findings were that perlecan and several other proteoglycans were upregulated in response to the stretching stimulus. TGF-β2 and VEGF were induced as well, possibly contributing to the upregulation of the perlecan transcript and protein. It has been shown that autocrine TGF-β signaling is a compensatory result of {{mechanical stress}} in vitro in endothelial cells. Using a similar cell stretching mechanism to mimic arterial pressure, this investigation showed that perlecan production increased in response to mechanical strain. This is contingent upon TGF-β autocrine signaling in a positive feedback loop with p38 and ERK. This endothelial cell increase in production of VSMC growth inhibitors (i.e. heparin) is reversed in VSMCs, where mechanical stress induces proliferation. Deformation of VSMC cells in culture leads to perlecan upregulation, with a significant increase in sulfation of the heparan sulfate chains. This is not in contrast to the data shown where perlecan expression is constant beyond e19 in rat VSMC, which suggested that perlecan plays an antiproliferative role for VSMCs. In this case, it seems that the molecule's <b>signaling</b> <b>function</b> is the operative upregulated factor, especially due to the increase in sulfation of the heparan sulfate chains.|$|E

Recent {{studies suggest that the}} <b>signaling</b> <b>function</b> of Tax requires its ubiquitination, although how the Tax ubiquitination is regulated remains unclear. Results We show here that the deubiquitinase CYLD physically interacts with Tax and negatively regulates the ubiquitination of this viral protein. This function of CYLD is associated with inhibition of Tax-mediated activation of IKK although not that of Tak 1. Interestingly, CYLD undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in HTLV 1 -transformed T cells, a mechanism known to inactivate the catalytic activity of CYLD. Consistently, a phospho-mimetic CYLD mutant fails to inhibit Tax ubiquitination. Conclusion These findings suggest that CYLD negatively regulates the <b>signaling</b> <b>function</b> of Tax through inhibition of Tax ubiquitination. Conversely, induction of CYLD phosphorylation may serve as a mechanism by which HTLV 1 overrides the inhibitory function of CYLD, leading to the persistent activation of NF-&# 954;B...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is an {{approach}} to reactive programming where systems are structured as networks of <b>functions</b> operating on <b>signals.</b> FRP {{is based on the}} synchronous data-flow paradigm and supports both continuous-time and discrete-time signals (hybrid systems). What sets FRP apart from most other languages for similar applications is its support for systems with dynamic structure and for higher-order data-flow constructs. This raises a range of implementation challenges. This paper contributes towards advancing {{the state of the art}} of FRP implementation by studying the notion of signal change and change propagation in a setting of hybrid <b>signal</b> <b>function</b> networks with dynamic structure. To sidestep some problems of certain previous FRP implementations that are structured using arrows, we suggest working with a notion of composable, multi-input and multi-output <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> A clear conceptual distinction is also made between continuous-time and discrete-time signals. We then show how establishing change-related properties of the <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> in a network allows such networks to be simplified (static optimisation) and can help reducing the amount of computation needed for executing the networks (dynamic optimisation). Interestingly, distinguishing between continuous-time and discrete-time signals allows us to characterise the change-related properties of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> more precisely than what we otherwise would have been able to, which is helpful for optimisation...|$|R
