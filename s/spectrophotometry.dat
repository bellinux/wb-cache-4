5|$|Sodium {{content in}} bulk may be {{determined}} by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO2)2ZnNa(CH3CO2)·6H2O precipitates and can be weighed. Caesium and rubidium do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may {{be determined by}} atomic absorption <b>spectrophotometry</b> or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{sample is}} also {{examined}} for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid. This {{can be determined}} by <b>spectrophotometry</b> (measuring the absorption of particular wavelengths of light) or visual examination. It is unclear which method is superior. Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache. An interval of at least 12hours between {{the onset of the}} headache and lumbar puncture is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin.|$|E
25|$|This {{has made}} <b>spectrophotometry</b> {{the methods of}} choice for {{measurements}} of bacterial growth and related applications. Spectrophotometry's drawback is its inability to provide an absolute count or distinguish between living and dead cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} determination of reaction rates involves measuring how {{the concentrations of}} reactants or products change over time. For example, the concentration of a reactant can be measured by <b>spectrophotometry</b> at a wavelength where no other reactant or product in the system absorbs light.|$|E
25|$|The CRI {{can also}} be {{theoretically}} derived from the SPD of the illuminant and samples since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care {{should be taken to}} use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5nm increments , so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's <b>spectrophotometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1940, the {{equipment}} needed to measure light {{energy in the}} visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount at that time. There was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range. Just as Beckman had created a single easy-to-use instrument for measuring pH, he made it a goal to create an easy-to-use instrument for <b>spectrophotometry.</b> Beckman's research team, led by Howard Cary, developed several models.|$|E
25|$|The {{colorimetric}} {{detection method}} depends on incubation {{of the western}} blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through densitometry (how intense the stain is) or <b>spectrophotometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cell {{suspensions}} are turbid. Cells {{absorb and}} scatter the light. The higher the cell concentration, {{the higher the}} turbidity. Spectrophotometers can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent cuvette and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. Optical density (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the cell suspension in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using <b>spectrophotometry</b> for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as turbidometry.|$|E
25|$|Photometry / <b>spectrophotometry</b> When the {{absorbance}} of {{a specific}} wavelength of light while passing through a fixed path-length through a cuvette of liquid test sample is measured and the absorbance is compared with a blank and standards with graded amounts of the target compound. If the emitted light is {{of a specific}} visible wavelength it may be called colorimetry, or it may involve specific wavelength of light e.g. by use of laser and emission of fluorescent signals of another specific wavelength which is detected via very specific wavelength optical filters.|$|E
25|$|Light {{dispersed}} by the grating or prism in a spectrograph can {{be recorded}} by a detector. Historically, photographic plates were widely used to record spectra until electronic detectors were developed, and today optical spectrographs most often employ charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The wavelength scale of a spectrum can be calibrated by observing {{the spectrum of}} emission lines of known wavelength from a gas-discharge lamp. The flux scale of a spectrum can be calibrated {{as a function of}} wavelength by comparison with an observation of a standard star with corrections for atmospheric absorption of light; this is known as <b>spectrophotometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The CIE {{assembled}} {{a committee to}} study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing <b>spectrophotometry,</b> {{with a set of}} Munsell samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, CIEUVW. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the human visual system. CRI is based upon this system of colorimetry.|$|E

[...] Based partly on earlier work by Pierre Bouguer and Johann Heinrich Lambert, it establishes the analytical technique known as <b>spectrophotometry.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Beckman {{spectrophotometer}} was {{the first}} easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultraviolet-absorption <b>spectrophotometry</b> within a single housing. The user could insert a cell tray with standard and sample cells, dial up the desired wavelength of light, confirm that the instrument was properly set by measuring the standard, and then measure the amount of absorption of the sample, reading the frequency from a simple meter. A series of readings at different wavelengths could be taken without disturbing the sample. [...] The DU spectrophotometer's manual scanning method was extremely fast, reducing analysis times from weeks or hours to minutes.|$|E

After a short stint under Perrin in the Institute of Chemical Physics, he began his doctoral research in organic chemistry. He worked in the laboratory of Pauline Ramart-Lucas, investigating the <b>spectrophotometry</b> of organic compounds.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2012, authors R. Amorin, E. Perez-Montero, J. Vilchez and P. Papaderos {{published}} a paper titled [...] "The star formation history and metal {{content of the}} [...] "Green Peas". New detailed GTC-OSIRIS <b>spectrophotometry</b> of three galaxies" [...] in which they presented the findings of observations carried out using the Gran Telescopio Canarias at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory. They gather deep broad-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy of 3 GPs using high precision equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphatase {{denaturing}} {{was originally}} monitored using a phenol-phosphate substrate. When hydrolysed by the enzyme these compounds liberate phenols, {{which were then}} reacted with dibromoquinonechlorimide to give a colour change, which itself was measured by checking absorption at 610nm (<b>spectrophotometry).</b> Some of the phenols used were inherently coloured (phenolpthalein, nitrophenol) and were simply assayed unreacted. [...] Spectrophotometric analysis is satisfactory but is of relatively low accuracy because many natural products are coloured. For this reason, modern systems (since 1990) use fluorometry which is able to detect much lower levels of raw milk contamination.|$|E
2500|$|The new spectrophotometers used a prism to {{separate}} light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. They allowed {{the user to}} plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance, giving a standardized [...] "fingerprint", characteristic of a compound. With Beckman's model D, later known as the DU spectrophotometer, National Technical Laboratories successfully provided the first easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultraviolet-absorption <b>spectrophotometry.</b> The user could insert a sample, dial up the desired wavelength of light, and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter. [...] It produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy. [...] The National Bureau of Standards ran tests to certify that the DU's results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use.|$|E
2500|$|These {{data are}} {{measured}} through <b>spectrophotometry</b> reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply {{greater levels of}} crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin {{is known as the}} [...] "colouring strength" [...] of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coupé saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, <b>spectrophotometry</b> is the {{quantitative}} {{measurement of the}} reflection or transmission properties of a material {{as a function of}} wavelength. It is more specific than the general term electromagnetic spectroscopy in that <b>spectrophotometry</b> deals with visible light, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared, but does not cover time-resolved spectroscopic techniques.|$|E

Through differential <b>spectrophotometry,</b> the differences in optical densities of a blood sample flowing through small-bore glass tubes at isosbestic wavelengths for deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and {{the product of the}} luminal diameter and hematocrit create a linear relationship that is used to measure hematocrit levels.|$|E

50|$|Visual {{inspection}} is {{the most}} frequent method used in the United States to assess cerebrospinal fluid for xanthochromia, while <b>spectrophotometry</b> is used on up to 94% of specimens in the United Kingdom.

5000|$|As {{described}} in the applications section, <b>spectrophotometry</b> {{can be used in}} both qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Qualitative analysis can be used and spectrophotometers are used to record spectra of compounds by scanning broad wavelength regions to determine the absorbance properties (the intensity of the color) of the compound at each wavelength. One experiment that can demonstrate the various uses that visible <b>spectrophotometry</b> can have is the separation of β-galactosidase from a mixture of various proteins. Largely <b>spectrophotometry</b> is best used to help quantify the amount of purification your sample has undergone relative to total protein concentration. By running an affinity chromatography you can isolate B-Galactosidase and this can be tested by reacting collected samples with ONPG and determining if the sample turns yellow. Following this testing the sample at 420nm for specific interaction with ONPG and at 595 for a Bradford Assay the amount of purification can be assessed quantitatively. In addition to this <b>spectrophotometry</b> can be used in tandem with other techniques such as SDS-Page electrophoresis in order to purify and isolate various protein samples.|$|E
50|$|The above factors {{contribute}} to the measurement uncertainty of the results obtained with UV/Vis <b>spectrophotometry.</b> If UV/Vis <b>spectrophotometry</b> is used in quantitative chemical analysis then the results are additionally affected by uncertainty sources arising from {{the nature of the}} compounds and/or solutions that are measured. These include spectral interferences caused by absorption band overlap, fading of the color of the absorbing species (caused by decomposition or reaction) and possible composition mismatch between the sample and the calibration solution.|$|E

50|$|Many {{laboratories}} rely on {{only the}} color of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine {{the presence or absence of}} xanthochromia. However, recent guidelines suggest that <b>spectrophotometry</b> should be performed. <b>Spectrophotometry</b> relies on the different transmittance, or conversely, absorbance, of light by different substances or materials, including solutes. Bilirubin absorbs light at wavelengths between 450-460 nm. <b>Spectrophotometry</b> can also detect the presence of oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, which absorb light at 410-418 nm and 403-410 nm, respectively, and also may indicate that bleeding has occurred; to identify substances in cerebrospinal fluid that absorb light at other wavelengths but are not due to bleeding, such as carotenoids; and to detect very small amounts of yellow color saturation (about 0.62%) which may may be missed by visual inspection, especially when the cerebrospinal fluid has been examined under incandescent lighting or a tungsten desk lamp (corresponding to International Commission on Illumination standard illuminant A).|$|E
