5|$|Dolph Lundgren has a brief {{appearance}} {{as one of}} General Gogol's KGB agents. Lundgren, who was dating Grace Jones at the time, was visiting her on set when one day an extra was missing so the director John Glen then {{asked him if he}} wanted to get a <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Lundgren appears during the confrontation between Gogol and Zorin at the racetrack, standing several steps below Gogol.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in the {{gauntlet}} match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team championship left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline was they were given the shot since they only lost in the gauntlet match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he already was a champion. They {{went on to win the}} belts later in the show. At The Conclusion, The Battle Lines Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At Our Best in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E
25|$|A long video {{showing the}} three torturing a white kitten {{was shown in}} court. It takes place in their garage. The {{suspects}} fashioned a cross from wooden boards and nailed the kitten to it, then <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with pistols, placing foam and glue in its mouth to muffle the kitten's noises.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the {{restored}} {{body of a}} World War II Spitfire aircraft was mounted at the company’s Salt River, Cape Town premises where it became a world-famous landmark. In 1988, the Spitfire {{had to be removed}} due to deterioration from nearby railway shunting yards and vandals taking <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It was shipped to the UK and sold to a restorer.|$|R
50|$|In the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race, Gilbert flew {{across the}} Pyrenees and was {{attacked}} by an angry mother eagle defending her young and nest; {{to ward off the}} large bird, he simply fired pistol <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> rather than kill it.|$|R
25|$|During the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race, French pilot Eugene Gilbert {{encountered}} {{an angry}} mother eagle over the Pyrenees. Gilbert, flying an open-cockpit Bleriot XI, {{was able to}} ward off the large bird by firing pistol <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> but did not kill it.|$|R
25|$|They indulged me rather. They {{liked my}} {{work as a}} writer and they wanted to keep me on. If I wanted to direct, why, they'd give me a <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and if it didn't come off all that well, they wouldn't be too {{disappointed}} as {{it was to be a}} very small picture.|$|E
25|$|Another car {{then came}} towards the toll booth and Bryant <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> The driver, Graham Sutherland, {{was hit with}} glass. A second bullet hit the driver's door. Sutherland quickly {{reversed}} back up the road and left. Bryant then got into the BMW, leaving behind his Volvo 244, including his Daewoo shotgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another car}} drove past and Bryant <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand. The driver, Simon Williams, {{was struck by}} fragments. The driver of another {{approaching}} vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then {{got back into the}} BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.|$|E
50|$|In 1911 French pilot Eugene Gilbert {{encountered}} {{an angry}} mother eagle over the Pyrenees Mountains {{en route from}} Paris to Madrid during the great aviation race held that year between those two cities.

50|$|Obi-Wan's Jedi {{interceptor}} is hit by enemy laser fire, and {{his right}} wing is destroyed. However, he uses the Force to dissassemble several droid fighters to their individual pieces and attaches them to his craft. He pilots his y-wing towards the Trade Federation control ship and fires a few well-placed <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> causing a giant explosion. Anakin's ship escapes from an access tunnel just in time as the control ship spectacularly explodes, and Obi-Wan and Anakin head down to Kashyyyk.|$|R
25|$|A folktale from Tlaxcala {{tells how}} some hunters saw an {{enormous}} black dog {{one night and}} decided to capture and keep it. It fled at their approach, so one hunter <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> wounding it in one leg. Following the blood trail {{they came to a}} richly furnished peasant hut, whose owner was tending a wound in his leg. They gave up the chase and headed for the nearest village, where the locals told them that the peasant had been a nahual who could transform into a dog to steal riches.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{initially}} {{rejected that}} the Kittyhawks {{were involved in}} the crash, stating that the plane seemed to have crashed into something. However, Indonesian witnesses on the ground reported that the Kittyhawks had come from the viewer's right of the Dakota and <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> An inspection of Wirjokusumo's body, when it was recovered, confirmed that he had been shot. They later denied knowledge of the flight and said that it had not had Red Cross markings. After India protested the incident, the Dutch government sent a Dakota C-47A along with financial restitution.|$|E
25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E
60|$|The {{cries of}} the two guards' were taken up {{on all sides of}} the camp, and {{especially}} {{in the vicinity of the}} rock from under which the reptile had appeared. All the soldiers recognized the snake as a dangerous enemy; and as the reptile moved about, first one and then another ran to get out of its way, several in the meantime taking hasty <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> but failing to do any serious damage. For several minutes the prisoner was entirely forgotten.|$|R
5000|$|A {{motorcade}} of Chechnya's OMON special police buses was <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> as <b>it</b> {{was leaving}} Ingushetia, heading home with an Ingush prisoner. The Chechen OMON Chief of Staff, Buvadi Dukhiyev, was mortally {{wounded in the}} shootout.|$|R

500|$|Randazza {{filed an}} appeal on June 5, 2007, and {{the matter was}} {{scheduled}} for a hearing before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Acworth told Orlando Weekly he considered ceasing appeals when the mark had initially been rejected by the USPTO. He {{said he was not}} intending to be the adult industry's representative for First Amendment rights. Acworth stated to Orlando Weekly, [...] "Marc talked me into it. I'm not normally this sort of person. Marc thought he had a pretty good <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> I'm really going on his advice.... I have no real agenda with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Clisby {{destroyed}} two Dornier Do 17 bombers on 10May, {{after which}} his aircraft {{was struck by}} friendly fire from a French anti-aircraft battery. He became an ace the following day, when he shot down three German fighters before the rudder of his Hurricane was damaged by enemy gunfire. Breaking off combat, he found a Heinkel He111 bomber drifting {{in front of him}} and instinctively took a <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> forcing it to land in a paddock. Clisby himself landed nearby and, when they tried to escape, chased the German crewmen across the field, firing his revolver. Capturing one in a rugby tackle, he forced the others to surrender at gunpoint. He then proceeded to march them over to French authorities before rejoining his squadron, whose diarist recorded: [...] "He wanted their autographs!" [...] According to Time magazine, reporting on the exploit some weeks later, [...] "Clisby's commanding officer remarked it was a bit uncommon for pilots to bring back prisoners".|$|E
500|$|The Earl was {{frequently}} {{depicted in the}} British tabloids for his drug use, wild parties and homosexuality. In May 1983, he was arrested on suspicion of trafficking $4 million of heroin and moved from New York back to Ickworth House. While there, {{on at least one}} occasion, the Earl piloted his helicopter without radar while snorting cocaine off the map he was using for navigation. On another, while accompanying his secretary Angela Barry, he crash-landed the helicopter in a field, and walked to the nearest farmhouse, demanding to use the phone while leaving mud everywhere. He became known for his dark sense of humour; on one occasion he allowed a young woman to ride a rubber dinghy {{into the middle of the}} lake at Ickworth and then <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with an air rifle, sinking it. On another, he was accused of opening a fridge door to retrieve a bottle of champagne by blasting it with a shotgun. He once drove along the hard shoulder of the M11 motorway at [...] to avoid traffic congestion.|$|E

5000|$|The Republicans {{burned the}} {{buildings}} they evacuated. In Clifden, the workhouse was burned in July. In addition, on 25 July, the Republicans {{set fire to}} the Marconi Station and fired <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> because they considered the station [...] "a British concern", and because the RIC had used the station to marshall reinforcements in March 1921. Transatlantic wireless service was transferred from Clifden to the more modern Marconi wireless station near Waunfawr, Wales. By one reckoning, the station's closure caused an estimated 1,000 people to lose their livelihood.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Solaris-Film, in co-production with Star-Film, Cinerom R.A. and the Bucharest`s Cinematographic Studio S.A., the film being <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> Buftea. <b>It</b> have been used frames from the films Sezonul Pescarusilor (1985) and Detașamentul Concordia (1980). The film contains nudity scenes.|$|R
500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I ought to give myself one more <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|Not all Capitol hauntings {{are related}} to people who worked there. The [...] "Demon Cat" [...] is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make {{appearances}} just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, and a night watchman <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out the door into the hallway before disappearing.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 May, the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{moved from}} Abasan el Kebir. As {{they arrived at}} Tel el Fara, a German Air Force Taube {{aircraft}} flew over very low to drop bombs, while the anti-aircraft guns <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> These single propeller, fighter-bombers flown by German pilots were effective and {{did a lot of}} damage in the Palestine region. [...] "Taube is the German word for pigeon, but to us they are more like hawks then pigeons!" ...|$|E

50|$|Following his {{decision}} to withdraw, Knight turned around and climbed onto the western platform of the Clifton Hill railway station. He ran north along the platform and then continued moving north beside the railway line. He reached {{a fork in the}} tracks at around 9.46pm and decided to follow the left fork. He spotted a police car in the northern end of Hoddle Street and fired three <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> The police car contained Sergeant Graham Larchin and Senior Constable Betty Roberts, who were not injured by the gunfire but who abandoned the car after Knight ceased firing.|$|R
2500|$|At {{around midnight}} on 25 October 1962, a {{guard at the}} Duluth Sector Direction Center saw a figure {{climbing}} the security fence. He <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and activated the [...] "sabotage alarm." [...] This automatically set off sabotage alarms at all bases in the area. At Volk Field, the alarm was incorrectly wired, and the Klaxon sounded, which ordered nuclear armed F-106A interceptors to take off. The interceptor crews had not been notified that the Strategic Air Command had increased its patrols of nuclear-armed bombers, {{some of which were}} airborne near Volk, threatening the possibility of nuclear friendly fire.|$|E
2500|$|December 17, 1942: Six Italians {{on three}} torpedoes left the Olterra {{to attack the}} three British {{warships}} , , and [...] in Gibraltar. A British patrol boat killed one torpedo's crew (Lt. Visintini and Petty Officer Magro) with a depth charge. Their bodies were recovered, and their swimfins were taken and used by two of Gibraltar's British guard divers (who dived with Davis Escape Sets and (up to here) breaststroke swimming and no fins) (Sydney Knowles and Commander Lionel Crabb). Another British patrol boat spotted another torpedo, and chased and <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and captured its two crewmen. The remaining torpedo returned to the Olterra without its rear rider.|$|E
2500|$|For lead actor Jeremy Irvine, {{starring}} {{in his first}} film role, the filming process was intense at times, in particular the scene where the British cavalry, 130 horses in total and many hundreds of extras, charged the German machine gun lines. He explained: [...] "It’s the weapons of the old world—our men on horses—meeting the absolute destruction of these tools of mass slaughter. There was this line of machine guns and there’s this wall of lead coming out of these guns. There were real explosions at my feet, bodies flying through the air, stunt men getting <b>shot</b> <b>at.</b> <b>It</b> was terrifying. The smoke and the smell and {{the taste of the}} guns firing. It’s not difficult to act scared in that situation. There’s no doubt this was deliberate: not only to have the film look great, but to have that effect on the actors. It was an eye-opening scene." ...|$|E
