40|$|Following {{independence}} from the former Soviet Union, Tajikistan inherited an extensive social protection system that included a range of cash and noncash benefits. While the economy is well into its transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy, its social welfare policies still adhere to the methods and approaches of the Soviet period. This is true for social protection, which has both social insurance and social assistance components, and for which benefits are effectively noncontributory in nature in that no contributions are collected from employees. In this paper, we examine {{the performance of the}} country's social protection system - essentially public transfers for the elderly and disabled - in terms of reducing poverty, with the aim of identifying its key problems. Since the government provides such public transfers mainly as pensions (i. e., old-age pension, disabled pension, and <b>survivors</b> <b>pension),</b> it merits an in-depth analysis of whether or not these transfer programs reach the intended beneficiaries; that is, how well do they target the intended beneficiaries? Using data from the Living Standards Measurement Survey conducted in 2007, the study finds that only 43 % of poor households are receiving transfers from the government, while 33 % of nonpoor households receive transfers. This study argues for applying a targeted approach to public transfer programs, including noncontributory pension schemes aimed at the most vulnerable populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>survivor's</b> <b>pension</b> is to create rights for young and old age dependants. In the case of {{developed}} countries, the system deals essentially with the spouse survival. In the case of MENA countries, the <b>survivor’s</b> <b>pensions</b> scheme provides a wider perspective of coverage and is extended to protect children, brothers, sisters, dependant parents and grand-parents according to specific criteria. Two objectives of <b>survivor's</b> <b>pensions</b> can be distinguished. On the one hand, the <b>survivor's</b> <b>pensions</b> aim at providing a minimum of resources when the widow(er) could not acquire any other sources of income. In this case, the widow <b>survivor's</b> <b>pension</b> is provided to the most modest households {{in order to help}} them from plunging in extreme poverty. This context prevails widely in MENA countries, where poverty is high and the level of dependancy is also prominent. On the other hand, a second perspective considers the <b>survivor's</b> <b>pensions</b> as a pension right to the widow (er) with the aim of maintaining her/his former standard of living. Developed countries are particularly concerned by this environment. This paper propose an analysis of the impact of pension reforms, particurlarly, of the survirvorship pensions reforms on the individual situations of retirees. The analysis focuses on Moroccan pension system and will consider a representative sample of members of the main schemes in Morocco. Survivorship Pensions; Reforms; MENA countries; Morocco;...|$|R

This report discusses the Improved Disability Pension, which makes payments to certain low-income veterans, and the Improved Death Pension, which makes payments to certain low-income surviving spouses and dependent children of deceased veterans. To qualify for either program, individuals must have become eligible for payments on or after January 1, 1979. Both pension programs {{were created by}} P. L. 95 - 588, the Veterans and <b>Survivors</b> <b>Pension</b> Improvement Act of 1978. In addition, this report discusses a special pension program for Medal of Honor recipients. This report does not discuss several other pension programs that are administered by the VA, such as the Old Law Disability Pension and the Section 306 Disability Pension, which make payments to low-income veterans, and the Old Law Death Pension and the Section 306 Death Pension, which make payments to low-income surviving spouses and dependent children of veterans; these programs apply only to veterans and their survivors who became entitled to such benefits before 1979.

Moroccan civil law (Mudawana) allows two types of dissolution of marriage: divorce and repudiation. Divorce requires spouses {{to go to the}} Tribunal to formally dissolve the marriage, which can be very costly and time-consuming (Ouali 1992). Repudiation enables one spouse to unilaterally break the contract, which limits costs and duration. This is why men—and in a small number of cases, women—use repudiation more often than divorce. However, repudiation is not always recognized as valid in Belgian civil law for Moroccan resident in Belgium.

30|$|The {{content of}} pension reform since 1989 {{emphasizes}} cost-cutting {{in order to}} adjust the system to demographic trends. Reforms rely on the familiar tools of pension retrenchment: benefit cuts, raising the retirement age, and expanding non-state provision. In addition, the generosity of <b>survivors</b> <b>pensions</b> has been reduced and pension entitlement for child-rearing has been improved. The 1989 pension reform passed under the CDU/CSU-FDP government led by Helmut Kohl introduced modest benefit cuts, limits on early retirement, and a higher retirement age for women, the unemployed and disabled. At the same time, pension rights for child-rearing were increased from 1 to 3 years, {{and the size of}} the federal subsidy was increased (Schulze and Jochem 2007; Schludi 2005).|$|R

The rejection of Ms. Hodge's application was appealed to a Canada Pension Plan Review Tribunal in 1997. The tribunal held that the law was invalid because Ms. Hodge was denied a benefit for not living with Mr. Bickell for the full year up to his death. The Pension Appeals Board overturned this finding in 2000, noting that in requiring a year's residence, the Parliament of Canada was merely trying to avoid more than one common law spouse claiming eligibility for a <b>survivor's</b> <b>pension.</b> In turn, the Federal Court of Appeal found in favour of Hodge in 2002. The Federal Court found the rejection to be discrimination based on marital status. If Ms. Hodge had been married to Mr. Bickell before the break-up, she would have received a pension. Ms. Hodge compared herself to separated married people, and not divorcees, and the Federal Court accepted this comparison.|$|R

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} poverty in Croatia are still insufficiently well researched. Not only is there no {{knowledge}} about how long Croatian citizens remain poor, {{but there are also}} some disagreements about the actual number of the poor and the choice of the national poverty line. Nor has there been any precise evaluation {{of the effects of the}} individual anti-poverty policy measures. The objective of this paper was to analyse the basic indicators of the scope and distribution of poverty, the risk groups and the structure of the population of the poor and to investigate the role of social transfers in the reduction of poverty. The paper consists of four parts and an introduction. In Part 1 there is an analysis of the trends in the numbers of the poor in Croatia at the beginning of the millennium and the profile of poverty. The second part deals with the policy for the reduction or elimination of poverty, while in Part 3 the author deals with the problem of selecting the official poverty line and the role of the minimum income in Croatia. Part 4 contains the conclusions. Using the official EU poverty line, a comparative analysis shows that the rates of relative poverty in Croatia do not deviate greatly from the EU mean, although Croatia does have a somewhat higher rate of poverty than most of the countries in the Union. Most at risk of falling below the poverty line are the elderly, the retired and the unemployed, single-person households, single-parent families and families with three or more children. The total system of social transfers is not less effective than the transfer systems of most of the countries of the EU. If we exclude old age and <b>survivor</b> <b>pensions</b> from the social transfers, in fact, Croatia has the most effective social transfers of any of the countries observed. However, on the other hand, the poverty rate reduction due to old age and <b>survivor</b> <b>pensions</b> is one of the lowest in the countries compared. poverty, official poverty line, poverty rate reduction, anti-poverty policy, social transfers, pensions...|$|R
