500|$|Although {{they broke}} up in 1914, Brooks painted Rubinstein more often than any other subject; for Brooks, Rubinstein's [...] "fragile and {{androgynous}} beauty" [...] represented an aesthetic ideal. The earliest of these paintings {{are a series of}} allegorical nudes. In The Crossing (also exhibited as The Dead Woman), Rubinstein appears to be in a coma, <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a white bed or bier against a black void variously interpreted as death or floating in spent sexual satisfaction on Brooks' symbolic wing; in Spring, she is depicted as a pagan Madonna strewing flowers on the ground in a grassy meadow. When Rubinstein starred in D'Annunzio's play The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, Brooks painted her as a blonde Saint Sebastiantied to a post, being shot with an arrow by a masked dwarf standing on a table. The dwarf is a satiric representation of D'Annunzio.|$|E

500|$|About an {{hour after}} the ambush, local {{citizens}} found 15 dead and 20 wounded soldiers <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> and near the road. Four more soldiers were later found dead of wounds or of exposure nearby. The men of Simpsonville took 20 wounded men back to town, 8 of the men so severely wounded they were not expected to live. A total of six soldiers died en route or in Louisville. Later it was determined that 19 Union soldiers had been murdered trying to surrender or [...] after being disarmed. The remainder of the Union wounded were left to die in the freezing cold. Three soldiers remained missing in the final accounting. Flint, who was in town during the ambush, fled to Louisville. Authorities telegraphed Camp Nelson, and Carpenter immediately ordered ambulances, and a heavy escort was mounted. They arrived on scene on October 28 and took the surviving wounded to a hospital in Louisville. Locals reported what had happened and the boasts of the Confederate guerrillas, led by Captain Dick Taylor, who had murdered or shot many of the Union soldiers after they had been captured. The mass grave was located, and an effort was made to find the missing men. Carpenter wrote a report and documented the names of the known guerrillas and encouraged a hunt and their prosecution.|$|E

2500|$|His second cameo {{occurred}} in the early panels of the story Vacances sans histoires (fr: [...] "Quiet Holidays") (later included in the album Le gorille a bonne mine) which was published between November 1957 and January 1958. Gaston appears {{at the start of}} the story when, cycling and lighting a cigarette at the same time, he runs past a red light and very nearly gets hit by Spirou and Fantasio's Turbot I sportscar. Towards the end, he is again cycling, this time down the wrong way of a one-way street, when he actually gets hit by the new Turbot II. More surprised than anything else, <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the front of the car, he simply tells Spirou and Fantasio that they are requested back at the Spirou offices.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than once}} he had a severe {{reaction}} to a drug. In Kessler, he tried a drug named Sygen which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I have to go now", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, [...] "and then I left my body.

The B-29 aircraft was written off and abandoned, and dropped from Air Force inventory records.|$|E
2500|$|The circle {{builders}} left no records, {{but their}} works were remarked upon {{and to some}} extent mythologised in historic times by the region's later inhabitants. The 16th century Aberdonian historian Hector Boece wrote that in the times of King Mainus ... huge stones were assembled in a ring and the biggest of them was <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the south side to serve for an altar ... In proof of the fact to this day there stand these mighty stones gathered together into circles 'the old temples of the gods' they are commonly called – and whoso sees them will assuredly marvel by what mechanical craft or by what bodily strength stones of such bulk have been collected to one spot. The English antiquarian John Aubrey recorded in the 17th century that people believed of the Easter Aquhorthies recumbent stone circle that [...] "Pagan priests of old dwelt in that place" [...] and that the Priests caused earth to be brought from other adjacent places upon peoples backs to Auchinchorthie, for making the Soile thereof deeper, which is given for the reason why this parcell of land (though surrounded by heath and moss on all sides) is better and more fertile than other places thereabout.|$|E

2500|$|Ring 3: Against God, Art, and Nature: The {{third round}} of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand {{scorched}} by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky, an image derived from the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24.) The Blasphemers (the Violent against God) are stretched supine upon the burning sand, the Sodomites (the Violent against Nature) run in circles, while the Usurers (the Violent against Art, which is the Grandchild of God, as explained in Canto XI) crouch huddled and weeping. Ciardi writes, [...] "Blasphemy, sodomy, and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions: thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners; and thus the rain, which in nature should be fertile and cool, descends as fire". Dante finds Capaneus <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the sands; for blasphemy against Jove, he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the Siege of Thebes; he is still scorning Jove in the afterlife. The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the First Round, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second round) and crosses the Burning Plain. Virgil explains {{the origin of the}} rivers of Hell, which includes references to the Old Man of Crete.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine's undated will, {{discovered}} in early 1792 by her secretary Alexander Vasilievich Khrapovitsky among her papers, gave specific instructions should she die: [...] "Lay out my corpse dressed in white, {{with a golden}} crown on my head, and on it inscribe my Christian name. Mourning dress is to be worn for six months, and no longer: the shorter the better." [...] In the end, the empress was laid to rest with a gold crown {{on her head and}} clothed in a silver brocade dress. On 25 November, the coffin, richly decorated in gold fabric, was placed atop an elevated platform at the Grand Gallery's chamber of mourning, designed and decorated by Antonio Rinaldi. According to Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun: [...] "The empress's body lay in state for six weeks in a large and magnificently decorated room in the castle, which was kept lit day and night. Catherine was <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a ceremonial bed surrounded by the coats of arms of all the towns in Russia. Her face was left uncovered, and her fair hand rested on the bed. All the ladies, some of whom took turn to watch by the body, would go and kiss this hand, or at least appear to." [...] A description of the Empress's funeral is written in Madame Vigée Le Brun's memoirs. Catherine was buried at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
2500|$|While {{considered}} simple by today's standards, the [...] "flying" [...] {{effects on}} Adventures of Superman were advanced for the period, although during season one {{it was apparent}} that, for distance flight shots, Superman was lying on a flat surface, his torso and thighs noticeably flattened between elbows and knees. Beginning with season two, Superman's [...] "flying" [...] involved three phases: take-off, flight, and landing. Cables and wires were used for Superman’s take-offs early in filming. In early episodes, stuntmen sometimes replaced Reeves for Superman’s wire-assisted take-offs. When Reeves came close to suffering a concussion in the episode [...] "Ghost Wolf" [...] (the supporting wires snapped and he fell to the studio floor), cables and wires were discarded and a springboard was brought in, designed by Thol [...] "Si" [...] Simonson, who remained with the series until its end. Reeves would run into frame and hit the out-of-frame springboard, which would boost him out of frame (sometimes over the camera) and onto padding. The springboard had enough force, along with subtle camera manipulation, {{to make it look}} as though he was actually taking off. The flying scenes were accomplished through a relatively few number of repeated shots. The typical technique had footage of Reeves <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a spatula-like device formed to his torso and leg, operated on a counterweight like a boom microphone, allowing him to bank as if in flight. In a couple of later episodes, such as [...] "The Atomic Secret", Reeves simulated flying, opting to lie on the device without the molded form to support his legs, which are seen to hang from the waist in those episodes in marked contrast to the stock footage of Superman in flight.|$|E
