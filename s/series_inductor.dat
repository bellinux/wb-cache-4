5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a <b>series</b> <b>inductor,</b> or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often Î»/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

40|$|The input {{electrical}} impedance behaves as a capacitive when a piezoelectric transducer is excited near its resonance frequency. In {{order to increase}} the energy transmission efficiency, a <b>series</b> or parallel <b>inductor</b> {{should be used to}} compensate the capacitive impedance of the piezoelectric transducer. In this paper, the effect of the <b>series</b> matching <b>inductor</b> on the electromechanical characteristics of the piezoelectric transducer is analyzed. The dependency of the resonance/anti-resonance frequency, the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient, the electrical quality factor and the electro-acoustical efficiency on the matching inductor is obtained. It is shown that apart from compensating the capacitive impedance of the piezoelectric transducer, the <b>series</b> matching <b>inductor</b> can also change the electromechanical characteristics of the piezoelectric transducer. When <b>series</b> matching <b>inductor</b> is increased, the resonance frequency is decreased and the anti-resonance unchanged; the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient is increased. For the electrical quality factor and the electroacoustic efficiency, the dependency on the matching inductor is different when the transducer is operated at the resonance and the anti-resonance frequency. The electromechanical characteristics of the piezoelectric transducer with <b>series</b> matching <b>inductor</b> are measured.

40|$|Abstract â This paper {{describes}} algorithms for the distributed computation {{of electromagnetic}} transients {{in a power}} system. Conventional simulators based on parallel computing utilize traveling-time delays due to Bergeronâs representation of transmission lines in order to divide the network of interest into subnetworks, and each subnetwork is assigned to a single CPU to solve the decoupled sets of the circuit equations in parallel. However, if a large subnetwork which cannot be divided further by a transmission line is found, this limits the overall performance of the simulator. In {{the case of a}} realtime simulator, this forces a large time step. To solve this bottleneck, two algorithms are described in this paper. One divides the network at <b>series</b> <b>inductors</b> and the other at shunt capacitors (series and shunt with respect to the ground). Since <b>series</b> <b>inductors</b> and shunt capacitors are found in many locations in a power system, the algorithms increase the possibility for dividing a network into subnetworks achieving optimal computational load assignment to the CPUs in a parallel computer...|$|R
50|$|For {{crystals}} operated at series resonance or {{pulled away}} from the main mode by the inclusion of a <b>series</b> <b>inductor</b> or capacitor, significant (and temperature-dependent) spurious responses may be experienced. Though most spurious modes are typically some tens of kilohertz above the wanted series resonance their temperature coefficient is different from the main mode and the spurious response may move through the main mode at certain temperatures. Even if the series resistances at the spurious resonances appear higher than the one at wanted frequency a rapid change in the main mode series resistance can occur at specific temperatures when the two frequencies are coincidental.A consequence of these activity dips is that the oscillator may lock at a spurious frequency at specific temperatures. This is generally minimized by ensuring that the maintaining circuit has insufficient gain to activate unwanted modes.|$|E

30|$|FigureÂ  6 a {{shows that}} G_ 0 (s), the {{transfer}} function of the resulting voltage at the faulted cable, has the characteristic of a band-rejection filter. The gain of the high frequency region for all <b>series</b> <b>inductor</b> values is approximately 2, which means the high-frequency components of the incident wave are doubled, i.e. totally reflected at the faulted cable terminal. The resonant frequency of this equivalent band-rejection filter is largely determined by the series resonance of the equivalent converter capacitance C_eq and by {{the sum of the}} equivalent converter inductance and the <b>series</b> <b>inductor</b> L_eq+L_p 1. A large <b>series</b> <b>inductor</b> shifts the resonant frequency to lower frequencies. Besides, it also reduces the bandwidth of the rejection range, which results in reflecting more low frequency components. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the upper cut-off frequency shifts from approximately 10 ^ 4 Hz to 10 ^ 2 Hz when the <b>series</b> <b>inductor</b> increases from 0 mH to 300 mH. FigureÂ  7 a shows the step responses of G_ 0 (s), which have a initial magnitude of 2 corresponding to total reflection of the high frequency components.
