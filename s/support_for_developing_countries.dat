40|$|Growing {{concern over}} the spread of {{resistance}} to antibiotics and other antimicrobials has prompted a plethora of recommendations for its control. Strategic programs for resistance containment have been initiated in various countries, particularly in Western Europe and North America. The World Health Organization and the European Union {{have responded to the}} need for international action by publishing guidance and encouraging collaboration. These recommendations rightly focus on controlling resistance in the community. They agree on the importance of surveillance of resistance patterns and antibiotic usage and the need to encourage judicious antibiotic usage (especially through education of prescribers and the public). Yet there remains a pressing need for the implementation of effective actions to address these issues. Important considerations given less attention include infection prevention (e. g. through immunization), the use of rapid diagnostic tests to reduce antibiotic usage, audit of implemented actions, and the provision of feedback. Furthermore, research is necessary to fill the substantial gaps in our knowledge. Notably, the reversibility or containment of resistance with the optimization of antibiotic usage has yet to be definitely established. For now, antimicrobial management programs should focus on ensuring the most appropriate use of antimicrobials rather than simply on limiting choices. Finally, developed countries must recognize that a truly global approach to resistance containment will require greater <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|E

Employment {{is one of the main}} areas affected during an economic crisis and consequently the unemployment rate and employment insecurity rise sharply. The last 20 years in all relevant studies have shown that unemployment and insecurity are leading to loss of prosperity and poverty and have dramatic though not absolutely clarified effects on health. The majority of them indicate the proportional relationship between long-term unemployment with an increased risk of premature mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular diseases and especially mental disorders that prevent a new round of problems such as suicides and violent deaths (fatalities, crimes, deaths from overdose of alcohol and drugs).

Development scholars largely agree on what would constitute a development round: improved market access for developing countries, no negotiations on investment and competition rules in the current round, additional <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{in the field of}} trade-related capacity-building. In contrast to their own rhetoric, however, trade policy makers in industrialized countries do not feel obliged by this consensus. It is therefore they who bear the main responsibility for the failure of Cancún. In Cancún the developing countries successfully presented themselves as an articulate group with the potential to block multilateral trade negotiations. It {{remains to be seen whether}} they will use their new-won scopes of action to take a hand in constructively shaping the world trading system. This will depend largely on newly industrializing countries (NICs) and anchor countries like India, China, or Brazil. The conference's failure does not mean a success for developing countries since they failed to achieve their trade-policy goals. What remains is the hope that the shock of Cancún will lead to a greater willingness to compromise, above all on the part of the industrialized countries, but also on the part of NICs and anchor countries, with a view to giving the WTO a more development-friendly shape. If this fails, the multilateral trading system would be in serious trouble. " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the WTO {{agricultural}} negotiations and their implications for developing countries {{is the subject of}} a report published in March 2003 by Tim Ruffer (Oxford Policy management) and Alan Swinbank (University of Reading). The report, which was based on a DfID financed study, summarises the most important issues arising for developing countries in the WTO agricultural negotiations in the context of the Harbinson drafts. It looks at issues under five headings: market access; domestic support; export subsidies; the peace clause; and <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Its main conclusions are that: market access liberalisation will 'reduce the preferences margins that some developing countries currently enjoy'. Accordingly the authors make a number of recommendations, the most significant of which is for the extension of special safeguard mechanisms for key food commodities for developing countries; concerning domestic support, the blue box should be eliminated, and there should be no extension of the green box as this could harm the interests of developing countries; developing countries should push for the elimination of export subsidies; developing countries should hold back on approval of the extension of the peace clause until firm assurances have been received on their areas of concern. Comment: In calling for the elimination of the 'blue box' and the maintenance of 'green box' provisions within current limits the analysis ignores the reality of the EU position which will require an extension of the green box provisions if it is to accept the elimination of the 'blue box'. It needs to be recognised that the EU is only likely to accept a timetable for the elimination of export subsidies which is consistent with the internal process of CAP reform designed to eliminate the need for export refunds.

40|$|Several {{developments}} {{in international trade}} in services impact strongly on developing countries: First, the world-wide diffusion of information technologies (IT) has created new export opportunities for developing countries in IT services. Second, the recently proclaimed Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction can only be attained if key services are provided more efficiently in developing countries - particularly through the liberalization of service imports. Third, in the ongoing Doha Development Round (DR) of trade negotiations, developing countries are asked to formally commit to liberalizing their service imports {{under the terms of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Developing countries will benefit from liberalizing service imports if liberalization enhances competition on the supply side. This is typically the case for producer services, such as domestic and international transport, financial services, and telecommunications. The lifting of restrictions on the market access by foreigners (including through direct investment) will often improve service quality or lower prices and thereby enhance the international competitiveness of downstream industries. In Doha Development Round negotiations, therefore, developing countries may find it useful to commit to liberalizing imports of producer services. By contrast, the benefits of import liberalization are less clear for some consumer services where supply is subject to network monopolies (e. g., water and energy distribution) or demand is constrained by poverty (health care, education). Here, achieving a socially optimal level of supply may require carefully calibrated government policies, possibly with international donor <b>support.</b> <b>For</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> such sectors should not be priority areas for commitments on service imports under the GATS. Most service exports by developing countries, especially IT services transmitted electronically, face few import barriers in industrialized countries. However, under the GATS, service exports may also be delivered through temporary movement of natural persons, e. g., developing country nationals working in industrialized countries without becoming residents there. If Doha Development Round negotiations were to increase opportunities for such temporary labor migration, the benefits to developing countries could be huge. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{last two}} decades {{witnessed}} a dramatic transformation of how central banks operate. An increasing number of central banks now use inflation targeting as their monetary policy control mechanism.

This paper reviews the existing methods used to test for the effectiveness of inflation targeting and compares the findings of these different methods <b>for</b> both <b>developed</b> and <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> In general, inflation targeting does not affect economic performance in <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> but does exert a positive effect on economic performance in <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> We conclude that the effectiveness of inflation targeting policy garners little, or only transitory, support based on evidence from <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> Much more <b>support</b> exists <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 {{influenza}} {{is affecting}} countries in all five continents, with most cases so far having {{been reported in}} North and South America and Europe, and {{children and young adults}} being the most susceptible age groups. To date, the clinical course of disease is typically mild, with low hospitalization and mortality rates. Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 is susceptible to oseltamivir and, although few clinical data are yet available, current information suggests that treatment with oseltamivir appears to be beneficial. Only isolated cases of resistance to the drug have been reported to date, in keeping with the low frequency observed in clinical studies involving patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses. Current health authority guidelines recommend the use of oseltamivir in infected adults and children who have or are at elevated risk for severe disease, including pregnant women; use during the pandemic in infants < 1 year has also been authorized in Europe {{and a number of other}} countries, including the USA and Canada. Before the onset of the current pandemic, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd expanded annual production capacity for oseltamivir to 400 million treatment courses per year to meet anticipated demand. However, during an influenza pandemic, and despite increased production capabilities, resources are nonetheless likely to be initially in short supply. For this reason, Roche, in line with WHO recommendations, has advocated advance stockpiling of antivirals by governments as a pandemic preparedness measure. Between 2004 and December 2009, 350 million treatment courses were supplied to governments worldwide. <b>Support</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> has been a priority. Roche has established a cluster of initiatives aimed at increasing access to Tamiflu for the world's developing economies, including, making donations to the WHO, establishing the Tamiflu Reserves Program (TRP) and sub-licensing and manufacturing contracts with local companies in Asia and Africa. Furthermore, Roche has published a document outlining how it would allocate limited supplies of Tamiflu during a pandemic, which are in line with WHO recommendations stating that ‘resources should be used to provide the maximum possible health benefit’. Roche is also offering support such as reprocessing of expiring capsule stocks (in development) and shelf-life extension to support governments in the management of their stockpiles. Clinical studies, either sponsored by or supported by Roche, are in progress. These trials are designed to investigate the effectiveness of oseltamivir in patients infected with the pandemic virus in greater depth, and include high-dose studies, assessment of natural and drug-induced resistance, and response to treatment in high-risk populations such as young infants, immunocompromised patients and the severely ill...|$|E
