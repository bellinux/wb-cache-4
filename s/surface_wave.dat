5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} of Nicaragua at 6:16p.m. on September 2. Some damage was also reported in Costa Rica. At least 116 people were killed and several more were injured. The quake was located in an active zone of stress and deformation. It created tsunamis disproportionately large for its <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{experiences}} regular earthquakes, with 200 {{reported in}} 1996 alone. Like dozens that had preceded it, the 1997 Qayen event was of significant magnitude. It occurred on Saturday, May 10, 1997 at 12:57 IRST in the Sistan region, {{one of the}} most seismically active areas of the country. The first major earthquake in that region since 1979, it registered 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw), 7.2 on the <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> magnitude scale (Ms), 7.7 on the energy magnitude scale (Me), and had a maximum perceived intensity of X, or Extreme on the Mercalli intensity scale.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> at {{the interface}} between a metal and a photovoltaic-photorefractive (PP) crystal. These <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> appear in several forms: delocalized <b>surface</b> <b>waves,</b> shock <b>surface</b> <b>waves,</b> and localized <b>surface</b> <b>waves.</b> Only localized <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> have limited energy. We demonstrate that the transverse sizes of localized <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> decrease {{with an increase in}} the propagation constant and the amplitudes of localized <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> increase with the propagation constant. The stability of localized <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> is investigated numerically and it is found that they are stable. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Back-scattered <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> can be {{migrated}} to detect near-surface reflectors with steep dips. A robust surface-wave migration requires the prior {{separation of the}} back-scattered surface-wave events from the data. This separation {{is often difficult to}} implement because the back-scattered <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> are masked by the incident <b>surface</b> <b>waves.</b> We mitigate this problem by using a super-virtual interferometric method to enhance and separate the back-scattered <b>surface</b> <b>waves.</b> The key idea is to calculate the virtual back-scattered <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> by stacking the resulting virtual correlated and convolved traces associated with the incident and back-scattered waves. Stacking the virtual back-scattered <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> improves their signal-to-noise ratio and separates the back-scattered surface-waves from the incident field. Both synthetic and field data results validate the robustness of this method...|$|R
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a tsunami affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span of six months. Runup heights were measured shortly after the earthquake and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. The tsunami was disproportionately large for its <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> magnitude, or Ms, and the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of tsunami earthquakes. Tide gages were set up at Corinto and Puerto Sandino, which showed an impulsive tsunami originating 61 minutes after the earthquake. It ran inland 1,000 meters to Masachapa, the hardest hit major town of all, with 9 fatalities.|$|E

25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} are {{credited with the}} discovery of skywave propagation on the shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> propagation at very low frequencies, which are attenuated along the path.

This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} the {{dispersion}} relation allows for two modes: a barotropic mode where the free surface amplitude is large compared with the amplitude of the interfacial wave, and a baroclinic mode where the opposite is the case – the interfacial wave is higher than and in antiphase with the free <b>surface</b> <b>wave.</b> The dispersion relation for this case is of a more complicated form.|$|E
40|$|For the {{relatively}} high frequencies relevant in a turbofan engine duct the modes of a lined sec-tion may be classified in two categories: genuine acoustic 3 D duct modes resulting from the finiteness of the duct geometry, and 2 D <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> that exist only near the wall surface in a way essentially independent {{of the rest of}} the duct. Per frequency and circumferential order there are at most 4 <b>surface</b> <b>waves.</b> They occur in two kinds: 2 acoustic <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> that exist with and without mean flow, and 2 hydrodynamic <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> that exist only with mean flow. The number and location of the <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> depends on the wall impedance Z and mean flow Mach number. When Z is varied, an acoustic mode may change via small transition zones into a <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> and vice versa. Compared to the acoustic modes, the <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> behave – for example as a function of the wall impedance – rather differently as they have their own dynamics.

25|$|Real amplitudes differ considerably, {{not only}} because of depth {{variations}} and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: if there were no land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> to propagate along the equator halfway around the Earth (by comparison, the Earth's lithosphere has a natural period of about 57 minutes).
