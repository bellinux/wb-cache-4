40|$|We {{investigated}} the perceived position of visual targets in apparent motion. A disc moved horizontally through three positions from 108 to þ 108 {{in the far}} periphery (208 above fixation), generating a compelling impression of apparent motion. In the first experiment, observers compared {{the position of the}} middle of the three discs to a subsequently presented reference. Unexpectedly, observers judged its position to be shifted backward, in the direction opposite that of the motion. We then tested the middle disc in sequences of 3, 5, and 7 discs, each covering the same spatial and temporal extents (similar speeds). The backwards shift was only found for the three-disc sequence. With the extra discs approaching more continuous motion, the perceived shift was {{in the same direction as}} the apparent motion. Finally, using a localization task with constant <b>static</b> <b>references,</b> we measured the position shifts of all the disc locations for two-disc, three-disc and four-disc apparent motion sequences. The backward shift was found for the second location of all sequences. We suggest that the backward shift of the second element along an apparent motion path is due to an attraction effect induced by the initial point of the motion...|$|R

The application of traditional Lagrangian approach to the reference frame selection problem suffers from either bounded worst-case error but high complexity, or low complexity but undetermined worst-case error. In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming based optimization algorithm that admits trade-offs between computation complexity and worst-case error using advanced rounding techniques. We also evaluate {{the performance of the}} algorithm in the context of multi-path streaming over QoS-enabled networks.

40|$|Abstract Retinal motion {{caused by}} {{reflexive}} or voluntary eye movements is rarely misinterpreted as object motion, {{as if the}} visual system discounted the contribution of these eye movements to retinal motion. Yet, involuntary eye movements caused by mechanical eye vibration is often interpreted as object motion unless the vibration has high frequency, in which case only image blur may be noticed. In these latter conditions, however, a light flickering above the fusion limit is vividly perceived to undergo oscillatory motion over its static surround. We determined the conditions of this phenomenon, showing that the perceived frequency of illusory oscillation equals the difference between flicker frequency {{and the frequency of}} vibration of the eyes. This outcome is explained {{as a result of the}} low-pass temporal frequency characteristic of vision, which further predicts that the same effect should occur if the flickering light is vibrated and observed with static eyes. This prediction was corroborated empirically. We also determined the minimal amplitude of oscillation required to perceive motion as a function of postural stability and the presence of <b>static</b> <b>references,</b> finding an amplitude threshold of ~ 1 arcmin with postural stability in dim-light conditions, which increases to ~ 2 arcmin with postural instability in the dark...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) {{is important}} for gating purposes in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). However, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect, which {{is caused by the}} flow of blood in the static magnetic field, makes it difficult to record clean ECG signals for gating. The vectorcardiogram (VCG), which can be derived from the ECG signal, is commonly used for gating purposes and has been well established for magnetic fields strength of up to 3 T. However, for higher field strengths this method is prone to errors [1]. This work tries to explain the rea-sons for the VCG based methods not being suitable for cardiac gating in ultra high field MRI. Methods ECGs were recorded using a standard 12 -lead Holter ECG (Getemed, Germany) inside a 7 T MR scanner (Sie-mens Magnetom), a 3 T MR scanner (Philips Achieva) and outside the MR scanner as references. Measurements were made on five healthy volunteers while MR imaging was switched off. The VCGs were derived from the 12 -lead ECG using the inverse Dower matrix [2]. The VCG method [3] was implemented and applied to the acquired data sets. This method measures the distance in the VCG space between a <b>static</b> <b>reference</b> vector defined by the R-wave (R) peak of an ECG signal recorded out-side the MR scanner (at 0 T) and the VCG vector recorded inside the MR scanner. Those points where a minimal distance and angle between both vectors is reached are classified as R peaks. Results A spatial representation of the VCGs recorded at 0 T, 3 T and 7 T is given in Figs. 1 (a) -(f). When comparing the VCGs recorded at 0 T and 3 T, the mean angle between the <b>static</b> <b>reference</b> and the R peaks at 3 T was 3. 6 ° whereas the mean difference between the norms of these vectors was 0. 4 mV. For the 7 T measurements, the mean angle and the mean difference between the norms of the <b>static</b> <b>reference</b> and the R peak vectors were 68. 7 ° and 1. 7 mV, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 2 (b), the minimum distance algorithm [3] showed several minima for the ECG signal recorded in the 7 T scanner which was not the case for the 3 T measurement...|$|E

One of the drawbacks of ultrasonic signal propagation through water is that measurements require relatively clean water conditions. In water with significant amount of impurities, the level of transmitted signals may not be sufficient for an accurate flow measurement. In terms of signal processing, the effect of impurities is represented by a random loss or fading of received signals.
