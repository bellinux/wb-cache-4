It is often created with a pen or brush, but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by photography, or to works on canvas, paper, computer images, and animations. The key to asemic writing {{is that even though}} it is traditionally [...] "unreadable" [...] it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's eye. Various asemic writing includes pictograms, or ideograms the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an abstract expressionist scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking. Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense. Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often calligraphic in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense, or can be understood through aesthetic intuition. True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. ciphers, wildstyle, etc). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes. Influences on asemic writing are illegible, invented, or primal scripts (cave paintings, doodles, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global postliterate style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are alien languages in science fiction, artistic languages, sigils (magick), undeciphered scripts, and graffiti. Uses for asemic writing include mental and creative idea stimulation, non-verbal communication, hoaxes, and general authorial <b>self</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|E

These meaningless,superficial expressions therefore termed as "reflections". The expressions that consist of deeper meanings, modify the beholder. The end result is being essentially a change in man. These meanings therefore "respond" to the beholder. These two kinds of perception sin architecture are applied in certain situations, but misapplications could be disastrous in the situations, that the most important aspect - the psychological needs of the beholder are more important...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} TCR V beta expression {{in a collection}} of wild mice.

The amino acid changes in this gene product suggest contact sites between V beta and the superantigen. Although all V betas are expressed within each wild mouse population, individual mice have a limited and variable V beta repertoire. The independent origin of multiple V beta deletions and the presence of polymorphic self superantigens suggest that this variation may be maintained by balancing selection...|$|R
