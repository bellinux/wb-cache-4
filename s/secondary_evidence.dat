25|$|The Indus civilisation's economy {{appears to}} have {{depended}} significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC {{may have been the}} first civilisation to use wheeled transport. These advances may have included bullock carts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is <b>secondary</b> <b>evidence</b> of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what they regard as a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal in western India (Gujarat state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.|$|E

In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States (1920) and Nardone v. United States (1939), the Court ruled that leads or other evidence resulting from illegally obtained evidence are also inadmissible in trials. Justice Felix Frankfurter described this <b>secondary</b> <b>evidence</b> in the Nardone decision as the [...] "fruit of the poisonous tree". The Supreme Court rejected incorporating the exclusionary rule {{by way of the}} Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf v. Colorado (1949), but Wolf was explicitly overruled in Mapp v.

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} that the Q-Celtic languages alone, including Goidelic, originated in western Iberia (a theory that was first put forward by Edward Lhuyd in 1707) or shared a common linguistic ancestor with Lusitanian. <b>Secondary</b> <b>evidence</b> for this hypothesis has been found in research by biological scientists, who have identified (firstly) deep-rooted similarities in human DNA found precisely in both the former Lusitania and Ireland, and; (secondly) the so-called [...] "Lusitanian distribution" [...] of animals and plants unique to western Iberia and Ireland. [...] Both of these phenomena are now generally believed to have resulted from human emigration from Iberia to Ireland, during the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic eras.|$|E

40|$|This article maps {{the vital}} debate on Prosperity Gospel in Africa and its {{relevance}} for socioeconomic change. Prosperity Gospel centres mainly on speech acts surrounding faith, wealth and victory, combined with ritual enactments around <b>secondary</b> <b>evidences</b> of divine blessings. Claiming this-worldly success and material well-being {{as signs of}} grace it has captured public spheres and has created African religio-scapes of prosperity. The survey on the socioeconomics of African prosperity oriented Pentecostalism firstly traces the historic genealogy of Prosperity Gospel as transposable message. It appears as a generic formula in paradigmatic reinventions of Pentecostalism in post second/cold war America and in its globalization in postcolonial Africa. The double resignification of Pentecostal theology - a rereading of ‘mammon` alongside a new ethic {{of being in the}} world – relates to the question of socioeconomic agency...|$|R
2500|$|The {{problems}} associated with finding archaeological evidence for migration {{during a period of}} lowered sea level are well known. [...] Sites related to the first migration are usually submerged, so the location of such sites is obscured. [...] Certain types of evidence dependent on organic material, such as radiocarbon dating, may be destroyed by submergence. [...] Wave action can destroy site structures and scatter artifacts along a prograding shoreline. [...] Additionally, Pacific coastal conditions tend to be unstable due to steep unstable terrain, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes. [...] Strategies for finding earliest migration sites include identifying potential sites on submerged paleoshorelines, seeking sites in areas uplifted either by tectonics or isostatic rebound, and looking for riverine sites in areas that may have attracted coastal migrants. Otherwise, coastal archaeology is dependent on <b>secondary</b> <b>evidence</b> related to lifestyles and technologies of maritime peoples from sites similar to those that would be associated with the original migration.|$|E

40|$|Pemphigus bursarius is a host-alternating aphid {{in which}} annual rounds of sexual {{reproduction}} on its primary host, Populus nigra, are interspersed with parthenogenesis {{on a range}} of <b>secondary</b> hosts. <b>Evidence</b> was sought for the existence of genetically distinct populations, associated with different secondary hosts, in P. bursarius.

Microsatellites were also used, in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA sequence variation, to investigate the relationships between aphids on Populus, following sexual reproduction, and those on the <b>secondary</b> hosts. <b>Evidence</b> was found for a distinct, cyclically parthenogenetic population that exploited Lactuca sativa as its secondary host. In contrast, populations associated with Matricaria inodora appeared to be largely composed of obligate parthenogens or may even have been another species of Pemphigus. Populations on Lapsana communis appeared to be a mixture of cyclical and obligate parthenogens and were more genetically heterogeneous than those on other secondary hosts, possibly due to founder effects. Experiments to measure the performance of P. bursarius clones on different secondary hosts were inconclusive, failing to demonstrate either {{the presence or absence of}} adaptations to secondary hosts...|$|R

40|$|First {{systematic}} spin probe ESR {{study of}} water freezing {{has been conducted}} using TEMPOL and TEMPO as the probes. The spin probe signature of the water freezing has been {{described in terms of}} the collapse of narrow triplet spectrum into a single broad line. This spin probe signature of freezing has been observed at an anomalously low temperature when a milimoler solution of TEMPOL is slowly cooled from room temperature. A systematic observation has revealed a spin probe concentration dependence of these freezing and respective melting points. These results can be explained in terms of localization of spin probe and liquid water, most probably in the interstices of ice grains, in an ice matrix. The lowering of spin probe freezing point, along with the <b>secondary</b> <b>evidences,</b> like spin probe concentration dependence of peak-to-peak width in frozen limit signal, indicates a possible size dependence of these localizations/entrapments with spin probe concentration. A weak concentration dependence of spin probe assisted freezing and melting points, which has been observed for TEMPO in comparison to TEMPOL, indicates different natures of interactions with water of these two probes. This view is also supported by the relaxation behavior of the two probes. Comment: 20 pages, 8 figures, 22 reference...|$|R
