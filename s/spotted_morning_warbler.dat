40|$|The {{validity}} of screening based on <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine samples to detect subjects with microalbuminuria {{in the general}} population. BackgroundNo study has yet investigated the {{validity of}} prescreening by albumin measurements in a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample to identify {{in the general population}} subjects with microalbuminuria. We therefore tested the diagnostic performance of urinary albumin concentration (UAC) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), measured in a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample, in predicting a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) ≥ 30 mg in subsequent 24 -hour urines (microalbuminuria). MethodsSubjects (2527) participating in the PREVEND study, a representative sample from the general population, collected a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample and, on average, 77 days later, two 24 -hour urine collections. ResultsThe ROC curve of UAC in predicting microalbuminuria has an area-under-the-curve of 0. 92 with a discriminator value of 11. 2 mg/L. Using this cut-off value for UAC, sensitivity in predicting microalbuminuria is 85. 0 %, and specificity 85. 0 %. For ACR these values are, respectively: area-under-the-curve 0. 93, discriminator value 9. 9 mg/g, sensitivity 87. 6 %, and specificity 87. 5 %. Sensitivity for UAC in predicting microalbuminuria does not differ significantly from the sensitivity for ACR, whereas the difference between the specificities of UAC and ACR reaches statistical significance, but is numerically very small. In various subgroups characterized by differences in urinary creatinine excretion, the area-under-the-ROC curve, sensitivity, as well as specificity, do not increase relevantly compared to the results in the overall study population. This holds true for ACR as well as UAC. ConclusionThe diagnostic performance of measuring UAC in a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample in predicting microalbuminuria in subsequent 24 -hour urine collections is satisfactory, and, moreover, comparable to that of measuring ACR. In order to keep the burden and costs involved in population screening for microalbuminuria as low as possible, we therefore propose prescreening by measuring UAC in a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample.

40|$|Albuminuria has {{recently}} drawn much attention {{as a valuable}} risk marker for cardiovascular and renal disease progression. Albuminuria can be measured and expressed in several ways: 1) in a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample as urinary albumin concentration (mg/liter) or albumin:creatinine ratio (mg/mmol) and 2) in a 24 -hour urine collection as urinary albumin excretion (mg/ 24 hours). It {{has not yet been}} clarified which measure for albuminuria is preferable in clinical practice. One of the points on which a choice should be made is which measure shows the least within-person coefficient of variation. From the perspective of their work in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease Intervention Trial, 1997 - 2001, the authors discuss several methodological issues that are important when interpreting studies on this topic. It is argued that fresh urine should be used, since freezing at - 20 degrees C results in considerable extra variability in the albumin concentration. Furthermore, it is important to use specifically collected urine samples and not portions of a 24 -hour urine sample as a surrogate for a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample. Albuminuria follows a circadian rhythm. Consequently, values for the within-person coefficient of variation will therefore be different when they are measured in a portion of a 24 -hour urine collection in comparison with a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample...|$|R

Iodine deficiency is especially serious for women during pregnancy and lactation because of the negative consequences for both mother and infant. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} the median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) as a population-level indicator of iodine status among rural women farmers of reproductive age (18 – 45 years) in the province of Prey Veng, Cambodia. A total of 450 women provided a <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine sample in 2012. Of those women, 93 % (n = 420) were non-pregnant and 7 % (n = 30) were pregnant at the time of collection. UIC was quantified using the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction with modifications. The median UIC of non-pregnant (139 μg/L) and pregnant women (157 μg/L) were indicative of adequate iodine status using the WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD epidemiological criteria for both groups (median UIC between 100 – 199 and 150 – 249 μg/L, respectively). We conclude that non-pregnant and pregnant women in rural Prey Veng, Cambodia had adequate iodine status based on single <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> urine samples collected in 2012.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Direct sputum smear {{microscopy}} is {{the cornerstone}} for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in resource-poor countries. However, the requirement for repeated visits to submit specimens and receive results is associated with considerable diagnostic delay, work load, patients drop-out and high expenses for patients. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently changed its policy from <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> <b>spot</b> (SMS) to <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> (SM), the SM method still involves two days visits for a patient. Objective: This study evaluated the yield of first spot double slides smears for the diagnosis of PTB in high TB setting. Methods: A total of 362 patients who visited the out-patient department (OPD) of Dilla referral hospital and who were suspected of PTB {{were involved in the}} study. In addition SMS sputum samples were collected; double slides smears were prepared, stained by the Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) method and 100 fields were examined under oil immersion objective for acid fast bacilli (AFB). Results: Of 362, 54 (14. 92 %) were smear-positives. Out of the 54 smear positive subjects, 53 (98. 15 %) were positives by the first spot specimen. Additionally, 1 of 54 (1. 85 %) were positives by the morning specimen. Using the 2 -day protocol (SMS) among 362 patients, 54 (14. 92 %) were smear positives by double slides and 53 (14. 64 %) by single slide smears. Whereas using the 1 -day protocol (first spot); among 362 patients, 53 (14. 64 %) were smear positives both in double slides and single slide smears.

METHODS 30 urinary stone-formers {{out of an}} initial 62 recruited provided a complete 24 -hour urine and early <b>morning</b> <b>spot</b> urine samples for metabolic evaluation. Pearson correlation and Bland and Altman Test {{were used to assess}} the correlations and agreements. RESULTS Significant correlations were established between the 24 -hour urinary solute excretions and the corresponding early <b>morning</b> <b>spot</b> urine solute/creatinine ratios for calcium, magnesium, urate, potassium, oxalate, citrate, and the Differential Gibb's free energy value of calcium oxalate DG(CaOx) values. However, all these solute/creatinine measurements between the 24 -hour and early <b>morning</b> <b>spot</b> urine samples were judged to be not within the acceptable limits based on the estimated "limit of agreement" by the Bland and Altman Test of Agreement. Diurnal circadian rhythm and postprandial excretion surge are thought to be responsible for the disagreements.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the prevalence and drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients visiting TB {{diagnosis and treatment}} facilities at selected health facilities in eastern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2011 and May 2013. A total of 408 new adult pulmonary TB patients (≥ 18 years) were enrolled in this study. Three consecutive sputum samples (<b>spot,</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>spot)</b> were collected from each patient and transported to the Armauer Hansen Research Institute TB laboratory located in Addis Ababa for culture on Lowenstein Jensen slant media. DST was performed on 357 (87. 5 %) of the patient samples for isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E), and streptomycin (S) using the standard proportion method. The rate of resistance to any one drug was 23 %. Any resistance to H, S, R, and E was 14 %, 11. 5 %, 2. 8 %, and 0. 3 %, respectively. The highest proportion of monoresistance was observed against H (9. 5 %). MDRTB was detected in 1. 1 % of the patients. Any drug resistance was associated with HIV infection (COR = 3. 7, 95 % CI 1. 905 – 7. 222) (P = 0. 000). Although the prevalence of MDRTB is relatively low in the study area, high prevalence of H resistance is a serious concern demanding close monitoring. Expanding diagnostic capacity for mycobacterial culture and DST is a vital step in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Appropriate dietary iodine is {{essential}} for thyroid hormone synthesis, especially in young children. Following an iodine fortification in bread initiative, approximately 6  % of Australian preschool children were expected to have an excessive iodine status. The {{aim of this study}} was to document the current iodine status of preschool children using urinary iodine concentration (UIC) as a biomarker of iodine intake. Methods A convenience sample of fifty-one preschool children, aged 2 – 3  years, were recruited from south east Queensland. UIC was ascertained from <b>spot</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon urine samples collected on two consecutive days and food frequency questionnaires were completed for each participant. Dietary iodine intake was extrapolated from UIC assuming 90  % of dietary iodine is excreted in urine and a urine volume of 0. 5  L/day. Results A median UIC of 223. 3  μg/L was found. The calculated median dietary iodine intake was 124. 8  μg/day (SD 47. 0) with 9. 8  % of samples above the upper level of 200  μg for dietary iodine for children within this age group. No foods were associated with UIC. Discussion Limited by sample size and recruitment strategies, no association was found between usual food intake and UIC. Extrapolated dietary iodine intake indicated that children within this cohort consumed adequate amounts of dietary iodine, although the number of children consuming above the upper limit of 300  μg/day was almost double of expected. The development of a UIC criteria to assess appropriate parameters for varying degrees of iodine status is required for the monitoring of iodine nutrition in this vulnerable age group...|$|R
