25|$|Vertical glass tubes, {{known as}} water gauges or water glasses, show {{the level of}} water in the boiler and are {{carefully}} monitored at all times while the boiler is being fired. Before the 1870s it was more common to have a series of try-cocks fitted to the boiler within reach of the crew; each try cock (at least two and usually three were fitted) was mounted at a different level. By opening each try-cock and seeing if steam or water vented through it, the level {{of water in the}} boiler could be estimated with limited accuracy. As boiler pressures increased the use of try-cocks became increasingly dangerous and the valves were prone to blockage with scale or sediment, giving false readings. This led to their replacement with the <b>sight</b> <b>glass.</b> As with the injectors, two glasses with separate fittings were usually installed to provide independent readings.|$|E
25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and safe operation of the boiler. If the water level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the heat of combustion, the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the fusible plug, a device to release pressure in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E

50|$|The 1970s {{were the}} heyday of Malins Engineers. The MM1 {{received}} a vaporising burner in 1970, both Minors got overflow plugs in 1975, the engines were converted to solid fuel in 1977 for the domestic market (it had happened earlier for export) and in 1978 the entire range (except for the MM1) received <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> on the boiler instead of the overflow plug. By the late 1970s the range was looking tired and so, with considerable investment from the Malins family, in 1979 the SE range was superseded by the SP range.|$|R
50|$|The National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors {{recommends}} a daily testing procedure {{described by the}} American National Standards Institute, chapter 2 part I-204.3 water level gauge.

50|$|The 7th Class {{represented}} a considerable advance {{in design and}} power. They were the first South African locomotives to be equipped with sight feed lubricators which allowed a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to be positioned in the cab, where the rate of oil feed to the cylinders could be observed. The reversing gear was of the quick-threaded screw type instead of the reversing lever which had earlier been used.|$|E
50|$|The {{air-cooled}} engine has a gear-driven counterbalancer {{as well as}} a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance. Valves are adjustable via 'screw and locknut' type clearance adjusters. The engine features an oil sump <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> enabling visual oil checks, and uses 87 octane fuel.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the days}} runs, the train is shoved back to clear the shop lead switch, with the cars being tied down, and the engine spotted for the night of the track pans to clean the fire the next morning. The fire is banked and the boiler is filled with water to sit through the {{overnight}} hours. Once that is complete the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are shut off, along with the air compressor and check valves to the boiler, the dynamo, blower, and injector lines are closed, and finally the turret is shut off and the stack is gagged.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big end bearings from inside. The end main bearings and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|R

5000|$|The {{separator}} is {{only effective}} {{as long as}} there is an air space inside the chamber. The separator can fail if either the mixed inlet is overwhelmed with supply material, or the liquid drain is unable to handle the volume of liquid being collected. The separator may therefore be combined with some other liquid level sensing mechanism such as a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> or float sensor. In this manner, both the supply and drain flow can be regulated to prevent the separator from becoming overloaded. (Agastya, Bayu) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of {{corrective}} lens is [...] "single vision", which has a uniform refractive index.

Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have two simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's <b>sight,</b> <b>glasses</b> complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required.
