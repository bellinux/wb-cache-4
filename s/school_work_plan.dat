40|$|Summary The {{subject of}} this study is the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> (schemes of <b>work)</b> in <b>school.</b> A <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{document}} that describes assignment the students are expected to do during a particular period of time. It can be used to solve didactical challenges connected to pedagogic differentiation and self- regulated learning. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is not developed as a consequence of departmental directives, but a tool made on a local level. Recent classroom research (Klette et al 2008, Haug 2009) shows {{that one of the most}} visible trends is that the amount of individual work is increasing at the expense of the collective teaching, and the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is a part of this picture. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> has been criticized because it leads to the ‘classroom’ as a learning arena becoming less important and the teacher adopting a background role. As a result, the student must take more responsibility for their own learning, and this leads to different outcomes for the students (Klette 2007). This study has three main areas of discussion: How widespread is the use <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in <b>school?</b> Which activities and types of interaction have teacher and student when the <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as a learning tool? What are the teacher’s intentions in their use of <b>work</b> <b>plans?</b> Data in this study are collected from a survey to teachers and quantitative classroom observations at levels 3, 6, and 9, which are based upon the research project, Quality in Education (KIO) at Volda University Collage. Collection of data took place in 2007 - 2008. The main findings in this present research are that <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used at all levels at Primary School level, but the KIO data identifies variations with regards to the design and application of these <b>planning</b> documents. Most <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in use are common <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> for several subjects. These plans are used to a limited extent in schools at levels 3 through to 6, but increasing by year 9. By year 9 the students follow the <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> for a third of the time of their individual work. Teachers both justify and define the schemes of work principally as a means of informing students and parents about <b>school</b> <b>work</b> and homework in an agreed period of time. It may appear that the teachers have no holistic teaching methodology behind the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans.</b> The teacher’s main educational reasons for using <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are pedagogic differentiation. At level 9 <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as the main tool when the student is working with differential tasks, whilst year 6 students rarely work with differential tasks when they are using a <b>work</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{teachers}} {{in political science}} course A, all from municipal upper secondary <b>schools</b> <b>work</b> with <b>planning</b> their lessons. Due to nationwide regulations and goals set by the The Swedish National Agency for Education, the teachers have to plan their lessons basing on these regulations. However it is not defined how to concretely implement these regulations when planning for the lessons, which {{may lead to the}} fact that the teachers’ own interpretations of the regulations cannot be fully avoided in the process of planning for the lessons. The investigation consists of five interviews made with teachers in political science, all from municipal upper secondary schools. The teachers who have taken part in this report come from two different municipal upper secondary schools. The result in this report partly shows that although the basic reference topics set by The Swedish National Agency for Education is the same for each teacher in political science, the planning of the lessons structure can be very different. For example, when the five teachers plan how to make the pupils understand the concept of "democracy", they all planned their lessons having the regulations and goals in mind, but they all have a unique approach in how to prepare for their lessons and explain the concept of "democracy" for their pupils...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{number of}} studies in social {{sciences}} and education domain discuss the value of analysing qualitative data or describe the methodology and data collection processes, but few detail how analysis was carried out. Trustworthiness and credibility of findings from qualitative research depend {{on the quality of}} data management, retrieval, and interpretation or identification of meaning. The robustness of data analysis is therefore an important factor in the rigor of qualitative research. This article uses a study of the factors that shape the adolescent’s future orientation to illustrate strategies that ensure rigor in qualitative data analysis. The findings in this study indicate adolescent goes through a host of challenges, ranging from the developmental changes to developmental tasks.

40|$|Implementation {{functions}} are skills that include organisation, planning, maintenance of attention, working memory, metacognition and time control. These processes {{have a significant}} impact on student’s school performance, since problems in the field of metacognition disable a student to choose appropriate strategies for learning. Troubles in the field of organisation consequently lead to problems with planning of learning time, forgetting of school timetable and relevant accessories for work and to difficulties in <b>planning</b> bigger project <b>works.</b> Developing of organizational skills is one of the key areas of child’s development which significantly affects also other areas of child’s functioning. Some students have well developed organizational skills; others need intensive help and support in developing them. Problems in organizational skills can reflect in different ways: a student forgets the accessories his needs, he doesn’t know, how to start solving the given task or doesn’t complete it, he has problems with time consciousness and forgets the school timetable (Shore 1998). Students with such deficits require systematic help at <b>school</b> <b>work</b> <b>planning,</b> timing of homework and other school activities. A group of students, who have expressive difficulties in terms of organizational skills, are the students with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder – ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). ADHD is a disturbance, described as an attention deficit and a hyperactive impulsivity that is more common and more serious as it is usual for children at a certain development stage (Kesič-Dimic, 2003). Learning disabilities for students with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder can be explained in conjunction with three main signs of the ADHD disorder: lack of attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. All these problems affect the less developed organizational skills. In my diploma thesis I focused on finding strategies, which help to improve learning and organizational skills for a forth class student with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. The aim of the empirical part was to prepare and perform training of organizational skills, which included colour classification of school subjects, arrangement of student’s working place at home and at school, arrangement of school accessories, daily and monthly planning of school activities, recording of homework, guidance for daily obligations, making concept cards in subject of natural science, making concept cards in English and elaboration of guidelines for improvement of reading comprehension. Before starting to perform training I obtained the initial assessment of the student’s functioning by using a check list which was completed by the student’s class teacher, his mother and the provider of additional professional assistance, a questionnaire on organizational skills (Do you have good organization skills?, 2011) and a questionnaire to identify learning styles (Memletics learning styles questionnaire, 2011). Based on the assessment I set goals of training and on the basis of planed targets I created the organizational skills training. The training took place from December 2011 to April 2012 three times a week for one school hour during prolonged stay at school after classes. Guided hours were carried out in a structured manner, according to elements set in advance. As the student’s time orientation was very poorly developed, each training hour was based also on developing and improving the time orientation. At the end of March 2011, after finished organizational skills training I repeated the test of organizational skills (Do you have good organization skills?, 2012) and compared the results of initial and final testing. In comparison to initial testing the student has made a significant progress in all fields of organization, especially in the field of time organization and acquired learning strategies. The student will still need assistance to assure greater self-motivation for <b>school</b> <b>work.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} perceptions of <b>school</b> <b>work</b> culture of instructional staff members (administrators and faculty) in public charter and public non-charter {{elementary schools in}} a large urban metropolitan county of Central Florida by assessing differences in perceptions of administrators and faculty related to <b>school</b> <b>work</b> culture, perceptions between school administrators and faculty, and the interaction between type of <b>school.</b> The <b>School</b> <b>Work</b> Culture Profile (SWCP), a paper-and-pencil survey, was designed in 1988 by Snyder to obtain a measure of a school 2 ̆ 7 s work culture. The SWCP uses a Likert scale to assess the overall perception and four sub-domains of planning, development, program development, school assessment, and staff development. One hundred sixty-one teachers and administrators from public charter and public non-charter elementary schools participated. Results of ANOVA tests indicated differences by job category: administrators {{scored significantly higher than}} faculty on the overall perception and three sub-domains of <b>school</b> <b>work</b> culture: <b>planning</b> development, program development, and school assessment. There was no difference on the staff development sub-domain. Administrators and faculty members do perceive certain aspects of <b>school</b> <b>work</b> culture differently. Program Development, Planning Development, and School Assessment are administrative functions, whereas Staff Development may be perceived {{to be more of a}} personal function. There was no difference between perceptions of instructional staff by type of school (public charter and public non-charter). In addition, there was no interaction between job category and school type. The perceptions of administrators and faculty members of both types of schools do not appear to be dependent upon whether or not they work in charter or non-charter public schools. Public charter and public non-charter school instructional staff responded to SWCP sub-domains similarly; therefore, the type of <b>school</b> the respondents <b>worked</b> in, albeit public charter or public non-charter, did not impact their perceptions. Differences existed in perceptions between school administrators and faculty members, regardless of type of school, with the exception of the sub-domain of staff development. The mean perception for administrators in both types of schools was higher in the other three domains. No interaction occurred between type of school and type of job category for any sub-domain or the overall perception. The conclusions from this study included (a) schools are equal regardless of the type of school, (b) the culture of administrators and faculty members remains the same regardless of the type of school, (c) the perceptions of administrators and faculty members are not determined by the type of school in which they work [...] administrators and faculty members do perceive certain aspects of <b>school</b> <b>work</b> culture differently. Implications derived from the study include (a) efforts to mainstream and encourage cross-institutional (public charter schools and public non-charter schools) collaboration might be helpful to improve the educational conditions for all students, (b) efforts need to be focused on increasing the collaborative conversations and involvement that connect the individuals in a school setting as related to planning development, program development, school assessment, and the overall perception of <b>school</b> <b>work</b> culture as well as developing inclusionary practices that increase faculty members 2 ̆ 7 input in meeting schools 2 ̆ 7 stated goals, (c) placing emphasis on the charter school movement as an alternative for the innovative ideas needed to address the state of the national education system could be increased in colleges of education and educational leadership programs, and (d) program development, planning development, and school assessment are administrative functions, whereas staff development may be perceived to be more of a personal function...|$|R

My purpose {{has been to}} get a view of, to which extent they use technology in their education. I have also compared boys and girls. The result has been achieved {{with the aid of}} questionnaires. It shows that the pedagogues in the preschool, think they use technology every day. They use it in their games, experiments, food situations and even when the children are dressing them selves. The pedagogues in the compulsory <b>schools</b> <b>work</b> with technology, without reffering to the actual concept. They use the nature and experiments, to involve the children in technology. One of the schools has a film project. They also learn the children how to use computers and cameras. The compulsory schools take the children to workplaces, where they can see how technology can be used, in the everyday existence. I have studied the workplans for the schools,and found out that there are none,or just a few objectives inscribed,in the compulsory school. The preschools however have their own plans how to reach the objectives in technology. From the teachers point of view,all of them {{think it is important to}} include technology, in early ages. The children will increase the desire to investigate und understand. There is no lack of creative material such as paper,bottles,beads and glue. In constructions and experiments, they use material from the activity or the nature. Half of the pedagogues keep their attitude toward boys and girls actively in mind. They are also positive to teach and conduct technology. Insufficient amount of time and resources in order to develop the technology,is however a problem in the compulsory school.

As an alternative to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Investigation (RFI) specified in Module VII of the Permit, current New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) guidance identifies an Accelerated Corrective Action Approach (ACAA) that may be used for any SWMU or AOC (NMED, 1998). This accelerated approach is used to replace the standard RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> and Report sequence with a more flexible decision-making approach.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is the master}} <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> for the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) Corrective Action Program (RCAP) for single-shell tank (SST) farms at the US. Department of Energy's (DOE'S) Hanford Site. The DOE Office of River Protection (ORP) initiated the RCAP to address the impacts of past and potential future tank waste releases to the environment. This <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> defines RCAP activities for the four SST waste management areas (WMAs) at which releases have contaminated groundwater. Recognizing the potential need for future RCAP activities beyond those specified in this master <b>work</b> <b>plan,</b> DOE has designated the currently planned activities as ''Phase 1. '' If a second phase of activities is needed for the WMAs addressed in Phase 1, or if releases are detected at other SST WMAs, this master <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> will be updated accordingly...|$|R

The original <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> - Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Tatum Dome Test Site, Lamar County, Mississippi (herein after called the <b>Work</b> <b>Plan)</b> {{was approved by}} the state of Mississippi in 1992 and was intended as the operative document for investigative activities at the Tatum Dome Test Site. Subsequent to the approval of the document a series of activities were undertaken {{under the auspices of the}} <b>work</b> <b>plan.</b> This {{document is}} organized in the same manner as the original work plan: (1) Introduction; (2) Site Background and History; (3) Initial Evaluation; (4) Data Quality Objectives; (5) RI/FS Tasks; (6) Project Schedule; (7) Project Management; and (8) Reference. This addendum will identify changes to the original <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> that are necessary because of additional information acquired at the SS. This document is not intended to replace the <b>work</b> <b>plan,</b> rather, it is intended to focus the remaining work in the context of additional site knowledge gained since the development of the original <b>work</b> <b>plan.</b> The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is conducting a focused and phased site characterization as a part, of the RI/FS. The RI/FS is the methodology under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) for evaluating hazardous waste sites on the National Priorities List (NPL). The SS is not listed on the NPL, but DOE has voluntarily elected to conduct the evaluation of the SS in accordance with CERCLA...|$|R
