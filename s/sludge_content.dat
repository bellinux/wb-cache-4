The boiler water needs to be alkaline and not acidic, {{so that it does}} not ruin the tubes. There can be too much conductivity in the feed water when there are too many dissolved solids. These correct treatments can be controlled by efficient operator and use of treatment chemicals. The main objectives to treat and condition boiler water is to exchange heat without scaling, protect against scaling, and produce high quality steam. The treatment of boiler water can be put into two parts. These are internal treatment and external treatment. (Sendelbach, p. 131) The internal treatment is for boiler feed water and external treatment is for make-up feed water and the condensate part of the system. Internal treatment protects against feed water hardness by preventing precipitating of scale on the boiler tubes. This treatment also protects against concentrations of dissolved and suspended solids in the feed water without priming or foaming. These treatment chemicals also help with the alkalinity of the feed water making it more of a base to help protect against boiler corrosion. The correct alkalinity is protected by adding phosphates. These phosphates precipitate the solids {{to the bottom of the}} boiler drum. At the bottom of the boiler drum there is a bottom blow to remove these solids. These chemicals also include anti-scaling agents, oxygen scavengers, and anti-foaming agents. Sludge can also be treated by two approaches. These are by coagulation and dispersion. When there is a high amount of <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> it is better to coagulate the sludge to form large particles in order to just use the bottom blow to remove them from the feed water. When there is a low amount of <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> it is better to use dispersants because it disperses the sludge throughout the feed water so sludge does not form.|$|E

In the experiment, four levels of mixing ratios of paper sludge to thermoplastic polymer (10 : 90, 20 : 80, 30 : 70 and 40 : 60) and three levels of coupling agent (Epolene G- 3003 TM) content (1, 3, and 5 wt. %) were designed to discuss the physical and mechanical properties of composite. Composite density, as expected, increased but melt flow index decreased when the paper <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> increased.

In times of high energy prices and regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, lightweight aggregate products of the high-temperature process in sales marketing are not readily accepted. This study developed a sintered-type paper sludge lightweight aggregate. In order to reduce energy consumption, substitution of some reservoir sediment clay in paper sludge substitutes is to be expected. The study used two types of paper sludge (green clay paper sludge and paper pulp sludge). The sintering temperature was reduced effectively as the green clay paper sludge was substituted {{for some of the}} reservoir sediment clay, and the optimum substitute ranges of green clay paper sludge were 10 %– 50 %. The optimum substitute ranges of the paper pulp sludge were 10 %– 40 %.

According {{to the principles of}} sustainability, several restrictions have been imposed on the conventional methods currently adopted for its disposal. The consequent need to develop alternative processes for the use of sewage sludge for energy purposes such as gasification requires experimental tests in order to quantify the potential energy recover from this waste, as well as to evaluate the optimum conditions for its gasification. In the present study, the gasification with air of dehydrated sewage sludge (20 wt. % moisture) mixed with conventional woody biomass was performed in a pilot scale updraft fixed-bed gasifier operating at atmospheric pressure. Attention was focused on the effect of the sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> and the equivalent ratio (ratio between the amount of air used and the stoichiometric air needed for combustion) on the product yields, gas composition and cold gas efficiency. The results obtained showed {{that it is possible to}} cogasify sewage sludge with wood pellets in pre-existing updraft fixed-bed gasification installations. However, at high sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> (P 70 w/w%) slagging and an excessive clinker formation may occur in the oxidation zone because of the high ash content and low ash fusion temperatures of the sludge making the gasification process unstable. In addition, the formation of an ash layer on the grate requires persistent ash discharge that introduces instabilities in the gasifier operating conditions. The rise in the equivalent ratio led to higher gas and carbon yields and cold gas efficiencies. At the optimal equivalent ratio of 0. 25, compared with wood pellets gasification, the addition of sewage sludge with 20 wt. % moisture up to 70 w/w% gave rise to decreasing the dry gas yield from 1. 56 to 1. 07 Nm 3 /kg of feedstock due to the higher moisture and ash content of sewage sludge and to moderate reductions of the gas lower heating value and cold gas efficiency from 5. 8 to 4. 9 MJ/Nm 3 dry and from 60 % to 55 %, respectively...|$|E

As said before, the ratio of sludge to water and the overall concentration of continuous phase (the sludge) are important factors in viscosity. Therefore, as seen, because of higher overall content of the sludge, despite high emulsifier concentration in test no. 3, the final emulsion is sticky and viscous so the viscosity cannot be measured. Additionally, in test nos. 3 and 6, the sludge to water ratio is 50 / 40 and 50 / 49.2, respectively. So, the viscosity of test no. 6 should be lower than test no. 3. On the other hand, in test nos. 6 and 7, as emulsifier content increases and water content decreases, the viscosity increases a little from 260.5 to 263  cp because of a little high overall <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> in test no. 7.|$|E

Thermal disintegration effectively decreased sludge production by 30 % when comparing results with control reactor running in parallel. However, the solubilization of sludge compounds and the decrease of VSS concentration in the aeration tank led to a higher organic load in the reactors.

Further analysis of the intermediate products show that methanogenesis was the rate limiting step during AcoD at a high organic loading value. As the organic loading increased, the digestion lag phase increased and the hydrolysis rate decreased...|$|E
40|$|Lotsbroverket is {{the largest}} {{wastewater}} treatment plant on the Aland Islands and it isdesigned for handling wastewater from approximately 30 000 persons. In 2011,Lotsbroverket produced about 2800 m 3 of dewatered sludge. The sewage sludge that isproduced is transported to a contractor where it is processed to eventually be used e. g. {{in the construction of}} green space. This study aims to investigate available applicationoptions in terms of the sewage sludge that is produced in Lotsbroverket. The main aimis to study the feasibility of using the produced sewage sludge as a fertilizer in theagriculture of the Aland Islands. The sludge already fulfills limit values for heavy metals in accordance with the Act"The Aland Government´s directive on the use of sewage sludge in agriculture. " Inorder to clarify the <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> of pharmaceutical and organic substances it isrequired that the substances are identified and a risk assessment is performed. In theliterature it is found that the risk of human exposure to these substances is low if thesludge is treated appropriately. Suggested appropriate treatment of the plant's sludge isthermophilic digestion whereby also pathogens are killed. The soil of the Aland Islands has a high content of phosphorus. Since 1995 there is anenvironmental program to which currently 95 % of the island's farmers are connected. The program controls the use of fertilizers i. e. by setting maximum permitted levels ofphosphorus. Since sewage sludge contains relatively much phosphorus it may be alimitation of the use of sewage sludge on agricultural land of the Aland Island. That iswhy it would be suitable to use the sludge with a different fertilizer in order to obtainthe proper fertilizing properties. In Europe, the use of sewage sludge in agriculture is relatively widespread. Severalcountries have less strict laws regarding the <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> than the Aland Islands. Because large amounts of fruits and vegetables annually are imported into the island,there is {{reason to believe that the}} population already consumes products grown onsludge treated soils. Several of the farmers on the Aland Islands are currently scepticalin terms of using sewage sludge in agriculture, mainly due to uncertainties in the sludgecontent. Regarding the certification of Lotsbroverket in accordance with the Swedishcertification system REVAQ no barriers have been found. To ensure that a certificationis possible, however, further investigations are required...|$|E
40|$|Bed {{expansion}} {{behavior and}} sensitivity analysis for super-high-rate anaerobic bioreactor (SAB) were performed based on bed expansion ratio (E), maximum bed <b>sludge</b> <b>content</b> (V 					pmax), and maximum bed contact time between sludge and liquid (τ 					max). Bed expansion behavior models were established under bed unfluidization, fluidization, and transportation states. Under unfluidization state, E was 0, V 					pmax was 4 867 ml, and τ 					max was 844 – 3 800 s. Under fluidization state, E, V 					pmax, and τ 					max were 5. 28 %– 255. 69 %, 1 368 – 4 559 ml, and 104 – 732 s, respectively. Under transportation state, washout of granular sludge occurred and destabilized the SAB. During stable running of SAB under fluidization state, E correlated positively with superficial gas and liquid velocities (u 					g and u 					l), while V 					pmax and τ 					max correlated negatively. For E and V 					pmax, the sensitivities of u 					g and u 					l {{were close to}} each other, while for τ 					max, the sensitivity of u 					l was {{greater than that of}} u 					g. The prediction from these models was a close match to the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{efficiency}} of an activated sludge system is generally evaluated by determining several key parameters related to organic matter removal, nitrification and/or denitrification processes. Off-line methods for {{the determination of}} these parameters are commonly labor, time consuming, and environmentally harmful. In contrast, quantitative image analysis (QIA) has been recognized as a prompt method for assessing activated <b>sludge</b> <b>contents</b> and structure. In the present study an activated sludge system was operated under different experimental conditions leading {{to a variety of}} operational data. Key parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium (N-NH 4 +), and nitrate (N-NO 3 -) concentrations, throughout the experimental periods, were measured by classical analytical techniques. QIA was further used for the microbial community characterization. Partial Least Squares (PLS) models were used to correlate QIA information and the aforementioned key parameters. It was found that the use of the morphological and physiological data allowed predicting, at some extent, the effluent COD, N-NH 4 +, and N-NO 3 - concentrations based on chemometric techniques.

40|$|Pit latrines {{can provide}} {{improved}} household sanitation, but without effective and inexpensive emptying options, {{they are often}} abandoned once full and may pose a public health threat. Emptying techniques can be difficult, as the <b>sludge</b> <b>contents</b> of each pit latrine are different. The design of effective emptying techniques (e. g., pumps) is limited {{by a lack of}} data characterizing typical in situ latrine sludge resistance. This investigation aimed to better understand the community education and technical engineering needs necessary to improve pit latrine management. In low income areas within Mzuzu city, Malawi, 300 pit latrines from three distinct areas were assessed using a dynamic cone penetrometer to quantify fecal sludge strength, and household members were surveyed to determine their knowledge of desludging procedures and practices likely to impact fecal sludge characteristics. The results demonstrate that there is a significant difference in sludge strength between lined and unlined pits within a defined area, though sludge hardened with depth, regardless of the pit type or region. There was only limited association between cone penetration depth and household survey data. To promote the adoption of pit emptying, it is recommended that households be provided with information that supports pit emptying, such as latrine construction designs, local pit emptying options, and cost. This study indicates that the use of a penetrometer test in the field prior to pit latrine emptying may facilitate the selection of appropriate pit emptying technology...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the rheology of mixed primary and secondary sludge and its dependency on solid content and temperature. Results of this study showed that the temperature and solid concentration are critical parameters affecting the mixed sludge rheology. It was found that the yield stress increases with an increase in the <b>sludge</b> solid <b>content</b> and decreases with increasing temperature. The rheological behaviour of sludges was modelled using the Herschel-Bulkley model. The results of the model showed a good agreement with experimental data. Depending on the total solid content, the average error varied between 3. 25 % and 6. 22 %...|$|R
