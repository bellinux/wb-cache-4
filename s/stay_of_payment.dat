The survey considered the impact of health policy changes in the P. R. C., especially cost recovery, decentralization, managerial changes {{and the promotion of}} traditional medicine. The financial records of county level hospitals and traditional medicine hospitals for the period 1980 - 1989 were examined, as were patient expenditures. Opinions of those responsible for policy execution were surveyed. The data showed that hospitals from which state subsidy had been removed had become dependent on medicine sales and increasing itemization of treatment to recover costs. The insurance status of patients influenced the length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and levels <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Uninsured peasants had a shorter stay and were charged more for items of treatment. Traditional Medicine hospitals saw more outpatients than County hospitals, but {{were more likely to have}} a deficit. They were also very dependent on medicine sales for income. Most officials questioned felt that the changing system caused problems, but at the same time were eager to invest in equipment as a source of revenue.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{hospital}} patients living in low income areas of England cost more to treat, using elective hip replacement as a tracer procedure and length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> {{as a cost}} indicator. Anonymous hospital records are extracted on all 235, 813 patients admitted to English NHS Hospital Trusts for elective total hip replacement from 2001 / 2 through 2006 / 7. The relationship between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and small area income deprivation is modelled using linear regression, allowing for patient characteristics (age, sex, number of diagnoses, procedure type), time trends and Trust effects. Patients from the most income deprived decile <b>of</b> areas <b>stay</b> 12 - 15 % longer than those from the least deprived decile, or 8 % longer after adjusting for patient characteristics and Trust effects. This relationship did not change during the period, despite substantial NHS expenditure growth and reform along with substantial declines in average length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and waiting time. The major determinants <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> are age and number of diagnoses. Under the current NHS fixed price payment system, there are incentives for hospitals to avoid offering hip replacements to elderly patients, patients with substantial co-morbidity and, to a lesser extent, patients from low income areas.

The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The positive effect of GDP on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged.

In this sense, the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is one <b>of</b> the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime. Two decade of economic reforms and free trade opened several opportunities that reflected in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> performance <b>of</b> the country. This paper attempts to evaluate the trends of India’s Balance <b>of</b> <b>Payments</b> and identify its emerging challenges. The discussion is broadly classified into four parts viz. i) India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> picture since 1991, ii) emerging role of invisibles and software services in balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> iii) unhealthy trends in FDI and iv) the vulnerability and challenges ahead. ...|$|R

Political stability has {{an important role in}} determination of healthy <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> than economic freedom. This study focus on selected 10 Asian countries of various income levels and test the factor of political stability and economic freedom in stability <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> by using a simple econometric model with various techniques. Our empirical finding shows that political stability is more important than economic freedom in stabilizing balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Stable political regime with visionary leadership leads the nations to higher level of favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Political stability is playing major role than theoretical explanation to achieve surplus <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> hence exchange rare stability. Surplus of trade balance, foreign direct investment and higher international reserves hence appreciation of Yuan in china mostly depends on its long term political stability under one party political system rather than pure theoretical determination <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Attaining <b>of</b> political stability before economic freedom is policy implication of this study to achieve international financial stability...|$|R
