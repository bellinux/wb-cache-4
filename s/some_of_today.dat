40|$|I am {{no expert}} in black masculinity. As a white female from a small, {{predominantly}} white town, I cannot claim {{to understand what}} it is like to grow up as a black man in America. However, I believe that I, and many others, can come closer to understanding <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> 2 ̆ 7 s complex black masculine identities through the history of constructions and conscious (re) constructions of images of black masculinity. There are countless routes that could have been taken, and admittedly, so much more that could be said about countless images of black masculinity, including those I have represented. The few constructions that I have chosen I believe are representative of the most popularly white-consumed images of masculinity of the nineteenth through the twenty-first centuries. An entire book could be written on the representations of black masculinity, and it still may never be defined. But that is what makes it interesting - the ways in which it has transformed over time, sometimes in compliance with and sometimes in reaction to white perceptions of black men. In studying selected instances of restrictive, white-constructed representations of black masculinity such as the 2 ̆ 2 Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 minstrel, 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 2 Real Nigga 2 ̆ 2 who rejects white society and retaliates by expressing his power and prowess can be more deeply understood.

40|$|Most {{research}} studies concerning implementation {{and use of}} ICT in hospitals relate to information systems. Various technologies and information systems are implemented in modern hospitals, such as EPRs, administrative systems, diagnostic tools, and lab systems. Common sense would suggest that collaboration 9 ̆ 7 for maximum efficiency 9 ̆ 7 would appreciate 9 ̆ 3 seamless 9 ̆ 4 integration of information systems and centralized control. Former research argues, however, that tighter integration in human-to-system communication could produce additional work or that it just relocates the workload instead of improving the efficiency and that 9 ̆ 3 patchworks 9 ̆ 4 sometimes are more beneficial than tight integration. The motivation for my research was to examine whether this strategy in hospitals would apply similarly in human-to-human communication and messaging, with a human receiver or 9 ̆ 3 callee 9 ̆ 4. This thesis presents some former research of ICT systems {{in health care and}} explains some relevant concepts from theory. It also provides a description of the health care domain, with information about the Norwegian health sector and hospitals. My field research was conducted at different sections at the Children 9 ̆ 2 s Clinic at Rikshospitalet, the Norwegian national hospital. I used techniques from qualitative research (interviews and observations) to examine and evaluate communication routines and practices in the hospital. This thesis describes the most important types and technologies of communication and discusses thoughts and opinions among hospital workers on today 9 ̆ 2 s practices and requests for future improvements. Many hospital workers found <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> 9 ̆ 2 s systems and practices for human-to-human communication interruptive, rigid, and cumbersome; and some improvements and changes could be desirable. An integration of voice and text messaging in handheld devices could improve the quality of clinical communication and reduce interruptions from using pagers. It could also be beneficial with context-aware communication systems, utilizing information about location and availability. Such information could be available through integrated functionality such as a positioning system, dynamic addressbook, and calendar applications. Due to different professions and roles in a hospital, though, it is hard to find common opinions. My research indicates that administrative and office personnel seemed more interested than clinical personnel in a tighter integrated communication and coordination system. Clinicians, however, tended to be a bit more skeptical of too much integration and new technology in human-to-human communication. Important aspects of human-to-human related work are flexibility, responsibility, professional judgment, and assessment of importance; and human contact and face-to-face communication will always be necessary. When introducing new systems, it is necessary to take into consideration actual and different needs among hospital workers, information security and privacy, user-friendliness, robustness and backup, and user involvement. It is also worth bearing in mind that a hospital is an old and rigid type of organization with deep-rooted traditions, routines, and professions consisting of individualists. Improvements of communication practices and new functionality are desired and will most certainly occur as part of a modernization and digitalization process. However, hospital changes take time and must be done gradually with small steps...|$|E
40|$|Once, they say, {{freedom of}} {{contract}} reigned in American law. Parties could make agreements {{on a wide variety}} of subjects and choose the terms they wished. Courts would refrain from questioning the substance of bargains and would ensure only that parties had observed the proper formalities. In interpretation, objectivity was paramount. Courts would seek to ascertain, not what the parties had intended, but what a reasonable observer would understand the parties 2 ̆ 7 words to mean. Contract law was a series of abstractions informed by individual autonomy and judicial deference. This world, a classical paradise of doctrines with sharp corners, began to disappear in the mid-twentieth century, a victim of legal realism and its successors in the academy. Legislatures limited the scope of contract by enacting social welfare and consumer protection statutes. Courts began to police the fairness of agreements, developing new doctrines like unconscionability that allowed them to intervene to protect parties with unequal bargaining power. When it came to interpretation, courts discounted the apparent certainty of contract language and focused on what the parties had actually meant. Contract law became more egalitarian and more subjective. But we live in a new day. Twenty-five years after Grant Gilmore famously declared it 2 ̆ 2 dead, 2 ̆ 2 {{freedom of contract}} is experiencing a revival in American law. The bargain principle has proven remarkably durable, now extending beyond traditional contracts to govern institutions, like marriage, that once were grounded in status. Courts again refrain from challenging the substance of parties 2 ̆ 7 agreements, and interpretation again emphasizes the written language. These developments reflect a new formalism that promises (or threatens) to restore the libertarian virtues of contract 2 ̆ 7 s classical past. This is the conventional account of American contract law. Like most such accounts, it gets many things right and some things quite wrong. A recent collection of essays, The Fall and Rise of Freedom of Contract (F. H. Buckley ed., 1999) (Duke University Press, 461 pp.), explores the accuracies and flaws in the conventional story and reflects on the continuing vitality of freedom of contract. Many of the essays, contributed by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most prominent scholars, come from a law-and-economics perspective, but the book is not unreflective or triumphalist. Taken together, the essays offer useful insights into the capacity of the bargain principle to withstand the critiques of the last century and the principle 2 ̆ 7 s adaptability in areas as diverse as tort law, zoning law, family law, bankruptcy law, and conflict of laws. One cannot do justice to all these topics in a short essay. Instead, I will concentrate on two areas, marriage and conflict of laws, and discuss the ways in which freedom of contract can make useful contributions to both. In addition, I will address an overarching question that Fall and Rise provokes. Is it really correct to speak of freedom of contract 2 ̆ 7 s contemporary 2 ̆ 2 revival 2 ̆ 2 ? To do so implies both that freedom of contract had gone into eclipse and that its present victory over rival concepts is more or less complete. Neither proposition is true. Today as always freedom of contract coexists with other, competing principles that stress substantive fairness and overriding social values. It seems fruitless to argue long about which of these many principles expresses the essence of contract law. The better part of wisdom, as Morris Cohen suggested many years ago, lies in accepting the complexity...|$|E

40|$|There {{are some}} {{fundamental}} questions of jurisprudence {{that have been}} with us from time immemorial. Cardozo started the modern conversation {{about the role of}} the judge in American democracy, but no one has been able to complete it. We have yet to uncover a satisfactory theory of judging that adequately accounts for the diverse, and often-times conflicting, responsibilities judges possess. Recent national controversies over judicial ethics at the Supreme Court, campaign contributions in state judicial elections, and the role of public opinion in judicial interpretation only underscore the growing urgency of clarifying the role of the judge. What are the qualities of a good judge? What are the relevant normative guideposts for a judge in a democracy that should constrain or inform interpretation? What are the sources of ethics for judicial behavior and performance? This Essay seeks to break some new ground on these fundamental inquiries by proposing a fiduciary theory of judging. The following complexities reveal the importance of the inquiry at the heart of our project. We know that judges owe certain duties to the litigants before them, and that they also have some responsibility to 2 ̆ 2 the state 2 ̆ 2 for implementing its laws. But responsibility to 2 ̆ 2 the state 2 ̆ 2 is impersonal - and the citizens of a democratic state may also reasonably demand from their judges direct attention and responsiveness. Democratic governance ultimately consists of a series of relationships between rulers and ruled, so even if judges routinely think of our government as one of laws and not persons, self-government means precisely that laws must be traceable to citizens. It is, canonically, for judges to 2 ̆ 2 say what the law is, 2 ̆ 2 but judges speaking the law must be held accountable if their rulings stray too far from the opinions of the people who authorize the judiciary to exercise this power. Yet, how to think about the nature of this accountability - thereby reconciling the principle of judicial independence with that of judicial responsiveness - is perplexing exactly because we lack a decidedly democratic theory of judging. In what follows, we argue that there is a satisfying normative vision of the judicial role that could better orient members of the judiciary - and the academics who study them - lost in this thicket. By turning to the principle of fiduciary relationships, we uncover a new perspective from which we can better conceptualize the judicial role. Translating the fiduciary principle of the private law into a set of obligations for actors in the public law is well-grounded theoretically and has historical provenance in the framing of the U. S. Constitution. Once we effectuate that translation for judges in the political system, the Essay offers insight into what it means to be a judge in a democracy: the judge-as-fiduciary framework both confirms features of judgeship that seem obvious and central to the job, while providing a useful normative benchmark that can help guide <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most controversial debates about the judiciary. Indeed, by rooting the role of the judge in a centuries-old rubric that governs trusting relationships, this Essay sheds new light on the basic structure of and justifications for liberal democracies...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} wine in Brazil dates back to 1532, when Brás Cubas tried to {{cultivate}} the vine on São Paulo coast. As we can imagine, {{it was not a}} very successful venture. Later, other efforts were made by Jesuits in the seventeenth century. In 1739 Portugal prohibited the production of grapes and wine in the colony and this prohibition lasted until the Independence of Brazil in 1822. Although it is interesting to mention those fledgling efforts to produce wine in Brazil, the decisive impetus for the Brazilian wine industry only began with the Italian immigration of the late nineteenth century. These immigrants from Veneto and Trentino Alto Adige settled in the Serra Gaucha and received land from the government, for which they had to pay later. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> famous Brazilian wineries, like Miolo and Casa Valduga, began as small canteens initiated by Italian immigrants. These immigrants had not the intention to build a wine industry when they arrived in Brazil. The primary intention was to make wine for their own consumption provided that wine was considered as a food, a part of Italian culture and tradition, not simply an alcoholic beverage. Therefore, wine industry in Rio Grande do Sul emerged to supply a cultural demand of the Italian immigrants. A different motive can be identified in the reasons of the implementation of a wine industry in São Francisco Valley, backcountry of Northeast Brazil. We could say that the region became economically interesting since the development induced by investments in irrigation, conducted mainly by CODEVASF. Therefore, the drive for wine production in Serra Gaucha was culture, while the drive for São Francisco Valley wine industry was the business opportunities engendered by institutional policies conducted on the region. In this article, I will consider the history {{of wine in}}dustry in Serra Gaucha and in São Francisco Valley through the lens of Institutional Economics, initiated by Thorstein Veblen in the late nineteenth century, reworked by new institutionalists like Douglass North, and continued today by authors like Geoffrey Hodgson and others. I suggest three institutional dimensions that are usually considered by the seminal authors of Institutional Economics: (i) rules of the game, they are the formal and informal rules that structure human interaction; (ii) mental models, consistent of ideologies, habits of thought and all the internalized rules of the game; (iii) organizations, that are groups of individuals acting together with an at least temporary common purpose. The objective {{of this article is to}} tell the history of wine in Brazil and to compare the different motives for wine production in those two Brazilian regions. The question proposed in this article is: which institutional dimension was more important for the emergence of a wine industry in Serra Gaucha and São Francisco Valley? The hypothesis is that not only government policies in the São Francisco Valley were important for the emergence of a wine industry in Brazilian backcountry, but also the know-how acquired in winegrowing in Serra Gaucha. This article is divided in five parts. The first section introduces the topics proposed in the article. In the second section, the institutionalist theory will be presented, based on the idea of the three institutional dimensions. In the third section, the history of wine in the Serra Gaucha will be told. In the fourth section, the motives for a wine industry in São Francisco Valley will be presented. Finally, the fifth section concludes the article...|$|E
40|$|While the techies {{have been}} {{twiddling}} {{away with the}} Internet, and you ve been wondering if you d be left out, the phone has still been getting on with connecting people. Yesterday s future is tantalisingly close, today. Make that call. Send that email. Hands up {{if you have not}} seen an Internet café or telecentre in a market near you this year! There are thousands in ACP countries. Some are public, others private, and a good many are geared up to provide market information (from costs of inputs and goods available, to sales opportunities) for agricultural producers and traders, as just a part of their services. Some are fumbling to translate their fuzzy vision of an ICT-enabled knowledge society into working reality, and some are more sanguinely trying to sort out the most reliable sources of market information. None are yet financially viable, {{in the same way that}} most Internet services in the West are still climbing their expensive learning curves. The rise and fall of dot com companies in the years 1999 - 2000, when the balloon-like faith of finance companies inelectronic commerce swelled and burst, bear witness to the volatility of the new economics (see Spore 88). Far from being dead, electronic commerce, or e-commerce, has now culled its weak and weak-hearted and is preparing for a serious surge from 2002 onwards. Unlike what happened in the first wave, many ACP countries will be relatively well equipped to join in. There is reason for confidence; some even talk euphorically of e-velopment. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> s initiatives will indeed flourish. They will be the ones that looked before they leaped. They will be taking a deep breath and ensuring financial stamina to get through the thankless early days. They understand that cash flow will come from social phone calls, emails or Internet searches (illness, family news, lotto results, shopping lists for visitors from the diaspora, even ecotourism bookings!). Calls and emails about fertiliser prices, shipping costs or veterinary services will not alone provide the critical volume of business. Is the waiting almost over? We think so, for most. A kind of magic, all the same It all started with the second telephone, and the world s first telephone call, in 1876. The world has not looked back since then. For the 3 billion people who allegedly have never made a phone call, most of them in Africa and Asia, the notion of hearing the voice of an unknown person, an untold distance away, will be a surprise. It will come soon, as more people become wired. The stated goal of the telecommunications people Universal Service has suffered from the Last Mile problem. This defines the technical and financial difficulty of installing telephone cables from a central point in a city, or a market town, to customers in surrounding communities. With apologies to the copper producers amongst us, we have to stop thinking of only phone wires, and Think Wireless. Revolutionary: from cell to cell While many specialists have focussed on how to computerise ACP countries, the telephone infrastructure has been growing fast. A virtual miracle has appeared in the form of the handheld mobile cellular phone, and low-cost satellite links. What has made the mobile a revolutionary tool, even in rural areas? The cost of installing and maintaining local receiver/transmitter stations (called cells) has fallen dramatically, as have the costs of sending signals by satellite. Each local station needs to be at most at a few kilometres distance from the next cell, literally to pass signals along. In isolated areas where there are no or few customers, and access is hard for maintenance, the signals can now be leapfrogged over longer distances via satellite. Where there are just a few dozen customers in a settlement, it makes most sense to establish a local station with fixed-line phone on the spot, ideally in a so-called telecentre which provides fax and computer services too. If there are several hundred customers in the area, cellular mobile phones become viable. The economics of covering an entire nation are not yet sound even parts of the densely-populated Netherlands have no mobile phone access but it is now feasible to provide such access to a good 95 % of your population in any country. Universal Service has been quietly replaced by Universal Access. If you can get your hands on a mobile phone, or go to a telecentre, you can reach any other phone or computer in the world. Many governments have resisted the de-regulation which would allow such systems to flourish, in part because a heavily regulated system offered a slim chance of collecting significant revenues from incoming international phone calls. The global telecommunications market, however, is fast becoming a free-for-all, and there are opportunities galore. Barefoot telecentres Normally such liberal talk excludes much of the ACP world. Not here. Here is not a reason to curse globalisation, nor to despair at the prospect of your rural community being isolated and never getting connected. Those classical reactions just do not work. The technology is evolving so quickly that notions of 'being priced out of the system' or 'the unbridged Last Mile' no longer apply. Hence, The Economist magazine reported in November 2000, Ghana now has five Internet service providers, and three mobile-phone operators. They set up a subscriber with a phone for $ 50 and a crystal clear connection within four hours, instead of the dark tunnel of a $ 150 connection, when it came, from the former state monopoly. It takes little to see what that means for entrepreneurs with an eye for ICTs. The Grameen Bank saw it first, seven years ago, in Bangladesh, where almost every village now has its barefoot telecentres which rent out mobiles. In ACP countries with deregulated telecoms, the telecentre booths that line most markets show what a flourishing trade there is in linking into the national phone network. No network nearby? No trouble (stay within the law though!); make your own links. The Economist: 'The most deregulated and dynamic system in Africa is in Somalia. The state system was destroyed in the civil war and has now been replaced, at least in the main towns, by enterprising Somalis. They simply buy a satellite dish and telephones, build a shed of phone booths and charge $ 1 a minute for anywhere in the world. A model for the rest of the continent?'.
