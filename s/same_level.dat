40|$|For convenience, health {{practitioners}} and clinicians {{are inclined to}} classify people/patients as overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI) cutoff points of 25 and 30 [*]kg[*]m(- 2) respectively, irrespective of age and gender. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to identity whether, for the <b>same</b> <b>levels</b> of adiposity, BMI is the same across different age groups and gender. A two-way ANCOVA revealed significant differences in BMI between different age groups and gender (plus an interaction), using body fat (%) as the covariate, data taken from a random sample of the English population (n= 2993). Younger people had greater BMI than older people for the <b>same</b> <b>levels</b> of adiposity (differences ranged by 4 BMI units for males, and 3 BMI units for females). In conclusion, if BMI thresholds for overweight (BMI= 25 [*]kg[*]m(- 2)) and obese (BMI= 30 [*]kg[*]m(- 2)) are to reflect the <b>same</b> <b>levels</b> of adiposity across all gender and age groups within a population, then age- and gender-specific BMI adjustments outlined here are necessary to more accurately/fairly reflect the <b>same</b> critical <b>levels</b> of adiposity...|$|R
