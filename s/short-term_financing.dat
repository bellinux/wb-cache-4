5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular <b>short-term</b> <b>financing.</b> As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

25|$|The United States has {{encouraged}} Belarus to conclude and adhere to {{agreements with the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, {{as well as to}} undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for Export-Import Bank <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> insurance for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated.

30|$|This {{research}} investigates efficiency {{differences between}} two important financial approaches that {{credit card companies}} use to attract customers. Since the cash-back offer has been already investigated by previous studies, this study focuses upon the balance transfer offer and then compares {{them in terms of}} their influences on consumers’ <b>short-term</b> <b>finance.</b> The proposed research utilizes the three-stage investigation. The first stage is related to consumers’ choice on offers. The second stage estimates the offer’s overall and monthly effects on payment, spending, and changes on debt in order to capture consumers’ dynamic finance conditions. The last stage estimates the effects on balance transfer and cash-back offers compared with control and non-promotional finance conditions. This study finds that the balance transfer offer is more effective in making a financial impact to consumers’ <b>short-term</b> <b>finance</b> than the cash-back offer.|$|R
25|$|A self-inflicted {{wound was}} the VOC's {{dividend}} policy. The dividends {{distributed by the}} company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade but one (1710–1720) from 1690 to 1760. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia {{to build up the}} trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the bewindhebbers only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the liquid capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to France, the British {{government}} relied more on <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> in {{the form}} of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: [...] "LEND YOUR MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk. If you invest in Exchequer Bonds your money, capital and interest alike, is secured on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, the premier security of the world." ...|$|E

30|$|To {{attain the}} {{research}} objective, {{this study examines}} consumer behavior by analyzing {{the effects of a}} balance transfer (BT) offered from a credit card company which is often accompanied with consumer’s <b>short-term</b> <b>finance.</b> Moreover, comparing between BT offers and cash-back offers, this study attempts to examine a business implication: Which offers are more effective in impacting consumers’ <b>short-term</b> <b>finance.</b> To obtain the implication, this study uses a randomized dataset provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS bank). An important feature of the dataset is that it contains account information both from the specific credit card company (CCC) and from the Equifax (EFX) bureau for every consumer. The EFX bureau is one of the three largest American credit agencies founded in 1899 that reports and maintains credit information on over 400 million consumers worldwide for every corresponding month.|$|R

30|$|In {{the third}} group (C), {{adjusting}} the total cost to $ 500, the payment, and ΔCCC balance, ΔEFX balance effects are much greater. Based on the standard finance condition of consumers, cash back can change 1 %, at most 2 % of their <b>short-term</b> <b>finance,</b> but a BT offer changes consumers’ finance from 8 to 27.5 %. Hence, the evidence confirms the result found in their paper that consumers originally save more cash in their accounts rather than purchase more. However, this does not hold for spending. Due to the limitations of our data, spending is not equal to total purchase. Thus, to some extent, the data are not comparable. This study considers that consumers are stimulated more by giving them the BT rather than giving them cash back. The credit card company can design more BT offers instead of cash back to encourage consumers to borrow and change their <b>short-term</b> <b>finance.</b>|$|R
