25|$|Fairtrade {{labelling}} (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a {{certification system}} designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a <b>standard-setting</b> <b>body</b> (FLO International) and a certification body (FLO-CERT), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the Fair Trade Certified Mark, it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested {{in accordance with the}} international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role of <b>standard‐setting</b> <b>bodies</b> and rating agencies which compete for authority in Islamic finance. It does so through a consideration of a recent debate over the permissibility of sukuk financing. Design/methodology/approach – The methods used are a combination of archival and bibliographic research, coupled with the author's previous research on Islamic banking and finance. Findings – While the debate over sukuk hinged on whether the structures are shari'a compliant in form only, not in substance, the role of sukuk in neoliberal reform and the privatization of state resources reveal a deeper potential conflict between Islamic <b>standard‐setting</b> <b>bodies</b> and global neoliberal projects more broadly. Research limitations/implications – The implications are significant for other Islamic finance contractual forms and modes of finance. They are also significant in light of the global financial crisis, and the recent debt crisis in Dubai. The research limitations have to do with the fact that this is a fast‐moving field and the global financial crisis has destabilized many institutions – both conventional and Islamic – in structured finance. Originality/value – Few scholars have considered sukuk's legitimacy, or the competition between Islamic <b>standard‐setting</b> <b>bodies</b> and non‐Islamic global rating agencies...|$|R
40|$|In {{an era of}} {{increased}} reliance on private regulatory bodies and globalised economic activity, standardisation is the field where politics, technical expertise and strategic behaviour meet and interact. International <b>standard-setting</b> <b>bodies</b> exemplify the rise of transnational governance and the challenges that it brings about relating to institutional choice, legitimacy, procedural and substantive fairness or transparency. This book takes a more empirical-based approach focusing on the mechanics of international standard-setting. It constitutes a multidisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of international standard-setting, an empirically under-researched yet important area of international informal lawmaking. Contributors expertly examine the peculiarities of international standardisation in selected issue-areas and legal orders and {{shed light on the}} attributes of international standard-setters, allowing comparisons among <b>standard-setting</b> <b>bodies</b> with a view to identifying best practices and improve our understanding about standardisation processes...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{principal}} features of accounting in the 21 st century is harmonisation and stanardisation. Regulation of the European Parliament and European Council No. 1606 / 2002 harmonizes financial reporting for certain companies in the EU. However, national accounting principles are of great importance for financial reporting. The main purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the application of generally accepted accounting principles, the regulatory accounting framework and the <b>standard-setting</b> <b>bodies</b> of EU member states. The analysis of these accounting issues was conducted with respect to all 28 EU member states. The results indicate that EU member states regulate their principal accounting issues through separate accounting acts or implement those issues in companies acts. Some EU member states do not have national accounting standards, the national accounting principles being incorporated in companies acts and accounting acts. Nevertheless, national accounting <b>standard-setting</b> <b>bodies</b> are governmental organisations in almost half the member states...|$|R
40|$|Audit {{materiality}} is {{a fundamental}} concept of the external audit process. Guidelines issued by professional <b>standard-setting</b> <b>bodies</b> generally state that the determination of audit materiality is primarily a matter of professional judgement. Over emphasizing professional judgement as predominate guideline might {{be an attempt to}} advance and maintain so-called uncertain professional knowledge. This paper examines the proposition that in respect of determining materiality during the audit of company annual financial statements, professional auditing standards suggest the preference of <b>standard-setting</b> <b>bodies</b> not to provide concrete guidelines to the extent it is possible. It does so by means of a comparative analysis between normative principles regarding the determination of audit materiality and the corresponding professional standards. The results provide sufficient evidence to support the research proposition. Audit materiality standards presently have two major shortcomings, namely: over emphasizing the exercise of professional judgement and providing for various alternatives, while normative principles favour a specific approach...|$|R

5000|$|In accounting, {{prudence}} {{was long}} {{considered one of}} the [...] "fundamental accounting concepts" [...] in its determination of the time for revenue recognition. The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have led academic critics to accuse the international <b>standard-setting</b> <b>body</b> IASB of abandoning prudence. In the British reporting standard FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a [...] "desirable" [...] quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept. Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.|$|E

The “carrying” of meanings between sub-worlds of the financial accounting world through social processes, principally by means of the <b>standard-setting</b> <b>body’s</b> conceptual framework, is shown to be implicated in the social construction, maintenance and modification of accounting meanings.

50|$|Another {{issue is}} the need for shariah {{supervisors}} to be trained in both Islamic commercial law and contemporary financial practices, the scarcity of such people, and the high prices they command as a result.
