5|$|After a <b>safety</b> <b>is</b> scored, {{the ball}} is put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger <b>safety,</b> <b>is</b> often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E

5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra <b>safety</b> <b>is</b> worth the additional expense.

5|$|The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public <b>Safety</b> <b>is</b> a law {{enforcement}} agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history {{and some of the}} best-known criminal cases {{in the history of the}} Old West.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own <b>safety</b> <b>is</b> not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
5|$|In {{gridiron}} football, {{the safety}} (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play {{that results in}} two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored {{in a number of}} ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a <b>safety</b> <b>is</b> scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking off the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can {{have a significant impact on}} the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick.|$|E

5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a <b>safety</b> <b>is</b> scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by the defense, and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently with CBS) called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E
