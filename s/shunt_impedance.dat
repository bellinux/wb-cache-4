40|$|This paper {{analyses}} and compares two passivity- based approaches that allow to include a-priori knowledge on the dynamic {{range of the}} human operator and/or the environment. This can lead to less conservative teleoperation systems compared to systems designed to be purely passive or absolutely stable. The first approach under investigation is a method where the absolute stability is analysed of a teleoperation system augmented with <b>shunt</b> <b>impedances</b> in series and/or parallel with the teleoperation system. It is shown that the traditional interpretation {{of the use of}} <b>shunt</b> <b>impedances</b> is not valid and a more accurate description of how to use this method is presented. The second approach under investigation is the bounded environment (operator) method. It is shown that the original idea to restrict the analysis to the so-called worst-case scenarios of a pure mass and a pure stiffness as environment can be too simplistic. Illustrative examples with mass-spring-damper systems fixed to the ground and floating objects as environments are made to demonstrate this in detail. In conclusion, this paper shows that embedding environment knowledge into the controller analysis/design is not straightforward and further research should be dedicated to determine which bounds should be used to obtain practically stable systems for different applications...|$|R

50|$|When {{the hand}} is {{distant from the}} antenna, the {{resonant}} frequency of the antenna series circuit is at its highest; i.e., it is closest to the free running frequency of the oscillator, and small changes in antenna capacitance have greatest effect. Under this condition, the effective inductance in the tank circuit is at its minimum and the oscillation frequency is at its maximum. The steepening rate of change of <b>shunt</b> <b>impedance</b> with hand position compensates for the reduced influence of the hand being further away. With careful tuning, a near linear region of pitch field can be created over the central 2 or 3 octaves of operation.

40|$|In {{conventional}} crab cavities the TM 11 mode is used {{to deflect}} the beam. It is necessary to damp all the other modes, namely the accelerating i. e. lower order mode (LOM), same order mode (SOM) and higher order modes (HOMs).
