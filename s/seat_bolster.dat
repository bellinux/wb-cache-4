All Brock EA Falcons featured a unique body kit, 16inch wheel package and interior upgrades. The latter used the standard <b>seats</b> <b>bolstered</b> and trimmed in a cloth specific to the model. Brock also improved the power output through a re-profiled camshaft, ECU tuning and modification to the induction and exhaust systems. A suspension upgrade was also performed, improving handling and ride quality.|$|R

50|$|In 1954, Eldorado {{lost its}} unique sheet metal and shared its basic body shell with {{standard}} Cadillacs. Distinguished now mainly by trim pieces, this allowed GM {{to lower the}} price and see {{a substantial increase in}} sales. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fenderbreaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear bodysides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupé built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the <b>seat</b> <b>bolsters.</b> Two thousand one hundred and fifty Eldorados were sold, nearly four times as many as in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Both the facelifted Magna and Verada {{benefited from}} a number of safety upgrades, as proven by the fact that all models met the then latest offset {{deformable}} barrier (ODB) and dynamic side impact requirements. In addition, front driver and passenger airbags became standard along with side airbags contained in the front <b>seat</b> <b>bolsters.</b> While the wheelbase of the new series had not changed, rear legroom was claimed to have been increased by reshaping the rear cushion of the front seats, the rear seat and by re-arranging the rear seat hip points and squabs. Other interior revisions included rear air vents {{for the first time on}} Magna as well as electric driver's seat height adjustment. For the first time, a factory-fitted GPS system was also offered as an option whereas most cars gained a rotary climate control panel, without the previous digital display. Systematic cost-cutting measures included the relocation of the front power window controls on the lesser Magna models from the door panels to the centre console, plus the removal of the individual battery cover compartment in the engine bay.|$|R

50|$|A major {{deviation}} from Town's design are the additional diagonals at the ends, which distribute the load over a smaller area and {{eliminates the need}} for long abutment <b>seats</b> of <b>bolster</b> beams. A patent was granted in 1863 for a similar variation on Town's design, so it is quite likely that this technique was not developed by the builder of the Beaverkill bridge. It is, however, unusual for New York. Davidson's three are the only ones known to have been built in the state.|$|R

40|$|Innovative wheelchairs allow {{individuals}} to change position easily for comfort and social situations. While these wheelchairs are beneficial in multiple ways, {{the effects of}} position changes on blood pressure might exacerbate hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion, particularly in those {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) who can have injury to autonomic nerves that regulate cardiovascular control. Conversely, cardiovascular benefits may be obtained with lowered seating. Here we investigate the effect of moderate changes in wheelchair position on orthostatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular reflex control. Nineteen individuals with SCI and ten neurologically-intact controls were tested in supine and seated positions (neutral, lowered, and elevated) in the Elevation™ wheelchair. Participants with SCI were stratified into two groups by the severity of injury to cardiovascular autonomic pathways. Beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) were recorded non-invasively. Supine blood pressure and MCAv were reduced in individuals with lesions to autonomic pathways, and declined further with standard seating compared to those with preserved autonomic control. Movement to the elevated position triggered pronounced blood pressure and MCAv falls in those with autonomic lesions, with minimum values significantly reduced compared to the seated and lowered positions. The cumulative duration spent below supine blood pressure was greatest in this group. Lowered <b>seating</b> <b>bolstered</b> blood pressure in those with lesions to autonomic pathways. Integrity of the autonomic nervous system is an important variable that affects cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress and should be considered when individuals with SCI or autonomic dysfunction are selecting wheelchairs.

5000|$|The Series 62 {{included}} a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets {{were incorporated into}} the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An Eldorado style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of window reveal molding, which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Florentine" [...] style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. Coupe de Ville script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the <b>seat</b> <b>bolsters.</b> Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment {{for the first time this}} year.

40|$|Musculoskeletal pain is {{commonly}} reported by police officers. A potential cause of officer discomfort is a mismatch between vehicle seats and {{the method used}} for carrying appointments. Twenty-five police officers rated their discomfort while seated in: (1) a standard police vehicle seat, and (2) a vehicle seat custom-designed for police use. Discomfort was recorded in both seats while wearing police appointments on: (1) a traditional appointments belt, and (2) a load-bearing vest / belt combination (LBV). Sitting in the standard vehicle seat and carrying appointments on a traditional appointments belt were both associated with significantly elevated discomfort. Four vehicle seat features were most implicated as contributing to discomfort: back rest bolster prominence; lumbar region support; seat cushion width; and <b>seat</b> cushion <b>bolster</b> depth. Authorising the carriage of appointments using a LBV is a lower cost solution with potential to reduce officer discomfort. Furthermore, the introduction of custom-designed vehicle seats should be considered...|$|R

50|$|Relative to the exterior, the {{interior}} of the LS bore a stronger resemblance to the S-Type, with a similar dashboard layout, gauges, and controls. The interior of the LS was simple, straightforward, and comfortable. Large gauges were designed to convey sportiness, while other controls, such as audio and climate controls, were positioned in the car's center stack for convenience to both the driver and the front passenger. The steering wheel could be wood- and leather-wrapped while wood accents continued around {{the interior}} on the door panels and dashboard area. Leather seating surfaces were standard and the front power bucket <b>seats</b> were <b>bolstered</b> for a firm feel like the LS' European competitors. Other standard interior features included power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power heated mirrors, automatic headlights, air conditioning with automatic climate control, cruise control, and an AM/FM cassette radio.

40|$|Keywords-component: seat pressure; {{discomfort}}; discomfort survey Abstract — Objective method {{alone is}} insufficient in measuring discomfort of car seats. It is indirect {{and does not}} truly convey the perception and feeling of the sitter. A combination of both objective and subjective method gives better evaluation on discomfort. Seat pressure distribution method was adopted to investigate the static characteristic of a seat. The method {{was found to be}} statistically repeatable in measuring sitting of fourteen male subjects in static condition. Subjective discomfort through subjective assessment using a valid and reliable self-established questionnaire together with a body pressure map (BPM) showed increasing discomfort as sitting time increase; which is expected. The short term seat pressure distribution was used to be correlated with subjective assessment. Significant and moderate correlation was observed between four local body parts namely the <b>seat</b> pan <b>bolster,</b> thighs, upper back and lower back with overall seat average pressure BPM used in the subjective evaluation. Multiple linear regression model were established; overall discomfort from averaged pressure from BPM can be predicted from right & left buttock, right & left thigh and upper back & lower back.

These are the Pulpit, the Ladder, and the Stage-itinerant. For as to the Bar, though it be compounded of the same matter and designed for the same use, it cannot, however, be well allowed the honour of a fourth, by reason of its level or inferior situation exposing it to perpetual interruption from collaterals. Neither can the Bench itself, though raised to a proper eminency, put in a better claim, whatever its advocates insist on. For if they please to look into the original design of its erection, and the circumstances or adjuncts subservient to that design, they will soon acknowledge the present practice exactly correspondent to the primitive institution, and both to answer the etymology of the name, which in the Phoenician tongue is a word of great signification, importing, if literally interpreted, [...] "The place of sleep," [...] but in common acceptation, [...] "A <b>seat</b> well <b>bolstered</b> and cushioned, for the repose of old and gouty limbs;" [...] senes ut in otia tuta recedant {60}.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard Eurosport package, there was a limited edition Eurosport VR version available, based on the 1986 Eurosport RS concept car. These very rare Celebrities were only produced for two model years (1987 and 1988) and came in one of four available monochromatic color schemes: Red, Silver, Black, and White. Notably, Fern Green was omitted from the color selection. Eurosport VRs were also fitted with special ground effects and body decals. 1987 VRs were available as sedans and wagons only, with the treatment expanding to the coupe for the 1988 model year. The 1987 models (often considered the most desirable) were given a special [...] "VR only" [...] interior, which included red carpeting, special tri-color door panels, bucket <b>seats</b> with thigh <b>bolsters,</b> and a rear seat cup holder. 1988 VRs did not receive the same interior treatment, {{as it turned out}} to be too costly, but were given either standard trim or upscale CL trim. All VR conversions were done by Autostyle Cars, near the Oklahoma City assembly plant, from where all VR Celebrities are believed to have originated. The Celebrity wagon was replaced by the Chevrolet Lumina APV.|$|R
