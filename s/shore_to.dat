5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E

5|$|At Tupper Lake, {{the route}} serves {{a cluster of}} {{recreational}} buildings at its intersection with Warren Point Road, a private drive leading to Warren Point. Here, NY421 turns southward, running along the lake <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> nearby Paradise Point Road, which leads east to Paradise Point and the lakeside Veterans' Mountain Camp. After Paradise Point Road, the highway follows a winding, southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth. NY421 follows the lake to its southern tip, where the route ends at an intersection with NY30 {{just west of the}} St. LawrenceFranklin county line.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls.

5|$|September 11, 1960 — Hurricane Donna makes {{landfall}} on Long Island as a Category2 hurricane. Sustained {{winds of}} 100mph (160km/h) on eastern Long Island and 70mph (110km/h) winds on western Long Island are reported, and tides are 6feet (2m) above normal along {{most of the}} coast.

Due to well-executed warnings, damages are extremely low, and it is reported that no deaths result from the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> collect the men.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a short}} {{diversion}} {{from the}} loch at Invermoriston, where the A82 crosses the River Moriston and the A887 provides another route back to the A87 and Skye. Telford's original stone bridge over the river, constructed in 1813, {{was replaced by a}} more modern structure as part of an overall improvement to the A82 undertaken in the 1930s. Between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit, there is a roadside memorial to John Cobb, who was killed on the loch attempting to beat the water speed record. As the A82 approaches Drumnadrochit, it passes Urquhart Castle before turning inland, away from the loch <b>shore,</b> <b>to</b> approach the village.|$|E
5|$|While Alcibiades {{was still}} en route, the two fleets clashed at Abydos, where the Peloponnesians {{had set up}} their main naval base. The battle was evenly matched, and raged for a long time, but the balance tipped towards the Athenians when Alcibiades sailed into the Hellespont with {{eighteen}} triremes. The Persian satrap Pharnabazus, who had replaced Tissaphernes as the sponsor of the Peloponnesian fleet, moved his land army to the <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> defend the ships and sailors who had beached their ships. Only {{the support of the}} Persian land army and the coming of night saved the Peloponnesian fleet from complete destruction.|$|E
5|$|After Gaza was {{occupied}} on 7 November, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (XXI Corps) rode through {{the ruins of}} Gaza to reach Beit Hanun at 13:00; and the 157th Brigade (52nd Division) began the infantry pursuit along the Mediterranean <b>shore,</b> <b>to</b> reach Sheikh Hasan by 12:15. In {{the centre of the}} line the Anzac Mounted Division found a gap on the eastern side of Sheria to begin their pursuit at daylight on 7 November. After being held up at Sheria, the Australian Mounted Division and the 60th (London) Division advanced to capture Huj on 8 November. By that evening, all the Ottoman positions which had made up the Gaza-to-Beersheba line had been captured, and the erstwhile defenders were in full retreat.|$|E

5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> avoid an accident.|$|E

5|$|Komet {{returned}} to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived {{off the island}} at 05:45 {{on the morning of}} 27December. After issuing a warning for those on <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) was {{established}} in the area in 1963. That and the explosive growth of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s, caused the remainder of the communities on the southwestern <b>shore</b> <b>to</b> urbanize. The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. The communities around Clear Lake rapidly reoriented toward aerospace related industries, and the region's economy diversified further. Urban development spread solidly between Houston and the Bay Area communities. Houston formally annexed most of Clear Lake City in 1977 with Pasadena annexing most of the rest. Most of the other communities around the bay, however, had already incorporated, or incorporated soon afterward, and thus were independent of the metropolis. Texas State Historical Association.|$|E
