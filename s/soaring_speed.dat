2500|$|Golden eagles are {{sometimes}} {{considered the most}} superlative fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds. They are equipped with broad, long wings with somewhat finger-like indentations on {{the tips of the}} wing. Golden eagles are unique among their genus in that they often fly in a slight dihedral, which means the wings are often held in a slight, upturned V. When they must engage in flapping flight, golden eagles appear at their most labored but this flight method is generally less common than soaring or gliding flights. Flapping flight usually consists of 6–8 deep wing-beats, interspersed with 2 to 3 second glides. While soaring the wings and tail are held in one plane with the primary tips often spread. A typical, unhurried <b>soaring</b> <b>speed</b> in golden eagles is around [...] When hunting or displaying, the golden eagle is capable of very fast gliding, attaining speeds of up to [...] When diving (or stooping) in the direction of prey or during territorial displays, the eagle holds its wings tight and partially closed against its body and the legs up against its tail. In a full stoop, a golden eagle can reach spectacular speeds of up to [...] when diving after prey. Although less agile and maneuverable, the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon’s stooping and gliding speeds. This places the golden eagle as the one of the two fastest moving living animals on earth. Although most flight in golden eagles has a purpose (e.g., territoriality, hunting, etc.), some flights (such as those by solitary birds or between well-established breeding pairs) seem to function merely as acts of playfulness.|$|E

40|$|To {{maximize}} fitness, flying animals should maximize flight speed while minimizing energetic expenditure. <b>Soaring</b> <b>speeds</b> of large-bodied {{birds are}} determined by flight routes and tradeoffs between minimizing time and energetic costs. Large raptors migrating in eastern North America predominantly glide between thermals that provide lift or soar along slopes or ridgelines using orographic lift (slope soaring). It is usually assumed that slope soaring is faster than thermal gliding because forward progress is constant compared to interrupted progress when birds pause to regain altitude in thermals. We tested this slope-soaring hypothesis using high-frequency GPS-GSM telemetry devices to track golden eagles during northbound migration. In contrast to expectations, flight speed was slower when slope soaring and eagles also were diverted from their migratory path, incurring possible energetic costs and reducing speed of progress towards a migratory endpoint. When gliding between thermals, eagles stayed on track and fast gliding speeds compensated for lack of progress during thermal soaring. When thermals were not available, eagles minimized migration time, not energy, by choosing energeticall...|$|R

50|$|Involves driving {{dangerously close}} to the vehicle ahead (often {{in an attempt to}} {{encourage}} them to increase their speed). This action can distract the operator of the forward vehicle and reduces the stopping time of the rear vehicle in case of sudden speed changes. This is generally used by aggressive drivers. Additionally, this may affect the driver of the forward car emotionally, sometimes to the point the offended driver may consider <b>soaring</b> to illegal <b>speeds</b> in an attempt to escape, which in turn creates an additional aggressive driver.|$|R
50|$|Waved {{albatross}} are spectacular flyers, {{perhaps even}} the most famous. They can fly for hours without stalling and they do this by dynamic <b>soaring.</b> The wind <b>speed</b> near {{the surface of the}} sea is much lower than about 50 ft in the air. The waved albatross uses this to its advantage by gliding at speed into the wind. As the waved albatross glides higher it loses most of its ground speed because it is gliding into a wind of a higher speed. However, its air speed does not fall, enabling it to glide continuously. However, waved albatrosses do have difficulty in landing due to their high stalling speed, and in taking off due to the challenge of beating their massive wings. To make it easier they sometimes take off from cliffs that are somewhat inland rather than beside the coast.|$|R
40|$|Overall {{migration}} speed {{is likely to}} be a trait under selection pressure in animals migrating annually between habitats for reproduction and survival. A general expression was used for {{migration speed}} (V-migr), accounting for energy accumulation and transport, and derive how V-migr scales with body mass for three types of migratory locomotion: running, swimming and flying (powered and <b>soaring</b> flight). Migration <b>speed</b> is predicted to increase with increasing body mass in animals that run (proportional tom(1 / 11)), swim (proportional tom(1 / 24)) and fly by soaring (proportional tom(0. 22)), whereas in animals migrating by powered flight it decreases (proportional tom(- 1 / 4)). How the relative duration of fuel accumulation to that of migratory locomotion scales with body mass is also derived. This proportion should increase in animals that run and fly, but should remain unaffected by body size in swimmers. The suggestion is made that in runners and swimmers, selection for enhanced migration speed could provide an explanation to Cope's rule, i. e. the observation that body size gradually tends to increase over time...|$|R
40|$|The {{flight range}} of {{migrating}} birds depends crucially {{on the amount}} of fuel stored by the bird prior to migration or taken up en route at stop-over sites. However, an increase in body mass is associated with an increase in energetic costs, counteracting the benefit of fuel stores. Water imbalance, occurring when water loss exceeds metabolic water production, may constitute another less well recognised problem limiting flight range. The main route of water loss during flight is via the lungs; the rate of loss depends on ambient temperature, relative humidity and ventilatory flow and increases with altitude. Metabolite production results in an increased plasma osmolality, also endangering the proper functioning of the organism during flight. Energetic constraints and water-balance problems may interact in determining several aspects of flight behaviour, such as altitude of flight, mode of flight, lap distance and stop-over duration. To circumvent energetic and water-balance problems, a bird could migrate in short hops instead of long leaps if crossing of large ecological barriers can be avoided. However, although necessitating larger fuel stores and being more expensive, migration by long leaps may sometimes be faster than by short hops. Time constraints are also an important factor in explaining why soaring, which conserves energy and water, occurs exclusively in very large species: small birds can <b>soar</b> at low <b>speeds</b> only. Good navigational skills involving accurate orientation and assessment of altitude and air and ground speed assist in avoiding physiological stress during migration.
