50|$|Croaghaun is {{the most}} {{westerly}} peak of Achill Island, and its highest mountain. Its cliffs lie on the northern slope of the mountain. The cliffs at Croaghaun can only be seen by hiking around or to {{the summit of the}} mountain, or from the sea. They are part of a sequence of sheer rock faces which start south of Keem Bay and loop around the uninhabited north-west of the island, by Achill Head and <b>Saddle</b> <b>Head,</b> and east to Slievemore, occasionally dropping vertically into the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5000|$|The {{normal route}} {{is from the}} pay and display car park of [...] "Ben An" [...] (sic) by the shore of Loch Achray. From there the signed path heads {{straight}} uphill in a north-northeasterly direction before picking up {{the course of a}} brook, the Allt Inneir, and heading north-northwest up to a low saddle (246 m). The path crosses the <b>saddle</b> <b>heading</b> northwest before picking up the course of another burn, the Allt na Cailliche, and following it steeply uphill below the crags of Ben A'an. Close to the source of the burn the path swings westwards and behind the west top of the hill onto a col, from which it is a short climb to the summit of the west top which is the destination for most hikers. There is no obvious path to the main summit.|$|R

6000|$|The ugly glade {{became a}} place of color and action. The Navajos rode wiry, wild-looking mustangs and drove ponies and burros {{carrying}} packs, most of which consisted of deer-hides. Each Indian dismounted, and unstrapping the blanket which {{had served as a}} <b>saddle</b> <b>headed</b> his mustang for the water-hole and gave him a slap. Then the hides and packs were slipped from the pack-train, and soon the pool became a kicking, splashing melee. Every cedar-tree circling the glade and every branch served as a peg for deer meat. Some of it was in the haunch, the bulk in dark dried strips. The Indians laid their weapons aside. Every sagebush and low stone held a blanket. A few of these blankets were of solid color, most of them had bars of white and gray and red, the last color predominating. The mustangs and burros filed out among the cedars, nipping at the sage and the scattered tufts of spare grass. A group of fires, sending up curling columns of blue smoke, and surrounded by a circle of lean, half-naked, bronze-skinned Indians, cooking and eating, completed a picture which afforded Hare the satisfying fulfilment of boyish dreams. What a contrast to the memory of a camp-site on the Connecticut shore, with boy friends telling tales in the glow of the fire, and the wash of the waves on the beach! ...|$|R
60|$|Gray dawn {{found him}} in the <b>saddle</b> again <b>headed</b> for the river. Half an hour of riding {{brought him to the}} dense {{chaparral}} and willow thickets. These he threaded to come at length to the ford. It was a gravel bottom, and therefore an easy crossing. Once upon the opposite shore he reined in his horse and looked darkly back. This action marked his acknowledgment of his situation: he had voluntarily sought the refuge of the outlaws; he was beyond the pale. A bitter and passionate curse passed his lips as he spurred his horse into the brakes on that alien shore.|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} the {{horseman}} pulled up, and sat motionless in his <b>saddle</b> with his <b>head</b> turned towards the house.

He saw one or two mounted men wheel their horses, and more on foot spring clear of the hoofs, and then the flash of a rifle beneath the black front of a building. A flagstaff ran up into the night above it, and there were shadowy objects upon the verandah. Grant threw up a hand.|$|R
5000|$|Armitage Saddle (...) is the <b>saddle</b> at the <b>head</b> of Blue Glacier, {{overlooking}} the Howchin and Walcott Glaciers which drain toward Walcott Bay in the Koettlitz Glacier.

The New Zealand Blue Glacier Party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1956-58, established a survey station on the saddle in September 1957.

60|$|It {{was getting}} dusk when Wheeler swung {{himself from the}} <b>saddle</b> near the <b>head</b> of the gully and, with the bridle of the jaded horse in his hand, stood still a few moments looking about him. A {{wonderful}} green transparency still shone high up above the peaks, whose jagged edges cut into it sharply with the cold blue-white gleam of snow, but upon the lower slopes there was a balmy softness in the air, which was heavy with the odours of fir and cedar. Summer was breaking suddenly upon the mountain-land, but Wheeler, who had crossed the divide in bright sunshine, was sensible of a certain shrinking as he glanced down {{into the depths of}} the cañon. A chilly mist streamed up out of it, and the great rift looked black and grim and forbidding.|$|R
5000|$|Some mopeds {{are of a}} step-through type design, {{while others}} are step-over, or top tank, designs, having a motorcycle-like frame, {{including}} a [...] "backbone" [...] and a raised fuel tank (known as a top tank among moped enthusiasts), mounted directly between the <b>saddle</b> and the <b>head</b> tube. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle, only having the addition of pedals, in which the rider can both manually power the vehicle through a bicycle-like crankset {{in addition to a}} small displacement engine. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some regions classify low-powered three- or (rarely) four-wheeled vehicles as a moped.

50|$|The {{panel to}} the east of the north portico is Shiva in a Yogic {{position}} called Yogisvara, Mahayogi, Dharmaraja and Lakulish. Resembling a Buddha, Shiva is in a dilapidated condition with only two broken arms. Shiva is seated in padmasana yogic posture (cross legged) on a lotus carried by two Nāgas. His crown is carved with details adorned by a crescent, a round frill at the back, and hair curls dropping {{on either side of the}} shoulders. His face is calm in mediation, his eyes half-closed. This represents Shiva in penance sitting amidst the Himalayan mountains after the death of his first wife Sati, who was later reborn as Parvati. He is surrounded by divinities in the sky and attendants below. Also seen is a plantain with three leaves already open and one opening, as well as a sunflower blossom. These are flanked by two attendants. Other figures discerned from a study of the broken images are: Vishnu riding Garuda on a plantain leaf; the Sun-god Surya riding a fully <b>saddled</b> horse (<b>head</b> missing); a saint with a rosary; two female figures in the sky draped up to their thighs; a faceless figure of the moon with a water container; three identical figures of a male flanked by two females; the skeleton of a sage; Brahma (without one arm) riding a swan; and Indra without his mount (elephant missing).|$|R
60|$|But she did {{not become}} {{unconscious}} {{to the extent that}} she lost the sense of being rapidly borne away. She seemed to hold that for a long time. When her faculties began to return the motion of the horse was no longer violent. For a few moments she could not determine her position. Apparently she was upside down. Then she saw that she was facing the ground, and must be lying across a <b>saddle</b> with her <b>head</b> hanging down. She could not move a hand; she could not tell where her hands were. Then she felt the touch of soft leather. She saw a high-topped Mexican boot, wearing a huge silver spur, and the reeking flank and legs of a horse, and a dusty, narrow trail. Soon a kind of red darkness veiled her eyes, her head swam, and she felt motion and pain only dully.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{marker for}} the second {{chromosome}} of Anopheles gambiae, black, was isolated from progeny of 60 Co-irradiated mosquitoes. The black mutation increases melanization of larval setae and portions of the cuticle that are heavily sclerotized such as the <b>saddle</b> and <b>head</b> capsule. Adults have a sooty color that almost completely eliminates white banding on wings, tarsi, and palps. Fertility and general vigor of black individuals is reduced relative to wild-type; however, this does not prevent routine use for genetic crossing. The black marker was mapped to an interval on chromosome 2 between collarless and Dieldrin resistance 22 centiMorgans (cM) from collarless and 39 cM from Dieldrin resistance. We also isolated from 60 Co-irradiated mosquitoes a pericentric inversion, In(2) 2, that was marked with dominant alleles of the independently assorting genes collarless and Dieldrin resistance. This inversion is in coupling with the pericentric inversion 2 Rd and covers approximately two-thirds of chromosome 2 from divisions 9 to 22. While inbreeding In(2) 2 heterozygotes, we isolated a stock in which the inversion was in repulsion to a chromosome marked with c b DlS and an unidentified recessive lethal. This arrangement produced a useful and stable chromosome 2 balancer system that has remained intact for 26 generations without selection. These genetic tools will reduce the effort requires to isolate, among other things, the genetic factors affecting malaria parasite interactions with the mosquito host. Anopheles gambiae is the primary vector of malaria i...|$|R
500|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known about Sviatoslav's {{childhood}} and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. Sviatoslav's father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 945, and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor {{did he have a}} tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his <b>saddle</b> under his <b>head,</b> and all his retinue did likewise.|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} large and rounded. The {{origin of the}} first dorsal fin lies over {{the last third of}} the pelvic fin bases, while the origin of the much larger second dorsal fin lies over the rear of the anal fin. The claspers of adult males are moderately long and tapering, though those of some individuals may be knob-shaped and spiky. The anal fin is roughly equal in size to the pelvic fins, and smaller but longer-based than the second dorsal fin. The short caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick; the dermal denticles have three-pointed crowns and are widely spaced compared to other species in the genus. Coloured yellowish brown above and cream below, this shark has a characteristic series of ten dorsal <b>saddles</b> from the <b>head</b> to the tail; each saddle is dark brown with a darker edge and a lighter middle. Unlike in the similar lined catshark, there are no spots or additional markings between the saddles.|$|R
60|$|Her {{horse had}} the {{bad luck to}} cross soft ground. He went {{to his knees and}} Helen sailed out of the <b>saddle</b> over his <b>head.</b> Soft willows and wet grass broke her fall. She was {{surprised}} to find herself unhurt. Up she bounded and certainly did not know this new Helen Rayner. Her horse was coming, and he had patience with her, but he wanted to hurry. Helen made the quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it. She would tell Bo that. But just then Bo flashed into the woods out of sight. Helen fairly charged into that green foliage, breaking brush and branches. She broke through into open forest. Bo was inside, riding down an aisle between pines and spruces. At that juncture Helen heard Dale's melodious yell near at hand. Coming into still more open forest, with rocks here and there, she saw Dale dismounted under a pine, and Pedro standing with fore paws upon the tree-trunk, and then high up on a branch a huge tawny colored lion, just like Tom.|$|R
60|$|At daylight, accordingly, Valencia's intrenched {{camp was}} assaulted. General Pierce was soon in the <b>saddle</b> at the <b>head</b> of his brigade, which {{retained}} {{its position in}} front, thus serving to attract the enemy's attention, and divert him from the true point of attack. The camp was stormed in the rear by the American troops, led on by Riley, Cadwallader, and Dimmick; and in the short space of seventeen minutes it {{had fallen into the}} hands of the assailants, together with a multitude of prisoners. The remnant of the routed enemy fled towards Churubusco. As Pierce led his brigade in pursuit, crossing the battle-field, and passing through the works that had just been stormed, he found the road and adjacent fields everywhere strewn with the dead and dying. The pursuit was continued until one o'clock, when the foremost of the Americans arrived in front of the strong Mexican positions at Churubusco and San Antonio, where Santa Alma's army had been compelled to make a stand, and where the great conflict of the day commenced.|$|R
