5|$|In November 1978, a C-130H {{became the}} first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound. In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles during John PaulII's tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey <b>stud</b> <b>bull</b> presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.|$|E
5|$|In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian {{and other}} foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-Qantas Boeing 707s, handing them over to No.33 Flight (later No.33 Squadron) {{at the beginning of}} 1981. No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles on John Paul II's 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a <b>stud</b> <b>bull</b> presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's Entombed Warriors. In February 1987, the unit again joined No.36 Squadron, along with No.33 Squadron, as part of a re-formed No.86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group). The following year, No.37 Squadron achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours on the Hercules. The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C-130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines. In December 1990 and January 1991, a detachment of C-130s from Nos.36 and 37Squadrons flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War. No.37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace in January 1993, and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May. No.486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998, having transferred its C-130 maintenance functions to Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons. No.37 Squadron began re-equipping with new-model C-130J Hercules in September 1999. Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C-130s supporting INTERFET forces in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000, under Operation Warden. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001, the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C-130J. Five C-130s of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons participated in relief efforts following the Bali bombings in October 2002.|$|E
