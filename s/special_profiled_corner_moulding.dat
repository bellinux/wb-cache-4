40|$|Reducing {{the number}} of {{transitions}} of manufacturing products {{and the increase in}} the degree of deformation at a transition in shaping sheet metal forming processes can improve the performance of manufacturing and makes the resulting products competitive. For the drawing process developed ways of shaping with the use of differential radial flange backwater using liquid drawing in a die of <b>special</b> <b>profile</b> and the combined drawing in the double cone die <b>special</b> <b>profile.</b> Using computer simulation by the method of finite elements, was found that application of backwater significantly reduce the amount of tensile stresses in the dangerous section, which result is the destruction of the wall. Reduction of these strains has increased the degree of deformation in one transition and reduce {{the number of}} drawing transitions. The use of traditional drawing in a die of <b>special</b> <b>profiles</b> and combined drawing in double-cone die of <b>special</b> <b>profile</b> also reduced the number of presswork transitions. The experimental results confirmed the results of the calculations. Was found the analytical dependences for determining the parameters of the combined drawing in the double-cone die. For processes of reducing tubular and hollow bottom blanks were used the application of liquid back pressure to the inner surface of the blanks and reducing was applied in the die of <b>special</b> <b>profile.</b> Calculation found that counter-pressure application with reducing of tubular of steel billets leads to the exclusion of loss of stability of the preform wall and forming of the cross-ribbed on the wall and on the deformed part of the workpiece, which allowed to obtain products with the neck in one transition. During reducing was applied cone and spherical dies of <b>special</b> <b>profile.</b> In such dies deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are positioned at an angle with a certain step. Forming on these surfaces ensure the reduction of the friction forces in forming and increasing the degree of deformation in one transition. Using the pre-operation profiling wall of tubular or hollow blanks with the bottom results in reducing products of constant wall thickness. Prototypes of products was obtained by experimental way. Was founded the analytical dependences for determining the reducing force, the shape and size of the deformed part of the blanks. The developed method of outward flanging of the holes in the sheet metal blanks and profiles provides receiving of deformed part with a constant wall thickness without distortion. Constant wall thickness leads to an increase in the height of products after outward flanging with thinning and increased reliability and durability detachable and permanent joints which are formed by outward flanging products with other items. Using the pre-profiling of the blanks and profiles by cold extrusion forming holes followed by punching jumper leads to saving metal. Calculations and experiments have shown the possibility of obtaining constant wall thickness. For engineering calculation of parameters of preliminary profiling blanks and parameters of outward flanging was founded analytical according to the definition of power modes, the specific efforts on the instrument and final shape and size of deformed blanks. For various configurations of flanges on tubular workpieces and pipes was developed method of bulging by punch of <b>special</b> <b>profile.</b> At such punch deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are located at an angle to the corresponding step. By computer simulation was found and confirmed by experiment punch profile, which provides a reduction of the friction forces in the forming in the bulging processes and increase the bulging ratio. ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????. ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????; ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ?? ?????? ? ???????????????? ????? ?????????, ??? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ??? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ???????????? ?????. ?????????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ??? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ????????????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????, ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ?????????. ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????. ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????. ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????. ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????. ???????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????...|$|R

40|$|Invaded {{landscapes and}} {{ecosystems}} {{are composed of}} multiple interacting networks and feed-back loops, sometimes leading to unexpected effects of management actions. In order to plan management for invaded systems we need to explicitly consider management goals before putting actions in place. Actions taken must be justified {{in terms of their}} amelioration of impacts of invaders, contribution to the management goals and the costs incurred. # 2. This <b>Special</b> <b>Profile</b> brings together papers on the management of invasive plants, transgenes, animals and diseases, leading to conclusions with clear policy and management relevance and contributing to some of the hottest current topics in invasion ecology: unexpected impacts of invaders, restoration of invasion resistance, distribution mapping, spatial epidemiology, escape of transgenes, community interactions and complex effects of management. # 3. As papers in this <b>Special</b> <b>Profile</b> demonstrate, management for amelioration of the impacts of invasive species will include a wide range of manipulations, not just of the invader itself but of both abiotic and biotic components of the system. In fact, several papers in this <b>Special</b> <b>Profile</b> show that indirect management of the community may be more effective than removal of the invader alone. # 4. As little information is generally available {{at the beginning of a}} management programme, an adaptive approach should be taken and the management objectives/goals revised throughout the management process. New methods are emerging for adaptive management; an example is presented in this <b>Special</b> <b>Profile</b> where a Bayesian model used for assessing eradication goals can be updated throughout the management process leading to refinement of management. # 5. Synthesis and applications. Applied research should be directed at providing decision support for managers throughout the management process and can be used to provide predictive tools for risk assessment of new invaders. The science of invasion ecology has much to contribute to the new challenge of natural or enhanced movement of organisms in relation to climate change. Methods and information from invasion ecology can be used to assess management goals, management actions and the risks of potential translocations before they are put in place...|$|R
