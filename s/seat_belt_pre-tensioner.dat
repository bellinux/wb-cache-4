25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used in the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>pre-tensioner</b> system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the {{deceleration}} sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines which rotate to take up the slack in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signals from}} the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various {{additional}} restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and [...] "curtain" [...] airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated {{with one or more}} pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>pre-tensioner,</b> this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.|$|E

A number of perceptions, beliefs and expectancies about <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined to identify variables that discriminated between <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> users and non-users on urban roads. The subjects were 398 undergraduate students (aged 17 - 47) studying at the University of Girona, Spain. On the urban roads reported discomfort from using the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was higher, while perceptions of risk (for non-users), safety perceptions (for those using a <b>seat</b> <b>belt),</b> beliefs about the seriousness of a crash or the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> were all lower than on the highway.

40|$|Background: In Trinidad and Tobago, {{the law on}} the {{mandatory}} use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> was passed in 1995, but this law is hardly enforced. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the frequency and predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use by motor vehicle drivers in the country. Findings: A cross-sectional study of 959 motor vehicle drivers using a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis included Pearson Chi square test and multinomial logistic regression analysis in order to determine the possible predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use by the drivers in Trinidad and Tobago. A majority of the drivers sometimes (51. 8 %) or always (31. 6 %) use a <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> About 16. 7 %, 29 % and 54. 2 % of the drivers perceived that the other drivers use their <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> more frequently, with the same frequency and less frequently respectively compared to themselves. The main reason for not using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> by the drivers was given as frequent stops (40. 7 %) and the main motivation to use <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> by the drivers was given as stiffer penalties for non-compliance with the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law (44. 5 %). The predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were male driver, no formal or lower level of education, driving for less than 10 years, and the perception that the other drivers use <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> with the same or higher frequency compared to the respondents.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws and public {{education}} campaigns on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rear seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage by rear passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. </p...|$|R
