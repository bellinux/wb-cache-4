A user had to remove the ROM from its <b>socket,</b> <b>insert</b> the No-Slot Clock, and then reinsert the ROM chip {{into the top of}} the No-Slot Clock. The No-Slot Clock was both ProDOS and Dos 3.3 compatible, however a software driver had to be patched into ProDOS or integrated into the applicable DOS 3.3 program. Once the driver was installed it emulated the Thunderclock. The No-Slot Clock was usually installed in the following locations on the motherboard in the following computers: ...|$|E

Here we report a case of dislocation after hemiarthroplaty due to insufficiency {{fracture of}} the acetabulum. In our patient, insufficiency fracture of the ilium immediately above the acetabulum produced obvious evidence of compression and collapse that led to dislocation of the outer head of the femoral component. This patient had subsequently been treated with a cementless <b>socket</b> <b>inserted</b> into the fractured acetabulum.

2500|$|Both {{railroads and}} {{automakers}} wanted to eliminate theft and damage from vandalism and weather, thus reducing shipping costs. They {{also wanted to}} increase the number of vehicles carried per rail car for the same reason. Toward that end, in 1968 General Motors and the Southern Pacific Railroad jointly began work on development of a radical new rail car designed to carry the Chevrolet Vega, a new compact car being developed by GM. Known as [...] "Vert-A-Pac", the rail cars would hold 30 Vegas in a vertical, nose-down position, versus 18 in normal tri-level autoracks.

50|$|Slotkets {{were first}} created {{to allow the}} use of Socket 8 Pentium Pro {{processors}} on Slot 1 motherboards. Later, they became more popular for <b>inserting</b> <b>Socket</b> 370 Intel Celerons into Slot 1 based motherboards. This lowered costs for computer builders, especially with dual processor machines. High-end motherboards accepting two Slot 1 processors (usually Pentium 2) were widely available, but double-socketed motherboards for the less expensive Socket 370 Celerons were not. The slotkets remained popular in the transition period from Slot to Socket-based Pentium III processors by allowing CPU upgrades in existing Slot 1 motherboards.|$|R
50|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a <b>socket</b> tang, or <b>inserted</b> into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. In medieval Europe, arrowheads were often anchored with nothing but candlewax minutes before firing, if not merely saliva - this ensured that the head would remain in enemy's body if the shaft was pulled out. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using ferrule, sinew, rope, or wire.|$|R
50|$|Following the ZX81's release, a ZX81 8 KB ROM was {{available}} to upgrade the ZX80 {{at a cost of}} around 20% of a real ZX81. It came with a thin keyboard overlay and a ZX81 manual. Simply taking off the top cover of the ZX80 and prying the old ROM from its <b>socket</b> and carefully <b>inserting</b> the new ROM and adding the keyboard overlay, the ZX80 would now function almost identically to the proper ZX81 - except for SLOW mode, due to the differences in hardware between the two models. The process was easily reversed to get the ZX80 back to its old self.|$|R
40|$|A drive {{mechanism}} enables a socket-type wrench to rotate a shaft and prevents accidental {{rotation of the}} shaft when the wrench is not coupled to the shaft. In the original intended application, the shaft {{would be part of}} an attachment mechanism on a spacecraft, and the purpose to be served by the drive is to prevent back-driving of the shaft by launch vibrations while enabling an astronaut equipped with the appropriate wrench to actuate the shaft while in orbit. The design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which it is necessary to prevent rotational back-driving. The mechanism includes a gear near the tip of the shaft, and a drive nut that constitutes the tip of the shaft. The gear and drive nut are positioned in a recess in a housing. The recess is sized to receive the wrench socket that mates with the drive nut. Also contained in the housing are four linkages that include pins that are spring-loaded into engagement with the gear to prevent rotation of the shaft. When the wrench <b>socket</b> is <b>inserted</b> in the recess, it pushes on the linkages in such a manner as to disengage the pins from the gear...|$|R
40|$|Prosthetic socket liners {{provide both}} {{suspension}} and stability, {{and they do}} so best when they cover the remaining limb without breaks in the liner surface. This full coverage conflicts {{with the need to}} acquire myoelectric signals directly from the skin. Early solutions to this problem include windows in the liner and metal electrodes piercing and thereby weakening the liner. Windows compromise the integrity of the liner and often lead to discomfort {{at the edge of the}} window. Metal electrodes require attachment of external wires after donning. Another alternative is to mount cased electrodes in molded silicone receptacles. This may result in a proper seal, but it requires repeated removal of the electrode from the liner. The problems identified above can be addressed by passing the myoelectric signals directly though the liner with flexible Conductive Inserts. This approach allows metal electrodes in the outer socket to acquire the myoelectric signals as if they were in direct contact with the skin with no wires attached to the liner. LTI has developed Conductive Inserts that not only pass myoelectric signals through the liner but also allow for misalignment when the liner is <b>inserted</b> into the <b>socket.</b> These <b>Inserts</b> can be installed by prosthetic technicians in a commercial liner, or they can be built into a custom liner. With Inserts installed, a liner is a separate part that can be easily removed for cleaning...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{two-stage}} surgical {{approach for}} implant placement first documented in 1977 by Branemark, represents today the most used protocol for placing implants. AIM: Aim of this prospective case series {{study was to}} compare the clinical and radiological performance of 12 edentulous jaws treated with of a modified prosthetic and surgical protocol for 3 D software planning, guided surgery, immediate loading of implants inserted in edentulous jaws and extraction sockets and restored with Cad-Cam Zirconia and titanium full arch frameworks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This work {{was designed as a}} prospective case series study. Twelve patients have been consecutively rehabilitated with an immediately loaded implant supported fixed full prosthesis. A total of 72 implants, Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy; Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden) 26 of which were inserted in fresh extraction <b>sockets,</b> were <b>inserted.</b> Outcome measures were implants survival, radiographic marginal bone-levels and bone remodeling, soft tissue parameters and complications. RESULTS: All patients reached 24 months follow-up, and no patients dropped out from the study. The cumulative survival rate was 100 %; after 24 months mean marginal bone remodelling value was: 1. 35 +/- 0. 25, mean PPD value was 2. 75 +/- 0. 40 mm and mean BOP value was 3. 8 % +/- 1. 8 %. Only minor prosthetic complications were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These data seem to validate this surgical and prosthetic protocol with valid results when applied in selected cases...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The ABG I {{acetabular}} insert is an ultra {{high molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) component used in primary hip arthroplasty. Studies have shown early osteolysis and aseptic loosening of the ABG I uncemented cup compared with other implants. Theories advocate that loosening is initiated by the biological response to insert wear debris; wear volume and the distribution of particle size are considered to be important parameters. This study analysed explanted plastic inserts to identify any mechanical properties that may have contributed to early failure. Materials and Methods 21 ABG I acetabular components were revised due to aseptic loosening over a 16 month period. Silicone casts of the <b>insert</b> <b>sockets</b> were made and volumetric analysis performed using a shadowgraphing technique and a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The UHMWPE inserts were divided into uniform pieces with a diamond-tipped microsaw and analysed for hardness, wear, stress and strain properties using a microhardness tool, pin-on-plate analysis and small punch testing. We performed identical tests on explanted inserts from other manufacturers. Results We present the findings of the above tests and provide suggestions as to why these particular implants are more prone to early failure when compared with other common implants. We also discuss the results of volumetric analysis by shadowgraphing compared with CMM...|$|R
