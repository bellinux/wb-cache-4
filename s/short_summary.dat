5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened {{to come up}} with the design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 29, 1910. The film likely had a wide release, but another film {{of the same name}} was released by Società Anonima Ambrosio. The Ambrosio film {{was released on}} November 16, 1910, but several theater advertisements are ambiguous as to the film being shown. It is known that Ambroiso and Thanhouser films were sometimes shown together, as one Maryland theater advertisement shows, further complicating identification. The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph found the story to have a novel way of advertising a hotel, but noted the error in the photographer's attempt and result to photograph the mermaid. The Moving Picture World found the film to be an effective production, but spared few details and a <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> of the film. The most critical review came from The New York Dramatic Mirror which was neutral in its assessment of the production, but it provided a list of faults with the production that focused on continuity issues with action.|$|E
5|$|There are few contemporary, {{reliable}} sources about the battle, and most were produced by Poles. The {{most important and}} trustworthy source is Cronica conflictus Wladislai regis Poloniae cum Cruciferis anno Christi 1410, which was written {{within a year of}} the battle by an eyewitness. Its authorship is uncertain, but several candidates have been proposed: Polish deputy chancellor Mikołaj Trąba and Władysław II Jagiełło's secretary Zbigniew Oleśnicki. While the original Cronica conflictus did not survive, a <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> from the 16th century has been preserved. Another important source is Historiae Polonicae by Polish historian Jan Długosz (1415–1480). It is a comprehensive and detailed account written several decades after the battle. The reliability of this source suffers not only from the long gap between the events and the chronicle, but also Długosz's biases against the Lithuanians. Banderia Prutenorum is a mid-15th-century manuscript with images and Latin descriptions of the Teutonic battle flags captured during the battle and displayed in Wawel Cathedral and Vilnius Cathedral. Other Polish sources include two letters written by Władysław II Jagiełło to his wife Anne of Cilli and Bishop of Poznań Wojciech Jastrzębiec and letters sent by Jastrzębiec to Poles in the Holy See. German sources include a concise account in the chronicle of Johann von Posilge. A recently discovered anonymous letter, written between 1411 and 1413, provided important details on Lithuanian maneuvers.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} hailed Haruna as a comic heroine {{and a key}} to the series' appeal, but Kawahara's {{handling of}} the other chararacters was also praised, particularly with Yoh and his sister Asami. They also praised Haruna's relationship with Yoh, which is presented as a pairing of friends and equals. Some critics noted that the story's initial makeover theme was more deftly handled than a <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> led them to expect, though some still expressed reservations about it.|$|E

A translation did not emerge until 1870, when François Chabas published a translation and <b>short</b> <b>summary.</b> It was not until 1929, when Jaroslav Černý published an English language translation that Egyptologists began to take an interest in both the papyrus and the story of Paneb.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
25|$|Several {{government}} agencies provide budget data. These include the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Department. The CBO publishes The Budget and Economic Outlook in January, which covers a ten-year window and is typically updated in August. It also publishes a Long-Term Budget Outlook in July and a Monthly Budget Review. The OMB, {{which is responsible}} for organizing the President's budget presented in February, typically issues a budget update in July. The GAO and the Treasury issue Financial Statements of the U.S. Government, usually in the December following the close of the federal fiscal year, which occurs September 30. There is a corresponding Citizen's Guide, a <b>short</b> <b>summary.</b> The Treasury Department also produces a Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances each December for the preceding fiscal year, which provides detailed data on federal financial activities.|$|E

500|$|Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons was an {{immediate}} hit for Apogee: the company's previous sales levels had been around US$7,000 per month, but by Christmas Keen already had sales of almost US$30,000. Miller described the game as [...] "a little atom bomb" [...] to magazine editors and BBS controllers when asked about it, and recruited his mother and hired his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players. By June 1991, the game was bringing in over US$60,000 per month. Chris Parker of PC Magazine later in 1991 referred to the game's release as a [...] "tremendous success". A contemporary review by Barry Simon of PC Magazine praised the game's graphical capabilities as having a [...] "Nintendo feel", though he termed the graphics as [...] "well drawn" [...] but [...] "not spectacular" [...] in terms of resolution. He noted that the game was very much an arcade game that players would not purchase for [...] "its scintillating plot or ground-breaking originality", but said that all three episodes were very fun to play and that the scrolling graphics set it apart from similar games. A <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> of the trilogy in 1992 by PC World termed it [...] "one {{of the most spectacular}} games available" [...] and praised the [...] "superb" [...] sound and graphics, and a similar summary in CQ Amateur Radio described it as [...] "Nintendo comes to the PC" [...] and the [...] "best action/adventure game" [...] the reviewer had ever seen.|$|E

500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} <b>short</b> <b>summary</b> of the film, {{but it does}} not {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E
