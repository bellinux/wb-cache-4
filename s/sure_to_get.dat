25|$|The economy rate is more {{important}} in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team {{a better chance of}} finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when in the field is to bowl the opposition out and take all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a specific period of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} her death was recounted {{throughout}} Europe. Jules Verne mentioned her in Five Weeks in a Balloon and, in The Gambler, Fyodor Dostoevsky likened the thrill of committing oneself in gambling to the sensation that Blanchard must have felt as she fell. For others, her death proved a cautionary tale, either {{as an example of}} a woman exceeding her station (as with Grenville Mellen, who said that it proved [...] "a woman in a balloon is either out of her element or too high in it") or as the price of vanity for attempting such spectacular shows. Charles Dickens commented [...] "The jug goes often to the well, but is pretty <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> cracked at last". With the advent of powered flight, ballooning and Blanchard's story were relegated to the margins of aviation history. A novel inspired by Blanchard's story, Linda Donn's The Little Balloonist, was published in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the film's preview segment was mixed. Kotaku heavily {{praised the}} effects, {{undertone}} and music, {{stating that the}} staff loved it, though lamented that an official film of this kind would join {{a long line of}} [...] "ill-advised live-action adaptations". Game Informer called it [...] "absurd", stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake, and adding [...] "It looks goofy as hell, and Pokéfans are <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else." [...] ComicsAlliance called it [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] of presenting a better take on the franchise and a reminder that [...] "some intellectual properties got things right (or inherently wrong) the first time", though called the effect [...] "surprisingly competent" [...] and it both generally fun and funny.

500|$|Hall of Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 14 reviews. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly positively compared the album {{to the late}} 90's releases by Bad Boy and said that Big Sean easily outshines all the featured artists on the album. At USA Today, Edna Gunderson called this, an [...] "outstanding second album" [...] that he [...] "occasionally stumbles" [...] in an effort that is a [...] "smart set of slick club thumpers, tear-jerkers and introspective yarns." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented saying, [...] "The Detroit MC gets over on congeniality and crisp delivery, even when his lyrics are pro forma." [...] He also praised the album's production. At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff noted that [...] "Hall of Fame is still a solid, confident and diverse set that shows how much he's grown as both an MC and a writer since 'Finally Famous' came out in 2011." [...] Andrea Aguilar of HipHopDX summarized the album stating, [...] "As a whole, the feel-good album's set of eclectic beats doesn't disappoint, but it lacks diversity. Most of Sean's content still teems with predictable material risking leaving listeners disinterested. Random skits also slightly interrupt {{the flow of the}} album, but if you're looking for motivational music centered on the money, the cars, the clothes and hoes, this album is <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> plenty of replays on your iPod and local radio stations alike." ...|$|E

2500|$|ETFs have a {{wide range}} of liquidity. Some funds are {{constantly}} traded, with tens of millions of shares per day changing hands, while others trade only once in a while, even not trading for some days. There are many funds that do not trade very often. This just means that most trading is conducted in the most popular funds. The most active funds (such as SPY, IWM, QQQ, et cetera) are very liquid, with high volume and tight spreads. In these cases, the investor is almost <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a [...] "reasonable" [...] price, even in difficult conditions. With other funds, it is worthwhile to take some care in execution. This does not mean that less popular funds are not a quality investment. This is in contrast with traditional mutual funds, where everyone who trades on the same day gets the same price.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} {{about the history of}} American screenwriting, Marc Norman wrote that the Ince studio, where Sullivan was the lead writer, was the first to use the {{screenplay}} as the blueprint for the entire production, marking a departure from earlier productions in which the [...] "screenplay" [...] was simply [...] "a one-page précis of the film's narrative." [...] Indeed, Sullivan's scripts detailed locations, the number of actors, costumes, and even the blocking of the shoot. [...] Norman pointed to the following excerpt from the Hell's Hinges script {{as an example of the}} directorial detail contained in Sullivan's work:"SCENE L: Close-Up on Bar in Western SaloonA group of good western types of the earlier period are drinking at the bar and talking idly -- much good fellowship prevails and every man feels at ease with his neighbor -- one of them glances off the picture and the smile fades from his face to be replaced by the strained look of worry -- the others notice the change and follow his gaze -- their face reflect his own emotions -- be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over a good contrast between the easy good nature that had prevailed and the unnatural, strained silence that follows -- as they look, cut." ...|$|E
