40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{and study}} the following problem and its further generalizations: given two finite collections of <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> a normed space, find a ball whose center lies in a given constraint set with the smallest radius that encloses all <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first collection and intersects all <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second one. This problem {{can be considered as}} a generalized version of the Sylvester smallest enclosing circle problem introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19 th century by Sylvester which asks for the circle of smallest radius enclosing a given set of finite points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane. We also consider a generalized version of the Fermat-Torricelli problem: given two finite collections of <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> a normed space, find a point in a given constraint set that minimizes the sum of the farthest distances to <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first collection and shortest distances (distances) to <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second collection...|$|R

5|$|Ninja Gaiden is <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game {{world of}} the Dead or Alive series. Located mainly in Japan and the fictional Vigoor Empire, the game draws on Heian period {{structures}} for its Japanese locales—a ninja fortress and village <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains. In contrast the Vigoor Empire, with its capital city of Tairon, {{is a blend of}} architectural types from around the world. European-style buildings display Arabic lettering, and the monastery in Tairon exhibits Gothic influences with a vaulted hall, pointed arches, and large stained glass windows. A hidden underground level features statues with the heads of cats, walls covered with carvings, hieroglyphics, Aztec pyramid and a labyrinth. This mix of styles was the result of Itagaki's deliberate refusal to constrain the game's creative process.|$|E

This fact has a complexity consequence — it follows that the problem of determining the clique number of an intersection graph of convex <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane is NP-hard.
