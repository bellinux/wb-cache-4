This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Non-contact interaction between two parallel flat surfaces {{is a central}} paradigm in sciences. This situation is {{the starting point for}} a wealth of different models: the capacitor description in electrostatics, hydrodynamic flow, thermal exchange, the Casimir force, direct contact study, third body confinement such as liquids or films of soft condensed matter. The control of parallelism is so demanding that no versatile single force machine in this geometry has been proposed so far. Using a combination of nanopositioning based on inertial motors, of microcrystal shaping with a focused-ion beam (FIB) and of accurate in situ and real-time control of <b>surface</b> <b>parallelism</b> with X-ray diffraction, we propose here a ‘‘gedanken’ ’ surface-force machine that should enable one to measure interaction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{present in}} this paper a {{discrete}} problem of constructing some parametric <b>surfaces</b> with <b>parallelism</b> conditions from some given Lagrangean data. We consider the problem of fitting some scattered points with a surface pseudo-parallel to a given reference surface in a finite element space. Some convergence results are shown. Finally, we analyze some graphical examples {{in order to prove}} the validity and the effectiveness of this method...|$|R

To define and know this characteristic of machine tools standard measuring procedures {{have been used}} for many years. Yet, others more advanced approaches and equipments, like laser measuring systems, are also available for measuring machine parameters like straightness of movements, repeatability, <b>surfaces</b> flatness, <b>parallelism</b> etc. This paper shows comparison of measuring results and measuring procedure between two different laser measuring systems, Damalini D 525 and Renishaw ML 10. Measurements are performed on DMU monoBlock 60, CNC universal milling machine. Same type of measurements, straightness measurement of main shaft movement in Y direction, is performed simultaneously by means of both of the laser systems. Results presented in this paper shows that there are differences in between measuring results as well as in between measuring procedures for selected lasers. Hence, the correct choice of measuring device in that sense can save time and decrease costs of machine maintenance. Index Terms—Laser, laser application, measurements I...|$|R
40|$|Affine {{deformations}} {{serve as}} basic {{examples in the}} continuum mechanics of deformable 3 -dimensional bodies (referred as homogeneous deformations). They preserve parallelism and are often used as an approximation to general deformations. However, when the deformable body is a membrane, a shell or an interface modeled by a <b>surface,</b> the <b>parallelism</b> {{is defined by the}} affine connection of this surface. In this work we study the infinitesimally affine time - dependent deformations (motions) after establishing formulas for the variation of the connection, but in the more general context of hypersurfaces of a Riemannian manifold. We prove certain equivalent formulas expressing the variation of the connection in terms of geometrical quantities related to the variation of the metric, as expected, or in terms of mechanical quantities related to the kinematics of the moving continuum. The latter is achieved using an adapted version of polar decomposition theorem, frequently used in continuum mechanics to analyze the motion. Also, we apply our results to special motions like tangential and normal motions. Further, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for this variation to be zero (infinitesimal affine motions), giving insight on the form of the motions and the kind of hypersurfaces that allow such motions. Finally, we give some specific examples of mechanical interest which demonstrate motions that are infinitesimally affine but not infinitesimally isometric. Comment: 22 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|An {{enhanced}} {{version of}} the flexure-based microgap rheometer (FMR) is described which enables rheological measurements in steady state shearing flows of bulk fluid samples of PDMS with an absolute gap separation between the shearing surfaces of loo nm- 100 mu m. Alignment of the shearing <b>surfaces</b> to a <b>parallelism</b> better then 10 (- 7) rad allows us to reliably measure shear stresses at shear rates up to 10 (4) s(- 1) At low rates and for shearing gaps < 5 mu m the stress response is dominated by sliding friction between the surfaces that is independent of the viscosity of the fluid and only determined by the residual particulate phase (dust particles) in the fluid. This behaviour {{is similar to the}} boundary lubrication regime in tribology. The absolute gap control of the FMR allows us to systematically investigate the flow behaviour at low degrees of confinement (gap separations too nm- 2 mu m) that cannot be accessed with conventional (controlled normal load) tribological test protocols. status: publishe...|$|R
