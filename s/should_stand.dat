5|$|A {{petition}} {{was presented}} to UK Home Secretary Jack Straw in 1998 asking for the witches to be pardoned, but {{it was decided that}} their convictions <b>should</b> <b>stand.</b> Ten years later another petition was organised in an attempt to obtain pardons for Chattox and Demdike. It followed the Swiss government's pardon earlier that year of Anna Göldi, beheaded in 1782, thought to be the last person in Europe to be executed as a witch.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E

5|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the album came from Madonna's exploration of other cultures and art, literature, and music, referencing them in the songs. She believed that the tracks <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> on their own, so that one could sing them accompanied with just a guitar. Madonna {{enlisted the help of}} her daughter Lourdes and son Rocco, calling them her A advisers. They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E
5|$|He {{would carry}} the day after federal {{prosecutors}} appealed for an en banc rehearing by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction <b>should</b> <b>stand.</b> The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child pornography and not sought to affect his predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) {{to do so in}} any way.|$|E
5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with a tap.|$|E

5|$|Only {{a single}} known {{case of fraud}} {{involving}} a record submitted to BBRC has become public. In autumn 1994, Nigel Pepper, a birdwatcher from Essex, claimed to have recorded a hermit thrush in a garden in Chipping Ongar. Doubts about the record were raised in Birdwatch and BBRC reviewed the record in 2002, but decided that it <b>should</b> <b>stand.</b> In 2009, Pepper revealed in Birdwatch magazine (Birdwatch 204: 46-47) that the record was a deception, made in protest at perceived secrecy surrounding rare birds in the county.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> {{ready to}} {{increase}} Canadian assistance to Sri Lanka {{in collaboration with}} other partners, as on-the-ground assessments and capacity to absorb warrant, not only for relief purposes but also for development and reconstruction.

5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} determine whether they <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the scatter}} plots of Fig.  5 do not reveal any narrow stand stage which is optimal for fertilization, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that very young stands or dense mature <b>stands</b> <b>should</b> not be fertilized. Dense mature <b>stands</b> <b>should</b> be thinned before fertilization. Young <b>stands</b> <b>should</b> be left to continue growing until the trees are near saw-log sized. This makes it possible to harvest a part of the volume increment as saw log, which is much more valuable than pulpwood.|$|R

5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to something and then let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, <b>should</b> <b>stand.</b> Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship <b>should</b> <b>stand.</b> De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{gained an}} early victory when the Court of Appeals {{ruled that the}} Nelson County vote <b>should</b> <b>stand.</b> The final result of the election, however, would {{be decided by the}} Board of Elections, created by the Goebel Election Law. Newspapers across the state, both Democratic and Republican, called for the board's {{decision}} to be accepted as final. Tensions grew as the date for the board's hearings drew near, and small bands of armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky began to arrive in Frankfort, the state capital. Just before the board's decision was announced, the number of armed mountain men was estimated at 500. Although the board was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to let the announced vote tally stand. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Democrats were outraged; party leaders met on December 14 and called on Goebel and Beckham to contest the election. Goebel had been inclined to let the result stand and seek a seat in the U. S. Senate in 1901, but he heeded the wishes of his party's leaders and contested the board's decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} {{by a team}} consisting of Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Nishi acted as the music director, while orchestration was handled by Mitsuda and his studio assistant Natsumi Kameoka. Early in the game's development, Sakurai and Nishi were in discussions about what the style of Uprisings music would be, and which composers to hire for it. The composers were those who had contributed most prominently to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The music involved both live orchestral music, synthesized tracks, and tracks that combined both musical styles. The air battle themes were created to match the dialogue and action on-screen, which was stated early on {{to be an important}} goal. Another aspect of the music, as noted by Koshiro, was that it <b>should</b> <b>stand</b> out while not interfering with dialogue. Sakuraba and Koshiro were brought in fairly early, and thus encountered difficulties with creating their music. Sakuraba recalled that he needed to rewrite the opening theme multiple times after his first demo clashed with the footage he saw due to his not knowing much about the game's world. Takada came on board when there was an ample amount of footage, but was shocked when he saw gameplay from the game's fifth chapter and tried to create suitable music within Sakurai's guidelines.|$|E
