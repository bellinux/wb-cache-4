25|$|Lopes {{began dating}} Atlanta Falcons American {{football}} player Andre Rison {{shortly after the}} release of Oooohhh... On the TLC Tip, and by 1994 the two were living together in Rison's upscale double-story home. Their relationship was allegedly filled with violent moments, and Lopes filed an assault charge against Rison on September 2, 1993. Rison denied battering her. Lopes was also battling alcoholism at the time. She had been a heavy drinker since the age of fifteen. After another fight between the couple {{in the early morning hours}} of June 9, 1994, Lopes tossed numerous pairs of Rison's newly purchased shoes into a bathtub, doused them with lighter fluid, and lit them on fire. The fiberglass bathtub quickly melted and set the <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> of the house on fire. Lopes was arrested and indicted on charges of first-degree arson; she was sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine. Rison eventually reconciled with Lopes, and they continued dating on and off for seven years.|$|E
25|$|Edo {{suffered}} badly from devastating {{fires and}} the 1657 Great Fire of Meireki {{was a turning}} point in urban design. Initially, as a method of reducing fire spread, the government built stone embankments in at least two locations along rivers in the city. Over time these were torn down and replaced with dōzō storehouses that were used both as fire breaks and to store goods unloaded from the canals. The dōzō were built with a <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> made of timber coated with a number of layers of earthen plaster on the walls, door and roof. Above the earthen roofs was a timber framework supporting a tiled roof. Although Japanese who had studied with the Dutch at their settlement in Dejima advocated building with stone and brick this was not undertaken because of their vulnerability to earthquakes. Machiya and storehouses from the later part of the period are characterised by having a black coloration to the external plaster walls. This colour was made by adding India ink to burnt lime and crushed oyster shell.|$|E

25|$|Further explosions by {{two more}} torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side (near frame 82 and about frame 85) {{less than two}} minutes later at about 0205 caused catastrophic and {{terminal}} damage. Men were thrown about twice with each following explosion and the force was greater the higher up in the ship's structure. This is the time that Carpenter was injured. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> damage caused the ship to twist and jackknife around the damaged area. The ship's momentum quickly fell off and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port sinking first. It dragged the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. Men quickly realized that the damage was fatal and began to abandon ship. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sunk, at about 0225. In the meantime, Carpenter - who had been wounded in the legs - and others of the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving lift rafts into the ocean. Even though the forward momentum of the ship dropped off rapidly the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle. Later currents would separate them even more.|$|E

40|$|Multi-storey {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> represent {{some of the}} most congested structural elements. Placing and consolidating concrete in such <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> imposes substantial challenges. This offers a unique area of application for self-consolidating concrete (SCC) because of its inherent ability to flow under its own weight and fill congested sections, complicated formwork and hard-to-reach areas. Research is, however, needed to demonstrate the ability of SCC <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> adequately to resist vertical and lateral loads. In the present study, full-scale 3 m high beam-column joints reinforced as per the Canadian Standards CSA A 23 · 3 - 94 and ACI- 352 R- 02 were made with normal concrete (NC) and SCC. They were tested under reversed cyclic loading applied at the beam tip and at a constant axial load applied on the column. The beam–column joint specimens were instrumented with linear variable displacement transducers and strain gauges to determine load–displacement traces, cumulative dissipated energy and secant stiffness. The current paper compares the performance of reinforced NC and SCC <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> and discusses the potential use of SCC in such structural elements. Results indicate that reducing the coarse aggregate content in SCC mixtures can reduce the contribution of the aggregate interlock mechanism to total shear resistance, which leads to more rapid deterioration under cyclic loading. Further research is needed {{to ensure the safety of}} using low coarse aggregate content in SCC in highly seismic areas and assess the safety of already existing buildings cast using SCC...|$|R

500|$|The {{construction}} of the Woolworth Building was announced in 1910 by Frank Woolworth, who wanted to create the largest income-producing property in the U.S. The project grew, and Woolworth finally opted for a 55-story, [...] high skyscraper, the latest tallest building in the world, {{at a cost of}} $13.5 million ($5.1 billion in 2010 terms). Architect Cass Gilbert designs included a very high proportion of usable – and thus rentable – floor space, {{with a great deal of}} light and a flexible floor plan that could be subdivided for different tenants. Up-to-date fittings were installed to encourage a high-class of tenants, including the world's fastest elevators, safety features, and a swimming pool. Gilbert adopted the Beaux-Arts style, using accented terracotta and glass to emphasis vertical lines, elegantly echoing the <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> underneath and incorporating 15th and 16th century Flamboyant Gothic-styled features. It was capped by a gilded tower that blended into the sky behind it to produce an illusion of even greater height. The building was illuminated with floodlights at night, topped with red and white flashing lights. It was famously dubbed the [...] "Cathedral of Commerce", rather to Gilbert's displeasure as he had attempted to avoid copying ecclesiastical architecture.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{grasses and}} straw {{have been in}} use {{in a range of}} ways in {{building}} since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular bales seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of Nebraska, where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality sods) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders.

This paper first discusses the design wind load levels for <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> and for cladding and components. Next, the design wind loads of scaffolds for building construction, those of buildings in the construction stage, and those of so-called “temporary” structures such as site offices are discussed. In Japan, the design wind load for scaffolds is defined as 1 -year-recurrence wind load, because its average setting period at one construction site is around 6 months, but this paper clearly proves the inappropriateness of this design wind load estimation concept. Then, it is shown {{that there is no}} relation between the design wind load level and its lifetime at an individual site. Finally, even for the design wind load for main <b>structural</b> <b>frames,</b> it is clearly demonstrated that the design load level {{may not be able to}} be determined based on the lifetime of an individual building. Therefore, although the LCC concept is applied in design load estimation, it is strongly recommended that the optimal design load level should be decided considering total LCC for the city or nation as a whole, and treat design as involving a group of buildings, rather than attempting to optimize the LCC of individual buildings.
