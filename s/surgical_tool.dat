40|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} a form of {{minimally}} invasive surgery (MIS) that has been an important advancement in modern medicine. MIS has been shown to reduce postoperative pain, recovery time, and has improved cosmetic outcomes. A naturally evolved form of laparoscopic surgery is laparo-endoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery where all the laparoscopic instruments are introduced through a single incision made at the patient’s navel. Even though there are benefits, both present a steep learning curve for new surgeons. A response to these challenges is the application of surgical robotics. One robotic-LESS (R-LESS) platform is LouBot- 1. 0, a two-armed robot, developed in the Advanced Surgical Technologies Laboratory at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Although they ease surgical procedures, the robotic platforms themselves have their own set of limitations. One is the exchanging of surgical instruments. It is advantageous for the process to be as streamlined as possible during surgery to reduce errors and operating time. This thesis explains the design of a tool-exchange system for LouBot- 1. 0. It uses a laparoscopic tool-exchanger that is inserted through a surgical trocar to [un]mount modular <b>surgical</b> <b>tools.</b> The laparoscopic tool-exchanger has a 0. 57 -inch (14. 5 -mm) outer diameter profile, an elbow, and a set of jaws to hold the modular <b>surgical</b> <b>tools.</b> Four modular <b>surgical</b> <b>tools</b> were developed: a grasper, a pair of scissors, a monopolar hook, and a bipolar grasper. The tools have a 3 / 8 -inch outer diameter, are about 1. 7 inches in length, and share the same modular base exterior. A modular robotic forearm was also designed to accept the <b>surgical</b> <b>tools.</b> It uses a push-to-connect mechanism to fix or release the <b>surgical</b> <b>tools.</b> Apart from rotating and actuating, the forearm also supplies electrical power to the tools to perform either monopolar or bipolar cautery if needed. The thesis is structured to report on the design and bench-top results of the laparoscopic tool-exchanger first, then the modular <b>surgical</b> <b>tools,</b> and lastly the modular robotic forearm. Conclusions on the overall tool-exchange system are given at the end. Advisor: Carl A. Nelso...|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} a thermal plasma {{with the ability}} to both cut and {{coagulate}} tissue lie in the early studies by the late John Glover {{and his colleagues at the}} Indiana University in the mid 1970s. Glover and his team described the first plasma scalpel and compared this to the use of the steel scalpel and electrosurgery. Although effective as a <b>surgical</b> <b>tool,</b> this relatively simple two electrode handpiece device involved a relatively high gas flow and in early pre-clinical and clinical use there was evidence of argon gas in the circulation with the concomitant risk of gas embolism. No subsequent development ensued and no commercially available system arose from this early work.|$|E

50|$|Laparoscopic {{appendectomy}} {{has become}} an increasingly prevalent intervention for acute appendicitis since its introduction in 1983. This surgical procedure consists of making three to four incisions in the abdomen, each 0.25 to 0.5 in long. This type of appendectomy is made by inserting a special <b>surgical</b> <b>tool</b> called laparoscope {{into one of the}} incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a monitor outside the person's body and it is designed to help the surgeon to inspect the infected area in the abdomen. The other two incisions are made for the specific removal of the appendix by using surgical instruments. Laparoscopic surgery requires general anesthesia, and it can last up to two hours. Laparoscopic appendectomy has several advantages over open appendectomy, including a shorter post-operative recovery, less post-operative pain, and lower superficial surgical site infection rate. However, the occurrence of intra-abdominal abscess is almost three times more prevalent in laparoscopic appendectomy than open appendectomy.|$|E
50|$|They {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} stereotactic high-energy proton irradiation in goats {{resulting in a}} seminal publication in Nature in 1958. This technique was also applied in a few patients with Parkinson's disease (pallidotomy), psychiatric disorder (capsulotomy) and pain (mesencephalotomy). Although precisely placed and well-limited lesions could be produced by the focused proton beams, as demonstrated in a few autopsy cases, the synchrocyclotron proved to be too complicated for general clinical use. This compelled Leksell to consider other radiation sources and he started designing the cobalt-60 gamma unit, which was fully integrated with the stereotactic system. The development of the ‘‘beam-knife’’ took place after Leksell had been appointed successor to Olivecrona in 1960 and the first unit was inaugurated in 1967. Later the same year reports of the two first cases, patients with cancer related pain subjected to radiosurgical thalamotomy, were published. Originally, radiosurgery and the gamma unit were developed {{with the hope that}} it would offer a bloodless, and less risky, method to be applied principally in functional neurosurgery, for example in thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, Leksell had always considered his sterotactic instrument a <b>surgical</b> <b>tool</b> that should also be utilized in general neurosurgery in order to enhance precision and minimize hazards. This idea had to some extent been realized by the extensive use of stereotactic technique in puncturing cysts and also in performing biopsies in critical regions. The gamma unit soon proved to be useful in the treatment of some diseases previously requiring neurosurgery, such as pituitary adenomas, acoustic neurinomas and arteriovenous malformations. This use of radiosurgery has revolutionized the management of these conditions but was met with skepticism from the neurosurgical community.|$|E
