Kuakini saw me and <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him.

500|$|Manson {{recorded}} his vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November 2008 and his January 5, 2009 birthday. He described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, and his later relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood, explaining: [...] "Some of the things I say here, it's sad to say them—they're relationship-destroying statements. Some of it is stuff I should have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E
500|$|An album {{including}} all 14 {{songs in the}} episode, with Christophe Beck's scores for three other Buffy episodes, was released by Rounder Records in September 2002 as season seven premiered.

AllMusic gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is [...] "every bit as fun as the episode itself", praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> backside, 'Nancy, I want to introduce you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..."

[...] Arnell initially disliked the song [...] "Dumb Head", later saying in an interview:I <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> manager, [...] "I'm {{not so sure about}} this song."

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Tijerina was first {{encouraged}} to divert his religious energy into politics. After a sermon in Dallas one day, a man invited him home for lunch.

What the Spanish-American people need is a Spanish-American politician, you may be that … you should study law and history and help your people.'" [...] In June 1956, Tijerina and a few bravos went to Monero, New Mexico, to visit a community that had previously welcomed him. [...] There he learned about land grants, a controversial issue regarding Hispanic property rights. [...] Zebedeo Martínez, Zebedeo Valdez, and other elderly men, all members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, shared the story of how their families were dispossessed of their lands. [...] The next day, they took Tijerina's group to Chama, Tierra Amarilla, and Ensenada to meet with other unhappy heirs.|$|E
2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved."

In an interview Jessie J stated that she wrote her first song, [...] "Big White Room", at the age of 17, about when she was in hospital, at 11 years old. A ward mate of hers, a little boy, died. She recalls waking up in the middle of the night and seeing him praying, and her mother explaining that he was having an operation the next day and was asking God to save him. [...] "He died the next day so I <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mum 'but God didn't save him'. I was so angry and it really confused me.

2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer and I think she was eager {{for me to go}} into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother, 'Are you letting that girl go to that awful place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
2500|$|Midrash {{identified}} the Melchizedek of [...] with Noah's son Shem. The Rabbis taught that Melchizedek {{acted as a}} priest and handed down Adam's robes to Abraham.

[...] But then Melchizedek gave precedence in his blessing to Abram over God, and thus God decided to bring forth the priesthood from Abram. As [...] reports, [...] "And he (Melchizedek/Shem) blessed him (Abram), and said: 'Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; and blessed be God the Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.'" [...] Abram replied to Melchizedek/Shem by questioning whether the blessing of a servant should be given precedence over that of the master. And straightaway, God gave the priesthood to Abram, as [...] says, [...] "The Lord (God) <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Lord (Abram), Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool," [...] which is followed in [...] by, [...] "The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, 'You (Abram) are a priest for ever, after the order (dibrati) of Melchizedek,'" [...] meaning, [...] "because of the word (dibbur) of Melchizedek." [...] Hence [...] says, [...] "And he (Melchizedek/Shem) was the priest of the most high God," [...] implying that Melchizedek/Shem was a priest, but not his descendants.|$|E
