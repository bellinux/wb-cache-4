5|$|With the {{prospects}} of {{a link between the}} navigation and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the sole proprietor from 1804, having bought out his <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner.</b> Throughout its life, the navigation had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, to make it an open navigation, where anyone could use it on payment of the appropriate tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E
25|$|Waterproof {{mattress}} pads {{are used}} {{in some cases to}} ease clean-up of bedwetting incidents, however they only protect the mattress, and the sheets, bedding or <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner</b> may be soiled.|$|E
25|$|A {{grinding}} or tapping noise during sleep, sometimes {{detected by}} a partner or a parent. This noise can be surprisingly loud and unpleasant, and can wake a <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner.</b> Noises are rarely associated with awake bruxism.|$|E

5000|$|In 1989, {{turnover}} {{increased to}} approximately 62 million DM. Lamy had begun taking on employees as <b>sleeping</b> <b>partners.</b> Approximately {{one third of}} the then 400-person workforce became <b>sleeping</b> <b>partners.</b> In that year, Lamy established contacts with East Germany and planned to do business there as well as in West Germany. 1991 held an increase in staff and turnover again, this time to 85 million DM and five hundred staff. Lamy invested in their [...] "innovation workshop" [...] in Heidelberg, in 1996, along with approximate expected turnover being 113 million DM. 1999 showed Lamy reporting stable turnover of approximately 120 million DM, though domestic demand has fallen.|$|R
25|$|Diagnosis of obstructive {{sleep apnea}} is {{significantly}} more common among people in relationships, who are alerted to their condition by being informed by their <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner</b> since individuals with {{obstructive sleep apnea}} are often unaware of the condition. There is a stigma associated with loud snoring, {{and it is not}} considered a feminine trait. Consequently, females {{are less likely to be}} told by their partners that they snore, or to admit it to themselves or doctors. Furthermore, CPAP is also perceived negatively by females, and less likely to be utilized to its full extent in this group.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner</b> of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 Howerd recorded, with June Whitfield, {{a comedy}} {{version of the}} song [...] "Je t'aime", made famous by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, in which she {{featured}} as [...] "Mavis" [...] alongside Howerd's [...] "Frank", and a third unexplained <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner</b> named [...] "Arthur". The song {{was included in the}} 2004 CD re-issue of Oh! What a Carry On!.|$|E
50|$|These {{are where}} {{one or more}} general {{partners}} enter or allow limited partners to go into business with them.

50|$|Warner's stage debut came in It's Never Too Late to Mend {{when he was}} 21. He went on to act in {{a number}} of plays before coming to the United States for the 1905-1906 season. His Broadway credits include Silence (1924), You and I (1922), Danger (1921), <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Partners</b> (1918), Out There (1917), and Blackbirds (1912).|$|R
25|$|After the War, Hoare {{became the}} manager of a fleet of fishing {{trawlers}} owned by Sam Robford & Co, a business based in Aberdeen. In 1926, Robin Hoare, in partnership with Lieutenant Commanders Sydney Allen and Lionell Chappell, took an interest in the Honister Slate Mine in Borrowdale, Cumbria: Hoare became the Resident Director while his colleagues became <b>sleeping</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The pose of Venus had {{precedents}} in {{a well-known}} classical relief called il letto di Polyclito (the Bed of Polyclitus), where the female is Psyche (though in the 16th century {{thought to be}} Venus with Vulcan). [...] She sits on a bed containing her <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner,</b> and twists round to see him, supporting herself {{on the bed with}} one arm, and lifting the covers with the other. Titian had various opportunities to see versions or copies of this very well-known composition. [...] It had already been used by Raphael's workshop in their frescos in the Villa Farnesina in Rome, for Hebe in the Feast of the Gods. [...] Giulio Romano had used it in the Palazzo del Tè in Mantua, for a Baachus and Ariadne. [...] Titian rarely comes so close to quoting another work.|$|E

500|$|Harries {{formed a}} {{production}} company called <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Partners</b> with Greengrass {{in the latter}} part of the decade, which produced Ross's The Incredibly Strange Film Show and comedian Lenny Henry's Lenny Live and Unleashed film. The latter was directed by Harries and was edited together from a number of performances by Henry at the Hackney Empire in 1989. The Guardians film critic called the direction [...] "unobtrusive".|$|R
5000|$|Bordoni {{made her}} Broadway debut in a Shubert {{brothers}} production of Broadway to Paris at the Winter Garden Theatre {{and was a}} successor to Anna Held as Broadway's idea of French piquancy and Continental flavor. [...] She was in Miss Information (1915) and successive productions of Hitchy-Koo (1917 and 1918). 1919 audiences saw Bordoni in <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Partners</b> co-starring with H. B. Warner at the Bijou. [...] In 1920 her [...] "captivating voice and presence" [...] graced As You Were at the Central Theater.|$|R
50|$|After the {{expiration}} of his articles Hargrove returned to Knaresborough, but in 1813 he purchased, with two partners, the York Herald, then a weekly newspaper. He moved to York, {{and the first}} number of the York Herald under his management was published on 13 July 1813. For the next 35 years he edited the paper. He added to the staff a reporter, and engaged a correspondent in nearly every town in Yorkshire. Hargrove subsequently bought the shares {{in the business of}} his two <b>sleeping</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was, however, a {{very large}} and {{important}} firm in Liverpool which was deeply interested {{in the life of}} Colonel Green, for he had long been a <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner</b> of the firm, and had, during a course of years, become so deeply indebted to it that the other partners were beginning to feel uneasy about him. Messrs. Wentworth and Hodge would have given a good deal to have got rid of their <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner,</b> but Colonel Green cared not a straw for Wentworth, nor a fig for Hodge, so he went on in his own way until the Swordfish was wrecked, when he went the way of all flesh, and Wentworth and Hodge discovered that, whatever riches he, Colonel Green, might at one time have possessed, he left nothing behind him except a number of heavy debts.|$|E

"You didn't {{suspect that}} while the firm helped the Dictator, I, its <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner,</b> gave Warren a check for the rebels, and I'd {{like to think that}} every {{cartridge}} my money bought accounted for one of the brutes who flog women to death and burn Indians at the stake when the revenue falls off." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Jones was a meek man, {{with a red}} {{nose and}} a humble aspect. He was a {{confidential}} clerk, and much respected by the firm of Sudberry and Company. In fact, it was generally understood that the business could not get on without him. His caution was a most salutary counteractive to Mr Sudberry's recklessness. As for [...] "Co," [...] he was a <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner,</b> and an absolute nonentity.|$|E

Their one return to musical comedy, Cash on Delivery (1917), confirmed the public's preference for comedy revues and music hall. Hicks continued to write light, escapist comedies, such as The Happy Day (1916), <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Partners</b> (1917) and, after the war, satiric farces, such as Good Luck and Head Over Heels (1923) and adaptations of French farces (The Man in Dress Clothes).|$|R

6000|$|... "Great {{men should}} think of Opportunity, {{and not of}} Time. Time is the excuse of feeble and puzzled spirits.

50|$|Hicks formed his own {{production}} company in 1923. The same year, {{he made his}} director's début, alongside Alfred Hitchcock, in Always Tell Your Wife although no director was credited on film itself. He wrote the screenplay for this, {{as well as for}} several films in the early 1930s. Hicks directed two more films: <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Partners</b> in 1930 and Glamour in 1931. Later notable films included The Lambeth Walk in 1939 and Busman's Honeymoon in 1940. He made his last supporting role in Silent Dust shortly before his death in 1949.|$|R
25|$|In some societies, people {{sleep with}} at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals. In other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except for an {{intimate}} partner. In almost all societies, <b>sleeping</b> <b>partners</b> are strongly regulated by social standards. For example, a person might only sleep with the immediate family, the extended family, a spouse or romantic partner, children, children of a certain age, children of specific gender, peers of a certain gender, friends, peers of equal social rank, or with no one at all. Sleep may be an actively social time, depending on the sleep groupings, with no constraints on noise or activity.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fifth is," [...] I went on, [...] "that such an {{expedition}} to succeed would need {{a great deal of}} money, more than you or I could find. Partners would be wanted, active or <b>sleeping,</b> but <b>partners</b> with cash." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a proud {{day for the}} ex-medical student when {{he first}} entered the counting-house of the African firm and {{realized}} {{that he was one of}} the governing powers in that busy establishment. Tom Dimsdale's mind was an intensely practical one, and although he had found the study of science an irksome matter, he was able to throw himself into business with uncommon energy and devotion. The clerks soon found that the sunburnt, athletic-looking young man intended to be anything but a <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner,</b> and both they and old Gilray respected him accordingly.|$|E
60|$|As {{the reader}} is aware, his sole motive in consenting to become, as it were, a <b>sleeping</b> <b>partner</b> in the shameful plot, of which his {{innocent}} daughter was the object, was to obtain possession of his lost inheritance, and it now {{occurred to him that}} even should that plot succeed, which he very greatly doubted, nothing had as yet been settled as to the terms upon which it was to be reconveyed to him. The whole affair was excessively repugnant to him: indeed, he regarded the prospect of its success with little less than terror, only his greed over-mastered his fear.|$|E

While making that film, Hicks fired the director and hired an unknown young director to make his debut: Alfred Hitchcock. Hicks directed <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Partners</b> (1930) and Glamour (1931).
