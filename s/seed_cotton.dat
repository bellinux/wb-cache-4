The city of Madurai lies on the flat and fertile plain of the river Vaigai, which runs in the northwest-southeast direction through the city, dividing it into two almost equal halves. The Sirumalai and Nagamalai hills lie {{to the north and}} west of Madurai. The land in and around Madurai is utilised largely for agricultural activity, which is fostered by the Periyar Dam. Madurai lies southeast of the western ghats, and the surrounding region occupies the plains of South India and contains several mountain spurs. The soil type in central Madurai is predominantly clay loam, while red loam and black cotton types are widely prevalent in the outer fringes of the city. Paddy is the major crop, followed by pulses, millet, oil <b>seed,</b> <b>cotton</b> and sugarcane.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{production}} in Pakistan {{is integral to}} the economic development of the country. The nation is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and the crop {{has been given a}} principal status in the country. Cotton is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land during the monsoon months of May to August, known as the kharif period, and is grown at a smaller scale between February and April. Record production of cotton was reported at 15 million bales of [...] each in the form of phutti (<b>seed</b> <b>cotton)</b> during 2014–15, which was an 11% rise compared to the previous season (2013–14). Production-wise, as of 2012–13, Pakistan occupied the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world, the first three being China, India and the United States, in that order. In respect of exports of raw cotton, Pakistan holds third position, and is the fourth in consumption (about 30 and 40 per cent of its production). It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{serves as}} the base for the nation's {{industrial}} sector. Production of cotton was reported at a record high of 15 million bales of 470 lbs each {{in the form of}} phutti (<b>seed</b> <b>cotton)</b> during 2014–15; this [...] was an 11% increase compared to the previous season (2013–14). Its phenomenal growth was from 1.38 million bales in 1961 to 11.138 million bales in 2014, with the estimated 2014–15 figures showing a further increase to 15 million bales. Between 1980–81 and 1990–91, the growth in production was rapid, with production rising from 0.70 million to 2.2 million tonnes, which was called the [...] "magic year" [...] of Pakistan's cotton industry. This was attributed to better pest control measures, use of improved seed types and increased use of fertilisers. The cotton and textile industries are integrated and account for 1,000 ginneries, 425 textile mills, and 300 cottonseed crushers and oil refiners. Cotton hybrids, created by crossing the Bt gene into traditional varieties, have been developed by local firms dealing with seeds. In Sindh province cotton is grown in more than one million acres in the districts of Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Mirpur Khas, Naushero Feroz, Sanghar, Badin, Sukkar, Ghotki, Tharparkar, Thatta and Umar Kot.|$|E

The research carried out showed that planting of cotton in {{the second week of}} April is the best choice for achieving higher production. The delaying in planting time results in the successive decrease in yield. Genotypes CIM-608 produced higher yield over CIM-620 and Cyto-124. Application of 200 kg N ha-1 to non Bt. cotton gave non significant increase in <b>seed</b> <b>cotton</b> yield over 150 kg N ha-1. The research findings showed that planting of transgenic cotton on 1 March produced the highest yield as compared to other planting dates i.e. 15 March, 1 April, 15 April, 1 & 15 May. Genotype Bt.CIM-616 produced significantly higher <b>seed</b> <b>cotton</b> yield as compared to Bt.Cyto-177 and Bt.CIM-598 (std). Nitrogenous fertilizer @ 400 kg ha-1 produced significantly higher <b>seed</b> <b>cotton</b> yield in transgenic cotton over 300 kg N ha-1.The result revealed that cotton planting as relay crop (75 cm apart rows) produced maximum <b>seed</b> <b>cotton</b> yield (4618 kg ha-1) than fallow land early planting (4086 kg ha-1). Planting of cotton under modified technique (Relay crop 75 cm apart rows) produced 13, 99.5 and 105.3% higher cotton yield over fallow land, wide row (150 cm) and after wheat harvesting, respectively.

The purpose of the seed dealer survey and seed collection was to test the seed, through DNA fingerprinting, for purity and other traits (germination, moisture etc.). The survey was designed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and implemented by Innovative Development Studies (IDS). The sample selection of seed dealers involved three steps: i) identification of markets from where most of the survey households in our sample for the study purchase seeds; ii) preparation of a list of all <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealers in these identified markets; and iii) selection of five seed dealers in each market and collect samples of three top selling varieties. The household survey identified that nearly 32 percent of the selected <b>cotton</b> growers purchased <b>seeds</b> from markets. These markets were located in 42 tehsils. Keeping in view the representation of all agroecological zones (AEZs) of cotton growing areas, 27 tehsil markets were randomly selected.
