500|$|Extensive timber {{cutting in}} the Sandy River basin {{began in the}} mid-19thcentury in {{response}} to a demand for wood from the Portland metropolitan area. Logging intensified in the lower basin through the 20thcentury as sawmills became established in Sandy, Boring, Brightwood and other settlements in the region, and railroad spurs extended into the forests. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to forbid activities such as camping and livestock grazing in the Bull Run Reserve.

500|$|On one account, {{sustainability}} [...] "concerns the {{specification of}} a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption, wealth, utility, or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons". Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics represents: [...] "...a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective. Social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis." [...] However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of <b>sustained</b> <b>yield</b> of welfare, resources, or profit margins. At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact.

When run failures occur, managers close fisheries to provide for predetermined escapement needs and therefore ensuring long-term sustainable yields.

During five crops cycle of continuous application of crop residues with inorganic fertilizers or combined with CM, 43 % of the observed maximum yield of the maize was sustained compared to 21 % in plots where crop residues were removed. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) uptake by the subsequent crops were significantly higher in crop residue treatments whereas phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were not signifi- cantly affected by application of crop residues.
