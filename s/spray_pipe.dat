40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{possibilities for}} Metso Paper {{to lower their}} costs of spray pipes for their pulp wash press TRPE, with maintained good functionality and quality. Information {{that can be used}} by competitors has been censored in this version of the essay. To find solutions, alternative suppliers have been contacted and asked to quote. There has also been a new <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> designed. The manufacturing costs of the new design have been calculated. The thesis also contains a concept generation of an alternative product to the spray pipes in installations where a high pressure washer is used. To be able to ask other manufacturers of spray pipes to quote, a demand specification based on the currently used <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> was made. This was then sent to two alternative suppliers. An investigation of earlier used spray pipes, and the currently used, shows that the nozzles are {{a big part of the}} total costs of the spray pipes. To attempt to reduce the nozzles high cost an concept generation was made to find the best solution for a new design. There was a request that it should be possible to change the internal brushes in the <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> without cutting and welding. A concept generation was made to find a solution to easily change the brushes. When the results of the projects different parts were delivered, they were compared to each other to find the best overall solution to lower the costs of the spray pipes. The conclusion of this project is that the currently used <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> not is overpriced and therefore in short term the best option is to continue using the current supplier. There have though been some discussions regarding manufacturing of the newly designed <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> in cost competitive countries. It seems like the costs can be reduced if manufacturing the <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> or parts of the <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> in E. g. China...|$|E

40|$|A Japanese-made {{vegetable}} washing machine, typeSJX- 72 S, {{was employed}} in the test of the vegetables washing. Its washing characteristics and the performance were investigated first. The cleaning efficiency and injuried rate were evaluated accordingly. Moreover the washing tests were conducted with various pipeline pressures and conveyer velocities. A nozzle testing instrument {{was set up to}} measure the impact force produced by the nozzle. Five factors of a nozzle affected the cleaning efficiency and injuried rate were found; i. e. jet coverage, impact force, inlet pressure, capacity, and spray distance. For the leafy vegetable washing, the results show that SJX- 72 S has high cleaning effiviency about 90 %, but it also has high injuried rate over 50 % while the pipeline pressure is 0. 3 ∼ 0. 5 kg/c㎡ and the vonveyer velocity is 0. 18 ∼ 4. 7 m/min. And the impact bearing ability of the leafy vegetable was poor. For the root vegetable washing, such as radish, SJX- 72 S has high cleaning efficency about 90 % and almost zero injuried rate. Therefore, SJX- 72 S can be used for the root vegetables washing, and not for leafy ones. A SHING-TA type vegetabel washing machine was developed and manufactured according to the study on SJX- 72 S vegetable washing machine. The fixed <b>spray</b> <b>pipe</b> (nozzle) in cleaning chamber for washing the root of the leafy vegetable was devised independently. For the leafy vegetable washing, the results show that SHING-TA type has high cleaning efficiency about 90 % and almost zero injuried rate while the pipeline pressure is 4. 5 ∼ 5. 0 kg/c㎡ and the conveyer velocity is 6. 79 m/min; For the root vegetable washing, it also has high cleaning efficiency over 90 % and almost zero injuried rate while the pipeline pressure is 4. 5 kg/c ㎡ and the conveyer velocity is 6. 79 m/min. According to the study, the SHING-TA type vegetable washing machine can be used for washing both leafy and root vegetables. 本論文利用日製SJX- 72 S 型蔬菜清洗機，進行蔬菜之清洗試驗，研究方法 首先探討該機之清洗機構特性，並量測該機之管路壓力（流量）與輸送帶 速度等各項基本性能，進而設定各種不同管路壓力及輸送帶速度進行蔬菜 之清洗試驗，並組立一噴咀性能測試台，研究各型噴咀之基本性能，建立 噴咀清洗蔬菜作業中會影響清潔率及損傷率之噴流範圍、沖擊力、管路壓 力與噴射距離等之線性迴歸模式，且選出最適用於清洗葉菜類蔬菜及根莖 類蔬菜之噴咀型式分別為扇形及圓柱形噴咀。由SJX- 72 S 型蔬菜清洗機進 行葉菜類蔬菜清洗試驗結果顯示在管路壓力 0. 3 ∼ 0. 5 kg/c㎡，輸送帶速 度 0. 18 ∼ 4. 73 m/min ，雖有 90 ％以上之清潔率，但平均損傷率卻高達 50 ％ 以上。再由蔬菜之耐沖（損傷）試驗，可同時驗証該機不適用於葉菜類蔬 菜之清洗及葉菜類蔬菜不宜以噴咀高壓直接沖洗；但在管路壓力 4. 5 kg/c ㎡，輸送帶速度 3. 46 m/min進行根莖類蔬菜清洗試驗結果顯示，其清潔率 高達 90 ％以上，而損傷率為零，顯示該機只適合於根莖類蔬菜之清洗。 根據SJX- 72 S 型蔬菜清洗機之清洗機構及各項性能資料，提供改良研製 興大型蔬菜清洗機之重要參考數據，興大型蔬菜清洗機係在清洗室中增加 一組獨立之直立固定式噴管(咀) 清洗系統，主要用來清洗葉菜類蔬菜之根 部，試驗結果顯示在管路壓力 4. 5 ∼ 5. 0 kg/c㎡，輸送帶速度 6. 79 m/min， 其清潔率高達 90 ％以上，而損傷率為零；而其擺轉式噴管（咀）清洗系統 清洗根莖類蔬菜在管路壓力 4. 5 kg/c㎡，輸送帶速度 6. 79 m/min，亦有高 達 90 ％以上之清潔率及零損傷率。根據超級市場販售各類蔬菜之清潔率及 損傷率抽樣調查結果，本機所清洗之蔬菜可達到消費者接受之程度，而成 為一多功能之蔬菜清洗機...|$|E

25|$|In August, TEPCO began {{considering}} {{changing the}} core injection method for the no. 3 reactor {{as it was}} requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized {{that this may be}} because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen {{to the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core <b>spray</b> system <b>pipes</b> as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core <b>spray</b> system <b>pipes</b> and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. <b>Sprayed</b> coatings, <b>pipe</b> insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{results of}} no-vent fill testing with liquid {{hydrogen}} in a 1. 2 cubic foot (34 liter) {{stainless steel tank}} are presented. More than 40 tests were performed with various liquid inlet temperatures, inlet flowrates, initial tank wall temperatures, and liquid injection techniques. Fill levels equal to or exceeding 90 percent by volume were achieved in 40 percent of the tests with the tank pressure limited {{to a maximum of}} 30 psia. Three liquid injection techniques were employed; top <b>spray,</b> upward <b>pipe</b> discharge, and bottom diffuser. Effects of each of the varied parameters on the tank pressure history and final fill level are evaluated. The final fill level is found to be indirectly proportional to the initial wall and inlet liquid temperatures and directly proportional to the inlet liquid flowrate. Furthermore, the top spray is the most efficient no-vent fill method of the three configurations examined. The success of this injection method is primarily due to condensation of the ullage vapor onto the incoming liquid droplets. Ullage condensation counteracts the tank pressure rise resulting from energy exchange between the fluid and the warmer tank walls, and ullage compression. Upward pipe discharge from the tank bottom is the next most efficient method. Fluid circulation induced by this fill configuration tends to diminish thermal stratification in the bulk liquid, thus enhancing condensation at the liquid gas interface...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{present an}} {{analysis}} of various types of internal protective pipeline coatings to ensure the strength and hydraulic characteristics of a remodeled pipeline and related coating methods for effective trenchless renovation of engineering systems, water supply systems and sanitation. As protective coating the authors considered a round profile tube of a smaller diameter than of the old pipe, close to the old <b>pipe,</b> <b>sprayed</b> lining {{on the basis of}} inorganic and inorganic materials. The article analyzes the methods of trenchless renovation for applying protective coatings: routing in the old pipeline of new pipes made of polymeric materials or polymeric sleeves, centrifugal spraying on the inner surface of pipelines’ inorganic and organic protective coatings. Special attention was paid to bag technology, providing the required strength properties at specific values of the modulus of elasticity and a number of external factors such as the depth of the existing pipe, the existence and magnitude of the horizon groundwater over it. Also attention is paid to the application technology of tape coatings ribbed profile on the inner surface of pipelines. This technology has a unique feature, which is the ability of recoverable pipeline functioning during its renovation by winding an endless belt and the formation of a new pipe. The tape coating winding is carried out by different types of spiral winding machines. The thickness of the protective coating layer forming the tube remains minimal. Inorganic cement-sand and organic coatings were considered as alternative options for repair of pipelines, which allow to localize the defects {{in the form of a}} fistula, minor cracks and other damages. However it is noted that a cement-sandy covering is inferior to organic, because it does not provide the strength characteristics of the pipeline system. The main advantage of the organic coating is mudding fistula of a large diameter, making a high wear-resisting pipe, ensuring a smooth surface. Then the protective coating almost merges with the old pipeline. The conclusion is made on the necessity of taking account of the potential for energy saving in case of various protective coatings and implemented trenchless technologies application...|$|R
