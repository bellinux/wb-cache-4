2500|$|Urine {{diversion}} {{takes advantage}} of the anatomy of the human body, which excretes urine and feces separately. In a UDDT, the urine is kept separate and drained via a basin with a small hole near the front of the toilet bowl or <b>squatting</b> <b>pan,</b> while feces fall through a larger drop-hole at the rear. This separate collection– or [...] "source separation"– does not require the user to change positions between urinating and defecating, although some care is needed to ensure the right position over the user interface. Female users may find that some urine may enter the vault during normal operation. This is typically a small amount and does not significantly affect the function of the toilet.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of UDDTs: the single vault type which has only one feces vault; the double vault type which has two feces vaults that are used alternately; and the mobile or {{portable}} UDDTs which are {{a variation of the}} single vault type and are commercially manufactured or homemade from simple materials. A UDDT can be configured as a sitting toilet (with a urine diversion pedestal or bench) or as a squatting toilet (with a urine diversion <b>squatting</b> <b>pan).</b> The most important design elements of the UDDT are: source separation of urine and feces; waterless operation; and ventilated vaults (also called [...] "chambers") or removable containers for feces storage and treatment. If anal cleansing takes place with water (i.e., the users are [...] "washers" [...] rather than [...] "wipers"), then this anal cleansing water must be drained separately and not be allowed to enter the feces vault.|$|E

50|$|A pit toilet, or pit latrine, is a dry toilet {{system which}} {{collects}} human excrement in a pit or trench, {{ranging from a}} simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or <b>squatting</b> <b>pans</b> and ventilation systems.

Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.|$|E

50|$|A dry toilet is {{a toilet}} that {{operates}} without flush water, unlike a flush toilet. The dry toilet {{may be a}} raised pedestal on which the user can sit, or a <b>squat</b> <b>pan</b> over which the user squats {{in the case of}} a squat toilet. In both cases, the excreta (both urine and feces) falls through a drop hole. The urine and feces can either become mixed at the point of dropping or stay separated, which is called urine diversion.|$|R

EcoSan technology has drawn attention to many Majumbasita dwellers, international organizations, government line ministries, individuals and other stakeholders following the construction of 95 EcoSan Latrine units in household level and 6 stances School latrine in the project area. Two types of urine diversion toilets have been applied, the seat pan and <b>squatting</b> <b>pan,</b> the later is more acceptable to the community following the unplanned settlement in the area. This paper provides insights and lessons learned from a piloting ecological sanitation project in Tanzania since November 2000. It includes findings of review as conducted to assess the operation and socio cultural pertaining the technology. It shows {{to what extent is}} the EcoSan is accepted in Tanzania. In addition, the paper explored community reactions towards the recycle of nutrients from human excreta and research on the recycling nutrients. Public acceptability is promising following the PHAST (Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation) methodology carried out at all stages of project implementation...|$|E
