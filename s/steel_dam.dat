25|$|A <b>steel</b> <b>dam</b> {{is a type}} of dam briefly {{experimented with}} around the start of the 20th century which uses steel plating (at an angle) and {{load-bearing}} beams as the structure. Intended as permanent structures, steel dams were an (arguably failed) experiment to determine if a construction technique could be devised that was cheaper than masonry, concrete or earthworks, but sturdier than timber crib dams.|$|E
2500|$|Holter Dam {{was built}} by the United Missouri River Power Company and the Montana Power Company. Samuel Thomas Hauser, a former Territorial Governor {{of the state of}} Montana from 1885 to 1887, had had a lengthy career in banking, mining, railroads, ranching, and smelting, but had {{encountered}} a series of financial setbacks after the Panic of 1893 which had nearly ruined him financially. In his early 60s, Hauser began to rebuild his finances by branching out into the relatively new industry of hydroelectric power generation. In 1894, he formed the Missouri River Power Company, and won the approval of the United States Congress to build a dam [...] below Stubbs' Ferry (which later was known as Hauser Dam). In 1905, Hauser and other directors of the Missouri River Power Company formed the Helena Power Transmission Company (also known as the [...] "Helena Power and Transmission Company"). The two companies merged on February 16, 1906, to form the United Missouri River Power Company. The merged company completed Hauser Dam on February 12, 1907. The dam was a <b>steel</b> <b>dam</b> built on masonry footings on top of gravel, with the ends of the dam anchored in bedrock {{on either side of the}} river. On April 14, 1908, Hauser Dam failed after water pressure undermined the masonry footings (the <b>steel</b> <b>dam</b> itself being structurally sound). United Missouri River Power began reconstruction of Hauser Dam in July 1908 (completing the dam in the spring of 1911).|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 1908, {{at about}} 2:30 PM, Hauser Dam—a <b>steel</b> <b>dam</b> about 90 miles {{upstream}} from Great Falls— failed. A surge of water [...] to [...] high swept downstream. A Great Northern Railway locomotive was {{dispatched to the}} city of Great Falls, warning stations along the way about the dam break. Workers at the Boston and Montana Smelter in Great Falls improvised a wing dam to deflect the floodwaters away from the smelter site and dynamited a portion of Black Eagle Dam to allow the floodwaters to go downstream. Their efforts were not needed, as the Missouri River only rose [...] by the time it reached that city. Two deaths occurred while the dynamiting attempt was made, however: One man drowned while trying to remove flashboards from the dam, and another drowned when his boat capsized.|$|E

50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>dams</b> {{may or may}} {{not have}} a spillway. The Ashfork-Bainbridge did not have one but was {{designed}} to allow water to pour directly over the crest, while the Redridge had both a spillway and a water pipe to supply water to downstream stamp mills.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>dams</b> {{were found}} {{uneconomical}} after the World War I as the steel prices raised many times compared to cement prices {{though they are}} equally sound like other dam building materials. However, their economics are highly favourable in 21st century due to higher onsite labour costs, costly bulk material transportation, availability of more construction time in a year, flexibility in construction plan complying statuary requirements, etc.|$|R

50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>dams</b> use {{relatively}} thin {{steel plates}} {{in contact with}} the water body, with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground. The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow, so that the weight of the water puts compressive forces on the girders holding the plates up. This transmits force to the ground without the bending moment that a vertical wall of plates would engender. It was believed at the time that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than masonry dams.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>dams</b> use {{a series}} of {{footings}} anchored in the earth. These footings hold struts which in turn hold up {{a series of}} deck girders which in turn hold steel plates. It is these plates that the water comes in contact with. The girders and plates are angled in the downstream direction so that part of the weight of the water acts with a downward force on the struts and footings, holding them in place. (Consider that, if the plates were vertical, as in a steel cofferdam, all the force would be horizontal and much more massive struts and anchors would be required to counteract the horizontal force and bending moment.) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{the various}} life cycle processes, CO 2 {{emissions}} were greatest during the production processes for materials and fuel {{for all types}} of check dam, with 75  % of the emissions for all-wood timber check dams and over 90  % of those for hybrid timber, concrete, and <b>steel</b> check <b>dams</b> emitted during this process.|$|R

30|$|For {{comparison}} with other measures of reducing CO 2 emissions [24], the marginal abatement costs of switching from concrete check dams to all-wood timber check dams would come to a similar amount to improvements to the urban automotive driving environment (the use of intelligent transport systems), for example. If (c) all-wood timber check dams without a front apron and only steel bars were used instead of <b>steel</b> check <b>dams,</b> this would cost around the same amount as using gas turbine combined-cycle power generation. These costs are around 4 – 38 {{times greater than the}} marginal abatement cost of 15 thousand yen/t-CO 2 (54 thousand yen/t-C) for using thinnings or logging residues as an energy source to reduce CO 2 emissions (average emission factors for all power sources) [24], suggesting that switching from concrete or <b>steel</b> check <b>dams</b> to timber check dams would not constitute a cheap means of reducing CO 2 emissions compared to other methods for reducing CO 2 emissions. Further cost reduction measures, as well as political support such as subsidy systems, are required for the use of timber in check dams.|$|R

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} efficiency, all-wood timber check dams are the most expensive, whereas concrete check dams are the cheapest, with all-wood timber check dams being expensive at 241  % {{of the cost of}} concrete check dams. However, it is possible to reduce the cost of all-wood timber check dams to around 60  % of its current level by changing the construction method and materials. Hybrid timber check dams are 132  % of the costs of concrete check dams, and slightly less expensive than <b>steel</b> check <b>dams,</b> and can therefore be competitive with them in terms of cost.|$|R
5000|$|The Ashfork Bainbridge <b>Steel</b> <b>Dam,</b> {{the first}} large <b>steel</b> <b>dam</b> in the world, {{and one of}} only three ever built in the United States, was {{constructed}} in 1898 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) to supply water for railway operations near Ash Fork, Arizona. It is named for the town of Ash Fork, and for Francis H. Bainbridge, a civil engineer and graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), a member of the Rensselaer Society of Engineers, and an engineer for ATSF. [...] The dam has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976.|$|E
50|$|In 1894, {{prior to}} the {{construction}} of the <b>steel</b> <b>dam,</b> the Atlantic Mining Company built a timber crib dam across the Salmon Trout River. The dam created a reservoir which supplied water to the Atlantic stamp mill which extracted copper from ore-bearing rock. With the growth of the Atlantic stamp mill and the construction of the Baltic Mining Company mill nearby, this reservoir proved to be insufficient, and in 1901 the <b>steel</b> <b>dam</b> was built. It was designed by J. F. Jackson and built by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company. The old timber crib dam remained in place, submerged, upstream of the <b>steel</b> <b>dam.</b> A system of spillways, sluices (or launders as they are referred to in contemporary texts), and pipes brought water downhill to the stamp mills. The dam itself measures 74 ft (23 m) high at its center and extends for a length of 1,006 ft (307 m) across the river. Access to the reservoir was shared by the Atlantic and Baltic mines, which had a common board of directors.|$|E

5000|$|Steel Heart was a [...] "strong, good-looking" [...] {{bay horse}} with no white {{markings}} bred in Ireland by W. F. Davison. He {{was from the}} second crop of foals sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who {{became one of the}} leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Flying Water, Marwell, Rose Bowl and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. <b>Steel</b> Heart's <b>dam</b> A. 1 showed little ability as a racehorse but was a successful broodmare who produced several other winners and was the female-line ancestor of King of Kings.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} each {{separate}} life cycle process, CO 2 emissions were greatest from the production processes for material and fuel {{for all types}} of check dam, accounting for 75  % of the total in all-wood timber check dams and over 90  % of the total in the other types. Focusing on a breakdown of the emissions during the material and fuel production processes, timber, which is used in large quantities in all-wood timber check dams, accounts for over 60  %, and connectors for over 20  %. Steel accounts for over 80  % of hybrid timber check <b>dams</b> and <b>steel</b> check <b>dams.</b> Concrete accounts for over 90  % of concrete check dams, irrespective of the use or otherwise of timber forms. This shows that for <b>steel</b> check <b>dams</b> and concrete check dams, almost all the CO 2 emissions produced during the construction of check dams are generated during the production process for their main materials. The CO 2 emissions per dam volume from the concrete-dam construction process used in this study and that from a previous study [9] were 8.2 and 18.4  kg-CO 2 /m 3, respectively; i.e., the emissions were smaller for this study. This is mainly because this study used manpower to build the forms, while the previous study assumed the use of a machine (rough-terrain crane) for the same task. Had the present study also used a machine, the emissions would have increased up to 16.0 (= 8.2  +  7.8) kg-CO 2 /m 3, which is not significantly different from those obtained in the previous study.|$|R
30|$|Focusing on the {{relative}} proportions of material and construction costs, for concrete check dams material costs accounted for 57  % and construction costs for 44  %. In contrast, the corresponding figures were 80 and 20  % for all-wood timber check dams, 89 and 11  % for hybrid timber check dams, and 83 and 17  % for <b>steel</b> check <b>dams.</b> Material costs accounted for {{a high proportion of}} direct construction costs for the three types of check dam other than those made of concrete, and the cost of material procurement was a factor driving up direct construction costs. Attempting to reduce material costs will therefore be a more effective cost-cutting measure than improving construction efficiency to keep down direct construction costs.|$|R
50|$|Some ore {{processing}} applications used {{large quantities}} of water so some stamp mills are located near natural or artificial bodies of water. For example, the Redridge <b>Steel</b> <b>Dam</b> was built to supply stamp mills with process water.|$|E
50|$|In {{both types}} of construction, it is typical for the plates to have a {{scalloped}} appearance, {{as can be seen}} in the Redridge <b>Steel</b> <b>Dam</b> illustration, above. It is to allow free expansion/contraction of the steel plates as the water or ambient temperature changes.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{inhibition}} of carbon <b>steel</b> in <b>dam</b> water by sodium heptane sulphonate (SHS) and zinc ion system was investigated using {{weight loss and}} potentiodynamic polarization methods. Results of weight loss method indicated that inhibition efficiency (IE) increased as the inhibitor concentration increased. A synergistic effect existed between SHS and Zn 2 +. The influence of sodium potassium tartrate (SPT) on the IE of the SHS-Zn 2 + system was evaluated. As the immersion period increased, the IE decreased. Polarization study revealed that SHS-Zn 2 + system functioned as a cathodic inhibitor. AC impedance spectra revealed that a protective film was formed on the metal surface. The nature of the metal surface was analyzed by FTIR spectra, SEM and AFM analyses...|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} period, several private establishments - {{most notably the}} Montana Power Company - began to develop the Missouri River above Great Falls and below Helena for power generation. A small run-of-the river {{structure}} completed in 1898 near the present site of Canyon Ferry Dam became the second dam to be built on the Missouri. This rock-filled timber crib dam generated {{seven and a half}} megawatts of electricity for Helena and the surrounding countryside. The nearby <b>steel</b> Hauser <b>Dam</b> was finished in 1907, but failed in 1908 because of structural deficiencies, causing catastrophic flooding all the way downstream past Craig.
