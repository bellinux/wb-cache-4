5|$|Ohio statewide {{offices are}} {{regularly}} contested {{every four years}} in the midterm election years. 2008 is Class 2 <b>senatorial</b> <b>election</b> year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo {{announced}} that he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Senator Jim Bunning in the 2010 <b>senatorial</b> <b>election.</b> The move effectively prohibited Mongiardo from running for re-election with Beshear in the 2011 gubernatorial contest. On July 19, 2009, Beshear {{announced that}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson would replace Mongiardo as his running mate in his re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{continued}} {{campaigning in}} Iowa and New Hampshire visiting {{up to four}} different cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 <b>Senatorial</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} only {{parliamentary}} group of communists in the Senate of the Third Republic was formed following the 1938 <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections,</b> with two members. A communist group existed through {{the duration of the}} Fourth Republic in the Council of the Republic, with 74 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 December 1946, 17 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 7 November 1948, 16 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 18 May 1952, 14 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 19 June 1955, and 16 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 June 1958.|$|R
50|$|During the Fourth Republic, {{a socialist}} group {{was formed in}} the Council of the Republic, with 64 seats {{following}} <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 December 1946, and 62 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 7 November 1948, doing better than its tripartite partners {{as a result of}} its good local implantation. The group subsequently maintained 56 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 18 May 1952, 56 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 19 June 1955, and 60 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 June 1958.|$|R

5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 <b>senatorial</b> <b>election</b> {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E
5|$|Even before McKinley {{completed}} his term in Congress, {{he met with}} a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor. Governor James E. Campbell, a Democrat, who had defeated Foraker in 1889, was to seek re-election in 1891. The Ohio Republican party remained divided, but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention, which chose McKinley by acclamation. The former congressman {{spent much of the}} second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell, beginning in his birthplace of Niles. Hanna, however, was little seen in the campaign; he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 <b>senatorial</b> <b>election.</b> McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20,000 votes; the following January, Sherman, with considerable assistance from Hanna, turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature's vote for another term in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Flournoy {{was elected}} to {{represent}} the 12th Senatorial District, consisting of Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, and Pendleton counties, in the West Virginia Senate in 1885 and was re-elected to the seat in 1889. In the West Virginia state <b>senatorial</b> <b>election</b> on November 6, 1888, Flournoy defeated his Republican challenger S.G. Pownall with 5,578 votes to Pownall's 4,028 votes. Following his election, Flournoy was selected as part of West Virginia's attending delegation to the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison. In his first term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy {{served as chairman of}} the Judiciary Committee, and in his second term he served as chairman of the Committee on Counties and Municipal Corporations. Throughout his two terms, Flournoy served on the committees of Privileges and Elections, Federal Relations, Immigration and Agriculture, and Public Printing. In 1890, during his second term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy relocated from Romney to Charleston and continued practicing law there. He resigned from his senate seat in 1890.|$|E

50|$|In the Council of the Republic of the Fourth Republic, {{the group}} was {{initially}} reincarnated as the Rally of the Republican Lefts group (groupe du Rassemblement des gauches républicaines), with 42 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 December 1946, and 86 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 7 November 1948. The group, which envisaged a new rise of radical thought, was however {{a victim of the}} decline of radicalism, far from achieving its former heights, was subsequently renamed to the Rally of Republican Lefts and the Democratic Left group (groupe du Rassemblement des gauches républicaines et de la gauche démocratique) in 1949 and later the Democratic Left and the Rally of Republican Lefts group (groupe de la Gauche démocratique et du rassemblement des gauches républicaines) in 1952, and held 73 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 18 May 1952, increasing to 77 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 19 June 1955. The group returned to its original appellation of the Democratic Left group (groupe de la Gauche démocratique) in 1956, controlling 62 seats following the final <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> of the Fourth Republic on 8 June 1958.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Willson {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. From 1910 to 1919, he served on the Harvard University Board of Overseers. In 1914, he was {{a candidate for the}} Senate seat of Johnson Camden. It was the state's first <b>senatorial</b> <b>election</b> since passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, meaning the seat would be filled by popular vote rather than by a vote of the legislature. The seat had originally belonged to former governor Bradley, who had died in office. Governor McCreary appointed Camden to fill the unexpired term, but Camden had agreed not to seek re-election so that J. C. W. Beckham could run for the seat. In the Republican primary, Willson defeated Richard P. Ernst. In the general election, the unpopularity of Willson's gubernatorial administration combined with the overwhelming popularity of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, ensured that Beckham won the seat by more than 32,000 votes. This campaign was Willson's last. He died on August 24, 1931, and is buried in the Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of his term, Crittenden was {{concerned}} with quelling the violence in Kansas Territory. An opponent of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, Crittenden also opposed repealing the Missouri Compromise unless the North agreed to substitute popular sovereignty for the exclusion of slavery north of the 36°30' line. In early 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the Kansas Territory to ensure that fair elections were held there, but the proposal was blocked by the Pierce administration. He did not agree with all of the act proposed by Robert Toombs to allow for a constitutional convention in Kansas Territory, but he supported it as a step to bring peace there. He regarded the ratifications of both the Topeka Constitution and the Lecompton Constitution as invalid, and made one of the most highly regarded speeches of his career in opposition to the latter. His substitute bill that would have resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another ratification vote was supported by Republicans, but it was ultimately defeated. So great was Crittenden's influence after his actions on the Kansas question that Abraham Lincoln felt that Crittenden's endorsement of Stephen Douglas cost Lincoln the Illinois <b>senatorial</b> <b>election</b> in 1858.|$|E
5|$|McCreary's senate {{term was}} set to expire in 1908, {{the same year as}} Beckham's second term as governor. Desiring {{election}} to the Senate following his gubernatorial term, Beckham persuaded his Democratic allies to choose the party's nominees for governor and senator by a primary election held in 1906 – a year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the <b>senatorial</b> <b>election.</b> This ensured that the primary would occur during his term as governor, when he still wielded significant influence within the party. McCreary now allied himself with J. C. S. Blackburn, Henry Watterson, and other Beckham opponents, and sought to defend his seat in the primary. During the primary campaign, he pointed to his record of dealing with national issues, contrasting it with Beckham's youth and inexperience at the national level. Beckham countered by citing his strong stand in favor of Prohibition, as opposed to McCreary's more moderate position, and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention, which he said gave the voters a choice in who would represent them in the Senate. Ultimately, Beckham prevailed in the primary by an 11,000-vote margin, rendering McCreary a lame duck with two years still left in his term.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} {{election}} of the Council of the Republic of the Fourth Republic, the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) group (groupe du Mouvement républicain populaire) obtained 76 seats, {{a quarter of the}} upper chamber, following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 December 1946. During the debate on the existence of the upper chamber, the MRP advocated for a bicameral system in which both the roles and modes of {{election of the}} two houses were clearly distinguished from each other, calling for the replacement of the system of indirect universal suffrage to select electors with greater representation of local collectivities. This proposal eventually prevailed despite the reluctance of certain members of the MRP, cognizant of the fact that such a system would favor it significantly less. Indeed, with a lack of representation at the local level {{as a result of the}} 1947 municipal elections in which the newly-founded Rally of the French People (RPF) of Charles de Gaulle secured a massive victory (the RPF having deprived the MRP of its flag as the party of the resistance), the MRP was reduced to just 22 seats following the <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> of 7 November 1948. and never regained its former strength through the duration of the republic, with 24 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 18 May 1952, 21 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 19 June 1955, and 23 seats following <b>senatorial</b> <b>elections</b> on 8 June 1958.|$|R
