40|$|Women 2 ̆ 7 s {{flat track}} roller derby {{is a growing}} niche sport that has {{gathered}} much attention from media and academics alike. Previous research has analyzed the sport from a gendered view with limited focus on bodies in the broader sense. I attempt to fill this {{gap in the literature}} by asking: How do derby skaters define the derby body? In what ways do skaters resist and/or accommodate conventional bodily norms and those within derby? Utilizing an ethnographic repertoire of observation, interviews, and autoethnography, I examine the experiences of women derby skaters for a local flat track league located in the Midwest. Drawing from literature on gender and <b>sport,</b> <b>resistance,</b> and embodiment, I argue that skaters engage with a series of tensions and contradictions between societal norms and derby values, specifically those related to body size, athleticism, public versus private spaces, and the role of non-(born) women in the sport...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} effort on implicit agency ascription for actions performed under varying levels of physical effort or cognitive load. People are able to estimate the interval between two events accurately, but they underestimate the interval between their own actions and their outcomes. This effect is known as ‘intentional binding’, and may provide feedback regarding the consequences of our actions. Concurrently with the interval reproduction task, our participants pulled <b>sports</b> <b>resistance</b> bands at high and low resistance levels (Experiments 1 and 2), or performed a working memory task with high and low set-sizes (Experiment 3). Intentional binding was greater under low than high effort. When the effort was task-related (Experiment 1), this effect depended on the individual’s explicit appraisal of exertion, while the effect of effort was evident at the group level when the effort was task-unrelated (physical, Experiment 2; mental, Experiment 3). These findings imply {{that the process of}} intentional binding is compromised when cognitive resources are depleted, either through physical or mental strain. We discuss this notion in relation to the integration of direct sensorimotor feedback with signals of agency and other instances of cognitive resource depletion and action control during strain...|$|R

This study {{tested the}} role of past {{physical}} activity mode in predicting physical activity motivation of first year college students. Consistent with self-determination theory, perceived competence and autonomy were expected to mediate the relationships of specific types of physical activity engaged in during high school to autonomous motivation for physical activity in college. College students (N = 124; Mage= 18. 42, SD = 0. 51) completed an online questionnaire that assessed frequency of engagement in different modes of physical activity during their final {{year of high school}} (i. e., competitive sport, recreational <b>sport,</b> aerobic exercise, <b>resistance</b> exercise, organized activities and recreational activities) and current perceptions of competence and autonomy and autonomous motivation for physical activity in college. Path analysis results showed that feelings of competence and autonomy mediated the relationships of past engagement in competitive <b>sport</b> and <b>resistance</b> exercise to current autonomous motivation for physical activity. Competitive sport involvement positively predicted both perceived competence and autonomy, whereas resistance exercise positively predicted perceived competence. Results supported self-determination theory and suggest that creating more opportunities for students to stay involved in competitive sport and engage in resistance exercise may be important for sustaining physical activity behaviours in college...|$|R

As a site for construction of alternative femininities {{in the image of}} a “derby girl, ” derby reveals how the understudied intragender relations between femininities can be important in challenging hegemonic gender relations. The dynamics between femininities, and the women who practice them, affect the motivations for challenging hegemonic gender, the transportation of symbolic discourses deployed in the challenges, and the creation of new organizational networks to sustain these challenges. One sees these effects in the organized ways the athletes feminize their participation in an aggressive <b>sport</b> through <b>resistance,</b> adaptation, mockery, and parody of hegemonic femininity, pariah femininities, and sport.

Also, I investigate if Allport’s contact hypothesis has played any role in the movement from hegemonic masculinity to inclusive masculinity. Religion, education, and economy all seem to be embracing the inclusive form of masculinity, while sport, in general, may be experiencing a slight backlash after three active gay athletes came out in core team sport in 2014...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} not {{available}} through ChesterRep. It is available at [URL] paper reviews research evidence relating to the strength training advice offered by Arthur Jones, founder and retired Chairman of Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries and MedX Corporation. Jones advocated that those interested in improving their muscular size, strength, power and/or endurance should perform one set of each exercise to muscular failure (volitional fatigue), train each muscle group no more than once (or, in some cases, twice) per week, perform each exercise in a slow, controlled manner and perform a moderate number of repetitions (for most people, ~ 8 - 12). This advice is very different to the strength training guidelines offered by the National Strength and Conditioning Association, the American College of Sports Medicine and most exercise physiology textbooks. However, {{in contrast to the}} lack of scientific support for most of the recommendations made by such bodies and in such books, Jones' training advice is strongly supported by the peer-reviewed scientific literature, a statement that has recently been supported by a review of American College of <b>Sports</b> Medicine <b>resistance</b> training guidelines. Therefore, we strongly recommend Jones' methods to athletes and coaches, as they are time-efficient and optimally efficacious, and note that, given his considerable contribution to the field of strength training, academic recognition of this contribution is long overdue...|$|R
30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects of segment muscle {{vibrations}} superimposed to the muscle belly of the agonist muscle. The findings demonstrated that segment-body vibrations may improve muscle coordination, increasing the activation of the agonist muscle, resulting in an increase of maximum force. Therefore, we conclude that initially, the neuronal adaptations to submaximal strength training lead to an increase in maximum isometric force, but not to a significant increase in MT before the third measurement. This method thus offers to athletes a short-term increment of maximum force, which has the potential to improve overall performance in force-dependent <b>sports.</b> <b>Resistance</b> training in <b>sports</b> already covers {{a significant part of the}} training schedule. The application of segment muscle vibration in the present study increases the quality of the resistance training by achieving the same effects with segment muscle vibrations in shorter training time or achieving a higher isometric muscle force in the same training time. Moreover, evidence of positive effects of the application of whole-body vibrations in rehabilitations has been reported. Vibration training has been successfully applied in the rehabilitation process of anterior cross-ligament injuries [54 – 56], in treatment of knee ostearthritis [57], in rehabilitation of spina bifida [58], etc. In contrast, no evidence can be found that supports the use of vibration training in the rehabilitation process of stroke patients [59]. Those above rehabilitation applications are based on whole-body vibration. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, no studies about segment-body vibrations and rehabilitation exist. It is to be assumed that similar and more specific effects in rehabilitation can be achieved with segment-body vibrations. The role of muscle tension in static and dynamic force development is still under investigation. Force measurement under isometric conditions is influenced by muscle properties and neural factors [60]. The key limitation brought about due to lack of a control group can be alleviated if more studies are conducted, which include a control group and EMG. This can further reveal the role of muscle tension and would be the subject of future research. We will also like to point out another limitation of the study which stems from the fact that the bilateral effects of two different training methods of the two arms have not been controlled. It is known that unilateral resistance training of the elbow flexor muscles of the non-dominant arm of a test person can have a significant increase of isometric maximum force of 5.3  % at the contralateral elbow flexor muscles [61]. Thus, in summary, we conclude that segment-body vibrations applied in resistance training can offer an effective tool to increase maximum isometric force, compared to traditional training. Thus, as the training quality improves, higher benchmarks can be realized in the same period of training time compared to regular strength straining. The results of this study show the practical application of training method which is superior to traditional training by 7  % compared to traditional training.|$|R

It draws on theoretical considerations from the sociology of science to distinguish and empirically investigate two dimensions of mediatization: changes in media coverage of science {{on the one hand}} and the repercussions of this coverage on science on the other hand. Results of content analyses and focused expert interviews show that mediatization phenomena can indeed be observed in the case of science, but they are limited to certain disciplines, to certain phases (mediatization phases differ from routine phases in which the media tend to acknowledge scientific criteria, routines, and knowledge), and to a small number of media visible scientists. We conclude that media-induced structural change in science, though present, is less pronounced than mediatization of other parts of society.

Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine optimism and delay discounting as predictors of exercise frequency. Optimism and delay discounting were negatively correlated, but neither was related to exercise frequency. Furthermore, optimism and delay discounting were not significantly related to frequency spent in cardiovascular, resistance, or active lifestyle exercise. However, women scoring higher in delay discounting were more likely to participate in physical sports. The present study helps inform future research by showing potentially important psychosocial variables related to optimism, delay discounting, and exercise...|$|R
40|$|The {{sport of}} track cycling is an Olympic disciplined event, {{commonly}} {{classified as a}} sprint sport due to {{the high levels of}} maximal or repeated maximal sprints required during events ranging from 250 m to 30 km in length. A major determinant of sprint cycling performance is a rider’s ability to produce high levels of sustained power, regardless of event distance. As a result practitioners must ensure that mechanical and physiological components contributing to power are improved. This thesis sought to gain insight into the relationship between muscular strength and power capabilities of well trained sprint cyclists. From the literature review, significant improvements in force generating capability and muscle architecture characteristics were found as a result of externally loaded resistance training. Research had also reported that <b>sport</b> specific <b>resistance</b> training could elicit greater adaptations within trained individuals. Only one study had attempted to analyse the effects of traditional resistance training and cycling specific resistance training on endurance based cyclists, with no reporting of sprint cyclists found. Study One of the thesis showed significant relationships between muscular force and maximal torque production at all tested pedalling velocities (r = 0. 890 - 0. 925), while muscular force and power production were found to not be significantly related. Study Two was conducted using well trained sprint cyclists and sought greater understanding on optimal training modalities. No substantial differences in the relationship of muscular force and maximal torque were found as a result of traditional gym based resistance training (Effect size (ES) = 0. 06) or cycling specific isokinetic resistance training (ES = - 0. 12). Additionally no worthwhile changes in maximal cycling power were found as a result of either traditional (ES = 0. 02) or isokinetic (ES = 0. 09) training modalities. It is suggested that the use of traditional and cycling specific strength training should be carried out regardless of training level, in order to elicit muscular adaptations and maintain sprint cycling performance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effect of the Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time (ATLAS) {{intervention}} on psychological well-being in adolescent boys and to examine the potential mediating mechanisms that might explain this effect. Methods: ATLAS was evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 secondary schools located in low-income communities (N = 361 adolescent boys, mean age = 12. 7 ±. 5 years). The 20 -week intervention was guided by self-determination theory and involved: professional development for teachers, provision of fitness equipment to schools, enhanced school sport sessions, researcher-led seminars, a smartphone application, and parental strategies for reducing screen time. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediately post intervention (8 months). Psychological well-being was measured using the Flourishing Scale. Motivational regulations (intrinsic, identified, introjected, controlled, and amotivation) and basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in school <b>sport,</b> muscular fitness, <b>resistance</b> training skill competency, and recreational screen time were examined as potential mediating mechanisms of the intervention effect. Results: The intervention effect on well-being was small but statistically significant. Within a multiple mediator model, changes in autonomy needs satisfaction, recreational screen time, and muscular fitness significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being. Conclusions: In addition to the physical health benefits, targeted physical activity programs for adolescent boys may have utility for mental health promotion through the mechanisms of increasing autonomy support and muscular fitness and reducing screen time...|$|R

A sample of 449 subjects (mean age 21 years; 380 female and 69 male students) was surveyed by questionnaire. The results of the t-test showed statistically significant gender differences in criterion variables. The students with longer sport experience felt far less health-related discomforts than the others. The female students with more leisure time self-evaluated their health as better. The sport experience of men was longer than the experience of the women, and they preferred <b>sport</b> games and <b>resistance</b> training in gyms. The self-perceived health evaluation of men was generally higher than the self-perception of health in women, except for anger, which was lower in female students. The female students listed numerous health-related discomforts and medical conditions, among which particularly conspicuous was the general feeling of being tired connected with a sequence of psychosomatic discomforts (tension, feeling restless, back pain and leg pain). The discomforts and medical conditions reported by the young female students are comparable to those already reported by the general population of older people. They were caused primarily by hypokinesis and stress, or vice versa, the majority of discomforts and medical conditions were induced by insufficient physical activity, that is, by a sedentary lifestyle, which draws attention to the necessity for intervention in the leisure time of the young, especially college or university students...|$|R
