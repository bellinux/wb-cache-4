The proposal would've prevented {{the state from}} building a prison on a controversial site in New Braintree, Massachusetts and prevented the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) from using the Walpole site for a landfill. The proposal was supported by Massachusetts Department of Correction Commissioner George Vose, but opposed by Governor Michael Dukakis and the MWRA. The prison was constructed in New Braintree as planned, however Dukakis' successor, William Weld, converted the facility into a law enforcement training center shortly after construction was completed. The MWRA entered an agreement to have its <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> output disposed of at a commercial landfill in Utah and the Walpole landfill was never built.|$|E

40|$|The WWTP of Garmerwolde {{treats the}} waste water {{produced}} by the citizens of Groningen. When cleaning polluted water, sludge is produced as a byproduct. In Garmerwolde the sludge is dewatered by a chamber filter press and the resulting <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> with a dry solid content of 22. 5 % is dried by Swiss Combi {{with the use of}} natural gas. The resulting granulates are sold to several other companies to be used as fuel. The cost of <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> handling is very expensive and makes the price of drinking water higher. Garmerwolde wants to lower the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> handling cost by the following things: - By using coal powder in the dewatering process. This will create a <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> with a higher dry solid content (around 40 %) and therefore Swiss Combi has to remove less water. - It is suggested that ferric chloride isn’t needed anymore when using coal powder. Not using any ferric chloride in the process will reduce the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> handling costs. - Swiss Combi uses an expensive way of drying the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> by using natural gas. What is the effect on the drying process if coal powder and ferric chloride are used? In this report the objective is to see whether the above things were indeed a way to improve the dewater ability of the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> and if the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> could be dried by using normal air. The methods used are lab scale experiments to study the effect of coal powder and ferric chloride on the dry solid content of the sludge. The produced <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> was then used to obtain sorption isotherms. By measuring sorption isotherms we could see what the effect of different additives (ferric chloride and coal powder) was on the drying process of the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake.</b> The results of the experiments within this research show that adding coal powder has an positive effect on the dewatering process. Dry solid contents of 40 % weren’t reached only when using undigested sludge. It was also shown that ferric chloride isn’t needed anymore when using coal powder. In the currently setup used at Garmerwolde, a combination of coal powder and ferric chloride gives the best dewatering results. Lastly it was shown by the sorption isotherm experiments the different additives (coal powder and ferric chloride) didn’t affect the drying process of sludge. A higher mass of water per mass of dry sludge is removed, which results in a higher dry solid content of the sludge. Since less water has to been evaporated in the drying process, this positively effects the reduction in costs. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{attachment}} of <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> to {{the membrane}} surface {{is the main}} cause of the fouling problem in the submerged membrane bioreactors (SMBR) used in biological wastewater treatment. In this laboratory study, the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> deposited on the membrane was found to have a specific filtration resistance of the order of 1014 m/kg, which is much greater than expected for <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> formed during the dewatering of activated sludge. The filterability tests showed that the cake sludge removed from the fouled membrane of the SMBR had an average specific filtration resistance of 4. 9 × 1013 m/kg, whereas the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> of the SMBR bulk sludge had an average filtration resistance of only 1. 9 × 1011 m/kg. Detailed chemical analysis showed there was a pool of biopolymer clusters (BPC) that was trapped within the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> on the membrane. These clusters could be readily separated from the cake sludge by stirring it into a suspension. The abundance of non-filterable BPC as measured by the total organic carbon (TOC) in the suspended solids (SS) was about 10. 3 mg/g SS for the cake sludge, in comparison to 0. 4 mg/g SS for the bulk sludge. When the BPC were removed from the cake sludge, the filtration resistance of the cake sludge could be reduced considerably from 4. 9 × 1013 to 8. 4 × 1012 m/kg. It is argued that the BPC are a special form of organic matter formed by affinity clustering of the free extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP) in the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> deposited on the membrane surface. The accumulation of BPC within the pores of the <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> is mostly responsible for the unusually high filtration resistance of the cake sludge during the SMBR operation. © 2006 Elsevier B.

Methods: In-vitro preparation and dewatering of sludge by combination of polyacrylamide activated with aluminum oxide nanoparticles were carried out in two main steps of determination of pH and optimal dose of activated coagulant aid. For measuring sludge dewatering capability, tests of time of filtration (TTF), <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> moisture content, turbidity, and total suspended solids of effluent from <b>sludge</b> <b>cake</b> filtration were evaluated. Results: Modified coagulant aid with aluminum oxide nanoparticles in optimum pH and concentrations of 5 and 4 mg/l, respectively, had the best efficiency and was more suitable than a primary coagulant without any modification.

One strategy {{is the use of}} the alum sludge in liquid form for co-conditioning and dewatering with the anaerobically digested activated sludge in MWWTP. The other strategy involves the use of the dewatered alum <b>sludge</b> <b>cakes</b> in a fixed bed for P immobilization from the reject water that refers to the mixture of the supernatant of the sludge thickening process and the supernatant of the anaerobically digested sludge.

The second strategy of reject water filtration with alum sludge bed has shown a good performance of P reduction. The alum sludge has P-adsorption capacity of 31 mg-P/g-sludge, which was tested under filtration velocity of 1. 0 m/h.

A multi-dimensional research project including the batch tests of phosphorus (P) adsorption onto alum sludge followed by the model CWs trials of single and multi-stage CWs, has been conducted since 2004. It has been successfully demonstrated that the alum sludge-based CW is capable of enhanced and simultaneous removal of P and organic matter (in terms of BOD 5 and COD), particularly from medium and high strength wastewater. The <b>sludge</b> <b>cakes</b> act as the carrier for developing biofilm for organics removal and also serve as adsorbent to enhance P immobilization. Batch P-adsorption tests revealed that the alum sludge tested possesses excellent P-adsorption ability of 14. 3 mg-P/g. sludge (in dry solids) at pH 7. 0 with the adsorption favored at lower pH.
