5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved <b>sidewall,</b> unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E

Hot-wire measurements were conducted at a Reynolds number based on slot-width (h) and exit centerline velocity of Reh ≈ 7000 (for AR = 30 and 60) and at 10, 000 (for AR = 30) up to 160 h downstream. All jets have a potential core in which the local centerline velocity is approximately constant, followed by a transition region and then a statistically two-dimensional (2 -D) region where the centerline mean velocity, Uc not, vert, similar x− 1 / 2. The potential core of the jet without <b>sidewalls</b> is shorter than that with <b>sidewalls.</b> Near field power spectral analysis reveals that the primary vortex shedding rate is higher for the jet without <b>sidewalls</b> than the jet with <b>sidewalls.</b> The 2 -D region of the jet with <b>sidewalls</b> is found to extend over a longer axial distance than that of the jet without <b>sidewalls.</b> It is also demonstrated that both the decay and spread rates of the jet within the 2 -D region are lower for the case with <b>sidewalls.</b> Beyond the 2 -D region, the jet without <b>sidewalls</b> enters into a far field transitional phase and then tends to behave statistically like an axisymmetric jet with Uc not, vert, similar x− 1. The centerline turbulence intensity of the jet with <b>sidewalls</b> becomes asymptotic closer to the nozzle exit than the jet without <b>sidewalls.</b> The skewness and flatness factors confirm further statistical differences between the jet with and without <b>sidewalls...</b>|$|R

25|$|Boast: The ball {{is played}} off a side wall at an angle, or the back wall, {{before hitting the}} front wall.
