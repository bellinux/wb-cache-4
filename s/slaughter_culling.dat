40|$|Using a {{cellular}} automata model, we simulate the British Government Policy (BGP) in the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in Great Britain. When clinical {{symptoms of the}} disease appeared on a farm, there is mandatory <b>slaughter</b> (<b>culling)</b> of all livestock on an infected premise (IP). Those farms that neighbor an IP (contiguous premise, CP), are also culled, aka nearest neighbor interaction. Farms where the disease may be prevalent from animal, human, vehicle or airborne transmission (dangerous contact, DC), are additionally culled, aka next-to-nearest neighbor iteractions and lightning factor. The resulting mathematical model possesses a phase transition, whereupon if the physical disease transmission kernel exceeds a critical value, catastrophic loss of animals ensues. The non-local disease transport probability can be as low as. 01 % per day and the disease can {{still be in the}} high mortality phase. We show that the fundamental equation for sustainable disease transport is the criticality equation for neutron fission cascade. Finally, we calculate that the percentage of culled animals that are actually healthy is ~ 30 %. Comment: To be published in the International Journal of Modern Physics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of sheep in the {{agricultural}} systems from the analysis of situations and Andean Mediterranean, characterized by a strong association between sheep farming and agriculture in the Mediterranean since antiquity, and the introduction of sheep following the Spanish colonization in the Andes. Compared to other domestic animal species in these regions as cattle or Andean camelids, sheep have several advantages (docile, small frame and able to graze difficult areas) that facilitate their livestock. However, their fragility, particularly from predators, forces farmers to collect them at night and invest {{a lot of work to}} monitor grazing and lambing. This investment was justified in work until the 19 th century by the fact that sheep produced wool, which was often the only monetary income of the family, sometimes milk for family consumption, and realized fertility transfers between space travel (saltus) and cultivated areas (ager, hortus), essential for the production of cereals and tubers, staples of these human populations. The sheep was then a byproduct of this breeding. Only older animals were <b>slaughtered</b> (<b>culls)</b> or very young (animals not kept for herd rebuilding). The opening of the world wool market in the late 19 th century signaled the end of this outlet in Western Europe, the development of artificial textiles after World War II led to the decline of the wool industry worldwide and the end of the specific function of sheep as a source of wool. The transfer function of fertility is compromised north of the Mediterranean from 1950 through the use of fertility treatments but continues to play a key role for farmers who can not afford them. Therefore, the question is: under what conditions are sheep, reduced to its function as meat production, viable...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the dynamics and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in the pig population of Great Britain (GB). The roles of the metapopulation of pig herds (metaherd) and individual herd characteristics are examined, and different control and intervention strategies assessed. A novel stochastic model of a metaherd was created, incorporating the births, deaths, <b>slaughter,</b> <b>culls</b> and movement of pigs within and between herds. The metaherd was structured to have characteristics representative of the GB metaherd: the distribution of herd sizes, ‘source’ herds per herd, and numbers of pigs moved per movement. The metaherd was arranged into a typical pyramidal structure. A stochastic infectious process of PRRSV was included. Herd size {{was found to be}} key to within herd persistence of PRRSV, with infection failing to persist in smaller (250 sow) herds. Fadeout did not occur in larger herds once infection established in the rearing herd. PRRSV reduces productivity of herds and the metaherd. There was variability in productivity both between herds and within herds over time. The number of source herds did not influence the dynamics, persistence or prevalence of infection within a herd. Breeding herd production was further decreased by PRRSV when the herd also had a rearing herd (breeder finisher). The model was extended to test the effects of control and intervention strategies. Vaccination effect increased with herd size, and reduced variability in production. Vaccination in small herds was ineffective in increasing production due to PRRSV failing to persist regardless of vaccination. Vaccination of the breeding herd produced higher gains per vaccine dose than vaccination of the rearing herd only. Vaccination of the rearing herd only resulted in higher total herd and metaherd gains, with less variability. Partial de-population combined with vaccination increased the probability of increasing herd performance unless the herd was small (1000 sows). Results highlighted the value of modelling to support the decisions of individual farmers to vaccinate and partially depopulate, showing that the optimal decision is influenced by the herd size. Results also demonstrated that the decision to introduce interventions is different for individual farmers...|$|R

40|$|Beef {{production}} from dairy herds represents an alternative source {{to improve the}} farm profitability. The use of beef semen to mate cattle not destined to breed replacement represent an interesting {{source of income for}} dairy farmers particularly due to the greater price and value of crossbreed calves respect purebred calves at sale. Unfortunately this practice has been decreasing in the last years in the more specialized herds of the Po valley mainly due to fertility and longevity problems of the high productivity dairy cattle. However, on the mountain area, were farms are characterized by less productivity but high longevity and fertility of their cattle, the low replacement rate permitted each year the use of beef sire to mate a considerable number of cattle not destined to breed replacement. In the Trentino area (North of Italy) every week the breeding federation collected calves from associated dairy herds and the best of these for beef traits, following weaning at specialized farms, were fattened at local associated fattening farms. After fattening, young bulls and heifers are slaughtered at the same abattoir and the meat are sold at the central butchers and to the entire cooperative wire markets of the Province. This meat is sold with a certified mark that guarantee birth, fattening and slaughtering of the animals in the same area. Moreover, weekly, the breeding Federation of Trento province collected cull cows from associated dairy herds too and these cattle are sold to an associated abattoir. The aim of the present thesis were to study production and economic traits from the whole beef output from dairy herds in mountain area; the first contribute of the thesis analyzed production and economic traits of <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cull</b> cows while the second and the third contributes analyzed production and selling traits of calves at sale (average 24 days of age). Finally the last contribute studied production and economic traits of young bulls and heifers at slaughter respect the purchase beginning value of calf. Results of first contribute evidenced that the value of <b>cull</b> cows at <b>slaughter</b> represents a significant source of income for the dairy farm and the large differences among different breeds for cull cow value suggests its possible inclusion in the selection objectives of these breeds. Holstein-Friesian cows were younger at slaughter, yielded lighter carcasses and received a lower price and total value than Brown Swiss cows while dual purpose breeds were older, heavier and received a greater price and value at slaughter than both dairy breeds. Results from the study that analyzed calves traits had evidenced that the dual-purpose purebred calves received, on average, greater price and value at sale than purebred dairy calves. Furthermore, among crossbreed calves, the progeny from Belgian Blue sire and Simmental dam evidenced the greatest live weight and selling values. Moreover, results evidenced that the majority of purebred calves from dairy dams were most likely destined for veal production while many dual-purpose calves were most likely destined for beef production as well as the vast majority of beef crossbreed calves. Results from the final contribute evidenced that crossbred young bulls and beef heifers from Belgian Blue sires and Simmental dam achieved the highest carcass weight and the best daily gain and carcass value. The best economic revenue was achieved by Simmental bulls among purebred animals, and by Belgian Blue sire x Holstein Friesian dams, among crossbreed animals. This is mainly related to less purchase value of calves {{at the beginning of the}} fattening period. Results might be useful for the farmers as guideline to quantify an alternative source of income and to improve the farm profitability obtained from beef production in dairy herds. ...|$|R

The objective of the first experiment was to determine the differences in chemical characteristics of trimmings from hot processed and traditionally processed cull meat goats. Crossbred cull doe goats (n= 18) were assigned to one of 3 kills days with 6 replications per day. The sides of each goat were randomly assigned to hot processed (HP) or traditionally processed (TP). HP sides were fabricated within 2 h of slaughter, ground with 2 % salt and dry ice and then held at 2 oC for 24 h. TP sides were chilled at 2 oC for 24 h prior to fabrication and grinding. After sampling, 2 % salt was added to remaining trim yielding 2 treatments: traditionally processed with no salt added (TPNS) and traditionally processed with salt added (TPS). As expected, the HP treatment had a higher (P 0. 19) for all treatments. However, TPNS had more protein (P< 0. 0001) than either the HP or TPS treatments. HP and TPS had decreasing L* values until d 6 when values increased significantly while TPNS decreased steadily by day. HP and TPS differed significantly from TPNS until d 6 when no significant differences were seen. For all treatments, a* values showed decreasing values until d 6. For all treatments, b* values increased until d 5. The objective of the second experiment was to investigate the viability of composting as a means for disposing of goat tissues resulting from the slaughter and fabrication process. By-products from the <b>slaughter</b> of <b>cull</b> meat goats (n= 18) were assigned to 3 treatment piles: bones, offal + head (OH), and whole (bones, skull, and offal). Bones and OH piles increased in temperature, with peaks at wk 7 and wk 9, while whole piles had elevated temperatures from wk 5 to wk 9. Bone piles had statistically lower temperatures through wk 3, but were not statistically different than other treatments through the duration of the study. Whole piles had higher (P< 0. 0001) temperatures over the 8 wk composting period than OH and bone piles. Bone decomposition progressed over 90 d; at d 60, bones in whole piles had greater (P< 0. 05) decomposition than in bone piles. Similarly, skulls decomposition increased over the 90 d period.

40|$|Global {{livestock}} production {{is expected to}} increase in future decades, and expansion of the agricultural area for feed production is not desired. Hence, increasing {{livestock production}} per unit agricultural area is essential. The bio-physical scope to increase production of livestock systems with the corresponding feed crop production (feed-crop livestock systems) could not be assessed generically at the start of this research. In crop production, however, crop models based on concepts of production ecology are widely applied to assess the bio-physical scope to increase actual production. The difference between the biophysical scope and actual production {{is referred to as the}} yield gap. The objectives of this thesis were 1) to develop a generic framework to assess the scope to increase production in feed crop-livestock systems based on concepts of production ecology, 2) to develop a generic livestock model simulating potential (i. e. maximum theoretical) and feed-limited livestock production, and 3) to apply this framework and model to feed-crop livestock systems, and conduct yield gap analyses. Concepts of production ecology for livestock were specified in more detail. Feed efficiency at herd level was a suited benchmark for livestock production only, and production of animal-source food per hectare for feed-crop livestock systems. Application of the framework showed that the yield gap was 79 % of the potential beef production of a cow-calf system, and 72 % of a cow-calf-fattener system in the Charolais region of France. The model LiGAPS-Beef (Livestock simulator for Generic analysis of Animal Production Systems – Beef cattle) was developed to simulate potential and feed-limited production of beef cattle using input data about animals’ genotype, climate, and feed quality and availability. The model consists of sub-models describing thermoregulation, feed intake and digestion, and energy and protein utilisation. Model evaluation under different agro-ecological conditions indicated live weight gain was estimated fairly well (15. 4 % deviation from measured values). LiGAPS-Beef was coupled with crop growth models to simulate potential and resource-limited production of twelve grass-based beef production systems in the Charolais region. Resource-limited production combines feed-limited production of cattle and water-limited production of feed crops. Yield gaps were on average 85 % of potential live weight production per hectare, and 47 % of resource-limited production. Yield gaps were attributed to feed quality and quantity limitation (41 % of potential production), water-limitation in feed crops (31 %), the combination of sub-optimal selling or <b>slaughter</b> weights, <b>culling</b> rates, calving dates, age at first calving, and stocking densities (9 %), and the combination of prolonged calving intervals and calf mortality (2 %). Improved grassland management and an earlier start of the grazing season may increase live weight production per hectare. Furthermore, the resource-limited production of bulls was simulated to increase by 6 - 14 % from 1999 - 2006 up to 2050 due to climate change. From the results of this thesis, it can be concluded that 1) a generic framework using concepts of production ecology is available now to assess the bio-physical scope to increase production in feed-crop livestock systems per unit area; 2) the mechanistic model LiGAPS-Beef simulates potential and feed-limited production of beef cattle fairly well; 3) combining LiGAPS-Beef with crop growth models allows to quantify yield gaps in feed-crop livestock systems, and to analyse these yield gaps. The method described in this thesis can be used subsequently to identify options to mitigate yield gaps, and to increase livestock production per unit area, which may contribute to sustainable intensification of agriculture...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to benchmark carcasses and muscles from commercially identified fed (animals that were perceived to have been fed an increased plane of nutrition before <b>slaughter)</b> and nonfed <b>cull</b> beef and dairy cows and A-maturity, USDA Select steers, so that the muscles could be identified from cull cow carcasses that may be used to fill a void of intermediately priced beef steaks. Carcass characteristics were measured at 24 h postmortem for 75 carcasses from 5 populations consisting of cull beef cows commercially identified as fed (B-F, n = 15); cull beef cows commercially identified as nonfed (B-NF, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as fed (D-F, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as nonfed (D-NF, n = 15); and A-maturity, USDA Select grade steers (SEL, n = 15). Nine muscles were excised from each carcass [m. infraspinatus, m. triceps brachii (lateral and long heads), m. teres major, m. longissimus dorsi (also termed LM), m. psoas major, m. gluteus medius, m. rectus femoris, and m. tensor fasciae latae] and subjected to Warner-Bratzler shear force testing and objective sensory panel evaluation after 14 d of postmortem aging. Carcass characteristics differed (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 05) among the 5 commercially identified slaughter groups for the traits of lean maturity, bone maturity, muscle score, HCW, fat color, subjective lean color, marbling, ribeye area, 12 th-rib fat thickness, and preliminary yield grade. Carcasses from commercially identified, fed cull cows exhibited more (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01) weight in carcass lean than did commercially identified, nonfed cull cows. There was a group 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #;muscle interaction (P = 0. 02) for Warner-Bratzler shear force. Warner-Bratzler shear force and sensory overall tenderness values demonstrates that muscles from the SEL group were the most tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01), whereas muscles from the BNF group were the least tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01). Sensory, beef flavor intensity was similar (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 20) among cull cow carcass groups and more intense (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01) than the SEL carcass group.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: l) determine the contribution of federal land grazing to beef production in Utah and the 11 western states, and 2) trace the impact of hypothetical incremental reductions in federal land grazing in the 11 western states on total beef supply and retail beef prices in the United States. The federal land animal units in the 11 western states were obtained from Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service records. The animal units were converted into the number of breeding cows and feeder calves totally dependent on federal land grazing, with the help of animal units per breeding cow. The animal units per breeding cow were calculated from a representative stock count chart of a typical 50 cow Utah ranch. The same chart provided percentage proportions of the number of calves and feeder calves. These feeder calves are the animals that originate and are totally dependent on federal lands. The minimum contribution of federal land grazing in the 11 western states to total beef supply in the United States ranges between dressed beef from feeder calves and cull cows on one end, and <b>slaughter</b> animals and <b>cull</b> cows on the other. The actual minimum contribution is somewhere to the middle of these extremes. The hypothetical incremental reductions in federal land grazing were calculated in terms of percentage {{reduction in the number of}} cows, calves and feeder calves, and the resultant decreases in beef tonnage on the lower and upper limits of minimum contribution of these lands to total beef supply in the United States. These reductions in beef supply were compared to total United States 2 ̆ 7 beef supply and reductions in total beef supply were estimated in percentage. To estimate the economic and other impacts on individual ranchers, local communities and regional economy, the feed grain in corn equivalents and forage production were compared to livestock and poultry requirements in the 11 western states. It appears that Utah is deficient both in feed grain and roughage production as compared to requirements. The 11 western states as a group were surplus in 1974 in both feed grain and roughage production as compared to livestock and poultry requirements. The contribution of federal lands in roughage production was also estimated. The importance of federal rangelands 2 ̆ 7 contribution, in my study is only 25 percent of total roughage production in the 11 western states and is discussed in the light of other benefits that would be lost if grazing were eliminated from federal lands. Lastly, the impact of reduction in federal grazing in the 11 western states on retail beef prices was estimated by using the concept of price elasticity of demand. It was concluded that an increasingly higher percentage increase in retail prices would occur for given percentage decreases in beef supply (by way of hypothetical incremental reduction in federal land grazing) for increasingly inelastic coefficients of elasticity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This study {{expresses the}} {{hypothesis}} that historical patterns of national beef cow herd accumulation and liquidations (the cattle cycle) have been related to investment incentive differences across cow ages through time, resulting each year in changes in herd age structure, performance and potentials for adjustment in subsequent years. A review of national cattle cycle literature reveals the common assumption of variable heifer recruitment levels through time to the mature cow herd. A review of firm level cattle cycle stategy studies shows that most which considered heterogeneous herds (distinguishing performance by cow age) ironically assumed constant recruitment in proportion to cow numbers. Farmer interviews indicated that heifer recruitment may vary widely in proportion to cow numbers {{from year to year}} and that there are strong tendencies to cull non-pregnant and unsound cows from the herd at any age. The present study assumes both variable recruitment and age heterogenity. A search and synthesis of the biological literature allowed expression of economically important attributes as point estimates from continuous functions of cow age. These attributes are conception rates, health rates, cow survival rates, cull cow body weights, calf survival rates and weaning weights. Based on these biological parameters, and on the assumption that non-pregnant and unsound cows would be culled, retainment and culling rates are defined as management expectation parameters. These biological and expectation parameters are the building blocks of a simulation model designed to make value comparisons between cows of different ages and pregnancy status and to trace out changes in the national cow herd age structure through time. A budget generator produces estimates of expected net annual revenues for each of the 26 discrete age and pregnancy classes of heifers and cows, in each year from 1950 through 1978, based on exogenous price and cost series. These estimates are used to project the present values of expected future net revenues for each class of breeding animals. The ratio of future breeding value to present <b>cull</b> <b>slaughter</b> value is calculated for each of the 26 classes, each year. These V-ratios, in turn, are decision variables for determining the proportions of animals in each class to be retained in the herd, simulated by a national beef cow demography model. Annual summations from the demography model are compared with objective historical series of January 1 inventories of beef cows and replacement heifers, and annual numbers of <b>cull</b> cows <b>slaughtered</b> and beef calves born. The model's simplicity, ignoring related livestock sectors, is one of its significant features. With its few exogenous price and cost variables, simple biological relationships and management assumptions, the model is able to track the historical numbers of beef cows and calves born quite well. Mean proportional absolute deviations (MPAD) of the simulated series from the objective historical series were computed in addition to simple correlation coefficients and Theil's coefficients of inequality. In a display run, the tracking behavior of the model was best for cow inventories and calves born, and worst for heifer recruitment and cull cows, with MPAD's of. 029,. 036,. 172, and. 261, respectively. Theil's coefficients of inequality were. 405,. 587,. 962, and. 842, respectively. In an alternative run, with parameters set to reflect the assumption that all cows have the same performance characteristics across ages, the tracking behavior of the model was in several aspects about as good as the display run. Thus, the null hypothesis that performance differences across cow ages are of no importance in explaining investment behavior could not be rejected. Simulated national beef cow herd age structure changes through cattle cycles are shown from 1950 through 1978...|$|R

The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to notify public health workers and clinicians of the potential for human infection with these viruses and to describe CDC recommendations for patient investigation and testing, infection control including the use personal protective equipment, and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. Between December 15, 2014, and May 29, 2015, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed more than 200 findings of birds infected with highly-pathogenic {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) A (H 5 N 2), (H 5 N 8), and (H 5 N 1) [1] viruses. The majority of these infections have occurred in poultry, including backyard and commercial flocks. USDA surveillance indicates that more than 40 million birds have been affected (either infected or exposed) in 20 states. These are the first reported infections with these viruses in US wild or domestic birds. While these recently-identified HPAI H 5 viruses are not known to have caused disease in humans, their appearance in North American birds may increase the likelihood of human infection in the United States. Human infection with other avian influenza viruses, including a different HPAI (H 5 N 1) virus found in Asia, Africa, {{and other parts of the}} world; HPAI (H 5 N 6) virus; and (H 7 N 9) virus, has been associated with severe, sometimes fatal, disease. Previous human infections with other avian viruses have most often occurred after unprotected direct physical contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated by avian influenza viruses, being in close proximity to infected birds, or visiting a live poultry market. Human infection with avian influenza viruses has not occurred from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products. For more information on the origin of the recently-identified HPAI H 5 viruses in the United States, their clinical presentation in birds, and their suspected clinical presentation in humans, please see [URL] considers the risk to the general public from these newly-identified US HPAI H 5 viruses to be low; however, people with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated environments may be at greater risk of infection. Until more is known about these newly-identified HPAI H 5 viruses, public health recommendations are largely consistent with guidance for influenza viruses associated with severe disease in humans (e. g., HPAI H 5 N 1 viruses that have caused human infections with high mortality in other countries). Currently, CDC considers these newly-identified HPAI H 5 viruses as having the potential to cause severe disease in humans and recommends the following:Clinicians should consider the possibility of HPAI H 5 virus infection in persons showing signs or symptoms of respiratory illness who have relevant exposure history. This includes persons who have had contact with potentially-infected birds (e. g., handling, <b>slaughtering,</b> defeathering, butchering, <b>culling,</b> preparation for consumption); direct contact with surfaces contaminated with feces or parts (carcasses, internal organs, etc.) of potentially-infected birds; and persons who have had prolonged exposure to potentially-infected birds in a confined space. State health departments are encouraged to investigate potential human cases of HPAI H 5 virus infection as described below and should notify CDC within 24 hours of identifying a case under investigation. Rapid detection and characterization of novel influenza A viruses in humans remain critical components of national efforts to prevent further cases, evaluate clinical illness associated with them, and assess any ability for these viruses to spread among humans. People should avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead birds, bird feces, litter, or materials contaminated with suspected or confirmed HPAI H 5 viruses. All recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn when in direct or close contact (within about 6 feet) with sick or dead poultry, poultry feces, litter or materials contaminated with suspected or confirmed HPAI H 5 viruses. People exposed to HPAI H 5 -infected birds (including people wearing PPE) should be monitored for signs and symptoms consistent with influenza beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Influenza antiviral prophylaxis may be considered to prevent infection (see below). Persons who develop respiratory illness after exposure to HPAI H 5 -infected birds should be tested immediately for influenza by the state health department and be given influenza antiviral treatment (see below). State health departments are encouraged to investigate all possible human infections with HPAI H 5 virus and should notify CDC promptly when testing for avian influenza in people.

40|$|By {{the year}} 2000 the {{potential}} deficit of meat production in sub-Saharan Africa {{is expected to}} be between 3 and 8 million tonnes. This prediction has been made by international organizations such as the FAO, the World Bank and the UN Economic Commission for Africa. The outlook is equally gloomy for milk production. According to data provided by the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) in Addis Ababa, the trade deficit in dairy products will reach between 2. 5 and 4 million tonnes by the year 2000. It therefore comes as a surprise to learn that a potentially rich source of milk and meat production - the dromedary (Camel dromaderius), more commonly known as the onehumped camel-has been all but ignored by development programmes Nevertheless, some recent studies have been done on the potential for largescale camel rearing, and the commercialisation of camel meat for human consumption has already begun in East Africa. The manner in which the camel not only survives in a generally dry, nutritionally poor environment but remains productive is nothing short of remarkable. In this respect, camels are much more impressive than cattle, especially the exotic cattle breeds that have been imported into Africa. Furthermore, the camel - long known as the 'ship of the desert' - is an excellent pack and riding animal. Today's dromedary is a descendant of the genus Camelus which originated in North America. Both the two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus) that is found primarily in East-Central Asia, and the humpless llama, which migrated to South America, share the same origin. Approximately 94 % of the estimated world population of camels are dromedaries, or one-humped camels. Five countries-Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Djibouti - account for 84 % of Africa's dromedaries and 60 % of the world's dromedaries. In West Africa, dromedaries are especially common in Niger, Mauritania and Mali. The world's camel population is estimated at 17 million, with more than 12 million in Africa. Research undertaken by the French Tropical Livestock and Veterinary Institute (IEMVT), and by the Director of Research for the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, Dr. Chema, has brought to our attention the multitude of specialized breeds of camel found throughout the world Camels have a great ability to travel long distances and to feed almost entirely from trees and shrubs. Furthermore, they tend to prune rather than strip vegetation and are known for contributing little to overgrazing, unlike cattle and goats. When pastures have already been grazed by other animals, camels are able to feed from heights not yet touched. 70 % of their feed comes from trees and shrubs, including thorny ones, whereas cattle depend on grasses for 80 % of their feed Camels also have the ability to graze up to 80 km (50 miles) away from a water source and to stay there for several days depending on the water content of their forage. Such is not the case with cattle, not even with those breeds that make up traditional Sahelian herds. In the dry season, cattle cannot go farther than 15 km (10 miles) from a water source. Rendille pastoralists who live in Northern Kenya, have abandoned cattle rearing in favour of camels because of the degradation of pastures due to drought, overgrazing or both. The Pokot and Samburu people, also in Kenya, have begun to introduce camels into their cattle herds The ability of camels to withstand harsh climatic conditions is quite remarkable. During the recent sustained African droughts which inflicted losses of up to 80 % among some cattle herds, camel herds suffered losses of less than 20 %. According to a recent study undertaken in the Sahel, camel herds seem to maintain a stable core of adults aged between 5 to 12 years, who are particularly resistant. This partly explains why camel populations are able to recover quickly after periods of birth mortality. PHYSIOLOGICALLY ADAPTED Camels can survive in arid environments because of their unique physiology. They are able to withstand body temperature variations from 34 ºC (94 o F) in the morning to 41 ºC (105 o. 8 F) in the evening, which enables them to have sufficient heat reserves to survive the bitterly cold desert nights. Unlike other warmblooded animals, camels do not waste their water reserves by sweating when it is hot. Camels are also known for their ability to drink large volumes of water in short periods of time: in Mauritania, for example, camels have been known to swallow 100 litres (over 20 gallons) of water in 7 minutes. Yet another physiological adaptation to the environment is their retention of urine. Whereas watering stimulates urination in cattle, camels are able to retain their water thanks to an antidiuretic hormone (ADH). They also have the capacity to recycle urea through their digestive system, which is a particularly effective survival mechanism during feed shortages. Finally, camels have a very low level of moisture loss through defecation. The camel's humps are used as fat reserves, and their narrow nostrils and long eye-lashes provide good protection against sandstorms and the sun. Furthermore, their lips, mouth and tongue are able to cope with the most thorny desert vegetation. MILK PRODUCTION According to an ILCA study, camels are at least twice as productive as cattle. They can produce considerable quantities of milk, especially when one considers their relatively small intake of forage. To produce one litre (1 3 / 4 pints) of milk, camels need 1. 9 kg (4 pounds) of dry matter as opposed to 9 kg (18 pounds) for cattle Camels are thus able to produce 1, 900 litres (422 gallons) of milk per year whilst cattle native to Africa produce only 300 litres (66 gallons) under similar conditions. Furthermore the lactation period for camels averages between 12 and 14 months whilst that of cattle is about 9 months. Finally, {{it should be noted that}} milk production by camels does not seem to decrease during the dry season whereas it does with cattle. MEAT PRODUCTION Very little camel meat is consumed in Africa and most of the animals <b>slaughtered</b> are old <b>culls</b> that were not raised for butchering. Nevertheiess, the yields are very good. In East Africa, especially in Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia, a substantial number of camels are raised for their meat. Their carcasses are exported to countries such as Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia. For most pastoralists in Africa. The consumption of camel meat is a luxury, but that is not the case elsewhere in the world. In India and the Soviet Union, for example, the respective governments have established large camel ranches. In the case of the Soviet Union, it is the two-humped camel rather than the dromedary that is used. In Africa, however, camels are reared more as a beast of burden than a producer of meat. Those animals that do reach the marketplace are often exhausted, wounded or sick. The only area in West Africa where meat production is emphasized is Northern Nigeria. It should also be remembered that camel blood, drawn periodically from live animals, is regularly consumed by several tribes in East Africa, such as the Rendille and Turkana people. SLOW HERD GROWTH There are, of course, a number of obstacles that need to be overcome before intensive camel rearing can be significantly improved. In their current state, camel herds reproduce rather slowly with a birth rate of about 165 per 1, 000. The mortality of camels under two years old is high, and herd populations can fluctuate widely from one year to the next. This is due essentially to pathological factors that occur during the year, and to food availability. The fertility rate, that is the number of live births per fertile camel, averages about 42 %. This translates into an average of 28 - 30 months between births. Furthermore, camels do not begin to reproduce before the age of 5 to 7 years. Another physiological anomaly with camels is that ovulation is stimulated only by copulation. Thus artificial insemination does not seem, for the moment, to be feasible. However, it has been shown that camels which are well-fed on grasses have more frequent births due in part to higher sexual activity among males and greater resistance to disease. DISEASES Camels suffer from a number of diseases for which treatments are available. As the Koran states, trypanosomiasis and mange are the worst camel afflictions, it is also true that parasites have a considerable negative effect on the herds. According to a recent IEMVT study, haemonchosis is certainly the most serious gastro-intestinal infection that affects camels. Infected animals contaminate pastures causing the rapid spread of the disease. Some medications have been developed to deal with camel parasites. These treatments must be administered primarily to young camels aged between 6 months and 2 years who are victims of their first infection. Females should also be treated during pregnancy to limit the spread of Parasites and to favour lactation. Particular care should be taken during the rainy season as infestations by Haemonchus are frequent and serious at this time. At present, trypanosomiasis is rarely a problem, at least in the Sahel although one form (Trypanosomia evansi) which does affect camels is not transmitted by the tsetse fly. Finally, mange is also a health threat to camels but it can be easily treated by insecticides or injections of antiparasitic drugs. FUTURE OF CAMEL REARING According to the most recent studies, in particular those of Dr. Chema, there are no major barriers to intensive camel rearing for food production. Whereas cattle and smaller ruminants are considered by some to be one of the causes of desertification, local knowledge portrays camels as good producers who do little-environmental damage Certain conditions are required, to ensure that a camel herd is productive. The most important is that there should be between 20 - 40 % males and 40 % fertile females. Under traditional, non-intensive raising, herds grow by about 10 % per year. This weak growth rate is due to several factors including low fertility, high infant mortality and poor nutrition. Improved feeding conditions can reduce the period between births to less than 2 years. RESEARCH Many aspects of camel rearing are still poorly understood and call for further research. For example, we need to know more about the variability of mortality rate according to age, fertility, herd composition, and we also need more detailed studies on food requirements. In France, the IEMVT has undertaken some studies on camels and D. Richard, D. Planchevault and J. F. Giovannetti have just completed a report of their mission on camel production in East-Central Niger. The UN has also recently granted financial support to ILCA for a detailed bibliographic study on camels and an update on on-going research in Africa. The goal of this project is to help design future research programmes. A team was established at ILCA in 1984, under the direction of R. T. Wilson, to study camel productivity, particularly under traditional conditions, and to propose ways of improving. ILCA researchers are also engaged in comparative studies between camels and other ruminants, both wild and domestic. Finally, ILCA is currently looking at the seasonal nature of camel reproduction in the hope of being able to accelerate the reproductive cycle. There is much work to be done before the camel's potential can be more fully realized in Africa, but there is no reason to believe that improvement methodology developed for other forms of livestock cannot be successfully applied to the camel. It is encouraging to see that some development agencies are now taking an interest in camel improvement, and it will be interesting to see what level of success these programmes will be able to achieve. By the year 2000 the potential deficit of meat production in sub-Saharan Africa {{is expected to be}} between 3 and 8 million tonnes. This prediction has been made by international organizations such as the FAO, the World Bank and the UN Economic [...] ...|$|R
