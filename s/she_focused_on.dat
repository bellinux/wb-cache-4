5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101–103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> writing and lecturing.|$|E

5|$|The word lesbian {{is derived}} from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho. From various ancient writings, historians {{gathered}} that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification. Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. <b>She</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Valiente {{began writing}} an {{autobiography}} in which <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> her own place within Wiccan history. It would {{be published by}} Hale in 1989 as The Rebirth of Witchcraft. In this work she did not dismiss the Murrayite witch-cult theory, but she did undermine the belief that Wicca was the survival of it by highlighting the various false claims made by Gardner, Cochrane, and Sanders, instead emphasising what she perceived as the religion's value for the modern era. She also provided a foreword for Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed, a book published in 1990 by Hale. It had been written by Evan John Jones, {{a former member of}} the Clan of Tubal Cain who also lived in Brighton. Heselton has expressed the view that Valiente likely did more than this, and that she wrote a number of the chapters herself.|$|E

25|$|Musgrave's {{career in}} {{elective}} office began in 1991, when she served one term on the Fort Morgan School Board, where <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> changing the local sex education curriculum to abstinence-only. She was {{also involved in}} the Fort Morgan Right To Life chapter, at one time serving as its president. Musgrave was then elected to the Colorado State House of Representatives in 1992, and served there until after her successful 1998 campaign for a Colorado State Senate seat. While serving in the state senate, Musgrave was selected the Senate Republican Caucus Chairman. In 2002, Musgrave ran for the Fourth Congressional District seat being vacated by Bob Schaffer.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} few years of her life, <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> obtaining stable, adequate, {{long-term}} funding to support the maintenance and further development of her Protein Information Resource. She envisioned an online system of computer programs and databases, accessible by scientists all over the world, for identifying protein from sequence or amino acid composition data, for making predictions based on sequences, and for browsing the known information. Less than a week before she died, she submitted a proposal to the Division of Research Resources at NIH for a Protein Identification Resource. After her death, her colleagues continuing working to make her vision a reality, and the protein database was fully operational by the middle of 1984.|$|E
25|$|For about a decade, {{the family}} would wander around France and Europe, living a bohemian lifestyle. In Nice, Saint Phalle and Mathews would have {{separate}} affairs in 1953; after she attacked her husband's mistress, she took an overdose of sleeping pills but they had little effect because she was manic at the time. When Harry discovered a stash of knives, razors, and scissors under a mattress, he took his wife to a mental clinic in Nice, where she was treated with electroshock therapy and insulin shock. Liberated from routine household work, <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> creating artwork instead, and improved enough to be discharged in six weeks. Around the same time, her husband abandoned his music studies and started to write his first novel, eventually switching to a career in writing.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, Clarkson {{began her}} own public affairs {{television}} show Adrienne at Large, {{though this was}} not particularly successful and lasted less than four months. The series did, however, allow her to travel extensively outside of Canada, as she recorded segments for the show in locations such as South Africa (where she interviewed Nadine Gordimer and Helen Suzman), and her native Hong Kong. With the cancellation of the show, the CBC created in 1975 the hard journalism programme The Fifth Estate {{as a means for}} meeting Canadian content requirements. Clarkson was brought on to co-host with Warner Troyer for the first season, but, due to persistent problems between the two, Troyer left the series, leaving Clarkson to host with Peter Reilly and Eric Malling thereafter. <b>She</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> investigative journalism and gained prominence after an in-depth study of the McCain family's business practices led a Senator to publicly accuse her of being un-naturalised.|$|E
25|$|Roberts was a {{real estate}} {{salesperson}} in 1964 when Abe Hirschfeld hired her {{to sit in the}} lobby and sell at 925 Park Avenue in New York. She was a condominium broker in 1968 when she met and began her involvement with the then-married multi-millionaire real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. In 1970, she joined one of Helmsley's brokerage firms—Brown, Harris, Stevens—as a senior vice-president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Helmsley divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. Roberts's marriage to Helmsley may well have saved her career. Late in 1971, several of her tenants sued her for forcing the tenants of one of the apartments she managed to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> running Helmsley's growing hotel empire.|$|E
25|$|During {{her years}} in Puerto Rico, Rodriguez-Trias {{became aware that}} unsuspecting Puerto Rican women were being sterilized and that Puerto Rico was {{being used by the}} United States as a {{laboratory}} for the development of birth control technology. In New York, after attending a conference on abortion at Barnard College in 1970, <b>she</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> reproductive rights of women and became an advocate for women's reproductive rights, campaigning for change at a policy level. In 1970, Rodriguez-Trias was a founding member of Committee to End Sterilization Abuse and in 1971, {{a founding member of the}} Women's Caucus of the American Public Health Association. Rodriguez-Trias supported abortion rights, fought for the abolishment of enforced sterilization, and sought that neonatal care to underserved people be provided. In 1979, Rodriguez-Trias became a founding member of the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse and testified before the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for passage of federal sterilization guidelines. The guidelines, which she drafted, require a woman's written consent to sterilization, offered in a language they can understand, and set a waiting period between the consent and the sterilization procedure. She is credited with helping to expand the range of public health services for women and children in minority and low-income populations in the United States, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.|$|E
