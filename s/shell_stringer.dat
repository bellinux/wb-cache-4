40|$|Structural {{models are}} {{examined}} for {{the influence of}} a ring with an asymmetrical cross section on the linear elastic response of an orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell subjected to internal pressure. The first structural model employs classical theory for the shell and stiffeners. The second model employs transverse shear deformation theories for the <b>shell</b> and <b>stringer</b> and classical theory for the ring. Closed-end pressure vessel effects are included. Interacting line load intensities are computed in the stiffener-to-skin joints for an example problem having the dimensions of the fuselage of a large transport aircraft. Classical structural theory is found to exaggerate the asymmetric response compared to the transverse shear deformation theory...|$|R
40|$|A design {{procedure}} is presented for compressed cylindrical <b>shells</b> stiffened by <b>stringers</b> and rings. The approach is indirect and begins {{by considering the}} applied stress level as a primary design variable. A new method for the sizing and spacing of rings is outlined and illustrated. Emphasis is placed upon the achievement of a minimum weight design within practical constraints imposed by parameter values...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrical shells {{are common}} {{configurations}} within the technology. The {{transition from the}} side to the bottom on a ship has {{the shape of a}} fourth of a cylindrical shell. Both ring and stringer stiffeners can be added to the shell for support. Buckling of this type of structure is an important area of interest. The main purpose of this thesis has been to make a semi-analytical model that can describe how a ring stiffened <b>shell</b> and <b>stringer</b> stiffened <b>shell</b> respond during buckling. A variety of loads have been subjected to the shell model. Simple analytical expressions do not exist for clamped shells or shells subjected to shear and numerical methods must be used. The development of the model has been done by use of linear buckling theory and an energy method, the Rayleigh Ritz method. The model has been programmed in Fortran. Eigenvalues and associated eigenmodes have been found. The semi-analytical model has been verified against the finite element analysis software Abaqus. The results from the models were in good agreement with each other. The apply of the semi-analytical model on a bilge structure showed a deviation in the results. A small difference in the boundary conditions, with the element model being stiffer due to the edges being held straight, was causing the deviation. The difference in the results from the semi-analytical model and the element model was smaller for the ring stiffened shell than for the unstiffened <b>shell</b> and the <b>stringer</b> stiffened <b>shell.</b> The buckling load calculated by the semi-analytical model were on the conservative side compared with the element model...|$|R
40|$|Pakar and M Bayat In this study, we try {{to analyze}} the free {{nonlinear}} vibration of a <b>stringer</b> <b>shell</b> analytically. The nonlinear governing equation {{of the problem is}} derived. Homotopy perturbation method is applied completely to obtain the analytical solution of the problem. We try to provide engineers and designers to achieve the nonlinear frequency of nonlinear problems especially shell vibrations with an easy method. The effects of different parameters on the ratio of nonlinear to linear natural frequency of shells are completely studied. The homotopy perturbation method gives us an excellent agreement with numerical results for whole range of the oscillation amplitude. The first order of homotopy perturbation method leads us to highly accurate solutions as indicated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{transmission}} of airborne noise into an aircraft fuselage, a mathematical model is presented for the transmission of an oblique plane sound wave into a finite cylindrical <b>shell</b> stiffened by <b>stringers</b> and ring frames. The rings and stringers are modeled as discrete structural elements. The numerical case studied was typical of a narrow-bodied jet transport fuselage. The numerical results show that the ring-frequency dip in the transmission loss curve that is present for a monocoque shell is still present {{in the case of a}} stiffened shell. The ring frequency effect is a result of the cylindrical geometry of the shell. Below the ring frequency, stiffening does not appear to have any significant effect on transmission loss, but above the ring frequency, stiffeners can enhance the transmission loss of a cylindrical shell...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} FEM calculations {{using the}} program package MSC/NASTRAN for linear buckling analysis of orthotropic <b>stringer</b> <b>shells.</b> In the flat case stringer panels under combined shear and compressive load are calculated and compared with analytical results. FEM results for orthotropic curved shell strips are indicated and compared {{taking into account}} different boundary conditions. FEM results for orthotropic curved shell strips taking into account different boundary conditions are indicated and compared with analytical calculations. The local sectional buckling of <b>stringer</b> stiffened <b>shells</b> is investigated for different skin-stringer combinations. With the solutions of the panel strip supported at one side one obtains the limits of sectional buckling. Comparing these with FEM calculations, it can be indicated that the curvature of the skin warrants expectations of {{a significant increase in}} local section buckling. In addition to this, conclusions are drawn for an analytical modeling of the section buckling of shells. (orig.)

30|$|The {{stiffeners}} {{are used}} to make shells with significantly increasing stiffness. Thus, to study these structures have been a remarkable trend of researchers in the recent years. The most powerful numerical tool for investigation of mechanical response of stiffened laminated composite shell structures with stiffeners is finite-element method: Bucalem and Bathe (1997), Scordelis and Lo (1964), Prusty (2003), Goswami and Mukhopadhyay (1994, 1995). The literature on the analytical free vibration analysis of stiffened shell {{is limited to a}} few published articles. Mustafa and Ali (1989) presented the energy method to determine the natural frequency of orthogonally stiffened isotropic cylindrical shells. Lee and Kim (1998) studied the vibration of the rotating composite cylindrical shell with orthogonal stiffeners using energy method. Zhao et al. (2002) used the Loveâ€™s shell theory and the energy approach, and carried out the vibration analysis of simply supported rotating cross-ply laminated composite cylindrical <b>shells</b> with <b>stringer</b> and ring stiffeners. Bich et al. (2012, 2013), Bich and Nguyen (2012) used the smeared stiffeners technique, carried out the nonlinear analysis of eccentrically stiffened functionally graded cylindrical shell/panel, and eccentrically stiffened functionally graded shallow shell, (Bich and Van Tung 2011; Bich et al. 2011). Nonlinear dynamic response, buckling and post-buckling analysis of imperfect eccentrically stiffened functionally graded doubly curved shallow shell resting on elastic foundation in thermal environment using smeared technique are presented in works of Duc and Cong (2014), Duc (2013), Duc and Quan (2012). Orthotropic circular cylindrical shells with closed ends stiffened by equally spaced stringers and rings subjected to combinations of uniform internal pressure, constant temperature change, and axial load are investigated by Wang and Hsu (1985). Wattanasakulpong and Chaikittiratana (2015) investigated the free vibration characteristic of stiffened doubly curved shallow shells made of functionally graded materials under thermal environment. The first-order shear deformation theory is employed to derive the governing equations used for determining natural frequencies of the stiffened shells. The governing equations can be solved analytically to obtain exact solutions for this problem.|$|R
