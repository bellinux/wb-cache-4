25|$|The {{second class}} of {{synthesis}} routes include the oxidation reactions of various 2,5-disubstituted furans utilizing {{a variety of}} inorganic oxidants. Several routes to FDCA via oxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with air over different catalysts have been reported. Oxidation of HMF under strongly alkaline conditions over noble metal catalysts gives almost quantitative formation of FDCA. HMF and methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) oxidation was also studied {{with a series of}} conventional metal bromide catalysts (Co, Mn, Br) used for the oxidation of para-xylene to terephthalic acid. Also, the direct, one pot dehydration and oxidation of fructose to FDCA via intermediate HMF has been investigated with good <b>selectivities,</b> unfortunately this system does not work in water.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of effort}} has been put into {{controlling}} cell selectivity. For example, {{attempts have been made}} to modify and optimize the physicochemical parameters of the peptides to control the <b>selectivities,</b> including net charge, helicity, hydrophobicity per residue (H), hydrophobic moment (μ) and the angle subtended by the positively charged polar helix face (Φ). Other mechanisms like the introduction of D-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells. It has also been found that Pro→Nlys substitution in Pro-containing β-turn antimicrobial peptides was a promising strategy for the design of new small bacterial cell-selective antimicrobial peptides with intracellular mechanisms of action. It has been suggested that direct attachment of magainin to the substrate surface decreased nonspecific cell binding and led to improved detection limit for bacterial cells such as Salmonella and E. coli.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Rh and Fe loading, and {{promoters}} on CO hydrogenation performance over Rh-Fe/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were investigated, {{as well as}} the stability of the catalysts. The results showed that with the increasing of Fe loading, methanol <b>selectivity</b> produced from syngas increased continuously accompanying by the decrease in methane <b>selectivity,</b> but the ethanol <b>selectivity</b> had a maximum value. The addition of alkaline or alkaline earth metals promoted methanol coupling or CO dissociation and insertion, or suppressed hydrogenation ability more or less, as a result, ethanol <b>selectivity</b> enhanced, and methanol <b>selectivity</b> decreased, but hydrocarbon <b>selectivity</b> remained almost unchanged. With CO hydrogenation reaction proceeding, hydrocarbon <b>selectivity</b> decreased, but methanol <b>selectivity</b> increased gradually, unfortunately, ethanol <b>selectivity</b> decreased, and the additions of promoters had little effect on it, probably due to the reduction of Fe species by syngas or decreasing of Rh-Fe interface areas during reaction...|$|R
30|$|When using Al 2 O 3 –B 2 O 3 as the support, the {{resultant}} carbide catalyst performance for HAS from syngas {{is shown in}} Fig.  5. Interestingly, the catalyst showed relatively high activity for CO conversion at 220  °C, CO conversion goes up to 20  % for a while at 220  °C, with CH 4 <b>selectivity</b> less than 4  % and almost no CO 2 produced. The <b>selectivity</b> to liquid is more than 90  %, but dropped with the time on stream at 220  °C. This suggests that the catalyst active site or surface property might change quickly in the initial reaction stage, which {{does not lead to}} reach the steady state, and CO conversion dropped from nearly 20 to 6  % at 220  °C without changing the other conditions, and the methane <b>selectivity</b> rises gradually. When increasing the reaction temperature, the CO conversion increases slowly, but the CH 4 <b>selectivity</b> and CO 2 <b>selectivity</b> increase when the liquid <b>selectivity</b> decreases rapidly. At 245  °C, CO conversion increased to 10  %, but CO 2 <b>selectivity</b> increased to 22  %, and methane <b>selectivity</b> changed to 7  %; however, the liquid <b>selectivity</b> decreased to 62  %. When raising the reactor temperature to 255  °C, the liquid <b>selectivity</b> dropped to 53  %, CO 2 <b>selectivity</b> raised to 30  %, with CH 4 <b>selectivity</b> increase of 8.2  %. This suggests that increase of the temperature leads to more CO converting to CO 2, not favoring the liquid formation. This can be understood from the thermodynamic view. As the liquid alcohol synthesis is a strong exothermic reaction, while the conversion of CO to CO 2 is favored by high temperature. Increasing the reaction temperature to 265  °C leads to CO conversion to 20  %, but CO 2 <b>selectivity</b> to 38  %, and the liquid <b>selectivity</b> dropped to 42  %. The CH 4 <b>selectivity</b> slightly increases.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- <b>Selectivity</b> of {{a number}} of vermiculites, montmorillonites and micas for K and Cs ions was {{determined}} by sorption of these ions from equilibrium solutions of diverse concentrations. The selec-tivity coefficients were related to the layer charge density and the area of the frayed edges in layer silicates. Montmorillonites had the smallest <b>selectivity</b> for the two ions, while biotite and illite had the great-est <b>selectivity.</b> <b>Selectivity</b> of biotite and illite was limited to small concentrations of K, however. At greater concentrations the <b>selectivity</b> of vermiculite for K exceeded the <b>selectivity</b> of the micas. The greater <b>selectivity</b> of vermiculites than montmorillonites for K and Cs ions was attributed to the greater layer charge density in vermiculites. The greater <b>selectivity</b> of micas than montmorillonites and vermiculites was attributed to the frayed edges of micas in addition to their larger layer charge density. As the frayed edRes in illite were increased inarea by removal of the interlayer K, the selec-tivity of illite for K also increased; thus confirming the <b>selectivity</b> of frayed edges for the K ions...|$|R

50|$|Gregory Fu {{and colleagues}} have {{developed}} a methodology utilizing a chiral DMAP analogue to achieve excellent kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Initial studies utilizing ether as a solvent, low catalyst loadings (2 mol %), acetic anhydride as the acylating agent, and triethylamine at room temperature gave <b>selectivities</b> ranging from 14-52, corresponding to ee's of the recovered alcohol product as high as 99.2%. However, solvent screening proved {{that the use of}} tert-amyl alcohol increased both the reactivity and selectivity.With the benchmark substrate 1-phenylethanol, this corresponded to 99% ee of the unreacted alcohol at 55% conversion when run at 0 °C. This system proved to be adept at resolution of a number of arylalkylcarbinols, with <b>selectivities</b> as high as 95 and low catalyst loadings of 1%, as shown below utilizing the (-)-enantiomer of the catalyst. This resulted in highly enantioenriched alcohols at very low conversions, giving excellent yields as well. In addition, the high <b>selectivities</b> result in highly enantioenriched acylated products, with a 90% ee sample of acylated alcohol for o-tolylmethylcarbinol, with s=71.In addition, Fu reported the first highly selective acylation of racemic diols (as well as desymmetrization of meso diols). With low catalyst loading of 1%, enantioenriched diol was recovered in 98% ee and 43% yield, with the diacetate in 39% yield and 99% ee. The remainder of the material was recovered as a mixture of monoacetate.The planar-chiral DMAP catalyst was also shown to be effective at kinetically resolving propargylic alcohols. In this case, though, <b>selectivities</b> were found to be highest without any base present. When run with 1 mol% of the catalyst at 0 °C, <b>selectivities</b> as high as 20 could be attained. The limitations of this method include the requirement of an unsaturated functionality, such as carbonyl or alkenes, at the remote alkynyl position. Alcohols resolved using the (+)-enantiomer of the DMAP catalyst are shown below.Fu also showed his chiral DMAP catalyst's ability to resolve allylic alcohols.Effective selectivity was dependent upon the presence of either a geminal or cis substituent to the alcohol-bearing group, with a notable exception of a trans-phenyl alcohol which exhibited the highest selectivity. Using 1-2.5 mol% of the (+)-enantiomer of the DMAP catalyst, the alcohols shown below were resolved in the presence of triethylamine.While Fu's DMAP analogue catalyst worked exceptionally well to kinetically resolve racemic alcohols, it was not successful in use for the kinetic resolution of amines. A similar catalyst, PPY*, was developed that, in use with a novel acylating agent, allowed for the successful kinetic resolution acylation of amines. With 10 mol% (-)-PPY* in chloroform at -50 °C, good to very good <b>selectivities</b> were observed in the acylation of amines, shown below. A similar protocol was developed for the kinetic resolution of indolines.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the hardest}} {{problems}} in query optimization is to accurately estimate the costs of alternative query plans. Optimizers cost query plans using a mathematical model of query execution costs that relies heavily on estimates of the cardinality, or number of tuples, flowing through each edge in a query plan. Cardinality estimation in turn depends on estimates of the selection factor of predicates in the query. Traditionally, database systems estimate <b>selectivities</b> through fairly detailed statistics {{on the distribution of}} values in each column, such as histograms. This technique works well for estimation of <b>selectivities</b> of individual predicates. However many queries have conjunctions of predicates such as select count(*) from R where R.make='Honda' and R.model='Accord'. Query predicates are often highly correlated (for example, [...] implies [...] ), and {{it is very hard to}} estimate the selectivity of the conjunct in general. Poor cardinality estimates and uncaught correlation are one of the main reasons why query optimizers pick poor query plans.
