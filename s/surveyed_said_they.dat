25|$|According to a 2010 survey, {{awareness}} of the reforms varies widely within the Moroccan population, with younger, urban, and educated women {{far more likely to}} have heard of the law and have some familiarity with its provisions than women in rural areas, those with less education, and older women. Of Moroccans who have heard of the new Mudawana, 85% of women and 59% of men support the reforms. Most men who oppose the reforms believe the law negatively impacts them, gives greater weight to their spouses' demands, and view it as contrary to their religious beliefs. Women's dissatisfaction with the Mudawana, however, reflects a belief that it is not implemented widely and successfully enough to address the problems of women's rights. Two-thirds of Moroccan women <b>surveyed</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> felt the new Mudawana had improved women's status in Morocco, and 50% of men agreed.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites <b>surveyed</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E

[...] Scientific American reported on this: [...] "One in 25 British psychiatrists and psychologists say {{they would be willing to}} help homosexual and bisexual patients try to convert to heterosexuality, even though there is no compelling scientific evidence a person can willfully become straight", and explained that 17% of those <b>surveyed</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> had tried to help reduce or suppress homosexual feelings, and 4% said they would try to help homosexual people convert to heterosexuality in the future.|$|E
