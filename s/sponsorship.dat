5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate <b>sponsorship</b> of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate <b>sponsorship</b> swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of <b>sponsorship</b> deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate <b>sponsorship</b> and the sale of television rights.|$|E

50|$|The NCAA is not {{involved}} in college bass fishing, which allows teams to use <b>sponsorships</b> to their advantage. <b>Sponsorships</b> allow bass fishermen to represent and advertise a company, receiving gear, publicity, and sometimes money in return. Also, lack of NCAA involvement in college bass fishing allows college bass fishermen to win money. This subject is very controversial, as college bass fishing is one of only a couple of collegiate sports where college athletes can actually win money (Cycling for example). However, if the NCAA got involved with college bass fishing, {{that would be the end}} of not only college fishermen being eligible to win money but also the end of <b>sponsorships.</b> <b>Sponsorships</b> mean the world to bass fishermen, whether at the collegiate or professional level. Without <b>sponsorships,</b> bass fishing would be a different sport.|$|R
