The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.

A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E

5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which <b>suppresses</b> the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E

This paper gives an optimal linear-time algorithm for testing whether there exist nontrivial analytic invariants in terms of the <b>suppressed</b> cells in a given set of <b>suppressed</b> cells.

5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol <b>suppresses</b> release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E

50|$|Antigonadotropins are drugs which <b>suppress</b> the GnRH-mediated {{secretion}} of gonadotropins {{from the}} pituitary gland. Gonadotropins include luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and are peptide hormones that signal the gonads to produce sex hormones.

GnRH analogues, including both GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists, are powerful antigonadotropins {{that are able to}} <b>suppress</b> androgen levels by 95% in men. In addition, estrogens and progestogens are antigonadotropins via exertion of negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and high-dose estrogens are able to <b>suppress</b> androgen levels to castrate levels in men similarly to GnRH analogues, while high-dose progestogens are able to <b>suppress</b> androgen levels by up to approximately 70 to 80% in men.|$|R
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases.

IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E

Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also <b>suppresses</b> the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E

This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter.

Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8).

40|$|Macrophage-derived foam cells play {{important}} roles in the progression of atherosclerosis. We reported previously that ERK 1 / 2 -dependent granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression, leading to p 38 MAPK/ Akt signaling, is important for oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) -induced macrophage proliferation. Here, we investigated whether activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could <b>suppress</b> macrophage proliferation. Ox-LDL-induced proliferation of mouse peritoneal macrophages was assessed by [3 H]thymidine incorporation and cell counting assays. The proliferation was significantly inhibited by the AMPK activator 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and restored by dominant-negative AMPKα 1, suggesting that AMPK activation <b>suppressed</b> macrophage proliferation. AICAR partially <b>suppressed</b> Ox-LDL-induced ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation and GM-CSF expression, suggesting that another mechanism is also involved in the AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. AICAR <b>suppressed</b> GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation without <b>suppressing</b> p 38 MAPK/Akt signaling. GM-CSF <b>suppressed</b> p 53 phosphorylation and expression and induced Rb phosphorylation. Overexpression of p 53 or p 27 kip <b>suppressed</b> GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. AICAR induced cell cycle arrest, increased p 53 phosphorylation and expression, and <b>suppressed</b> GM-CSF-induced Rb phosphorylation via AMPK activation. Moreover, AICAR induced p 21 cip and p 27 kip expression via AMPK activation, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of p 21 cip and p 27 kip restored AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. In conclusion, AMPK activation <b>suppressed</b> Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation by <b>suppressing</b> GM-CSF expression and inducing cell cycle arrest. These effects of AMPK activation may represent therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis...|$|R
