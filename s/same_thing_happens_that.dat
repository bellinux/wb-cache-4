50|$|Although dumb pipes mostly {{refer to}} {{telecommunication}} companies, now that fintech companies are gaining {{more of the}} financial services’ market share, there is fear that banks may also become dumb pipe companies. In regards to the telecommunication sector, {{an example of a}} dumb pipe company would be a service provider like Verizon. Before smartphones, primarily Apple’s iPhone, became popular, companies like Verizon once controlled everything on a phone from the applications to the ringtones available. However, Apple took over and decided to focus solely on the phone and its interface instead of its wireless service. Consumers became loyal to Apple due to interface exposure and less loyal to their wireless providers, like Verizon. If a customer moved to a different area where AT&T’s signal was stronger than Verizon’s, he/she would easily switch providers while keeping their iPhone, ultimately making telecommunication companies dumb pipes. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to the telecommunication industry is now happening to the financial services sectors. Customers are becoming loyal to the interfaces created by fintech companies and merely connecting their bank accounts to fintech programs. Essentially, there is nothing stopping the consumer from switching their bank and continuing to connect their accounts to services provided by fintech companies. The main concern for financial services companies is that by becoming a dumb pipe, they lose significant value.|$|R

Instead of following the political logic they follow media logic. Nicolas Sarkozy has usually done so in terms of national/domestic politics, however what I show is the fact that a foreign policy can also be lead by the permanent campaign - or to be more precise that politicians are trying to appeal on the national audience through the permanent campaign, and on public abroad through public diplomacy, it is practically the <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> It can <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> politicians care more about the media and less about their own policies; this can be certain aspect observed on the case of the Mediterranean Union's project.

Due to their social {{differences}} and Renata's current position, the couple decides to keep their love a secret. During Vítor and Elaine's wedding anniversary, Arthur presents Renata to the family as his fiancé. Unfortunately Arthur's mother becomes blindingly mad and banishes her future daughter-in-law from the house. Vítor becomes amazed with the similarities that Renata shares with her mother Marina, and immediately becomes suspicious {{that she is the}} girl who disappeared all those years ago. Much more than these similarities, Vitor becomes suspicious that she could be there to take back Vitor's dinheiro (money). But the passion that Vítor felt for Marina starts to resurface, Renata's figure was too reminiscent to her mother's. Thus, the loving triangle begins, between Renata, Arthur, and Vitor. Vitor's passion for Renata's mother comes back and finds a place in Renata's likeness. Elaine feels the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> more than 20 years ago is repeating itself, and this time Elaine will do anything to make sure that she doesn't lose Vítor. Renata begins to live in the very same loft that belonged to her mother. When Renata finds the picture that was taken of Marina during her maternity period, she has a realization about her mother. Renata and Arthur surpass the problems and traumas of the past together and proceed to take it all as a blessing and a gift, because in the end if none of the bad things in the past didn't happen then Renata and Arthur would never had met and fell in love.|$|R

Google Earth has a huge collection of 3 D models and it only continues to grow as users all over the world continue to contribute new models. As new buildings are built new models are also created.

While Google Earth shows the most current data, many users would also benefit from being able to view historical data. Google Earth has acknowledged this with the ability to view historical images with the manipulation of a time slider. However, this feature does not apply to 3 D models of buildings, which remain in the environment even when viewing a time before their existence. I would like to build upon this concept by proposing a system that stores 3 D models of historical buildings that have been demolished and replaced by new developments. People may want to view the old cities that they grew up in which have undergone huge developments over the years. Old neighborhoods may be completely transformed with new road and buildings. In addition to being able to view historical buildings, users may want to view statistics of a given area. Users can view such data in their raw format but using 3 D visualizations of statistical data allows for a greater understanding and appreciation of historical changes. I propose to enhance the visualization of the 3 D world by allowing users to graphically view statistical data such as population, ethnic groups, education, crime, and income. With this feature users will not only be able to see physical changes in the environment, but also statistical changes over time...|$|R

At first, this works because Frannie is hovering over his shoulder, however Marcus continues the conversations when Frannie is not around and it is unclear exactly who Jeffrey likes.

She calls Jenn, another friend, and they realize that Jeffrey was not falling for Frannie, but for 'Marcus posing as Frannie. Frannie seduces Jeffrey by wearing a negligee and serving him ginseng-laced hot cacao, but when he throws up, she decides he must be gay. Marcus and Frannie reconcile, and she tells him of her suspicions of Jeffrey's sexuality. They decide to take Jeffrey to a meeting of the school's Gay-Straight Alliance, but this does not give them any information, so Marcus decides hook up with Jeffrey. While waiting for Marcus to see a movie, Glenn, Jeffrey's best friend, shows up, telling her that Marcus told him to go there. Marcus calls, telling Frannie he cannot make it and she realizes that Marcus is setting her up with Glenn. She tells Glenn about it, and he reveals that he is gay and denys that Jeffrey is.

40|$|Background In {{clinical}} practice, {{the assessments}} provided by relatives {{are treated as}} a source of information about the emotional-cognitive difficulties manifested by a customer. Usually, those opinions are treated as objective data, i. e. data that indicate the real possibilities of the evaluated person. Data suggest that personality and affective factors of the assessing individual may modify the manner of describing an individual person in one’s care, regardless of the actual difficulties experienced by that individual. Participants and procedure In the study, the scale of the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) was used in the version investigating oneself, a peer and an elderly individual in relation to whom the assessing individual undertakes care and support activities. The MFQ is relevant to different aspects of memory. The MFQ is composed of 64 questions grouped in scales composed of different numbers of items. Low results on the scales and a low general result illustrate the feeling that one experiences memory difficulties, whereas higher results illustrate the feeling that one’s memory is highly efficient. The participants (N = 65 individuals; 61 % female and 29 % male) were between 40 and 76 years old (M = 51. 50 and SD = 7. 25). In the analyses, the intensity of depression (GDS) and of positive and negative emotionality – state and trait (SUPIN) – of the assessing individual were taken into consideration, assuming that their intensity would correlate with opinions relevant to mnemonic capacities (one’s own and those of other people). Results On average, the participants assess their mnemonic competence as higher than that of their peers and of the elderly. The higher the level of abilities which the former ascribe to themselves, the better are those which are ascribed by them to a peer and an elderly individual. Negative affectivity shapes the conviction that one’s own mnemonic competence is deteriorating, and <b>that</b> the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>happening</b> to <b>that</b> of a peer/an elderly individual as well. Conclusions Evaluation of the psychological functioning of a customer prepared by relatives/a caregiver can indicate symptoms of subclinical severity. There exists a connection between the affective-personality traits of a caregiver and the manner of the assessment of mnemonic competence (one’s own and that of near relations). The direction of those connections is not clear. The negative affectivity of a near relation/caregiver may result in formulating negative opinions about oneself, and about those in their care. Conversely, typical developmental memory changes in oneself and others can cause anxiety and depressive mood...|$|R
