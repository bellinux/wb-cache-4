40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors {{assessed}} {{whether the}} small-molecular-weight magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents dysprosium diethylenetriamepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (<b>sprodiamide</b> injection), which enhances T 2 *, and gadolinium diethylenetriamepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (gadodiamide injection), which enhances T 1, could improve {{the detection of}} reperfused ischemia of the rat intestine. METHODS: Eighteen rats were subjected to vascular occlusion of the distal ileum for 30 minutes, followed by reperfusion. Ten minutes after reperfusion, T 1 - and T 2 -weighted spin-echo (SE) images were obtained before and after administration of <b>sprodiamide,</b> gadodiamide, or both. The same imaging protocol was applied in another group of 18 rats subjected to 10 minutes of occlusion and reperfusion. Histologic examination of the intestine was performed after MR imaging. RESULTS: Villous injury (ie, denudation) was observed in most cases after 30 minutes of occlusion, but not after 10 minutes of occlusion. After 30 minutes of occlusion, the superficial part of the ischemic intestine was hyperintense to the normal intestine on unenhanced T 2 -weighted images. Administration of <b>sprodiamide</b> improved {{the contrast between the}} normal and ischemic intestine on T 2 -weighted images, and administration of both gadodiamide and <b>sprodiamide</b> improved the contrast on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. After 10 minutes of occlusion, no contrast was discernible before or after contrast material administration. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the detection of reperfused intestinal ischemia of sufficient duration to cause villous injury can be improved by using <b>sprodiamide</b> injection alone or in combination with gadodiamide...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{evolution}} of a photochemically induced cortical infarct was monitored using T- 2 -, postcontrast (GdDOTA) T- 1 -, and postcontrast (DyDTPA-BMA) T- 2 *-weighted NMR imaging techniques. Data acquired with these different NMR imaging types were compared, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The T- 2 *-weighted NMR images after <b>sprodiamide</b> injection (DyDTPA-BMA) were perfusion-weighted images that allowed the differentiation between several infarct-related areas in terms of different degrees of perfusion deficiency. No quantitative information on cerebral blood flow (CBF) was obtained. A clear distinction was made between areas with a complete lack of CBF located {{in the core of}} the lesion and temporary CBF insufficiencies in the rim surrounding this core. Concomitant observations on T- 2 -weighted and postcontrast T- 1 -weighted images revealed the same temporary rim characterized by an increased water content, and an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), as well as by reduced perfusion. This rim appeared within the first hours after infarct induction, reached a maximum 24 h later, and lasted between 3 - 5 days, when its size gradually decreased until complete disappearance. These observations suggest the existence of an area at risk. Only on postcontrast T- 1 -weighted images, the core of the lesion remained visible during the whole experimental period (10 days) and reflected in all likelihood the irreversibly damaged ischemic central core. The combined application of different NMR imaging techniques when studying focal cerebral infarctions in the rat brain allowed us to distinguish, in terms of NMR characteristics, zones of reversible from irreversible brain damage and to estimate the severity of the damage. This might offer an appropriate experimental setup for the screening of cerebroprotective compounds...|$|E
