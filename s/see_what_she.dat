5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E
25|$|When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja {{also tells}} Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, {{saying it was}} someone else, and goes with her to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> discovered. It is {{revealed}} that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, {{under the command of}} Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.|$|E

Henry is encouraged by both his mothers to ask Violet out on a date. Meanwhile, in Storybrooke, Emma uses Merida to turn Gold into the hero she needs to release Excalibur as the heroes {{come up with a plan}} to break into Emma's home to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has in the basement.|$|E

25|$|At that time, the men's {{basketball}} team at Indiana was coached by future Hall of Fame coach Bobby Knight. While Knight {{was not a}} direct influence on VanDerveer's choice of school, {{he may have been}} had an indirect effect. The Indiana women's coach, Bea Gorton, patterned her style of play and practices after Knight, and it was the observation of the style of play at the AIAW event that persuaded her to choose Indiana. The effect would become more direct. Because Gorton designed her practices based upon what she observed from Knight, VanDerveer started attending Knight's practices to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would be doing later that day in practice. VanDerveer carried what she learned from Knight to her practices at Stanford.|$|E
25|$|Back at the diner, Hook enlists Robin into a plan {{to check}} Emma's house and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had in the basement. As Granny hands Belle a dinner plate, Belle, to her surprise, notices her rose's petals being restored, a sign that Mr. Gold is waking up, but when she returns to the pawnshop, he's not there. At Emma's house, Emma has taken Gold - and Hook's sword - since {{it was the last}} item that Gold touched when before he became the Dark One, which is what is needed to heal him. Emma wakes Gold up, by {{performing}} a healing spell, destroying the blade. She reveals that his heart is a blank slate and promises to make him the purest hero. She hints that she wants him to pull Excalibur out of the stone, in order to vanquish the light.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, {{the song}} was {{included}} on the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) [...] "Filthy Fifteen" [...] list, for the sexual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder Tipper Gore had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line [...] "Gonna dress you up in my love" [...] as exemplifying 'vulgar music'. The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors– a rating system based on lyrical content. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] received a rating of 'S', for [...] "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA. Gore commented on the song: [...] "Popular culture is morally bankrupt, flagrantly licentious and utterly materialistic—and Madonna is the worst of all." [...] According to Bruce David Forbes and H. Mahan in their book Religion and Popular Culture in America, Madonna's fans took the attitude [...] "Can't you cultural conservatives <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is trying to do—to annoy people like you! If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Stop trying to police my morality!" [...] The campaign was successful {{and led to the}} creation of the Parental Advisory sticker.|$|E

Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E

500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees {{that it is a}} recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|E

It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours.

2500|$|Sondheim detested his mother, who {{was said}} to be psychologically abusive and {{projected}} her anger from her failed marriage on her son: [...] "When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat up on, you <b>see.</b> <b>What</b> <b>she</b> did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time." [...] She once wrote him a letter saying that the [...] "only regret [...] ever had was giving him birth." [...] When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|Julia Caroline (Ripley) Dorr (February 13, 1825 – January 18, 1913) was an American {{author who}} {{published}} both prose and poetry. Although {{she wrote a}} number of novels and works on travel, she was {{best known for her}} poetry. Her work was conservative; she did not write anything that she felt was improper for children to hear, and was described as consisting of [...] "respectable but not highly distinguished or passionate phrases to the conventional wisdom of her time and place." [...] She had a keen sense of form and, working as she did in several mediums, to her belonged the distinction of never attempting to say in verse what might better find expression in prose. To her sense of form she added a clear-seeing eye, and the ability so to fit words together as to make others <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw.|$|E
2500|$|Merman {{returned}} to Broadway {{at the behest}} of her third husband, Continental Airlines executive Robert Six, who was upset she had chosen to become a Colorado housewife following their wedding in 1953. He expected her public appearances to engender publicity for the airline, and her decision to forgo the limelight did not sit well with him. He urged her to accept the lead in Happy Hunting, with a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (who had written Call Me Madam) and a score by the unknown team of Harold Karr and Matt Dubey. Merman acquiesced to her husband's demands, although she clashed with the composers from the start and soon was at odds with co-star Fernando Lamas and his wife, Arlene Dahl, who frequently attended rehearsals. Based on the Merman name, the show opened in New York with an advance sale of $1.5 million and, despite the star's dissatisfaction with it, garnered respectable reviews. Although Brooks Atkinson thought the score was [...] "hardly more than adequate", he called Merman [...] "as brassy as ever, glowing like a neon light whenever she steps on the stage." [...] Several months into the run, she insisted that two of her least-favorite numbers be replaced by songs written by her friend Roger Edens, who, because of his exclusive contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, credited them to Kay Thompson. She lost the Tony Award to Judy Holliday in Bells Are Ringing, and the show closed after 412 performances, with Merman happy to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> considered [...] "a dreary obligation" [...] finally come to an end.|$|E

2500|$|The Emperor did not {{normally}} get up until noon, had brunch at about 2pm before {{going back to}} bed for another rest, to be followed up by playing tennis or table tennis, riding his bicycle or his car aimlessly around {{the grounds of the}} palace or listening to his vast collection of Chinese opera records. Puyi become a devoted Buddhist, a mystic and a vegetarian, having statues of the Buddha put up all over the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to while banning his staff from eating meat. Puyi's Buddhism led him to ban his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found any insects or mice droppings in his food, the cooks were flogged. When Puyi went into the gardens to mediate before a statue of the Buddha, there always had to be complete silence, and as there were two loud Japanese cranes living in the garden, the emperor always had his servants flogged if the cranes made a sound. One day when out for a stroll in the gardens, Puyi found that a servant had written in chalk on one of the rocks: [...] "Haven't the Japanese humiliated you enough?" [...] When Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he gave them long lectures on the [...] "glorious" [...] history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing Emperors with himself, a miserable man living as a prisoner in his own palace. The Empress Wanrong retreated in seclusion as she became addicted to opium, and her father stopped visiting the Salt Tax Palace as he could not bear to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had become. Wanrong, who detested her husband, liked to mock him behind his back by performing skits before the servants by putting on dark glasses and imitating Puyi's jerky movements. During his time in Tianjin, Puyi had started wearing dark glasses at all times, as during the interwar period wearing dark glasses in Tianjin was a way of signifying one was a homosexual or bisexual.|$|E
