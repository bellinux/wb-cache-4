Derepression of the pL promoter led to the synthesis of a protein of the same molecular weight as sigma NS produced in reovirus-infected L cells. The expressed protein was indistinguishable from authentic sigma NS by peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease and by immunoblot analysis. Most importantly, the purified protein had nucleic acid-binding properties similar to that previously shown for sigma NS obtained from infected cells. Binding of single-stranded RNAs by recombinant sigma NS protein was inhibited by GTP...|$|R

The reason for the general interest in circulation systems is obvious. Circulating books, particularly in large libraries, has always been a burdensome operation, but the process has become increasingly so in recent years. Larger enrollments in colleges and universities since the war, increased population, and library consciousness generally, have resulted in a greater number of books being issued. Scarcity of clerical help, higher labor costs, and, to a lesser degree, lower "production " resulting from shorter working hours have added to the woes of circulation departments.
