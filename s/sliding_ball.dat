The braking system included larger front rotors and cross-drilling all around. Quicker steering, lower-profile tires, and new shock settings improved handling.

40|$|Ultrasound is {{reflected}} from a liquid layer between two solid bodies. This reflection {{depends on the}} ultrasonic frequency, the acoustic properties of the liquid and solid, and the layer thickness. If the wavelength {{is much greater than}} the liquid-layer thickness, then the response is governed by the stiffness of the layer. If the wavelength and layer thickness are similar, then the interaction of ultrasound with the layer is controlled by its resonant behaviour. This stiffness governed response and resonant response can be used to determine the thickness of the liquid layer, if the other parameters are known. In this paper, ultrasound has been developed as a method to determine the thickness of lubricating films in bearing systems. An ultrasonic transducer is positioned on the outside of a bearing shell such that the wave is focused on the lubricant-film layer. The transducer is used to both emit and receive wide-band ultrasonic pulses. For a particular lubricant film, the reflected pulse is processed to give a reflection-coefficient spectrum. The lubricant-film thickness is then obtained from either the layer stiffness or the resonant frequency. The method has been validated using fluid wedges at ambient pressure between flat and curved surfaces. Experiments on the elastohydrodynamic film formed between a <b>sliding</b> <b>ball</b> and a flat surface were performed. Film-thickness values in the range 50 - 500 nm were recorded, which agreed well with theoretical film-formation predictions. Similar measurements have been made on the oil film between the balls and outer raceway of a deep-groove ball bearing. ...|$|E
40|$|Several prior {{investigations}} have documented the deformation-induced rotation of β- Si 3 N 4 grains resulting in texture and property anisotropy. Highly oriented microstructures {{have been produced}} by hot deformation of full density silicon nitride in the plane strain condition due to the rearrangement of the elongated β-grains. Predictive modeling of textures was conducted {{for a range of}} deformation conditions, and compared with experimentally determined crystallographic orientation distributions. The quantification of crystallographic orientation was performed by measuring X-ray pole figures. Predictive modeling compares favorably with experimental results for a limited degree of deformation. At high deformation levels, grain clustering, which effectively reduces the aspect ratio in modeling is observed, and accounts for deviation of experimental results from modeling. ^ Fracture toughness anisotropy is observed for these materials and is primarily due to crack deflection along oriented grain boundaries. Modeling is used to predict crack path in anisotropic materials by equating an orientation dependent fracture toughness with crack deflection mechanisms. Results from this modeling approach are in reasonable agreement with experimental observations of crack deflection in Vickers indentation and three-point bending, however, this approach only considers mode I of a mixed mode loading. ^ Hertzian contact tests were conducted on fine and coarse grain materials. A definite trend from cone cracking behavior to a shear microcracking mechanism was observed with increasing grain size. However, from observation, cone cracking initiates before the microcracking at all grain sizes, but is impeded in cases where the grain size is finite relative to the contact diameter. Direct measurement of damage associated with indentations was obtained through surface profilometry, allowing for analysis of contact behavior. Hertzian contacts in textured materials result in non-circular cone cracking behavior. This is attributed to the observed fracture toughness anisotropy. Implications regarding enhanced contact properties were demonstrated through <b>sliding</b> <b>ball</b> wear tests which showed dramatic effects of orientation on crack initiation. ...|$|E

30|$|Tribological {{property}} of c-axis textured shell-like Ti 3 AlC 2 ceramic was investigated using reciprocating <b>sliding</b> <b>balls</b> (SUS 304) under loads of 1, 5, and 9 N. It {{was found that}} the textured top surface (TTS), corresponding to the (000 l) plane, shows the lowest mean coefficient of friction in comparison with those measured on the textured side surface (TSS), where the sliding directions are parallel (TSS- 1) and perpendicular (TSS- 2) to c axis, under the same load. Among all the tested orientations, the TSS- 2 exhibited the lowest wear rate of 1.51 × 10 − 3 mm 3 /(N·m) under the load of 9 N. The worn mechanisms on the TTS and TSS- 1 were delamination, grain fracture, and grain spalling-off. On the TSS- 2, plowing effect against balls was the dominating mechanism.
