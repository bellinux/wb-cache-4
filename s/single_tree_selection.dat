40|$|The Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment (HEE) {{in central}} Indiana {{presents}} {{an excellent opportunity}} to study species reactions to different forestry practices: clearcutting, shelter wood cutting, and <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selections.</b> This project focuses on {{the differences in the}} populations and diets of the various insectivorous bat species in the HEE management units. Bats studied were Myotis septentrionalis, Lasiurus borealis, Eptesicus fuscus, Perimyotis subflavus, Myotis sodalis, Myotis lucifugus, and Lasionycteris noctivagans. Since insectivorous bats do not simply eat whatever is available, and I hypothesize that the diets of these bats will not change despite their changing environment and changing populations. To test these ideas, guano was collected between years 2006 - 2010 and ANABAT calls were recorded between years 2007 - 2010. I analyzed 440 guano samples, and the invertebrate parts were identified visually to the lowest taxonomic level within a reasonable amount of time; this is most often to family, but always order for the Lepidopterans. The data were compared within each species: before and after treatment, across treatment types, between males and females, and across different months. There was no significant change between bat diets before and after treatments, and each species maintained a specific diet across the years. These results reinforce previous conclusions that bats select among available foods and do not simply eat whatever is available. I also analyzed 5346 call minutes using ANABAT bat detectors. There were significant changes in Myotis sodalis, Lasiurus borealis, and Perimyotis subflavus call minutes. This supports the hypothesis that the diets still remain constant despite the changes in the species populations. Caylor,Megan KWhitaker, John O. Lima, Steven L. Scott, Peter E.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of indigenous Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) at Ano Nuevo {{stands in the}} central coast of California was examined. The foremost management objective in these stands is {{to establish and maintain}} stand structures that ensure a sustainable presence of the species in terms of uneven-aged management. The major threats are the proliferation of shade-tolerant tree species and the pitch canker (Fusarium circinatum) disease. The study was based on data from 17 systematically placed sample plots, measured once, in one stand with a very high degree of variation in stand structure and species composition. The results indicated that the {{sustainability of}} Monterey pine is not assured by existing stand structures. Monterey pine regeneration is almost completely lacking. Intensive shading and competition from high stand densities of shade-tolerant broadleaf trees are inhibiting regeneration, and growth of seedlings and saplings. Pitch canker is affecting growth, vigor, and competitive status of Monterey pine, but its progress and long-term impact remain unknown. <b>Single</b> <b>tree</b> or group <b>selection</b> cuttings, combined with treatments that enhance regeneration, are urgently required for the promotion of Monterey pine...|$|R
50|$|Single-tree {{selection}} harvest method {{works best}} within the riparian ecosystem. Single-tree selection {{is a good}} method to keep the western hemlock and western red cedar on the site. If the stand was left alone and the forest naturally created gaps for succession then other species that are less tolerant than the desired tree species of western red cedar and western hemlock could overtake the created gaps. <b>Single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> will contribute minimally to erosion, still provide habitat for wildlife, be aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and follow the best management practices (BMPs) {{that are associated with}} riparian forests. <b>Single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> gives the forest a great vertical distribution of foliage. The last reason for doing a <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> is that it spreads out income over longer period of time. This could help pay for any costs associated with the stand’s management. <b>Single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> replicates the natural process called gap-phase. Gap-phase is an event that happens in a forest when a tree in the upper canopy of the forest falls down, usually form a strong wind. The gap formed in the upper canopy allows enough sunlight to come through the opening and reach saplings at the forest floor. These saplings can grow and eventually penetrate the canopy. The natural gap-phase process may only open the total stand by 1 percent. Single tee selection is different from the natural process because the openings are created more often. Since both species are tolerant an opening of the stand by 10 percent each cutting cycle would be enough for stand to do well. An uneven aged forest is the result of periodically opening the canopy.|$|E

Although it is currently widely recognized that forest dynamics are naturally more complex, including small scale gap and patch dynamics, and partial disturbances (Kuuluvainen and Aakala 2011; Taylor and Chen 2011), forest management continues to be predominantly grounded on the even-aged management approach. However, as expectations of ecological sustainability and provisioning of different ecosystem services from forests are growing (Burton et al. 2010), problems related to even-aged management {{are becoming more and more}} evident (e.g. Kuuluvainen et al. 2012). As a consequence, there is increasing interest in management approaches based on emulation of natural forest dynamics (Bergeron et al. 2002; Kuuluvainen et al. 2012), including continuous cover forestry utilizing <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> or group <b>selection</b> harvesting. Although such management approaches have traditionally been considered economically less profitable compared with even-aged management, this prejudgment has been questioned by recent research (Kuuluvainen et al. 2012; Rämö and Tahvonen 2014; Pukkala 2016).|$|R

First, 100 circular sample plots has been selected by use of random systematic inventory. Then into the each plots nine micro-plots defined.

30|$|Although {{there are}} very few {{previous}} studies on optimal tree selection, several recent results on pre-and post-cutting diameter distributions in economically optimal uneven-aged management support the conclusion that optimal cutting resembles diameter-limit cutting (Tahvonen et al. 2010; Tahvonen 2011; Pukkala et al. 2014; Pukkala 2015 a, 2015 b). The American studies conducted during the 1980 s lead to similar conclusions (Haight 1985, 1987; Haight and Getz 1987). Also long-term silvicultural trials support the conclusion than diameter limit cutting is more profitable than single-tree selection.

40|$|Street {{and park}} trees form an {{important}} component of the urban environment by supplying multiple benefits to the urban community. A <b>tree</b> species <b>selection</b> process describes the steps taken to identify a suitable tree species for a specific location. Research on urban <b>tree</b> species <b>selection</b> has confirmed the use of environmental, social and economic criteria. In contrast, ecological criteria, such as creating wildlife habitat, and biogeographical criteria, such as selecting indigenous species, and their potential conservation benefits have received little attention. Research in conservation biology has advocated the transformation of anthropogenic habitats to habitats for the joint use of humans and other species. Incorporating ecological and biogeographical criteria into a street and park <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> process may help this transformation by addressing ecology and biogeography in a seemingly ‘unsuitable’ environment. This research aimed to examine the extent to which ecological and biogeographical criteria are used in street and park <b>tree</b> species <b>selection</b> and the potential use of ‘new’ ecological and biogeographical criteria in addition to existing <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. This research attempted (i) to research the selection of street and park trees for urban environments, (ii) to identify potential ecological and biogeographical criteria for use in <b>tree</b> <b>selection,</b> (iii) to assess the extent to which street and park trees contribute to the ecology and biogeography of urban environments and (iv) to devise a decision-making support tool for <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> incorporating proposed ecological and biogeographical <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. This research focused on case cities in temperate New Zealand and Australia. Methods for data collection and analysis were taken from the social sciences and ecological studies. An interview technique was used to collect empirical data on the <b>tree</b> species <b>selection</b> process applied by municipal tree-care practitioners. Results were triangulated with policy document information from the respective city councils. The ecological and biogeographical component of this research was investigated through an extensive literature review and an exemplary tree inventory. The results revealed that few ecological and biogeographical criteria are used in urban <b>tree</b> species <b>selection.</b> Furthermore, municipal practitioners seem not to follow a standardised process in selecting street and park trees. Although many <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> criteria are applied, their way of application appears still unclear. In addition, the results of the investigated parameters from the exemplary inventory showed that tree plantings in urban residential streets and parks probably contribute little to the ecology and biogeography of the urban environment. Based on these results a systematic <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> decision support tool for municipal tree-care practitioners that includes ecological and biogeographical criteria was designed and applied in a theoretical manner. This tool theoretically verified the potential to integrate ecological and biogeographical criteria into urban <b>tree</b> species <b>selection.</b> Major barriers for their integration were identified.

40|$|Forest {{management}} in Sweden {{can be characterized}} by even-aged silviculture heavily relying on three established harvest regimes: clearcutting, the seed-tree method, and the shelterwood system. Less intense, small-scale retention harvest systems such as <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> and group <b>selection</b> harvest are rarely used. In addition, natural regeneration dynamics without enrichment planting have barely been studied. Consequently, this study examined natural regeneration establishment in a multi-layered Pinus sylvestris-Picea abies forest stand in southwest Sweden after target diameter harvesting and soil scarification. The creation of forest canopy gaps had {{a positive effect on}} total seedling density five years after harvest, mainly due to a significantly higher number of Betula pendula individuals. Seedling density of more desirable tree species suitable for continuous cover forestry such as Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Picea abies also increased substantially in gaps when compared to pre-harvest conditions or the unharvested plots. In contrast, soil scarification did not increase the number of seedlings of desired tree species due to a significant decrease in Picea abies abundance. Soil moisture and gap size significantly improved Betula pendula seedling establishment while a larger number of Quercus petraea seedlings were observed in Vaccinium myrtillus patches. We conclude that canopy gaps are beneficial under the encountered stand conditions to initiate forest regeneration, and that soil scarification without the timely occurrence of a mast year of desired tree species is not effective in the type of forest studied...|$|R

The results were also compared to the genetic composition ofseed used for artificial regeneration following clear-cutting. Both natural regeneration treatments resulted in higher genetic variation in post-treatment seed, indicating a richer pollen cloud after management.

During the summers of 2005 & 2006, Cerulean Warblers were surveyed within the Morgan-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests, {{as well as the}} Hoosier National Forest in southern Indiana. Three forest types were surveyed; unharvested reference sites were compared with <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> treatments and treatments where a combination of group and <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> was used. Mean bird abundance was estimated from bird surveys to determine if a correlation exists between silvicultural regimes and Cerulean Warbler abundance. Cerulean Warblers were located in all treatment types, with no significant differences in abundance between or among treatment types examined. These results suggest that uneven-age management practices, such as single tree and group selection harvesting, provide suitable breeding habitat for Cerulean Warblers. Knowledge of Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) male pairing status based on song rates and frequencies, as well as familiarity with non-song vocalizations could be an effective management tool when studying this species. Cerulean Warblers were recorded throughout the breeding season, and 18 song variables were measured and compared between paired and unpaired males using Logistic Regression. Unpaired males had higher song rates and higher minimum frequencies than paired male counterparts. Female and fledgling call notes were also recorded and quantitatively analyzed.

40|$|Modelling {{mechanical}} systems using symbolic equations can provide many advantages over the more widely-used numerical methods of modelling these systems. The use of symbolic equations produces more efficient models, {{which can be}} used for many purposes such as real-time simulation and control. However, the number, complexity, and computational efficiency of these equations is highly dependent on which coordinate set was used to model the system. One method of modelling a mechanism's topology and formulating its symbolic equations is to model the system using a graph-theoretical approach. This approach models mechanisms using a linear graph, from which spanning trees can be used to define a mechanism's coordinate set. This report develops two <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms capable of estimating the tree set, and hence coordinate set, that produces models having the fastest forward dynamic simulation times. The first <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm is a heuristic-based algorithm that tries to find the coordinate set containing the minimal possible number of modelling variables. Most of this algorithm's heuristics are based on <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> criteria found in the literature and on observations of a series of benchmark problems.

The second <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm developed in this report also uses graph theory. It bases most of its heuristics on observations of one of the methods developed to obtain a mechanical system's symbolic equations using graph theory. This second algorithm also makes use of, and improves upon, a few of the heuristics developed in the first <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm.

Time in motion data was collected on all system components to understand how the extra efforts to gather small diameter and slash material affect the cost structure of a mechanized timber harvest thinning. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to find breakeven points at varying diesel input costs, equipment purchase costs, hauling distances, stumpage costs and government subsidy. Results indicate that an average of 15. 50 tons of fuel chips and 35. 72 tons of solid hardwood products was removed per acre. The cost per ton to harvest, skid and process at road side for the fuel chips and solid hardwood products was $ 19. 20 and $ 11. 17 per ton respectively. Contracted fuel chips hauling cost was $ 12. 00 per ton and solid hardwood hauling averaged $ 4. 16 per ton. Stumpage was assumed to be $ 5. 00 and $ 9. 95 per ton, respectively. Average price at the gate for these two products were $ 26. 00 per ton and $ 32. 64 per ton leading to a profit/loss of $- 10. 20 per ton and $ 7. 36 per ton for the fuel chips and solid hardwood products respectively. Losses from fuel chips were less than the profits from the solid hardwood products resulting in a net profit of $ 3, 131. 76 dollars.

40|$|Removing all large trees without {{planning}} {{to replace them}} with either planted or naturally regenerated younger trees (i. e., high-grading) is widely thought to have negative consequences on a forest's productivity and species composition, but no previous studies in California had evaluated this assumption. To make such an evaluation, I measured productivity and canopy species composition shifts following the repeated removal of large trees and compared the results with those from two other basic forest harvest methods: thinning from below and <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection.</b> Timber productivity was substantially lower with large-tree removal (0. 65 thousand board feet per acre per year) than with the other methods (averaging 1. 33 thousand board feet per acre per year), which included the no-harvest control, where yield was zero. Large-tree removal also resulted in more species change, with white fir increasing in the canopy and ponderosa pine decreasing...|$|E

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Keith W. Goyne. Forests {{ecosystems}} {{are governed by}} complex and dynamic nutrient cycles where soil is a major provider of nutrients essential for plant growth. Disturbances occurring in forested ecosystems (timber harvest, fire, and disease breakouts) lead to removal of living biomass which may impact nutrient cycling and can cause changes in soil solution chemistry, nutrient flux, and alter soil moisture and temperature. Missouri Ozark Highland soils are highly weathered and, to maintain long-term sustainability and productivity of forests supported by these soils, understanding harvest operations effect on nutrient loss is of utmost importance. Therefore, the primary objective {{of this study was}} to enhance understanding of nutrient dynamics and pools in forested soils of the Missouri Ozark Highlands. The study was divided into two specific research objectives: (1) quantify the influence of clearcutting (CC) and <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection</b> forest (STS) regeneration on soil solution chemistry and nutrient flux in low and medium nutrient status soils at Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP); and (2) identify the importance of geomorphic and soil properties on total and available P concentrations in Ozark Highland soils. To address concerns regarding the depletion of soil nutrients in association with timber harvest in the Missouri Ozark Highlands, soil solution and nutrient flux in low and medium nutrient status soils was monitored in clearcut, <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> <b>selection,</b> and no-harvest management sites (NHM) at MOFEP. Pre-harvest and post-harvest solution samples were collected with throughfall and zero-tension soil solution (ZTS) samplers (15 and 40 cm depths), and samples were analyzed for pH and electrical conductivity (EC), anions (F-, Br-, Cl-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, PO 4 3 -), cations (K+, Na+, NH 4 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and total aluminum), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total nitrogen (TN). Ion exchange resin (IER) samplers (15 and 40 cm soil depths) were used to capture cumulative flux. Pre-harvest and one year post hIncludes bibliographical references (pages 145 - 156) ...|$|E

40|$|The paper gives a short {{overview}} {{about the}} existing data base and extraction methods for <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> detection. Forest remote sensing {{has a long}} tradition and a variety of methods for <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> extraction have already been developed. Most studies and methods focus either on the analysis of satellite images or airborne laser data and on the extraction of coniferous trees. The automatic detection of deciduous trees is still a great challenge. This paper describes different methods of <b>single</b> <b>tree</b> extraction with focus on the automatic extraction of deciduous trees from aerial imagery. <b>Single</b> <b>trees</b> can be extracted by using aerial true-ortho images and photogrammetrically produced digital surface models as input data and a combination of remote sensing methods and GIS analyses with completeness and correctness over 80 percent. The presented method enables the extraction of tree tops as well as tree-crowns for deciduous trees. For the automatically extracted <b>singles</b> <b>trees</b> important attributes like exact position or average crown diameter are calculated and added to the tree objects. The extracted trees can be used for the modeling of trees in virtual environments or for forest area inventories...|$|R
