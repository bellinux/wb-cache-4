50|$|This {{effect of}} <b>superradiance</b> has been {{demonstrated}} by monitoring the decay of the exciton polarization in suitably arranged semiconductor multiple quantum wells.Due to <b>superradiance</b> introduced by the coherent radiative coupling among the quantum wells, the decay rate increases proportional {{to the number of}} quantum wells and is thus significantly more rapid than for a single quantum well.The theoretical analysis of this phenomenon requires a consistent solution of Maxwell's equations together with the SBEs.|$|E

50|$|Raimond {{enrolled}} at the École normale supérieure (rue d'Ulm) (ENS) in 1975. After graduating with a DEA in atomic and molecular physics, his first research work was in <b>superradiance</b> and Rydberg atoms.|$|E
5000|$|In quantum optics, <b>superradiance</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs {{when a group of}} N emitters, such as excited atoms, interact with a common light field. If the wavelength of the light is much greater than the separation of the emitters, then the emitters interact with the light in a collective and coherent fashion. This causes the group to emit light as a high intensity pulse (with rate ∝ N2). This is a surprising result, drastically different from the expected exponential decay (with rate ∝ N) of a group of independent atoms (see spontaneous emission). <b>Superradiance</b> has since been demonstrated {{in a wide variety of}} physical and chemical systems, such as quantum dot arrays [...] and J-aggregates. The effect has recently been used to produce a superradiant laser.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than relying}} on photons to store phase coherence, it relies on {{collective}} effects in an atomic medium to store coherence. Such a laser uses repumped Dicke <b>superradiance</b> (or superfluorescence) to sustain emission of light that can have a substantially narrower linewidth than a conventional laser.|$|E
50|$|She was a {{graduate}} student under Bryce DeWitt at the University of Texas, where she received her Ph.D. in 1984. Her dissertation, titled The Vacuum in the Presence of Electromagnetic Fields and Rotating Boundaries, contained two separate results: a treatment of the gravitational Casimir effect in rotating reference frames, and a discussion of <b>superradiance</b> in both gravitational and electromagnetic contexts.|$|E
50|$|In astrophysics, {{the most}} popularly known example of <b>superradiance</b> is {{probably}} Zel'dovich radiation. Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich picked the case under quantum electrodynamics ("QED") where the region around the equator of a spinning metal sphere {{is expected to}} throw off electromagnetic radiation tangentially, and suggested that {{the case of a}} spinning gravitational mass, such as a Kerr black hole ought to produce similar coupling effects, and ought to radiate in an analogous way.|$|E
50|$|After a PhD {{dissertation}} on dressed atoms {{under the supervision}} of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (himself a Nobel Prize recipient) from 1967 to 1971, he developed new methods for laser spectroscopy in the seventies, based on the study of quantum beats and <b>superradiance.</b> He then moved on to Rydberg atoms, giant atomic states particularly sensitive to microwaves, which makes them well adapted for studying the interactions between light and matter. He showed that such atoms, coupled to a superconducting cavity containing a few photons, are well-suited to the testing of quantum decoherence and to the realization of quantum logic operations necessary for the treatment of quantum information.|$|E
50|$|The superradiant phase {{transition}} was originally {{predicted by the}} Dicke model of <b>superradiance,</b> which assumes that atoms have only two energetic levels and that these interact with only one mode of the electromagnetic field.The {{phase transition}} occurs when {{the strength of the}} interaction between the atoms and the field is greater than the energy of the non-interacting part of the system. (This is similar to the case of superconductivity in ferromagnetism, which leadsto the dynamic interaction between ferromagnetic atoms and the spontaneous ordering of excitations below the critical temperature.)The collective Lamb shift, relating to the system of atoms interacting with the vacuum fluctuations, becomes comparable to the energies of atoms alone, and the vacuumfluctuations cause the spontaneous self-excitation of matter.|$|E
5000|$|Rotational <b>superradiance</b> [...] is {{associated}} with the acceleration or motion of a nearby body (which supplies the energy and momentum for the effect). It is also sometimes described as the consequence of an [...] "effective" [...] field differential around the body (e.g. the effect of tidal forces). This allows a body with concentration of angular or linear momentum to move towards a lower energy state, even when there is no obvious classical mechanism for this to happen. In this sense, the effect has some similarities with quantum tunnelling (e.g. the tendency of waves and particles to [...] "find a way" [...] to exploit the existence of an energy potential, despite the absence of an obvious classical mechanism for this to happen).|$|E

40|$|The {{main part}} of this review {{is devoted to the}} {{comprehensive}} description of coherent radiation by nuclear spins. The theory of nuclear spin <b>superradiance</b> is developed and the experimental observations of this phenomenon are considered. The intriguing problem of how coherence develops from initially incoherent quantum fluctuations is analysed. All main types of coherent radiation by nuclear spins are discussed, which are: free nuclear induction, collective induction, maser generation, pure <b>superradiance,</b> triggered <b>superradiance,</b> pulsing <b>superradiance,</b> punctuated <b>superradiance,</b> and induced emission. The influence of electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions and the role of magnetic anisotropy are studied. Conditions for realizing spin <b>superradiance</b> by magnetic molecules are investigated. The possibility of nuclear matter lasing, accompanied by pion or dibaryon radiation, is briefly touched. Comment: Review, 59 pages, no figure...|$|E
40|$|The Dicke <b>superradiance</b> on vibronic {{transitions}} of impurity crystals is considered. It {{is shown}} that {{parameters of the}} <b>superradiance</b> (duration and intensity of the <b>superradiance</b> pulse and delay times) on each vibronic transition depend {{on the strength of}} coupling of electronic states with the intramolecular impurity vibration (responsible for the vibronic structure of the optical spectrum in the form of vibrational replicas of the pure electronic line) and on the crystal temperature through the Debye-Waller factor of the lattice vibrations. Theoretical estimates of the ratios of the time delays, {{as well as of the}} <b>superradiance</b> pulse intensities for different vibronic transitions well agree with the results of experimental observations of two-color <b>superradiance</b> in the polar dielectric KCl:O 2 -.

40|$|We {{have applied}} {{the concept of}} <b>superradiance</b> {{introduced}} by Dicke in 1954 to astrophysics by extending the corresponding analysis to the magnetic dipole interaction characterizing the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line. Although {{it is unlikely that}} <b>superradiance</b> could take place in thermally relaxed regions and that the lack of observational evidence of masers for this transition reduces the probability of detecting <b>superradiance,</b> in situations where the conditions necessary for <b>superradiance</b> are met (close atomic spacing, high velocity coherence, population inversion, and long dephasing timescales compared to those related to coherent behavior), our results suggest that relatively low levels of population inversion over short astronomical length-scales (e. g., as compared to those required for maser amplification) can lead to the cooperative behavior required for <b>superradiance</b> in the interstellar medium. Given the results of our analysis, we expect the observational properties of 21 cm <b>superradiance</b> to be characterized by the emission of high-intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features potentially taking place over short periods ranging from minutes to days...|$|E
40|$|Inertial motion <b>superradiance,</b> the {{emission}} of radiation by an initially unexcited system moving inertially but superluminally through a medium, {{has long been}} known. Rotational <b>superradiance,</b> the amplification of radiation by a rotating rigid object, was recognized much later, principally in connection with black hole radiances. Here we review the principles of inertial motion <b>superradiance</b> and prove thermodynamically that the Ginzburg [...] Frank condition for <b>superradiance</b> coincides with the condition for superradiant amplification of already existing radiation. Examples we cite include {{a new type of}} black hole <b>superradiance.</b> We correct Zel'dovich's thermodynamic derivation of the Zel'dovich [...] Misner condition for rotational <b>superradiance</b> by including the radiant entropy in the bookkeeping. We work out in full detail the electrodynamics of a Zel'dovich rotating cylinder, including a general electrodynamic proof of the Zel'dovich [...] Misner condition, and explicit calculations of the superradiant gain for both types of polarization. Contrary to Zel'dovich's pessimistic conclusion we conclude that, if the cylinder is surrounded by a dielectric jacket and the whole assembly is placed inside a rotating cavity, the <b>superradiance</b> is measurable in the laboratory.

40|$|Recently Van Putten has {{suggested}} that <b>superradiance</b> of magnetosonic waves in a toroidal magnetosphere around a Kerr black hole {{may play a role}} in the central engine of gamma-ray bursts. In this context, he computed (in the WKB approximation) the superradiant amplification of scalar waves confined to a thin equatorial wedge around a Kerr hole and found that the <b>superradiance</b> is higher than for radiation incident over all angles. This paper presents calculations of both spin- 0 (scalar) <b>superradiance</b> (integrating the radial equation rather than using the WKB method) and and spin- 1 (electromagnetic/magnetosonic) <b>superradiance,</b> in Van Putten's wedge geometry. In contrast to the scalar case, spin- 1 <b>superradiance</b> decreases in the wedge geometry, decreasing the likelihood of its astrophysical importance.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{amplification}} due to so-called <b>superradiance</b> from the scattering of pulses off rotating black holes as a numerical time evolution problem. We consider the "worst possible case" of scalar field pulses for which <b>superradiance</b> effects yield amplifications $< 1 %$. We {{show that this}} small effect can be isolated by numerically evolving quasi-monochromatic, modulated pulses with a recently developed Teukolsky code. The results show {{that it is possible}} to study <b>superradiance</b> in the time domain, but only if the initial data is carefully tuned. This illustrates the intrinsic difficulties of detecting <b>superradiance</b> in more general evolution scenarios. Comment: 5 pages, 3 Postscript figures, Submitted Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative {{phenomena}} arising due to {{the coupling}} of individual atoms via the radiation field are a cornerstone of modern quantum and optical physics. Recent experiments on x-ray quantum optics added a new twist to this line of research by exploiting <b>superradiance</b> in order to construct artificial quantum systems. However, so far, systematic approaches to deliberately design <b>superradiance</b> properties are lacking, impeding the desired implementation of more advanced quantum optical schemes. Here, we develop an analytical framework for the engineering of single-photon <b>superradiance</b> in extended media applicable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and show {{how it can be}} used to tailor the properties of an artificial quantum system. This "reverse engineering" of <b>superradiance</b> not only provides an avenue towards non-linear and quantum mechanical phenomena at x-ray energies, but also leads to a unified view on and a better understanding of <b>superradiance</b> across different physical systems.

40|$|Classical and quantum {{dynamics}} of <b>superradiance</b> in macroscopic samples of active media is discussed. Along {{with the usual}} convective instability, the absolute instability is analyzed {{as the basis of}} the <b>superradiance</b> phenomenon. Various regimes of <b>superradiance</b> in a conducting inverted two-level medium immersed in the plasma under and out of the condition of plasma-dipole resonance are described and compared. It is shown that the absolute instability of long-wavelength high-frequency polarization waves results in the pulsed generation of strong nonradiating electric fields. The remarkable phenomenon of macroscopic manifestation of quantum fluctuations in the observable parameters of <b>superradiance</b> is described. A general method of the quantization of unstable normal modes in the systems of coupled partial modes with opposite-sign energies is developed. Delay-time statistics of the <b>superradiance</b> pulse is examined in detail. New experiments for the observation of the outlined effects in the nonequilibrium activated semi-conductors and partially ionized gases, e. g. in impulsive discharge, in the infrared range are proposed and appropriate estimates are provided.

40|$|We {{apply the}} concept of <b>superradiance</b> {{introduced}} by Dicke in 1954 to the OH molecule 1612 MHz spectral line often used {{for the detection of}} masers in circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. As the detection of 1612 MHz OH masers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the existence of a population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence, and that these are two necessary requirements for <b>superradiance,</b> we investigate whether <b>superradiance</b> can also happen in these regions. <b>Superradiance</b> is characterized by high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features taking place over time-scales on the order of seconds to years, depending on the size and physical conditions present in the regions harboring such sources of radiation. Our analysis suggests that <b>superradiance</b> provides a valid explanation for previous observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral line for the U Orionis Mira star and the IRAS 18276 - 1431 pre-planetary nebula.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis is given of spin <b>superradiance</b> and atomic <b>superradiance.</b> Their similarities and distinctions are emphasized. It is shown that, despite a close analogy, these phenomena are fundamentally different. In atomic systems, <b>superradiance</b> is a self-organized process, {{in which both}} the initial cause, being spontaneous emission, {{as well as the}} collectivizing mechanism of their interactions through the common radiation field, are of the same physical nature. Contrary to this, in actual spin systems with dipole interactions, the latter are the major reason for spin motion. Electromagnetic spin interactions through radiation are negligible and can never produce collective effects. The possibility of realizing <b>superradiance</b> in molecular magnets by coupling them to a resonant circuit is discussed. Comment: Latex file, 12 pages, no figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{suggest a}} {{mechanism}} {{for the emergence of}} a <b>superradiance</b> burst in a subwavelength array of nonlinear classical emitters. We assume that the emitters interact via their common field of radiative response and that they may have an arbitrary distribution of initially phases. We show that only if this distribution is not uniform, a non-zero field of radiative response arises leading to a <b>superradiance</b> burst. Although this field cannot synchronize the emitters, it forces fast oscillations of a classical nonlinear emitter to have long-period envelopes. Constructive interference in the envelopes creates a large dipole moment of the array which results in a <b>superradiance</b> pulse. The intensity of the <b>superradiance</b> is proportional to the squared number of the emitters, which envelopes participate in the fluctuation...|$|E

40|$|Several {{physical}} {{systems can}} {{be treated as a}} scattering process, and, for these processes, a natural observed quantity arises: the ratio between the reflected and incident intensities, known as the reflection coefficient. This dissertation is concerned with the phenomenon known as <b>superradiance,</b> that is, when this coefficient is larger than unity. We shall explore many examples of such systems, and, more importantly, we shall also see how, apart from the interest in its own right, <b>superradiance</b> is related to a number of important current research physical issues. We begin with a small survey of important results on chapter one. On chapter two, we establish a general criteria {{to decide whether or not}} superradiant scattering is observed based on the linear, second order, homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) or linear, first order homogeneous systems of ODEs which describes the process and we shall give an example of system in which <b>superradiance</b> is observed. On chapter three, we focus on spinning black hole <b>superradiance,</b> we shall describe how one can compute explicitly the reflection coefficient for different spin waves. Chapter four is dedicated to the relations with thermodynamics. We develop what is meant by black hole thermodynamics, particularly the so-called first and second law of black hole thermodynamics, and apply them in the context of <b>superradiance,</b> so we can generalise some of the results from chapter three to more general black holes. Finally, on chapter five, we explore many of the quantum aspects of <b>superradiance,</b> including the relation with the Klein paradox, and the quantum version of black hole <b>superradiance,</b> for the later we will explain briefly how one usually quantise fields in curved space-time. A further connection with thermodynamics is explored. Thorough all this text we analyse the connection between <b>superradiance</b> and spin and statistics...|$|E

40|$|<b>Superradiance</b> is an {{enhanced}} decay of an excited system of emitters resulting from their mutual coupling. This thesis {{is focused on}} <b>superradiance</b> of the emitters coupled via their interaction with a plasmonic nanoparticle. So-called plasmon-mediated <b>superradiance</b> results in even stronger enhancement of the decay rate as the nanoparticle serves as an additional decay chanel. We have developed a quantum model {{of the system of}} emitters coupled to a plasmonic nanoparticle, which allows us to differentiate between a pure dephasing and decay processes. We show that the pure dephasing can destroy the cooperative effect leading to <b>superradiance.</b> Furthermore, we have studied how the direct mutual coupling between emitters affects time evolution of the system in dependence on its configuration, and we show conditions when a decay of the system is dramatically decreased by direct coupling...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a quantum {{microscopic}} approach we study the dynamics of the afterglow of a dilute Gaussian atomic ensemble excited by pulsed radiation. Taking into account the vector nature of the electromagnetic field we analyze in detail the angular and polarization distribution of single-photon <b>superradiance</b> of such an ensemble. The dependence of the angular distribution of <b>superradiance</b> on the length of the pulse and its carrier frequency {{as well as on the}} size and the shape of the atomic clouds is studied. We show that there is substantial dependence of the superradiant emission on the polarization and the direction of fluorescence. We observe essential peculiarities of <b>superradiance</b> in the region of the forward diffraction zone and in the area of the coherent backscattering cone. We demonstrate that there are directions for which the rate of fluorescence is several times more than the decay rate of the timed-Dicke state. We show also that single-photon <b>superradiance</b> can be excited by incoherent excitation when atomic polarization in the ensemble is absent. Besides a quantum microscopic approach, we analyze single-photon <b>superradiance</b> on {{the basis of}} the theory of incoherent multiple scattering in optically thick media (random walk theory). In the case of very short resonant and long nonresonant pulses we derive simple analytical expressions for the decay rate of single-photon <b>superradiance</b> for incoherent fluorescence in an arbitrary direction...|$|E
