40|$|As {{commonly}} used forced convection air cooling devices in electronics, cooling fans are crucial for guaranteeing {{the reliability of}} electronic systems. In a cooling fan assembly, fan bearing failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation <b>speed,</b> <b>locked</b> rotor, failure to start, and other problems; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} conduct research on the health assessment of cooling fan bearings. This paper presents a vibration-based fan bearing health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for fan bearing degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a cooling fan accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of fan bearings. A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i. e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI. The analysis results suggest that the HCI can identify incipient fan bearing failures and describe the bearing degradation process. Overall, the work presented in this paper provides a promising method for fan bearing health evaluation and prognosis...|$|R

To analyze gear box efficiency, a back-to-back test-rig with mechanically closed energy loop was developed according to the FZG principle. An electrical motor with adjustable flange coupling was integrated in the loop. The efficiency of the gears can be determined very accurately by measuring the motor power {{that is needed to}} drive the closed loop as a function of <b>speed,</b> <b>locked</b> in torque, type of oil and oil immersion depth. The second test-rig consists of a driven shaft with adjustable motor position and excited bearing house. This enables the analysis of vibrations resulting from bearing defects and shaft misalignment. Bearings with three fault patterns (ball, inner ring or outer ring defect) are analyzed under radial loading conditions and broad speed range (10 - 3000 rpm). Moreover, single and double cardanic joints and torsionally flexible jaw type couplings are tested under radial and angular shaft misalignment. The third test rig is a closed electromechanical loop used for fault diagnosis of gear mesh defects under constant or variable torque loading.

Therefore, over speed has become main factor the occurrence of tank truck accident. Main objective of this research is to install speed limiter on the tank truck in order to improve safety engineering system, decrease accident and to maintain engine performance. This research is conducted in Indonesia especially in Java-Bali route travel. Speed limiter is installed to the tank truck engine which completed by fuel cut-off solenoid to reduce the speed automatically when it exceeding the maximum speed that has been determined.

On the other hand, the production, transport and usage are very dangerous and demand measures of precaution because the consequences could be catastrophic, and not only at the local level where the accident would happen. Accidents that have been publicly recorded during the last eighteen years (from 1988 till the beginning of 2006) are analyzed in this paper. It is very alarming data that, according to all the recorded accidents, over 1. 6 million tons of sulfuric acid were exuded.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} design and {{analysis}} of the control system structure for back-to-back converter squirrel-cage induction machine drives. Particularly, sensorless control of induction machines, meaning vector control without a mechanical shaft sensor, and vector control of pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) rectifiers are considered. The back electromotive force is used as the basis for sensorless control in this thesis. A variant of the classical "voltage model" is adopted for sensorless flux estimation. It is shown that the estimator must be redesigned for the purpose of arbitrarily placement of the closed-loop poles. A thorough stability analysis of the redesigned estimator shows that asymptotical stability can be guaranteed at nominal speeds. The stability at very low frequencies is, however, largely affected by the knowledge of the stator resistance. The presence of a singularity for zero stator frequency is found, which makes it impossible to guarantee stable operation at very low frequencies, except for the case of zero external load torque. The underlying mechanisms behind the two widely acknowledged instability phenomena for sensorless control at low frequencies are revealed. The most critical form of instability is the infamous flux collapse: the flux collapses to approximately zero, giving nearly total loss of torque, and uncontrolled rotation {{in the direction of the}} external load torque. The less well-known instability phenomenon frequency lockup is not as critical: the field orientation deteriorates, such that the torque reduces but not vanish, and the stator frequency and rotor <b>speed</b> <b>lock</b> on to constant values close to zero. A control system structure is developed for the PWM rectifier. The previously proposed concept of virtual flux is adopted for grid-voltage synchronization, and three different synchronization algorithms are analyzed. The PWM rectifier is also considered for an active filtering application, for which a vector current control system designed for the deadbeat response is designed. An analysis shows that the resulting deadbeat control system is equivalent to previously proposed Smith predictor structures...|$|R

Polly gets off to a decent start, carrying out the Eye of the Needle and Slalom combo flawlessly and only hitting two things in the forward precision steering section, but things quickly start going wrong when she turns the car around, as she hits it twelve times, before hitting several things while reversing. She then fails to even make it into the turning space for the Reverse Flick before hitting an arch in the second Eye of the Needle, before her run ends in disaster as she <b>speeds,</b> <b>locks</b> up her brakes and understeers on the Icy Corner, smashing through the wall.
