40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} synthesis of <b>servo</b> <b>driver</b> for controlling {{the speed of the}} object with the speed tuned at the modular optimum. An automatic electric motor drive is considered as the controlled element. This assumes the use of the speed sensor on the output shaft of the drive gear.

30|$|The second {{strategy}} implemented was in {{the path}} controller. This was a cooperative strategy because the driver can help to achieve zero lateral error by applying torque to the steering wheel. One problem in achieving this objective is that, as identified in simulations [28] and tests in the vehicle with the visual <b>servoing</b> control, any <b>driver</b> torque {{is perceived as a}} perturbation by the steering PID controller. The strategy adopted was therefore to change the reference signal b_k^ref at a rate dependent on driver torque if this {{was in the}} same direction as the lateral error and both were outside a dead band.|$|R

40|$|Robotic {{arms are}} {{indispensable}} tools in both industry and education. The robotic arm currently {{used in the}} MIT class 2. 12, Introduction to Robotics, {{is in need of}} revision. The arm is heavy, imprecise, bulky, and difficult to customize. The new design presented in this thesis resolves these issues while making the arm more user-friendly and inexpensive enough for classroom use. It uses Hitec HS- 805 BB hobby servo motors to directly drive each joint. Controlling these motors is effortless with the many commercially available <b>servo</b> motor <b>drivers.</b> Modular construction allows students to change the shape and size of the arm's workspace easily; creating and installing custom linkages is a simple task. Linkages and motor output shafts mount to a common connection shaft with one-sided cut hubs. The radial loads in these shafts are supported by maintenance-free Super Oilite bronze bearings. This robotic arm is better suited for a classroom environment than the current one. It weighs 2. 7 pounds; the old one weight 21. 2 pounds. Though its workspace and recommended linkage length are about 7 % smaller than those of the old design are, it is 87 % more precise. (cont.) It is 60 % cheaper with a materials cost of $ 120 for a two degree of freedom arm. The new motors have 343 oz-in of torque, which is sufficient to handle a 12 oz payload 17 inches from the joint axis or a 16 oz payload at 14 inches. Students will spend less time connecting wires and calibrating sensors. This arm should be a welcome addition to the introductory robotics classroom. by David Lafferty. Thesis (S. B.)

Second, the maximum earthquake displacement can not be larger than the table. s displacement capacity. In the present work, the recorded strong motion acceleration time series are processed in order to obtain useful data for engineering analysis. Strong motion accelerogram processing (earthquake data processing) is performed in Scilab. The objectives of strong motion data processing are corrections for the response of the strong motion instrument itself, and reduction of random noise in the recorded signals. The processing concentrates on the lowfrequency ranges of the usable signal in the records. The results obtained from comparison of the present work's outputs and some data providers' outputs are satisfactory. Some slight differences exist due to the different integration schemes and due to the application of different filter orders, zero-padding, and different filters for instance, acausal or causal Butterworth filter.
