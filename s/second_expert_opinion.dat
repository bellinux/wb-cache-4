40|$|Solitary pink lesions in {{differential}} diagnosis with hypopigmented/amelanotic melanoma present a diagnostic challenge in daily practice and are regularly referred for <b>second</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) {{has been shown}} to improve diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopically equivocal pink lesions. No studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of adding a second expert reader and automatic removal of lesions with discordant management recommendations and its potential effect on diagnostic sensitivity and final management of these lesions in retrospective or telemedicine settings. To improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce potential mismanagement of dermoscopically equivocal pink cutaneous lesions by implementing double reader concordance evaluation of RCM images. 316 dermoscopically equivocal pink lesions with dermoscopy-RCM image sets were evaluated retrospectively. Accuracy of three readers was evaluated by single reader evaluation of dermoscopy only and dermoscopy-RCM image sets and finally by double reader evaluation of dermoscopy-RCM image sets. Lesions with discordant diagnosis between two readers were automatically recommended for excision. Dermoscopy only evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 95. 9 % and specificity of 33. 6 %, with 1 of 12 amelanotic melanomas mismanaged. Dermoscopy-RCM image set single reader evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 93. 9 % and overall specificity of 54. 2 %, with 1 of 12 melanomas mismanaged. Dermoscopy-RCM image set double reader concordance evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 98. 3 % and specificity of 42. 7 %, with no amelanotic melanoma mismanagement. Evaluation of dermoscopy-RCM image sets of equivocal pink lesions by a single reader in telemedicine settings is limited by the potential for misdiagnosis of dangerous malignant lesions. Double reader concordance evaluation with automatic referral of lesions for removal in the case of discordant diagnosis improves the diagnostic sensitivity in this subset of lesions and reduce potential misdiagnosis in settings where a <b>second</b> <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> may be employed...|$|E
40|$|Students’ {{evaluations}} of teacher performance (SETs) are increasingly used by universities. However, {{in their current}} format SET-scores are controversial mainly due to two issues: (1) questionnaire items are relegated {{to the status of}} being of equal importance, and (2) the feedback to the teachers is rather vague and limited. This paper proposes a tailored version of Data Envelopment Analysis to construct SET-scores. One part of this method’s appeal stems from overcoming the two aforementioned criticisms. In particular, DEA accounts for different values and interpretations that teachers attach to ‘good teaching’ and teacher performances are put into a relative perspective to be optimally evaluated. <b>Second,</b> if available, <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> on the relative importance of teaching aspects can be easily incorporated into the evaluation.

Design: A two-round modified Delphi approach among pediatric intensivists with a visible special interest in mechanical ventilation. Settings: None. Subjects: Pediatric intensivists. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: In the first questionnaire "experts" classified 64 items as "important," "not so important" or "not important" (June 2010). The second questionnaire included the 29 items having been classified by more than 50 % of the experts as being " important" in the first questionnaire {{that needed to be}} ranked in order of importance (August 2010). Twenty-nine of 50 (64 %) experts responded to the first questionnaire, and 28 of the 29 initial responders (96. 6 %) to the <b>second</b> questionnaire.

40|$|Worldwide, {{there has}} been a rapid {{increase}} in the use of mobile technologies as a conduit for student learning. A combination of traditional teaching approaches, lack of consistency in skill-teaching between educators and limited resources in health and tertiary environments may create difficulties for students in achieving clinical skill competence. Mobile technologies could provide relevant solutions through 'just-in-time' support for students to learn and practice specific clinical skills in readiness for their practice role. Foundational clinical skills training videos, presented from a first person point of view (1 PPOV) by expert health clinicians, who 'think aloud' as they step through selected skills have been developed. Videos can be viewed from a range of mobile devices to support health practitioners, students and educators. Additional to the potential to enhance teaching and learning, these resources may provide additional support for students with English as a <b>second</b> language. <b>Expert</b> educator <b>opinions</b> (4 nursing, 2 paramedic science, 1 public health and 1 information technology) were collected to identify feasible uses of such videos for global health education. <b>Expert</b> <b>opinion</b> resulted in identification of the following potential uses; pre-class learning, a guide for feedback, resource for 'just -in -time' learning, remediation, development of critical inquiry and context awareness, co-operative learning, and opportunities for different assessment approache...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sarcomas {{are rare}} {{malignant}} tumors. Accurate initial histological diagnosis {{is essential for}} adequate management. We prospectively assessed the medical management of all patients diagnosed with sarcoma in a European region over a one-year period to identify the quantity of first diagnosis compared to central expert review (CER). Methods Histological data of all patients diagnosed with sarcoma in Rhone-Alpes between March 2005 and Feb 2006 were collected. Primary diagnoses were systematically compared with second opinion from regional and national experts. Results Of 448 patients included, 366 (82 %) matched the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Of these, 199 (54 %) had full concordance between primary diagnosis and second opinion (the first pathologist and the expert reached identical conclusions), 97 (27 %) had partial concordance (identical diagnosis of conjonctive tumor but different grade or subtype), and 70 (19 %) had complete discordance (different histological type or invalidation of the diagnosis of sarcoma). The major discrepancies were related to histological grade (n = 68, 19 %), histological type (n = 39, 11 %), subtype (n = 17, 5 %), and grade plus subtype or grade plus histological type (n = 43, 12 %). Conclusions Over 45 % of first histological diagnoses were modified at second reading, possibly resulting in different treatment decisions.
