5000|$|Ayers {{was asked}} in a January 2004 interview, [...] "How {{do you feel about}} what you did? Would you do it again under similar circumstances?" [...] He replied: [...] "I've thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it's {{impossible}} to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful? ... I don't think <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable." ...|$|E

"I {{think you}} always want to be {{sensitive}} to anybody that finds it offensive, that, you know ultimately the Indians name and the team, ah, is in recognition of our pride and affiliation with the first Native American baseball player. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we choose to do is celebrate, you know, Louis Sockalexis and his history and tradition with the Indians and, and not to focus on uh anything that we would view, that, you know, anything that we don't view and certainly don't want to put, uh, be offensive to anyone." ...|$|E

Exactly what is that connection is hard to characterize. So that is a line with an arrow in one direction, or an arrow in two directions. So it's really the abstract component of the work of art.

We had [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and thought maybe the key was to make hard and fast songs, and make a stripped rock album. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> you hear in Save Yourself is a band making an album they believe they want to do, but not sure why." ...|$|E
40|$|Unitary {{language}} {{constitutes the}} theoretical {{expression of the}} historical processes of linguistic unification and centralization, {{an expression of the}} centripetal forces of language. A unitary language is not something given (dan) but is always an essence posited (zadan) - and at every moment of its linguistic life it is opposed to the realities of h e t e r o g l o s s i a. (Bakhtin: 1981, 270) The grand ricits are great narratives and the narrative has an end in v i e w. It is a programme which tells how social justice is to be a c h i e v e d. And I think the post-structuralists, if I understand them right, imagine again and again that when a narrative is c o n s t r u c t e d, something is left out. Where an end is d e f i n e d, other ends are rejected, and one might not know what those ends a r e. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they are about is asking over and over again, what is it that is left out? Can we know what is left out? We must know the limits of n a r r a t i v e s, rather than establish the narratives as solutions for the future, for the arrival of social justice, so that to an extent they're working with an understanding of what they cannot d o, rather than declaring w a r. (Spivak: 1990, 18) The originatory m o m e n t, both random and intentional, spins off from unpacking the two questions addressed as highly topical: 1) what does linguistics offer the language professions? 2) what do the language professions require from linguistics? By setting up this e x c h a n g e, these questions have been bracketed by an assumption of a relationship between the categories "linguistics " and "language professions". In the exchange mechanism there is an implication of the hierarchical discrimination of base and superstructure, of a status which is both inclusive and exclusive...|$|E

2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|R

500|$|On the friendship, Metcalfe {{said that}} the [...] "{{characters}} are like chalk and cheese, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> works well", while Hassan said the characters [...] "have this kind of prickly friendship". She added that they have [...] "a {{lot of things in}} common, but they’re very different people. It’s almost like they shouldn’t be friends, but opposites attract. Lynsey sees qualities in Mercy that she kind of wishes she had herself. Mercy’s very straight-talking, she’s quite ballsy and calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> attracts her to Mercy". Both Metcalfe and Hassan praised the friendship between Mercedes and Lynsey, with Metcalfe saying she [...] "loved" [...] the friendship and enjoyed seeing her persona [...] "form a good bond with Lynsey" [...] while Hassan praised the chemistry between herself and Metcalfe.|$|R

2500|$|Peter Jackson, {{producer}} of the remake that later began, said in 2006 that [...] "It is not our intention to offend people. But really {{you are in a}} no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario: [...] If you change it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was chosen}} to head the General Medical Council’s 2014 review into the {{differences}} between the scores achieved by black and minority ethnic GP trainees and their white counterparts in the clinical skills assessment component of the Membership exam of the Royal College of General Practitioners. The RCGP was challenged in the courts by the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. He analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said ‘subjective bias due to racial discrimination may be a cause’ of the different pass rates for between white and non-white graduates. [...] "Many of us who do work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>what</b> might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore. It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." ...|$|R

Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|R
5000|$|The British Channel 4 {{screened}} the censored American {{version in}} July 2007, {{in which the}} dialogue was dubbed so as to call the dog [...] "Trigger", this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced. For the remake, Peter Jackson has said no {{decision has been made}} on the dog's name, but is in a [...] "no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario", as changing the name could be seen as too much political correctness, while not changing the name could offend people. Further, executive producer Sir David Frost was quoted in The Independent as stating: [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] In September 2007, as part of the BBC Summer of British Film series, The Dam Busters was shown at selected cinemas across the UK in its uncut format. The original, uncensored, version was also shown on 1 and 5 January 2013, by the British broadcaster Channel 5. It was the version, distributed by Studio Canal, containing shots of the bomber flying into a hill.|$|R

You ever heard that song Pancho and Lefty? I wrote that', and they looked back around and {{they looked at each other}} and started grinning, and it turns out that their squad car, you know their partnership, it was two guys, it was an Anglo and a Hispanic, and it turns out, they're called Pancho and Lefty ... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe that's <b>what</b> it's about, those two guys ...

Braden {{grew up in the}} care of his mother, Jodie Atwood, until she died of cancer when Braden was in high school. From that point on, Braden was raised by his grandmother, Peggy Lindsey. Lindsey was in {{attendance}} during Braden's perfect game. After the game, Braden embraced his grandmother. Lindsey recalls, [...] "It's very special. Dallas and I are very close. He just said, 'I love you,' and I said, 'Your mom would have been <b>so</b> proud.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> he was thinking, too." [...] Athletics' catcher Landon Powell described the moment: [...] "When we first finished the game and celebrated and I saw Dallas hugging his grandmother, I was tearing up...He's had a lot of things happen in his life, even {{in the last couple of}} years in the game of baseball, and it couldn't happen to someone who deserves it more." ...|$|R
5000|$|Metcalfe told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that {{to forget}} about the {{situation}} Mercedes [...] "wants to feel numb" [...] and as a means of [...] "escape" [...] she called Doctor Browning, which left her feeling [...] "awful". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes was in [...] "self destruct mode" [...] and she [...] "hates herself" [...] for having sex with Doctor Browning, although she does not take money this time. Metcalfe justified Mercedes' actions by saying Mercedes was [...] "looking for any distraction, any way to escape her demons". Metcalfe told a journalist from The Sun's magazine TV Buzz that Mercedes believes Doctor Browning [...] "will help her move on" [...] with her ordeal. Mercedes took a business man back to her hotel room where [...] "things end badly"; she locked herself in the bathroom and refused to come out. As Metcalfe explained, Lynsey soon arrived to comfort her, and came to her [...] "rescue when she's at her lowest point. Lynsey can see how broken Mercedes is".On the friendship, Metcalfe said that the [...] "characters are like chalk and cheese, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> works well", while Hassan said the characters [...] "have this kind of prickly friendship".

5000|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "You Make Me Want to Be a Man" [...] {{was directed by}} anime director Kōji Morimoto and Kiriya. Utada stated that because the song itself featured electro and dance genres, [...] "it fits well with visuals. I {{have a lot of}} electronic elements with machines and stuff like that." [...] Utada said she was influenced by her Japanese heritage, anime and otaku culture, and Japan's advances in technology during the early 2000s. She commented, [...] "We wanted to play with the Japanese side of my existence. Japan is well know sic for these kinds of technological things, like Anime and the futuristic things, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is <b>what</b> started off the whole thing." [...] Utada revealed that she shared her creative input with Kiriya because [...] "It's very difficult, but a bit of companionship was exactly what I needed. With most of my work I mostly just say yes or no, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> guess what I needed was someone that I could trust the taste and opinions of and have the guts to tell me about things. Somebody that I could trust with the creative side of things a little more, so that is when he came into the picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{last the}} moon came up, {{and with it}} a moaning wind, at the breath of which the silence began to whisper mysteriously. Lonely enough in the newborn light looked the wide expanse of mountain, plain, and forest, more like some vision of a dream, some {{reflection}} from a fair world of peace beyond our ken, than the mere face of garish earth made soft with sleep. Indeed, {{had it not been}} for the fact that I was beginning to find the log on which I sat very hard, I should have grown quite sentimental over the beautiful sight; but I will defy anybody to become sentimental when seated in the damp, on a very rough beam of wood, and half-way up a tree. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> merely made a mental note that it was a particularly lovely night, and turned my attention to the prospect of elephants. But no elephants came, and after waiting for another hour or <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>what</b> between weariness and disgust, I must have dropped into a gentle doze. Presently I awoke with a start. Gobo, who was perched close to me, but as far off as the beam would allow--for neither white man nor black like the aroma which each vows is the peculiar and disagreeable property of the other--was faintly, very faintly clicking his forefinger against his thumb. I knew by this signal, a very favourite one among native hunters and gun-bearers, that he must have seen or heard something. I looked at his face, and saw that he was staring excitedly towards the dim edge of the bush beyond the deep green line of mealies. I stared too, and listened. Presently I heard a soft large sound as though a giant were gently stretching out his hands and pressing back the ears of standing corn. Then came a pause, and then, out into the open majestically stalked the largest elephant I ever saw or ever shall see. Heavens! what a monster he was; and how the moonlight gleamed upon his one splendid tusk--for the other was missing--as he stood among the mealies gently moving his enormous ears to and fro, and testing the wind with his trunk. While I was still marvelling at his girth, and speculating upon the weight of that huge tusk, which I swore should be my tusk before very long, out stepped a second bull and stood beside him. He was not quite so tall, but he seemed to me to be almost thicker-set than the first; and even in that light I could see that both his tusks were perfect. Another pause, and the third emerged. He was shorter than either of the others, but higher in the shoulder than No. 2; and when I tell you, as I afterwards learnt from actual measurement, that the smallest of these mighty bulls measured twelve feet one and a half inches at the shoulder, it will give you some idea of their size. The three formed into line and stood still for a minute, the one-tusked bull gently caressing the elephant on the left with his trunk.|$|R
