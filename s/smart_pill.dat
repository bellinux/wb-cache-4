40|$|What {{if there}} were a “smart pill ” that could make you excel at everything? Limitless {{examines}} the power of the mind and how one struggling writer, Eddie Morra, played by Bradley Cooper, deals with his newfound supermental powers. The film begins by reasserting the popular myth that we use {{only a small portion of}} our brain’s potential (Beyerstein, 1999) and proceeds to show both the upside and downside of neuroenhancement. The inciting incident of the movie occurs when Eddie, a down-and-out writer, first takes the <b>smart</b> <b>pill,</b> NZT, given to him by his shady former brother-in-law. Eddie is now able to effortlessly write his novel. He composes and writes like a speed demon, finishing his manuscript in days. Any trace of writer’s block is gone, and, according to his editor, he produces a masterpiece. Eddie is hooked. He quickly discovers that his abilities extend beyond just enhancing his previously learned skills. He has access to every incidental memory in his life. He feels he can “tap into ” his unconscious. This is more than just the rote retrieval of photographic memory. Like a dream come true, he uses his memory of obscure references to seduce hi...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Medication {{adherence}} {{is extremely}} important in preventing relapse and lowering symptoms in schizophrenic patients. However, estimates show that nearly half of these patients have poor adherence. The Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) {{seems to be the}} most reliable tool assessing adherence in schizophrenia and shows that the antipsychotic adherence ratio (AAR) is about 49. 5 % in schizophrenia. The aim {{of the study was to}} test if an electronic pill dispenser named DoPill&# 174; improved AAR of schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, we compared AAR obtained by the DoPill&# 174; and the BARS, in order to verify whether the DoPill&# 174; provides reliable assessment of medication adherence. Methods: The DoPill&# 174; is a <b>smart</b> <b>pill</b> dispenser that beeps and flashes at the appropriate time of the day. Each of its 28 compartments is covered by a plastic lamina that, when taken off, sends a signal to the pharmacist. Patients were randomized to the DoPill&# 174; or Treatment As Usual group (TAU) for six weeks. The BARS was used as a reference measure. Results: Forty-six percent of patients were deemed to be non-adherent with antipsychotic medication. The mean AAR was 67 % after six weeks. DoPill&# 174; recorded better AAR than some of those found in the literature and were lower than the BARS estimate we found. Conclusion: These results suggest that DoPill&# 174; is a valid tool that provides more reliable and objective data for the clinician about their patient’s adherence, than existing assessment tools like the BARS. Furthermore, the device may help patients successfully manage their medication regimen...|$|E

To resolve this, swallowable capsules have been created that slowly pass through the entire GI tract taking images. Research is currently being done in magnetic actuation and localization to increase the speed and control of these <b>smart</b> <b>pills.</b> This paper focuses on a technique to more efficiently control a capsule endoscope based on proprioceptive sensing of the magnetic field. This sensing provides knowledge of the applied field in the frame of the capsule, and enables determination of its current state. I...|$|R
40|$|One {{exciting}} {{implication of}} micromotors {{is that they}} can be powered by rectifying non-equilibrium thermal fluctu-ations or mechanical vibrations via the so-called Feynman-micromotor. An example of mechanical rectification is found in the batteryless wristwatch. The original concept was described in as early as 1912 by Smoluchowski and was later revisited in 1963 by Feynman, in the context of rectifying thermal fluctuations to obtain useful motion. It has been shown that, although rectification is impossible at equilibrium, it is possible for the Feynman-micromotor to perform work under non-equilibrium conditions (eg. {{in the presence of a}} thermal gradient). These concepts can now be realised by MEMS technology and may have exciting implications in biomedicine — where the Feynman-micromotor can be used to power a <b>smart</b> <b>pill,</b> for example. Previously, Feynman's analysis of the motor's efficiency has been shown to be flawed by Parrondo and Español. We now show there are further problems in Feynman's treatment of detailed balance. In order to design and understand this device correctly, the equations of detailed balance must be found. Feynman's approach was to use probabilities based on energies and we show that this is problematic. In this paper, we demonstrate corrected equations using level crossing probabilities instead. A potential application of the Feynman-micromotor is a batteryless nanopump that consists of a small MEMS chip that adheres to the skin of a patient and dispenses nanolitre quantities of medication. Either mechanical or thermal rectification via a Feynman-micromotor, as the power source, is open for possible investigation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cows&# 039; milk {{generally}} {{contains two}} types of β-casein, A 1 and A 2 types. Digestion of A 1 type can yield the peptide β-casomorphin- 7, which is implicated in adverse gastrointestinal effects of milk consumption, some of which resemble those in lactose intolerance. This study aimed to compare the effects of milk containing A 1 β-casein with those of milk containing only A 2 β-casein on inflammation, symptoms of post-dairy digestive discomfort (PD 3), and cognitive processing in subjects with self-reported lactose intolerance. Methods: Forty-five Han Chinese subjects participated in this double-blind, randomized, 2 × 2 crossover trial and consumed milk containing both β-casein types or milk containing only A 2 β-casein. Each treatment period was 14 days with a 14 -day washout period at baseline and between treatment periods. Outcomes included PD 3, gastrointestinal function (measured by <b>smart</b> <b>pill),</b> Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test (SCIT), serum/fecal laboratory biomarkers, and adverse events. Results: Compared with milk containing only A 2 β-casein, the consumption of milk containing both β-casein types was associated with significantly greater PD 3 symptoms; higher concentrations of inflammation-related biomarkers and β-casomorphin- 7; longer gastrointestinal transit times {{and lower levels of}} short-chain fatty acids; and increased response time and error rate on the SCIT. Consumption of milk containing both β-casein types was associated with worsening of PD 3 symptoms relative to baseline in lactose tolerant and lactose intolerant subjects. Consumption of milk containing only A 2 β-casein did not aggravate PD 3 symptoms relative to baseline (i. e., after washout of dairy products) in lactose tolerant and intolerant subjects...|$|E
40|$|In the EU Artemis project Smarcos we {{developed}} a personal behaviour change support system that supports users in attaining a healthy lifestyle. The coach sends timely, context-aware feedback about daily activities through a range of interconnected devices. The system is designed for two targeted user groups: Diabetics Type 2 patients and office workers. The Diabetics group gets feedback about their medication intake, activity level, glucose level and food intake. The office workers receive feedback about physical activity and food intake. The feedback to the users of the system consists of personalized reminders, advice and tips, or learn more about why healthy behaviour is important. The prototype system combines two existing (single-device) behaviour change support systems. The multi-device service system we present here extends the single device feedback systems bringing them on one integrated service platform. It allows multiple contact points with users in various contexts: at home, at work, {{on the road and}} the system is able to gather more context information of the user. Interventions with several contact points are expected to be more effective in stimulating change in health behaviour than those that use a single contact points [5]. The input devices in the prototype are a <b>smart</b> <b>pill</b> dispenser and a 3 D accelerometer. The pill dispenser is connected to a server via the GSM network. Every time the user opens the pill dispenser it sends a message to the server. The accelerometer is measuring the amount of physical activity all day long. The use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{availability}} {{of a range of}} new psychotropic agents raises the possibility that these will be used for enhancement purposes (<b>smart</b> <b>pills,</b> happy pills, and pep pills). The enhancement debate soon raises questions in philosophy of medicine and psychiatry (eg, what is a disorder?), and this debate in turn raises fundament questions in philosophy of language, science, and ethics. In this paper, a naturalistic conceptual framework is proposed for addressing these issues. This framework begins by contrasting classical and critical concepts of categories, and then puts forward an integrative position that is based on cognitive-affective research. This position can in turn be used to consider the debate between pharmacological Calvinism (which may adopt a moral metaphor of disorder) and psychotropic utopianism (which may emphasize a medical metaphor of disorder). I argue that psychiatric treatment of serious psychiatric disorders is justified, and that psychotropics are an acceptable kind of intervention. The use of psychotropics for sub-threshold phenomena requires a judicious weighing of the relevant facts (which are often sparse) and values. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{significant}} {{development in}} medical diagnostics and imaging has {{brought up a}} lot of new wireless capsule endoscopes coming to health care market. The capsule has been able to minimize patient discomfort and pain during digestive tract screening with less risk of infection and harmless to body organs. This kind of medical procedure is less invasive and gives a great impact compared to the traditional method. Although pill-shaped capsules have existed for over 11 years by now and are currently being used successfully in medical screening to study the GI tract, these systems are passive and are dependent to the peristaltic movement of the gastric wall to propel. The aim of this work is to provide the electronics needed to control an endoscopic capsule robot and the electronics needed to enable active locomotion and advanced vision functions (like autofocus). Enabling such functions the capsules will be able to perform screening, diagnosis and therapy. Such capsule robot has been designed in the framework of the “Versatile Endoscopic Capsule for Gastrointestinal Tumour Recognition and Therapy” (VECTOR) project. This project pursues the goal of realizing <b>smart</b> <b>pill</b> technologies and applications for gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis and therapy. The overall medical goal of the project is to enable medical devices through advanced technology that can dramatically improve early detection and treatment of GI early cancers and cancer precursors.

It {{is a particular}} challenge in schizophrenia due to the illness&# 39;s association with social isolation, stigma, and comorbid substance misuse, plus the effect of symptom domains on adherence, including positive and negative symptoms, lack of insight, depression, and cognitive impairment. Nonadherence lies on a spectrum, is often covert, and is underestimated by clinicians, but affects more than one third of patients with schizophrenia per annum. It {{increases the risk of}} relapse, rehospitalization, and self-harm, increases inpatient costs, and lowers quality of life. It results from multiple patient, clinician, illness, medication, and service factors, but a useful distinction is between intentional and unintentional nonadherence. There is no gold standard approach to the measurement of adherence as all methods have pros and cons. Interventions to improve adherence include psychoeducation and other psychosocial interventions, antipsychotic long-acting injections, electronic reminders, service-based interventions, and financial incentives. These overlap, all have some evidence of effectiveness, and the intervention adopted should be tailored to the individual. Psychosocial interventions that utilize combined approaches seem more effective than unidimensional approaches. There is increasing interest in electronic reminders and monitoring systems to enhance adherence, eg, Short Message Service text messaging and real-time medication monitoring linked to <b>smart</b> <b>pill</b> containers or an electronic ingestible event marker. Financial incentives to enhance antipsychotic adherence raise ethical issues, and their place in practice remains unclear. Simple pragmatic strategies to improve medication adherence include shared decision-making, regular assessment of adherence, simplification of the medication regimen, ensuring that treatment is effective and that side effects are managed, and promoting a positive therapeutic alliance and good communication between the clinician and patient. These elements remain essential for all patients, not least for the small minority where vulnerability and risk issue dictate that compulsory treatment is necessary to ensure adherence.

40|$|There are {{at least}} two {{scientific}} debates concerning the possibility to offer enhanced lifetime to the human race. One of them derives from the medical sciences and the other from the computer sciences. The former has to do with improving the quality and length of human life by improving their biological systems, for example by way of <b>smart</b> <b>pills.</b> The latter concerns possible improvements of the quality and length of human life by correlating high technology with human beings. Medical scientists illustrate their research progressions using smart mice. Computer scientists present advanced robot models and other high-technological systems. To conquer nature seems to be humankind’s everlasting driving force. However, the scientific dream of enhanced lifetime is problematic at least from a philosophical point of view. The aim of this paper hence is to give a critical philosophical analysis of the problems. After giving a brief historical view of the conquests of technology, the capacities of computer scientists to simulate human behaviour in computer systems is critically analysed. How are these capacities interpreted? Which consequences do these understandings have for human life? In addition, how is the medical success to produce mood and mutation drugs understood and which consequences is it thought to have for human life? What or who, in the end will save humanity? The first part of the article, which concerns computer sciences focuses on philosophical problems while the second part, which concerns medical sciences regards ethical problems...|$|R
40|$|The micromotor is an {{extremely}} small device a few millimetres or less in size. Micromotors {{in the order of}} microns are realised by MEMS technology. Important applications in biomedicine include ultrasound probes for blood vessels, 1 microrobots for colon intervention, 2 <b>smart</b> <b>pills</b> and nanolitre pumps. Other uses include actuators for MOEMS and small variable capacitors. One exciting implication of micromotors is that they can be powered by rectifying mechanical vibrations (Feynman-micromotor 3). MEMS are playing an important role in our daily life as these systems are widely used in optics, communication and information systems, fluidics, biotechnology and medicine, scanning probe microscopes, automobiles and aerospace. There are a number of technical challenges with micromotors, including the need to reduce stiction and increase torque. The precise geometry of the motor is usually tightly coupled to the stiction effect —the sticking of adjacent surfaces after release due to static friction. Piezoelectric, electrostatic and electromagnetic effects have been inves-tigated to produce the electromotive force for the micromotor. However, we propose a micromotor design based on the Huber effect 456, as this will allow a new range of geometries and hence possibilities for managing stiction. To date, there have been no reported attempts at using the Huber effect, and this is possibly due to it being a poorly understood phenomenon. The {{reason for this is that}} large motors that utilise the Huber effect are self-destructive and hence have never been reliably characterised. Such motors are shown to be able to operate from a dc or ac source, and this property may be valuable in some MEMS applications...|$|R
