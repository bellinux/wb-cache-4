40|$|Farmed blue foxes utilise a sand {{floor when}} it is available. They perform various {{activities}} on the sand, e. g. exploration, sniffing, digging and object play. It is unclear, which of the possible activities the foxes use the sand floor for. Our aim was to study why blue foxes enter the sand floor from a mesh floor and vice versa by using the order and latencies of various behaviours after entrance. Each experimental cage (n = 8) consisted of two cages, one with a mesh floor and one with a sand floor. The cages were connected with two one-way doors, to which weights could be added. The orders of the occurrence of various behaviours were video recorded and their latencies were measured after entrance to a cage with 0 and 2. 5 kg of extra weight on the door in 15 juvenile blue foxes. The results were analysed with a linear mixed model analysis. After entering the mesh floor, the foxes most commonly first observed surroundings outside the cage (in 44 % of 131 analysed entries), explored the cage (32 %) and contacted the neighbouring fox (12 %). Observing (39 %) and exploration (32 %) were common also as second behaviours. Other common second behaviours were resting (11 %) and eating (6 %). After entering the sand floor, the foxes first observed surroundings (in 37 % of 129 analysed entries), sniffed (33 %) and contacted the neighbouring fox (13 %). The most common second behaviours were inspection of the cage (30 %), sniffing (29 %) and contact with the neighbouring fox (18 %). In general, more elimination and food hiding, and less resting and contact with neighbouring fox was observed on sand than on mesh. The latency of sniffing sand (19 ± 3 sec, mean± SE) was shorter than that of digging (97 ± 9 sec). The latencies {{to play with a}} neighbour (Sand: 72 ± 19 sec; Mesh: 36 ± 16 <b>sec,</b> <b>F</b> 1, 31 = 7. 4, P< 0. 01) and inspect the cage (Sand: 53 ± 8 sec; Mesh: 23 ± 4 <b>sec,</b> <b>F</b> 1, 153 = 29. 3, P< 0. 001) were significantly longer on sand than on mesh. The latency of solitary play tended to be longer on sand than on mesh (Sand: 112 ± 16 sec; Mesh: 65 ± 25 <b>sec),</b> <b>F</b> 1, 38 = 3. 1, P< 0. 1). The latency to dig/scratch tended (F 2, 47 = 3. 2, P< 0. 1) to be shortest when no cost was imposed on entering a cage and longest when the cost was imposed on leaving a cage (No cost: 90 ± 11 sec; Cost to enter: 100 ± 21 sec; Cost to leave: 137 ± 23 sec). The first behaviours after entering a cage were related to exploration of the environment outside and inside the cage, having a certain order irrespective of the floor material. This suggests that after entering a cage, the change in the overall environment is more meaningful to blue foxes than the instant effect of changed floor material. Since some differences in latencies were found, it seems that measuring latencies may provide a tool to evaluate resource value if the resource can be used for different activities. vo...|$|E

A variety of factors cause SECs to place different emphasis in these areas, including human resources (FTE), financial resources, institutional priorities as influenced by reporting lines, institutional strengths, and {{the origin of the}} center. As shown in Table 4, all SECs carry out the functions listed under the first heading of educational research, with one exception: Institutions B 1 and D 2 do not partner with institutional research to explore base-line data. Under the second heading, Enhancing the Quality of Teaching and Learning, only SECs B 1, C 1, and E 3 develop innovative curricula. For each of these SECs, the research and development component of their mission provides emphasis in this area, and their director’s expertise leads to rich opportunities. While <b>SEC</b> <b>F</b> 3 does not have a role in developing innovative curricula, it does partner with the Center for Teaching and Learning to provide assessment expertise for faculty and departments who are implementing innovations. SEC B 1 functions exclusively as a research center, and therefore is not engaged in professional development for faculty or training for students in teaching roles. In contrast, SEC D 2 functions primarily as a hub, aimed at communication within the institution to increase awareness of opportunities, while connecting and linking individuals to these. Therefore, SEC D 2 does not function in areas of curricular development, expanding use of evidence-based instructional practices, or training of students for teaching roles (e.g., LAs, TAs). Cross-case findings for each area will be developed below, beginning with educational research, which emerged as a role of primary importance to each SEC.|$|E

Potentially relevant intangible items are not reported on the balance sheet, since current standards mandate the immediate expensing of these intangible items. Presumably FASB 2 ̆ 7 s uncertainty with the fundamental issues of extent and timing of future benefits to the firm has led to concerns with relevance, reliability, and objectivity of capitalizing some intangibles, which results in potential long term value generating expenditures being immediately expensed on the income statement. Prior research has demonstrated extent and timing of some income statement intangibles, such as advertising and research and development, however the potential value of IT intangibles as an asset has not been investigated.
