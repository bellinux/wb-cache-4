5|$|Sasuke was not {{included}} in Kishimoto's original concept of the Naruto manga. While discussing the future of the series, his editor advised him to add a rival character for the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, so he created Sasuke. Kishimoto read a variety of manga to gather ideas for creating an effective rivalry between the characters, and he incorporated these elements into Naruto and Sasuke's relationship. Kishimoto also drew inspiration from his own relationship with his twin brother, Seishi. Since childhood, Masashi had worried about Seishi when he faced failures, such as in high <b>school</b> <b>or</b> <b>college,</b> and tried to help him.|$|E
