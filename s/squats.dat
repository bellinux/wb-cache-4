5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure <b>squats</b> with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, <b>squats</b> {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E

25|$|After the {{confrontation}} in March, the squatters gained significant advances. They established many new <b>squats</b> {{in the spring}} and summer of 1982. The <b>squats</b> were mostly located in Nørrebro, and unlike before, the police did not move in and evict the squatters right away. This allowed the squatters to establish collectives. The houses included such now-infamous sites as Allotria, Bazooka, Den Lille Fjer ("The Little Feather"), Garternergade 14 ("Gardener Street 14"), Snehvide ("Snow White"), Safari, and many more. Allotria in particular became a popular place for alternative music. In Bazooka, the squatters even set up a housing service with records of empty houses and flats in the area. Those in need of a place to live could come to Bazooka. They were shown an empty house and offered a crowbar with which to break down the door.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, a {{group of}} squatters moved in and took control of an empty house in Ryesgade 58. The squatters, many of them very experienced, moved in slowly and in small groups to avoid detection. The plan succeeded, and {{after a couple of}} months, they had {{established}} a well-organized squat. It was designed so that every floor was an independent collective charged with maintaining its part of the house. They improved the living conditions in the house, and Ryesgade 58 soon became the unofficial headquarters of the squatters movement. It was the center for political activities and was usually the place where foreign squatters lived when visiting Copenhagen. Soon after the squatting of Ryesgade 58, other new <b>squats</b> were established around Copenhagen. These <b>squats</b> included Kapaw in Østerbro, Baldersgade 20 ("Baldurs Street 20"), Bauhaus, and the infamous Sorte Hest ("Black Horse").|$|E

Additionally, both {{the placement of the}} bar and depth of <b>squat</b> have been widely contemplated and researched for maximum <b>squat</b> but never for full vertical jump. PURPOSE: To investigate the improvements of vertical jump in two groups of <b>squatting</b> techniques, full front <b>squat</b> and half back <b>squat.</b> METHODS: Study participants were chosen from a NAIA college HP 121 strength and conditioning class (N= 12; male = 7, female = 5). They were chosen by a convenience sample. These students volunteered based on their involvement in a strength and conditioning class and their inexperience in lifting. The subjects participated for one hour each workout session two times a week for a total of 6 hours. Prior to and after 3 weeks of front or back <b>squat</b> training, vertical jump (VJ) and one rep maximum full front <b>squat</b> (1 RMFS) or half back <b>squat</b> (1 RMBS) were measured.

25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ <b>squats</b> (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) <b>squats,</b> such that property owners {{would have to go}} to court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E
25|$|This event {{marked a}} turning point in the conflict. Where the evictions of other <b>squats</b> had been {{relatively}} peaceful, this was the first time that the squatters had actually attacked the police.

Each configuration also entails specific problems. Deprivation based <b>squatting</b> involves poor people who are distressed because of severe housing deprivation.
