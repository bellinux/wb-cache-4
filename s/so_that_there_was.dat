5|$|The daric {{was called}} dārayaka within the empire and {{was most likely}} named after Darius. In an effort to further improve trade, Darius built canals, {{underground}} waterways and a powerful navy. He further improved and expanded the network of roads and way stations throughout the empire, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a system of travel authorization for the King, satraps and other high officials, which entitled the traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to cofound the {{spin-off}} {{private equity}} investment firm, Bain Capital. He had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain's offer to head the new venture, until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no financial or professional risk to Romney. Bain and Romney raised the $37million in funds needed to start the new operation, which had seven employees. Romney held the titles of president and managing general partner. Though he was the sole shareholder of the firm, publications also referred to him as managing director or CEO.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E

25|$|The {{commands}} themselves could {{sometimes be}} obscure. For instance, the command to duplicate files was named PIP (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), {{the name of}} the old DEC utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no single option character that differentiated options from file names. Different programs could and did use different characters.|$|E

Before 2005, the WSDC rules stipulated that teams who reached the semi-finals or Grand Final of the {{championship}} were not eligible to receive the ESL award. After the EFL award was introduced, the rules were changed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no restriction on teams reaching the semi-finals or Grand Final being able to receive the ESL or EFL award.|$|E

He initially refrained from accepting the offer, and Bain re-arranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no financial or professional risk to Romney.

25|$|In former {{times the}} {{questions}} had {{been devoted to}} many departments of knowledge, both sacred and profane, being concerned with halakic and exegetic themes {{as well as with}} ethical and philosophical problems, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> scarcely a subject of human activity or thought on which the responsa might not expatiate. In this period, on the other hand, the responsa were restricted almost entirely to legal regulations. Since the pronouncement of judgment was regarded as a religious duty, and since in most countries the Jews were unwilling to submit to a non-Jewish court, legal questions formed {{a large part of the}} responsa.|$|E

Wealthy men and men of high social status {{were appointed}} as Qadis {{so that they might}} not have the temptation to take bribes, or be influenced by the social position of any body.

With {{the exception of}} the Birmingham sleeper these were scheduled for alternate days, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> always one sleeper each for Chicago and St. Louis on the one hand, and St. Petersburg and Tampa/Sarasota on the other. Connecting Atlantic Coast Line trains handled the sleepers south of Jacksonville; the Illinois Central's Chickasaw handled the St. Louis sleepers west of Carbondale, Illinois. The sleeping cars each had eight sections, two compartments, and a drawing room. A dining car operated Chicago–Jacksonville and a buffet-lounge Carbondale–St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lead}} up to World War II, the Germans made {{successive}} improvements to their military Enigma machines. By January 1939, additional rotors had been introduced <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a choice of three from five (i.e. 60 wheel orders) for the army and airforce Enigmas, and three out of eight (336 wheel orders) for the navy machines. In addition, ten leads were used on the plugboard leaving only six letters unsteckered. This meant that the airforce and army Enigmas could be set up 1.5×1019 ways. In 1941 the German navy introduced a version of Enigma with rotatable reflector (the M4 or Four-rotor Enigma) for communicating with its U-boats. This could be set up in 1.8×1020 different ways.|$|E
25|$|From his spies Waller learnt it was possible, if a {{bold and}} sudden attack was made, that Hereford might be taken. Such workWaller loved, and he {{determined}} to try. With about 2,500 men {{he set out}} from Gloucester, and at daybreak on the 24 April appeared before Hereford. Some desultory fighting went on during the day, at times rather sharp, but the garrison had no heart in their resistance and deserted, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing for Sir Richard Cave, the governor of Hereford, to do but to surrender. This he did, and on 25 April 1643. Waller entered Hereford in triumph. He was entitled to every credit that belongs to a bold and successful leader, and had more than restored {{his reputation as a}} conqueror. He had struck unexpectedly, and struck hard, with the result that he had dealt a blow where least expected, and one which was of considerable tactical importance, as he had severed the King's line of communication with Wales.|$|E

25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no need to break them, and this use continues.|$|E
