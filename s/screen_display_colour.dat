At {{the beginning of the}} game, the contestant selects one of three [...] "cash cards", each of which has been credited with a value of £50,000 or higher in multiples of £1,000. The value on the selected card becomes the contestant's target for the game.|$|R
50|$|Alexis Spectral Data is a {{software}} developed for colour matching processes that calculates from available spectral data the colour numbers used by computers to <b>display</b> <b>colours</b> on <b>screen.</b> It <b>displays</b> the <b>colour</b> for each spectral reflectance curve and records the calculated trichromatic values and colour numbers {{along with the}} spectral curves. This eliminates the need to scan the samples separately with a Truecolour Scanner while creating the database. The spectral data can be introduced manually {{as a series of}} reflectance values at wavelengths measured in different standard illuminants with an arbitrary but fixed increment that must be kept for each spectral curve throughout the creation of the whole database. Therefore, older UV-VIS Spectrophotometers that can’t be interfaced with computers can also be used for creating the database needed for colour matching. Alexis Spectral Data determines the whiteness degree in a less time consuming method, which permits storage and easier handling of the obtained data.|$|R
50|$|The Bosnian {{performance}} featured Deen {{separated by}} a barbed wire prop from the other performers, who were covered by golden metallic foil. The performance made references to the European migrant crisis and the refugees fleeing Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995. As the performance progressed, the performers were all symbolically reunited. The stage lighting and LED <b>screens</b> <b>displayed</b> predominantly blue <b>colours</b> which transitioned to red. The creative director for the Bosnian performance was Haris Pašović. The black costumes for Deen and Jala were designed by Tom Rebl, while Dalal's red metallic dress and Ana Rucner's metallic black and nude bodysuit were designed by Juraj Zigman. Two backing vocalists join the four performers on stage: Ena Đapo and Zorana Guja.|$|R

50|$|The Serbian {{performance}} featured Sanja Vučić performing {{together with}} four backing vocalists and a male ballet dancer. The choreography and staging {{of the performance}} interpreted the song's abuse of women in domestic violence message with Vučić and the backing vocalists trying {{to escape from the}} male dancer. The stage lighting and background LED <b>screens</b> predominately <b>displayed</b> red <b>colours</b> and patterns with images of female faces. The director of the Serbian performance was Marko Novaković and the choreography was completed by Staša Stanković. The four backing vocalists that joined Sanja Vučić on stage were: Lena Kuzmanović, Jelena Đurić, Iva Pletikosić and Dunja Vujadinović. The male ballet dancer was Miloš Isailović. The black stage costumes for the performance were designed by studio Morfijum and designer Jelena Malešević.|$|R
5000|$|The Spanish {{performance}} featured Barei {{on stage}} wearing a golden bronze dress, joined by four backing vocalists wearing black dresses; an additional off-stage backing vocalist was {{also part of}} the performance. The stage lighting and LED <b>screens</b> <b>displayed</b> neon <b>colours</b> and geometric shapes. Barei began the performance on the main stage and did a dance routine with her backing vocalists before walking down the catwalk and finishing the song on the satellite stage. During the performance, Barei fell down; the incorporation of the move was explained by the singer during a press conference: [...] "We thought about it when recording the music video, like I'm talking about failure and not throwing the towel. You need to go for your dreams and failure can come any time, you don't know when, and this fall on stage is a symbol, that it could happen right there." [...] The stage director for the performance was Florian Boje with choreography completed by Laura García. The five backing vocalists that joined Barei were Rebeca Rods, Milena Brody, Alana Sinkëy, Awinnie MyBaby and Brequette. Rods was a backing vocalist for Spain in [...] and , Brody was a backing vocalist in , Sinkëy and MyBaby were backing vocalists in , while Brequette was the runner-up in the 2014 Spanish national final. Spain placed twenty-second in the final, scoring 77 points: 10 points from the televoting and 67 points from the juries.|$|R

Especially projector-based PC cluster large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> systems share most of large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> system market {{and they are}} main {{research}} topics today. A lot of researchers research on cluster algorithms, computation power improvements, high performance graphic rendering technologies, high speed buses, networks, and HCIs. Remarkable research results are being published by technical leading groups. Whereas, following groups who want research on large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> have difficulties even to build a test system. Hens {{there are not enough}} information to build large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> systems. In this paper, we survey on projectorbased PC cluster large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> technologies that use distributed rendering. Also, this paper shows basic implementation technologies for building projector-based PC cluster large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> systems...|$|R
