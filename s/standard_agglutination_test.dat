50|$|Definite {{diagnosis}} of brucellosis requires {{the isolation of}} the organism from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, but serological methods may be the only tests available in many settings. Positive blood culture yield ranges between 40% and 70% and is less commonly positive for B. abortus than B. melitensis or B. suis. Identification of specific antibodies against bacterial lipopolysaccharide and other antigens can be detected by the <b>standard</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (SAT), rose Bengal, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), antihuman globulin (Coombs’) and indirect enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SAT is the most commonly used serology in endemic areas. An agglutination titre greater than 1:160 is considered significant in nonendemic areas and greater than 1:320 in endemic areas. Due to the similarity of the O polysaccharide of Brucella to that of various other Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Francisella tularensis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella urbana, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) the appearance of cross-reactions of class M immunoglobulins may occur. The inability to diagnose B. canis by SAT due to lack of cross-reaction is another drawback. False-negative SAT may be caused by the presence of blocking antibodies (the prozone phenomenon) in the α2-globulin (IgA) and in the α-globulin (IgG) fractions. Dipstick assays are new and promising, based on the binding of Brucella IgM antibodies, and found to be simple, accurate, and rapid. ELISA typically uses cytoplasmic proteins as antigens. It measures IgM, IgG, and IgA with better sensitivity and specificity than the SAT in most recent comparative studies. The commercial Brucellacapt test, a single-step immunocapture assay for the detection of total anti-Brucella antibodies, is an increasingly used adjunctive test when resources permit. PCR is fast and should be specific. Many varieties of PCR have been developed (e.g. nested PCR, realtime PCR and PCR-ELISA) and found to have superior specificity and sensitivity in detecting both primary infection and relapse after treatment. Unfortunately, these have yet to be standardized for routine use, and some centres have reported persistent PCR positivity after clinically successful treatment, fuelling the controversy about the existence of prolonged chronic brucellosis. Other laboratory findings include normal peripheral white cell count, and occasional leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis. The serum biochemical profiles are commonly normal.|$|E

40|$|Five {{serological}} assays: the buffered plate antigen <b>test,</b> the <b>standard</b> tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> the {{complement fixation}} test, the hemolysis-in-gel {{test and the}} indirect enzyme immunoassay were diagnostically evaluated. Test data consisted of results from 1208 cattle in brucellosis-free herds, 1578 cattle in reactor herds of unknown infection status and 174 cattle from which Brucella abortus had been cultured. The complement fixation test had the highest specificity in both nonvaccinated and vaccinated cattle. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, if interpreted at a high threshold, also exhibited a high specificity in both groups of cattle. The hemolysis-in-gel test had a very high specificity when used in nonvaccinated cattle but quite a low specificity among vaccinates. With {{the exception of the}} complement fixation test, all tests had high sensitivities if interpreted at the minimum threshold. However, the sensitivities of the <b>standard</b> tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and indirect enzyme immunoassay, when interpreted at high thresholds were comparable to that of the complement fixation test. A kappa statistic was used to measure the agreement between the various tests. In general the kappa statistics were quite low, suggesting that the various tests may detect different antibody isotypes. There was however, good agreement between the buffered plate antigen <b>test</b> and <b>standard</b> tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (the two <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> evaluated) and between the complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay when interpreted at a high threshold.

40|$|Purpose: Brucellosis is a {{systemic}} disease {{that can affect}} many organs and tissues. Musculoskeletal system {{is one of the}} most commonly affected systems. Disease may present itself with sacroiliitis, peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, paraspinal abscess, bursitis or osteomyelitis. The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency, types and clinical features of osteoarticular involvement among cases with brucellosis in Konya city and to establish the differences between patients with and without osteoarticular involvement. Material and Methods: Three hundred and sixteen patients with Brucellosis who presented between June 2003 and June 2014 were included in the study. Brucellosis was diagnosed by positive Brucella <b>Standard</b> <b>Agglutination</b> <b>Test</b> (and # 61619; 1 / 160 titer) and/or growth of Brucella spp. in blood culture in addition to the presence of clinical signs and findings. Diagnosis of osteoarticular system complications was established by physical examination and radiological findings obtained by diagnostic imaging tools. Magnetic resonance images of the thoracic, lumbar or sacral vertebrae were acquired in patients with back pain, low back pain and sacro-iliac joint pain. Results: Osteoarticular involvement was noted in 129 patients (40. 8 %) (females: 52 % and males: 48 %). The most common route of transmission was employment in farming and/or consumption of un-pasteurized milk or dairy products, especially fresh cheese, in 97 (75 %) cases. Mean age was 46 and # 61617; 18 years. Sacroiliitis was the most frequent osteoarticular involvement (n: 68, 52. 7 %), 70. 5 % of which were bilateral. Sacroiliitis was followed by spondylodiscitis in 35 (38. 7 %), peripheral arthritis in 20 (15. 5 %), bursitis in 1 (0. 8 %) cases. Patients with osteoarticular involvement received medical treatment for at least three months. Discussion: Ratio and anatomical region of osteoarticular involvement in brucellosis shows variability among areas. In the present study, we demonstrated that sacroiliitis was the most common form in Konya city. This disease should be included in differential diagnosis in patients with symptoms of sacroiliitis, spondylodiscitis or those with articular pain.

40|$|Problem statement: Brucellosis is a {{globally}} found infectious &# 13; {{disease and}} there is no licensed vaccine against human brucellosis. The present &# 13; study carried-out to evaluate the potency of our modified extracted lipopolysaccharide &# 13; (LPS) of B. abortus to elicit specific anti- Brucella antibodies in animal model &# 13; (Rabbit) {{as a part of a}} candidate vaccine for brucellosis. Lipopolysaccharide &# 13; is one of the main virulence factors and the most immunogenic structure of smooth &# 13; strains of Brucella. Approach: Lipopolysaccharide of B. abortus &# 13; S 99 (S-LPS) initially extracted through an optimized method as described previously. &# 13; After biochemical and pyrogenicity evaluations of the extracted S-LPS humoral &# 13; immune response against the extracted LPS analyzed in animal model through serological &# 13; assays such as Rose Bengal assay, Rapid agglutination (Rapid Wright) test and &# 13; <b>Standard</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (SAT or Wright test) to demonstrate the specific elicited &# 13; antibodies against the injected LPS. In addition, the interaction of LPS and anti-LPS &# 13; antibodies was demonstrated by Agarose Gel Immunodiffusion (AGID) assay. Results: &# 13; Higher doses of B. abortus S 99 LPS caused less or equal body temperature increase &# 13; in comparison to E. coli LPS doses. Sera of immunized animals had been reported &# 13; positive by RBT because of B. abortus LPS immunogenicity which we extracted through &# 13; our optimized method. The highest titer of anti- Brucella antibodies detected two &# 13; weeks after the third immunization (assayed by rapid slide agglutination and standard &# 13; agglutination tests). Anti- Brucella antibodies of immunized animals reacted more &# 13; specifically with the LPS of B. abortus in comparison with E. coli LPS and precipitation &# 13; lines between B. abortus LPS and immune sera appeared after 30 min while detected &# 13; after three hours for E. coli LPS. Conclusions/Recommendations: &# 13; The properties of B. abortus S 99 LPS concluded from the present study results, &# 13; suggest the possible use of this component as a carrier or a part of a sub-unit &# 13; or conjugated vaccine for human brucellosis...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Brucellosis is {{a disease}} of {{zoonotic}} importance as it affects both human as well as animal’s health, and therefore, directly affects animal productivity and human efficiency. Therefore, a {{study was conducted to}} estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans in Jammu and surrounding areas. Materials and Methods: A total of 121 sera samples from humans occupied with professional related to animals were collected and tested for anti-Brucella antibodies by Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT), modified RBPT (mRBPT), <b>standard</b> tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (STAT), and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA).

40|$|The {{different}} serologic {{techniques for}} bovine brucellosis diagnosis have different abilities to detect antibodies after vaccination with Brucella abortus strain 19. The humoral response in heifers vaccinated with Brucella abortus strain 19 was evaluated by using several serologic techniques. In the experimental field of INTA, Pilcaniyeu, Rio Negro province, sixteen 5 months old heifers were vaccinated subcutaneously {{with a standard}} dose (2 ml, containing 20 x 109 to 10 x 109 living organisms) of Brucella abortus strain 19. Sera from all the heifers were obtained on 18 occasions (one 87 days before vaccination, one immediately before vaccination and on 16 occasions after vaccination, during 488 days) and analyzed by buffered plate antigen test, rose bengal <b>test,</b> <b>standard</b> tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> 2 -mercaptoetanol test, complement fixation test, indirect ELISA, and competitive ELISA. Prior vaccination, 100 % of the heifers gave negative results in all the techniques used, while 100 % of them gave positive reaction in the first sampling after vaccination to all the techniques, {{with the exception of}} <b>standard</b> tube <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> that showed agglutinating titters of 1 / 100 or higher (positive threshold) in only 71. 4 % of the heifers. The indirect ELISA technique showed a reducing percentage of positive animals up until 316 days after vaccination, after which positive results were obtained. The competitive ELISA gave positive results in a variable number of heifers up to 253 days after vaccination when 100 % of the sera were negative to this technique. Buffered plate antigen test was the technique that gave positive results for a longest period, being 100 % of the animals negative to this technique at 450 days after vaccination.
