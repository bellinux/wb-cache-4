5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
25|$|A {{table saw}} or {{sawbench}} is a woodworking tool, {{consisting of a}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> mounted on an arbor, that is driven by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through {{the surface of a}} table, which provides support for the material, usually wood, being cut.|$|E

25|$|Small tools {{production}} {{was just a}} start; the item that set him apart was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
25|$|A biscuit joiner (or {{sometimes}} plate joiner) is a {{woodworking tool}} used to join {{two pieces of}} wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E
25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's {{music was}} {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} genres and artists. Albini was a fan of punk rock bands including Suicide, the Ramones, the Stooges, and Naked Raygun. When Riley joined the band in 1985 he brought with him a funk background, having worked at a Detroit studio where George Clinton and Sly Stone had recorded. During their career Big Black recorded cover versions of songs from a number of styles including post-punk, new wave, funk, hard rock, synthpop, and R; these included Rema-Rema's [...] "Rema-Rema", James Brown's [...] "The Payback", Wire's [...] "Heartbeat", Cheap Trick's [...] "He's a Whore", Kraftwerk's [...] "The Model", and the Mary Jane Girls' [...] "In My House".

Big Black distilled years of post-punk and hardcore down to a sound resembling a singing <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> mercillesly tearing through sheet metal. No one had made records that sounded so harsh." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|E

2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer the following advantages over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved dust collection due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a dust collection port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications. Where some {{of the advantages of}} a cabinet saw are desired in a home shop application, so-called [...] "hybrid" [...] saws have emerged to address this need.|$|E
2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer jointer, planer, shaper or boring features. The blade arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|E

50|$|The next {{improvement}} {{was the use}} of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> perhaps invented in England in the late 18th century, but perhaps in 17th-century Holland, the Netherlands. Soon thereafter, millers used gangsaws, which added additional blades so that a log would be reduced to boards in one quick step. Circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> were extremely expensive and highly subject to damage by overheating or dirty logs. A new kind of technician arose, the sawfiler. Sawfilers were highly skilled in metalworking. Their main job was to set and sharpen teeth. The craft also involved learning how to hammer a saw, whereby a saw is deformed with a hammer and anvil to counteract the forces of heat and cutting. The Modern circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> have replaceable teeth, but still need to be hammered.|$|R
50|$|A {{splitter}} is {{a stationary}} blade of similar thickness to the rotating <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> mounted behind it {{to prevent a}} board from pinching inward into the saw kerf and binding on the <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> potentially causing a dangerous kickback.
