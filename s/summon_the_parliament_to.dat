50|$|She {{married on}} 20 November 1509 in Wolfenbüttel Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg (1470-1543). Her father <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> in 1509 <b>to</b> collect a lady tax, because {{he found himself}} unable to pay the dowry alone. Only after long negotiations, did <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> grant three rounds of real estate tax, to {{generate}} for money for a dowry and jewels for the princess.|$|R
5000|$|Edward I <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> on 13 November 1295. In calling <b>the</b> <b>parliament,</b> Edward proclaimed in his writ of summons, [...] "what touches all, {{should be}} {{approved}} of all, {{and it is}} also clear that common dangers should be met by measures agreed upon in common." [...] At <b>the</b> time, <b>Parliament's</b> legislative authority was limited and its primary role was to levy taxes. Edward's paramount goal in <b>summoning</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> was <b>to</b> raise funds for his wars, specifically planned campaigns against the French and the Scots for the upcoming year, and countering an insurgency in Wales. This [...] "sound finance" [...] by taxation was a goal of <b>summoning</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament,</b> but it was tied into [...] "counsel" [...] to the king and [...] "the element of service" [...] for feudalism.|$|R
50|$|In 1589, Paris was {{effectively}} {{in the hands of}} the League. To escape, Henry III of France <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> of Paris <b>to</b> meet at Tours, but only a small faction of its parliamentarians accepted <b>the</b> <b>summons.</b> (Henry also held a parliament at Châlons, a town remaining faithful to the king, known as <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> of Châlons.) Following the king's assassination by the monk Jacques Clément, <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> of Tours continued to sit during the first years of Henry IV of France's reign.|$|R
50|$|In 1320 {{it became}} the invariable {{practice}} <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Commons <b>to</b> <b>Parliament.</b> If <b>the</b> Commons were not summoned <b>to</b> an early <b>Parliament,</b> this is indicated in a footnote. The normal place for <b>Parliaments</b> <b>to</b> meet was in Westminster. If a different location is known, it is indicated in a note.

50|$|In December 1788, Guillotin {{drafted a}} {{pamphlet}} entitled Petition of the Citizens Living in Paris, concerning the proper {{constitution of the}} States-General. As a result, he was <b>summoned</b> by <b>the</b> French <b>parliament</b> <b>to</b> {{give an account of}} his opinions, which served to increase his popularity. On 2 May 1789, he became one of 10 Paris deputies in the Estates-General of 1789 and was secretary to the body from June 1789 to October 1791.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) This was phase 'b' of <b>the</b> Long <b>Parliament,</b> when it {{functioned as}} a revolutionary <b>Parliament,</b> after <b>the</b> start of the English Civil War. <b>Parliament</b> assumed <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> legislate by Ordinance, without needing Royal assent. This phase ended with Pride's Purge, which {{converted}} <b>the</b> Long <b>Parliament</b> into <b>the</b> Rump <b>Parliament.</b> In 1644 <b>the</b> King <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Long <b>Parliament</b> <b>to</b> meet at Oxford. Those members who responded constituted <b>the</b> King's Oxford <b>Parliament</b> (phase c of <b>the</b> <b>Parliament,</b> see <b>the</b> previous section), in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary <b>Parliament</b> which continued <b>to</b> sit at the Palace of Westminster. The date in the Assembled column is the day when King Charles I raised his standard and commenced the English Civil War. The date in the Dissolved column is the day before Pride's Purge, when <b>the</b> full Long <b>Parliament</b> last met (until the Purge was reversed on 21 February 1660).|$|R
60|$|Grisell {{returned}} to all her old habits, {{and there was}} no difference in her position, excepting that she was scrupulously called Dame Grisell Copeland. Her father was soon called away by <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>Parliament,</b> sent forth in the name of King Henry, who was then in the hands of the Earl of Warwick in London. The Sheriff's messenger who brought him <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> plainly said that all the friends of York, Salisbury, and Warwick were needed for a great change that would dash the hopes of the Frenchwoman and her son.|$|R
50|$|Following Edward's {{escape from}} captivity, Montfort was {{defeated}} and {{killed at the}} Battle of Evesham in 1265. Henry's authority was restored and the Provisions of Oxford were forgotten, but this was nonetheless {{a turning point in}} the history of <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> of England. Although he was not obliged by statute to do so, Henry <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Commons <b>to</b> <b>parliament</b> three times between September 1268 and April 1270. However, this was not a significant turning point in the history of parliamentary democracy. Subsequently, very little is known about how representatives were selected because, at this time, being sent <b>to</b> <b>parliament</b> was not a prestigious undertaking. But Montfort's decision to <b>summon</b> knights of <b>the</b> shires and burgesses <b>to</b> his <b>parliament</b> did mark <b>the</b> irreversible emergence of the landed gentry as a force in politics. From then on, monarchs could not ignore them, which explains Henry's decision to <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Commons to several of his post-1265 parliaments.|$|R
50|$|Henry VIII {{was named}} Defender of the Faith (Fidei Defensor) for his {{opposition}} to Luther's Reformation. His wife's inability to bear a living son and the pope's inability to permit him a divorce while her nephew's armies held Rome, however, prompted Henry <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Reformation <b>Parliament</b> and <b>to</b> invoke <b>the</b> statute of praemunire against the English church, ultimately leading to the 1532 Submission of the Clergy and the 1534 Acts of Supremacy that established the Church of England. A law passed the same year made it an act of treason to publicly oppose these measures; SS John Fisher and Thomas More and many others were martyred for their continued Catholicism. Fear of foreign invasion was a concern until the 1588 rout of the Spanish Armada, but land sales after the Dissolution of the lesser and greater monasteries united most of the aristocracy behind the change. Religious rebellions in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire in 1536, in Cumberland in 1537, and in Devon and Cornwall in 1549 were quickly dealt with. The doctrine of the English Reformation differed little at first except with regard to royal authority over canon law: Lutheranism remained condemned and John Frith, Robert Barnes, and other Protestants were also martyred, including William Tyndale, whose Obedience of a Christian Man inspired Henry's break with Rome and whose translation of the Bible {{formed the basis of}} Henry's own authorized Great Bible. Meanwhile, laws in 1535 and 1542 fully merged Wales with England.|$|R
60|$|At a {{subsequent}} period of these melancholy times, {{we find the}} clan Gregor claiming the immunities of other tribes, when <b>summoned</b> by <b>the</b> Scottish <b>Parliament</b> <b>to</b> resist <b>the</b> invasion of the Commonwealth's army, in 1651. On {{the last day of}} March in that year, a supplication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King and <b>Parliament,</b> from Calum MacCondachie Vich Euen, and Euen MacCondachie Euen, in their own name, and that of the whole name of MacGregor, set forth, that while, in obedience <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orders of <b>Parliament,</b> enjoining all clans to come out in the present service under their chieftains, for the defence of religion, king, and kingdoms, the petitioners were drawing their men to guard the passes {{at the head of the}} river Forth, they were interfered with by the Earl of Athole and the Laird of Buchanan, who had required the attendance of many of the clan Gregor upon their arrays. This interference was, doubtless, owing to the change of name, which seems to have given rise to the claim of the Earl of Athole and the Laird of Buchanan to muster the MacGregors under their banners, as Murrays or Buchanans. It does not appear that the petition of the MacGregors, to be permitted to come out in a body, as other clans, received any answer. But upon the Restoration, King Charles, in <b>the</b> first Scottish <b>Parliament</b> of his reign (statute 1661, chap. 195), annulled the various acts against the clan Gregor, and restored them to the full use of their family name, and the other privileges of liege subjects, setting forth, as a reason for this lenity, that those who were formerly designed MacGregors had, during the late troubles, conducted themselves with such loyalty and affection to his Majesty, as might justly wipe off all memory of former miscarriages, and take away all marks of reproach for the same.|$|R
50|$|Between 1295 and 1318 he was {{regularly}} <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>parliament,</b> {{and from}} <b>the</b> {{fact that his}} name does not occur in the writ issued <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> of 1319, it may be inferred that he was then dead. In 1320 his executors were ordered to cause {{the records of the}} proceedings before him as justice of assize or otherwise to be transmitted to the exchequer.|$|R

50|$|In 1629 Howth {{joined with}} his fellow peers in protesting against the level of Irish {{taxation}} and in 1630 he petitioned the English Crown for <b>the</b> <b>summoning</b> of <b>the</b> Irish <b>Parliament.</b> When <b>the</b> Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford duly <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Irish <b>Parliament</b> in 1634 Howth played a prominent part in its proceedings, sitting on two key committees.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> 8th <b>Parliament</b> of Elizabeth I {{was summoned}} by Queen Elizabeth I on 4 January 1593 and {{assembled}} on 19 February following. At the state opening of <b>Parliament</b> <b>the</b> Lord Keeper Sir John Puckering informed {{the house that}} <b>the</b> reasons for <b>summoning</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> were <b>the</b> threat of Spanish invasion and the Queen's [...] "extraordinarye and most excessive expenses". Edward Coke, the Solicitor-general and Member of Parliament (MP) for Norfolk, was appointed speaker.|$|R

50|$|According to the Czechoslovak {{constitution}} of 1920, the only body with power {{to issue the}} laws was <b>the</b> National Assembly (<b>parliament)</b> with each law being contrasigned by the president. As {{there was no way}} <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> in <b>the</b> exile, the only body with limited legislative power was the office of the president. The legality of the whole government-in-exile was therefore derived from the person of Edvard Beneš who, nevertheless, resigned his office in October 1938.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{previous}} <b>Parliament</b> first sat on 29 April 1992. <b>The</b> <b>Parliament</b> Act 1911 {{required at}} the time for each <b>Parliament</b> <b>to</b> be dissolved before {{the fifth anniversary of}} its first sitting, therefore the latest date the dissolution and <b>the</b> <b>summoning</b> of <b>the</b> next <b>parliament</b> could have been held on was 28 April 1997.|$|R
50|$|On 22 January 1377 he was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> held at Castledermot; and on 11 September 1381 to {{that held}} at Trim; and on 29 April 1382 to that held at Dublin.|$|R
50|$|He {{took steps}} towards modernizing and democratizing his {{dominion}} and founded the University of Salamanca in 1212. In 1188 he <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> first <b>parliament</b> reflecting full {{representation of the}} citizenry ever seen in Western Europe, the Cortes of León.|$|R

50|$|When the {{abeyance}} of the Barony le Despenser {{was terminated}} in 1604, Mary Fane was confirmed with precedence dating from 1264, though modern scholars {{do not accept}} that <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> of that year created hereditary baronies.|$|R
