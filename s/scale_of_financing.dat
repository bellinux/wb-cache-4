40|$|Purpose: The {{organization}} {{of this article}} was subordinated to the connections between the government program documentation related to the state social objectives and their implementation at the budgetary level. The article shows the necessity of perceiving fiscal policy as an instrument toimplement government programming objectives. The aim of the article is to assess the degree of implementation of social objectives on the basis of information resulting from the experience gained in the area of performance budgeting in Poland. Methodology: To assess the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> of social objectives in Poland in comparison with other European countries, the author used Eurostat data from COFOG (Classification of the Functions of Government). To assess the effectiveness of state operations related to the achievement of social objectives, the author used information from the implementation of the performance-oriented state budget. It was assumed that the performance-oriented system linking the clear structure of public expenditure with the objectives and measures assigned to them to assess the effectiveness of fiscalpolicy in particular areas of government intervention. Findings: The relations between individual strategic documents related to social objectives and performance-oriented budgetary structure are presented. The results indicate that the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> of social tasks in Poland is at a lower level than the average for European countries.

This thesis aims at figuring out whether there are relations between company’s capital structure and their enterprise value and if the relation exists, how the capital structure may influence the firm’s value and whether an optimal structure does exist for the companies to maximize their value. This paper presents empirical findings through establishing the relationship that exists between the capital structure choices of firms and their return on equity and Tobin’s Q (a market performance measure). Other factors that may influence firm value such as size, liquidity, profitability, growth opportunity and industry were also selected as control variables. The study employed panel data analysis by using Pooled OLS, Fixed-effect estimation and GMM. The usual identification tests and the Hausman’s Chi-square statistics for testing whether the Fixed Effects model estimator is an appropriate alternative to the Random Effects model were also computed for each model. The empirical results based on 2001 to 2010 accounting and marketing data for 40 quoted firms confirm the effect of capital structure on firm value as well as prove the existence of an optimal capital structure for the companies. In addition, the study also shows that industries have influence on the relationship between firm value and capital structure...|$|E

30|$|However, in reality, SMEs {{have made}} {{significant}} progress {{even in the}} absence of a regular financial system, which impelled researchers to turn their focus to financing channels outside the regular financial system, such as underground private banks, civil bidding, and even exorbitant usury. Taking nongovernmental finance in Wenzhou as an example, there are nongovernmental loans, industrial loans, and civil bidding (Wang et al. 2004; Zhang 2000; Guo and Liu 2002). Whether through financing channels within or outside the regular financial system, SMEs had to pay certain rates for loans since all these financial services are offered for profit. Thus, the SMEs were under the double restriction of a shortage of regular capital supply channels and the high cost of irregular capital supply (Zhou 2007). The cost of regular capital supply was also considerable. With overcapacity in China’s economic sector and the rise of the RMB exchange rate, the profit rate of export-oriented enterprises decreased more and more. Influenced by changes in international marketing conditions, SMEs entrepreneurs who depend heavily on such financing channels tended to experience cracks in the capital supply chain. A large number of entrepreneurs have gone into hiding due to the pressure to repay loans. These SMEs have collapsed on a large scale due to the guarantee chain for the credit warranty system established by banks and massive mutual interenterprise debt. Thus, the causes for the capital shortage were first, that financing approaches were seriously limited and second, SMEs entrepreneurs intended to restrict the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> in order to avoid risks. This raises the question of whether there are any other approaches to tackling the capital shortage problem that emerged in the course of SME operations as market subjects.|$|E
40|$|Cicin-Sain, BilianaApproximately 29 {{percent of}} the ocean’s fish stocks that have been {{assessed}} are considered as ‘overfished’, with levels increasing the most in tropical waters which often border developing countries. Following over two decades of international agreement that overfishing is a global environmental problem, on September 25, 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution setting 17 ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ that included a commitment to end overfishing by 2020. Global models have suggested that achieving this target will require {{a significant reduction in}} the amount of fishing effort, with unknown costs to states or in aggregate to the international community. Acknowledging that there are many determinants of human fishing behavior, this dissertation adopts an institutions perspective on fisheries, to focus on governance as one of the key (and most feasible) variables that can be changed in order to reduce current levels of overfishing. Governance is defined as a systemic concept relating to the exercise of control or influence over fishing activity by political, economic and social institutions, and the organizations emerging from them and articulating policies to implement or change them or establish new rules. Given the diversity of different types of fisheries, any changes or reforms to governance in order to reduce overfishing will be context-specific and only likely to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) in the aggregate. As such, empirical analysis can be useful to understand the types of governance reforms that could support progress in different contexts and at different scales, and their potential costs. Although a wide body of literature exists on governance reform efforts at the level of specific fisheries, and a growing body on national-scale reforms in developed countries with temperate waters, relatively few cases have been documented of national or large-scale fisheries governance reforms in tropical developing countries, where the trends in overfishing are growing. This dissertation aims to contribute conceptual tools {{that could be used to}} expand the body of empirical analysis of fisheries governance reforms in tropical developing countries at a national or large spatial scale, and answer the following questions: (i) what is the conceptual framework that would be needed to support greater empirical analysis of fisheries governance reforms in tropical developing countries at national or large spatial scales, and (ii) what conclusions can be drawn from a first application of this framework to a relatively new body of experience in tropical fisheries governance reforms, based on the recent portfolio of investments by the World Bank? To answer this question, a conceptual framework for ocean fisheries governance reform has been developed based on a literature review, as a common lens by which to assess changes in different cases and contexts, and the potential costs. This lens has been applied to the World Bank’s portfolio of public investments over the last 10 years, which provides a relatively unique body of data on developing country large-scale reform efforts, including financial cost data. Within this dataset, two case studies from different types of fisheries and geographies are described in detailed, one coastal in West Africa, the other with small islands in the western Pacific. Analysis of the World Bank’s portfolio showed several common types of fisheries governance reforms supported with varying degrees of success in contributing towards reducing or preventing overfishing, including establishment of co-governance partnerships between the state and resource users to create (or in some cases return) management rights for the latter over coastal and multi-species sedentary fisheries; introduction of effort and catch rights in industrialized fisheries; and enhanced efforts of state agencies to support reforms, notably to increase compliance with existing rules. The financial costs, i. e. those costs incurred by states, of reforms in the cases was on the order of $ 245 million total, across 11 countries and one regional agency (i. e. the regional effort in the SWIOFP), over a period of 5 years maximum. The financial costs of policy formulation and reform were relatively small across the cases, though this was often a relatively lengthy time process, while the majority of the costs were incurred in developing and enacting rule changes or new rules—generally the transaction costs of establishing and supporting community/stakeholder management rights in co-governance partnerships, and also the costs of enhancing operations of state organizations charged with supporting harvest rules, such as monitoring and surveillance to enhance compliance—essentially the enforcement costs. In terms of the economic costs of the reform, foregone production and resource rent did not happen at a large scale in West Africa, where effort reductions were achieved by reducing illegal fishing effort and the industrial vessel buy-back in Senegal never occurred. In the Pacific Islands, the introduction of reforms in the purse seine fishery prior to overfishing, offered the potential to avoid effort reductions and foregone rent, in favor of a cap or limit. More broadly, the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> for reform—some $ 245 million in 11 countries over 5 years—is both significant and yet a fraction of the ocean fisheries in many of these countries: representing seven districts in eastern Indonesia, four out of nine Pacific Island Countries, 10 {{percent of the}} EEZ in Tanzania, just under 20 pilot sites for coastal sedentary fishery systems in four countries of West Africa, etc. The duration of reform has been a minimum of five years in these cases, with many not considered complete after this period. Given the timeframe, and the mixed picture of success (as well as lack of data) in the cases examined, a note of caution may be warranted as to the scale of reform efforts needed in tropical ocean fishery systems in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target. Both significant time horizons and some $ 245 million in external financing resources were needed in order to achieve globally modest reductions in fishing effort, though prevention of overfishing in the Western and Central Pacific purse seine fishery system seems likely to be more cost-effective. Even if much more external financing became available, in the cases reviewed the entry points and characteristics of reform suggest a process of years. While care must be taken in extrapolating from case studies, this research suggests that at the current rate the Sustainable Development Goal target seems unlikely to be met. Greater empirical research to understand the types of large-scale fisheries governance reforms that have led to reductions in overfishing in different developing country contexts, notably in the tropics, and the economic costs and benefits of these reforms, are urgently needed. This could lead to more causal research on the amount of new investment in ocean fisheries governance reform needed to end overfishing and meet the Sustainable Development Goal.

There is also no apparent commitment to increase resources for the all important compliance function and no mandating of 'plain English' explanations.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the dynamics <b>of</b> new venture <b>financing</b> across 20 business start-ups. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 20 cases were explored, via initial discussions with the founder(s), and follow-up contact to confirm sources <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> acquired during new venture creation. This approach was adopted because of the challenges associated with acquiring full details <b>of</b> start-up <b>financing,</b> and in particular informal forms <b>of</b> new venture <b>financing.</b> Findings: Significant variation in, and <b>scale</b> <b>of,</b> new venture <b>financing</b> was identified. In multiple cases, funding patterns did not tally with established explanations <b>of</b> small business <b>financing.</b> Research limitations/implications: The primary limitation of the analysis is the focus on {{a small number of}} individual cases. Although this allowed for more detailed analysis, it does not make the findings applicable across the small business population as a whole. New ventures acquired very different forms <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> and in different configurations or "bundles", so creating a wide range <b>of</b> start-up <b>financing</b> patterns and overall levels of capitalisation. This suggests that multiple factors influence founder decisions on start-up funding acquisition. It also indicates the wide divergence between highly capitalised and under-capitalised start-ups. Practical implications: Many of the new ventures were started with low levels of capitalisation, which as the literature suggests is a strong determinant of reduced prospects for survival. This suggests a possible "financing deficit", rather than gap, for a proportion of business start-ups. Originality/value: The paper provides an alternative methodology for considering new venture financing, and as a result concludes that standard, rational theories <b>of</b> small business <b>financing</b> may not always hold for new ventures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|While the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> {{informal}} <b>finance</b> in {{many developing}} countries has long been known to be extensive, data at the national level and particularly in Africa has been scarce. Moreover, financial sector development policy has firmly shifted its attention away from informal finance and towards working with the formal sector to provide inclusive financial services. However, some donors and policy makers are concerned that this approach is inadequate and will leave the poorest people unserved with even basic financial services, and are as a result experimenting with savings-led group-based approaches. This paper uses data from the 2006 Financial Access Survey carried out in Kenya to examine the scale, scope and nature of informal groups in order to assess the context for this alternative strategy. This survey provides the first significant nationally representative dataset to exist offering a much more detailed analysis of informal group operation than has so far been possible. First, we demonstrate the extent of use and estimated <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> savings currently flowing through these systems. Second, we examine the profile of use via socio-economic characteristics through the use of logistic regression analysis. We then turn to the reasons users give for engaging in groups, the way they are organised and the experiences reported by users having engaged with them. We conclude by drawing out the policy implications of this analysis for the new focus on savings-led group-based approaches and for policy towards the development of the informal financial sector...|$|R
40|$|This brief {{explains}} CPI’s {{understanding and}} definition <b>of</b> key climate <b>finance</b> terms {{and the reasons}} for these definitions to inform the debate and build a common understanding among stakeholders. • Policy makers, investors, financial intermediaries and analysts do not always have the same understanding <b>of</b> key climate <b>finance</b> terms and concepts. Building a common understanding <b>of</b> key climate <b>finance</b> terminology would improve ongoing discussions on how best to track climate finance, clarify efforts to measure its effectiveness, and help identify where public sector interventions can best impact the <b>scale</b> up <b>of</b> climate <b>finance.</b> • In its Global Landscape <b>of</b> Climate <b>Finance</b> studies, CPI applies a definition <b>of</b> climate <b>finance</b> which counts public and private investment costs plus public framework expenditures but excludes revenue support. We use this to track current climate mitigation and adaptation financing, while reducing double counting as far as possible. In detailed case studies, we also analyze other costs and public revenue support provided over the lifetime of investments. • Clarifying project-level climate finance terminology can help policymakers better understand the range of options available for public actors to both reduce the costs and boost the revenues of low-carbon and climate-resilient projects in order to make investment more financially attractive for the private sector. It also helps to show that public framework expenditures are {{an essential part of the}} transition towards low-carbon and climate-resilient economies...|$|R

40|$|First, {{there is}} an {{analysis}} on the present marketing segmentation <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products. Then, this paper explores whether the theory of niche has any application on the marketing segmentation <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products {{from the perspective of}} niche. Based on this, the influencing factors model <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products’ niche is given. After that, the niche selection criteria <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products’ marketing segmentation is given according to three aspects - needs of customers and behavior characteristics, innovation ability <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products and competitiveness of banks. At last, the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> niche selection criteria <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products’ marketing segmentation is designed which is helpful to the special target market selection <b>of</b> RMB <b>financing</b> products and also provides reference for the exact orientation and dislocation competition <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> enterprises.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{developed}} around {{the concept of}} the “intermediate city”. In fact, during this precarious phase set by the economical crisis and worsened by the shrinking condition of the city, it is necessary for Rotterdam to work in an “intermediate dimension” in several terms: <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> time, <b>financing</b> and also location, focussing more on those parts of the city that have been neglected for a long time, in favour of concentrated interventions in the downtown and in the suburban edges, thus addressing limited targets of population. Two complementary strategies, based on the same principles but with different processes and hypothesis, are proposed in order to depict an alternative model of urban regeneration as a basis for a more sustainable development.
