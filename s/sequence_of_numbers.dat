It covers most notably his theory of permutations and combinations; the standard foundations of combinatorics today and subsets of the foundational problems today known as the twelvefold way. It also discusses the motivation and applications of a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> {{more closely related to}} number theory than probability; these Bernoulli numbers bear his name today, and are one of his more notable achievements.|$|E
5|$|The main {{technique}} Cage {{used for}} composition {{is that of}} nested proportions: an arbitrary <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> defines {{the structure of a}} piece on both the macroscopic and the microscopic level, so that the larger parts of each piece are in the same relation to the whole as the smaller parts are to a single unit of it. For instance, the proportion for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼ (in whole notes), and a unit here is equal to 8½ bars (the end of a unit is marked with a double barline in the score, unless it coincides with the end of a section). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Section A consists of a single unit, composed according to the given proportion: correlation on the microscopic level. A is repeated, and AA forms {{the first part of the}} proportion on the macroscopic level: 1, 1. B consists of three units and an appendix of ¼ of a unit. B is also repeated, and BB gives the second half of the proportion: 3¼, 3¼. Therefore, AABB has proportions 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼: correlation on the macroscopic level. The musical phrases within each unit are also governed by the same proportion. See Example 2 for a graph of the structure of Sonata III.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} and sometimes confusing fact about the Secretariat's internal organization {{is the use}} of a specially structured <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> to refer to different internal divisions. For example, the Undersecretariat of Interior Intelligence is numbered '8', and its dependencies, such as the Directorates of Counterintelligence and Judicial Surveillance are numbered '84' and '85' respectively.

25|$|One way to {{represent}} permutations of n is by an integer N with 0nbsp&≤nbsp&Nnbsp&<nbsp&n!, provided convenient methods {{are given to}} convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when n is small enough that N can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&12, and for 64-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> d'n, d'n−1, …, d2, d1, where d'i is a non-negative integer less than i (one may omit d1, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express N in the factorial number system, {{which is just a}} particular mixed radix representation, where for numbers up to n! the bases for successive digits are n, , …, 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a Lehmer code or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.|$|E
