5|$|A {{pedigreed cat}} is one whose ancestry is {{recorded}} by a cat fancier organization. A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic <b>short-haired</b> or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
5|$|The {{generally}} accepted hypothesis among breeders {{is that the}} Maine Coon is descended from the pairings of local <b>short-haired</b> domestic cats and long-haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers (possibly by Captain Charles Coon) or 11th-century Norsemen. The connection to the Norsemen {{is seen in the}} strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that {{is said to be a}} descendant of cats that traveled with the Norsemen.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral {{origins of}} the Maine Coon are unknown — there are only {{speculation}} and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France {{with the help of}} Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other <b>short-haired</b> breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a <b>short-haired</b> girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped <b>short-haired</b> woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British <b>short-haired</b> bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a <b>short-haired</b> man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

25|$|Esmont was {{concerned}} that the distinct types of borzaya {{were in danger of}} degenerating without a controlled system of breeding. He convinced the Soviet government that borzois were a valuable asset to the hunters who supported the fur industry and henceforth, their breeding was officially regulated. To this day <b>short-haired</b> Hortaya Borzaya are highly valued hunting dogs on the steppes, while the long-haired Psovaya Borzaya, is going through a hard period of restoration of its working qualities after decades of shadow, mainly show existence.|$|E
25|$|A {{black and}} cream queen {{with a short}} wig and braided tail. She is aloof and {{somewhat}} mysterious. She is often assumed to be Abyssinian, given her unusual markings and exotic <b>short-haired</b> appearance. Her costume is smooth and form-fitting and her make up is fairly simple, without warmers or fluff on her shoulders. In the film version, when not actually participating in a group performance she would strike poses reminiscent of ancient Egyptian paintings, and she was Mr. Mistoffelees' assistant in his magic trick to rescue Old Deuteronomy.|$|E
25|$|Heim gave Bello {{the name}} Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund and {{dismissed}} the first {{representative of a}} newly named breed from the ring. Heim wrote the first standard based on Bello, and Schertenleib started to search for {{other members of the}} new breed. He found two <b>short-haired</b> bitches and breeding began. The first Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were stockier and rougher than the modern dogs; the skulls were wider than desirable today and showed a marked stop. Judging from old pictures, the coloring was bad; the black coat was mixed with yellow wool at the neck, flanks and rear.|$|E
25|$|On the January 21, 2013 Raw, a <b>short-haired</b> Hawkins {{returned}} {{on television}} tapings in a show-closing brawl. He made his return match on the February 9 episode of Saturday Morning Slam, losing to Justin Gabriel. After that Hawkins most commonly appeared on Superstars and NXT where he lost {{all of his}} matches. On the May 8, 2014 episode of NXT, Hawkins competed in a battle royal to determine a new #1 contender to the NXT Championship, {{in which he was}} unsuccessful. On the May 22 episode of NXT Hawkins faced Adrian Neville in a losing effort.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth <b>short-haired</b> coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a {{consistent}} basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
25|$|The Boxer is a medium-sized, <b>short-haired</b> {{breed of}} dog, {{developed}} in Germany. The coat {{is smooth and}} tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, {{and the necessity of}} producing thousands of dogs {{for one of the most}} popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.|$|E
25|$|Parallel to {{this success}} ran Toyota’s feud with future tag-team partner Toshiyo Yamada. Initially, {{following}} Tokyo Sweethearts' success, the AJW braintrust {{felt they could}} well be the new Beauty Pair or Crush Gals. However, Toyota's real chemistry came not with Shimoda but with Yamada, whose style was unlike Toyota's and provided more of a contrast. Yamada was a slightly built, <b>short-haired,</b> kicking specialist, who idolized both Chigusa Nagayo and Akira Maeda. Unlike other wrestlers who rely on kicks and submissions, Yamada could also work the rapid-paced matches and was accomplished at building to near-falls with repeated kick-outs at the last possible moment. To begin with, however, Toyota and Yamada were opponents rather than partners. Between 1989 and 1991 they wrestled many times. At the start of 1992, the two won their first tag team championship when they defeated KAORU and Lady Apache in Tokyo on January 19 for the UWA Women's World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} breed standard {{was written in}} 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited {{a few times to}} achieve today’s current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they even knew one existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but “show dogs” represented (and still do) {{only a small portion of}} the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) <b>short-haired.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on <b>short-haired</b> animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. If {{you live in a}} tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, it is suggested that you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E
500|$|In 2006 the {{bumblebee}} researcher Dave Goulson {{founded a}} registered charity, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, {{to prevent the}} extinction [...] "of any of the UK's bumblebees." [...] In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the <b>short-haired</b> bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with Natural England, Hymettus and the RSPB, has reintroduced <b>short-haired</b> bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent. The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh {{have been set up}} to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five [...] "Schedule 41 priority" [...] species: the ruderal bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus; [...] the red-shanked carder bee, Bombus ruderarius; the shrill carder bee, Bombus sylvarum; the brown-banded carder bee, Bombus humilis and the moss carder bee, [...] Bombus muscorum.|$|E

500|$|The Norwegian Forest cat ( [...] or [...] ) is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat originating in Northern Europe. This natural breed {{is adapted to}} a very cold climate, with top coat of glossy, long, water-shedding hairs and a woolly undercoat for insulation.

During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.|$|E

Benicio del Toro appeared on the video as a background character, portraying a teenager sitting on a car hood. The video first appeared on MTV on March 6, 1987 and became the most requested video in the channel history by a record-breaking 20 consecutive weeks. It starts with showing a number of Latin people dancing in a Spanish barrio as Madonna watches them from her window. She plays two different characters in the video: a <b>short-haired</b> Catholic woman and a colorful Flamenco dancer. The characters are quite opposite in their portrayal, which is emphasized by two opposing settings for the characters. Firstly, the video shows a sparsely decorated room with an altar and pictures of Hispanic people on the wall. Madonna plays a pale-looking, pious young woman wearing a white petticoat and her short hair brushed back. She sheds tears in her room and reluctantly ignores the invitation of the Latinos in the street to join them.|$|E
500|$|Sophie Muller {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Love Is a Camera", which {{was released on}} 30 May 2014. The video commences with Ellis-Bextor, who impersonates an [...] "eerie temptress" [...] {{dressed in a black}} [...] "ankle-length, lace-trimmed" [...] gown, walking and dancing slowly inside a classical mansion. Exploring the divisions of her house, she starts adjusting picture frames, which hold monochromatic photographs of individuals. One of those pictures depicts a <b>short-haired</b> woman, dressed in white—also played by Ellis-Bextor—who starts mimicking the song, whilst in the frame. The story of the woman in the frame is told throughout the video—after crossing a field, she finds the mansion. Her photograph is taken by the dressed-in-black Ellis-Bextor, and she is trapped in the frame. Whilst walking down a staircase, the [...] "temptress" [...] passes by a bearded man who stares at her interestingly. Both enter the mansion, where they drink; the dressed-in-black Ellis-Bextor holds his hand. She convinces him to take his photograph, and after realizing it is a trap, he tries to escape. However, the [...] "temptress" [...] finds him running and takes his photograph; trapping him in a frame as well.|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{occurred}} {{in the second half}} of October 2007. [...] The scenes on the freighter in this and later episodes were filmed for several days on a freighter ten to fifteen minutes off the west coast of Oahu, Hawaii, where Lost is filmed. [...] Instead of docking the ship and returning to the ocean each day, the actors and crew slept on the freighter in areas that were not being used for filming. The Oxford scenes were shot at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu. In 1996, Desmond has short hair and no facial hair and in 2004, Desmond sports long and untamed hair with a full beard. [...] Cusick did not cut his hair; it was hidden underneath a <b>short-haired</b> wig by [...] "really talented hair and makeup folks", according to Carlton Cuse. [...] All freighter scenes were shot before Cusick shaved most of his beard for the 1996 scenes. [...] A fake beard was glued onto Cusick for the episodes [...] "Ji Yeon" [...] and [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] while his beard grew back. The equations on Faraday's chalkboard were written by a physicist who was hired as a consultant by the producers. The way the transitions between the 1996 and 2004 scenes would take place was frequently discussed during production. The producers took the advice of editor Mark Goldman, who suggested sudden cuts with [...] "no fancy effect, and in some cases, no sound cut", similar to the way [...] "All Good Things..." [...] was edited. The original ending would set up the following episode by having Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) drop a bag containing a gas mask at Faraday's feet. But the producers thought it did not work after the emotional scenes between Desmond and Penny, and decided to finish with Faraday reading his diary.|$|E

[...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
