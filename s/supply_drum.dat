40|$|Research and {{innovation}} activity to create energy-efficient {{processes in the}} melon processing, is a significant task. Separation skin from the melon flesh with their subsequent destination application {{in the creation of}} new food products is one of the time-consuming operations in this technology. Lack of scientific and experimental base of this operation holding back the development of high-performance machines for its implementation. In this connection, the technique of the experiment on the separation of the skins of melons in the pilot plant and the search for optimal regimes of its work methods by statistical modeling is offered. The late-ripening species of melon: Kalaysan, Thorlami, Gulab-sary are objects of study. Interaction of factors influencing on separating the melon skins process is carried out. A central composite rotatable design and fractional factorial experiment was used. Using the method of experimental design with treatment planning template in Design Expert v. 10 software yielded a regression equations that adequately describe the actual process. Rational intervals input factors values are established: the ratio of the rotational speed of the drum to the abrasive supply roll rotational frequency; the gap between the <b>supply</b> <b>drum</b> and the shearing knife; shearing blade sharpening angle; the number of feed drum spikes; abrading drum orifices diameter. The mean square error does not exceed 12. 4 %. Regression equations graphic interpretation is presented by scatter plots and engineering nomograms that can be predictive of a choice of rational values of the input factors for three optimization criteria: minimal specific energy consumption in the process of cutting values, maximal specific performance by the pulp and pulp extraction ratio values. Obtained data can be used for the operational management of the process technological parameters, taking into account the geometrical dimensions of the melon and its inhomogeneous structure...|$|E

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: The object in these tests {{was to determine}} the pull of certain loads on dry and muddy roads of different grades and surfaces. The following roads were selected on which the tests were to be made; the road that leads from shops to East college entrance oiled road (Manhattan Avenue) from East college entrance to Fremont street; Fremont street from South end of oiled road to 9 th street; South on 9 th street to Leavenworth street; East on Leavenworth street to 2 nd street; South on 2 nd street to Humbolt street; West on Humbolt street to 9 th street; North on 9 th street to Fremont street; East on Fremont street to 2 nd street; North on 2 nd street to Moro street, West on Moro street to oiled road (Manhattan Avenue); North on oiled road to North end; West from North end of oiled road to gate just North of college barns; from this gate up to shop to starting point. These were supposed to be fair samples of different kinds of road, A survey was then made of these roads and a profile of them plotted on standard profile paper to a convenient scale from which the grades of the road may be obtained. The recording traction dynamometer used in connection with these tests was built in the Kansas State Agricultural College shops, A full description with detail and assembly drawings of the instrument is given in the designers' thesis. A few minro changes were made {{in the construction of the}} dynamometer and some new parts were added. The main axle was shortened so that the wheels would track with a farm wagon. The spring that was to be placed in the <b>supply</b> <b>drum</b> was omitted and a brake shoe was substituted in its place. Instead of using one edge of the paper as a zero line, a marker was attached to the machine to make a zero or base line and in which the movable pencil would lie when there was no pull. As metallic coated paper was used on the dynamometer, brass points were substituted in place of the common pencil points...|$|E

Customers demand more variety, better quality, and greater service {{in terms of}} reliability and response time. The success in this environment is very much determined by how a company forms the whole supply chain. A supplier plays very important role as the production cost and product quality are highly dependent on the supplier. Besides cost and quality, an efficient delivery that can respond quickly to the customer demand {{is also an important}} issue in the customer-oriented economics now days.
