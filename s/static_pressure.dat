The builders hastily equipped the ship with rudder controls built for Poltava and delivered the ship for her sea trials on , 1896.

Performance of the compressor is measured with three sets of double row diffusers with different radial spacing between the diffusers.

25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the <b>static</b> <b>pressure.</b> The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E

One method was used as published; the other was modified for certain cases of coolant discharge from the blade suction surface. For coolant ejection from blade surface regions where the surface <b>static</b> <b>pressures</b> are higher than the blade exit pressure, both methods predict the experimental results quite well. However, for ejection from regions with surface <b>static</b> <b>pressures</b> lower than the blade exit pressure, both methods predict too small a change in efficiency.

25|$|Across the {{expansion}} fan, the flow accelerates (velocity increases) and the Mach number increases, while the <b>static</b> <b>pressure,</b> temperature and density decrease. Since {{the process is}} isentropic, the stagnation properties (e.g. total pressure and total temperature) remain constant across the fan.|$|E

25|$|Dynamic {{pressure}} is the kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid particle. Dynamic {{pressure is}} in fact one {{of the terms of}} Bernoulli's equation, which can be derived from the conservation of energy for a fluid in motion.

25|$|The Navier–Stokes equations, {{even when}} written {{explicitly}} for specific fluids, are rather generic {{in nature and}} their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse.

40|$|The viscous {{transonic}} flow about a stationary body in free air was numerically investigated. The geometry chosen was a symmetric NACA 64 A 010 airfoil at a freestream Mach number of 0. 8, a Reynolds number of 4 million based on chord, and angles of attack of 0 and 2 degrees. These conditions were such that, at 2 degrees incidence unsteady periodic motion was calculated along the aft {{portion of the}} airfoil and in its wake.

25|$|For {{fluid flow}} over a porous boundary, the fluid {{velocity}} can be discontinuous between the free fluid and the fluid in the porous media (this {{is related to}} the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low subsonic speeds to assume that a gas is incompressible — that is, the density of the gas does not change even though the speed and <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> change.|$|E

25|$|The {{measurement}} and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an airspeed indicator ("ASI") {{connected to a}} pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more pitot probes (or tubes) facing the on-coming air flow to measure pitot pressure (also called stagnation, total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a study to determine if commercially available automatic sprinklers could withstand the high <b>static</b> <b>pressures</b> in deep underground coal mines without leaking and if exposure to the mine environment affected their leak pressures. New sprinklers and sprinklers exposed to the mine environment were subjected to increasing pressures until leakage occurred. The average leak pressures of the new sprinklers ranged from 640 to 2, 300 psig and were significantly different for sprinklers from different manufacturers and for different types of sprinklers. Generally, standard-response sprinklers withstood higher pressures than fast-response sprinklers. The results indicated that most commercially available sprinklers would withstand the high <b>static</b> <b>pressures</b> in deep underground coal mines; however, they would not provide the same reliability and safety factor as sprinklers used aboveground at or below their rated pressure of 175 psig. The average leak pressures of the sprinklers exposed to the mine environment ranged from 740 to 1, 180 psig. The mine environment affected the ability of 66 % of the sprinklers to withstand high <b>static</b> <b>pressures.</b> New sprinklers were also evaluated at pressures of at least 500 psig for 30 days to determine their ability to withstand long-term exposure to high static pressures; no leakage was observed.

25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of {{turbulent}} air {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Forced draught — A {{mechanical}} draft tower with {{a blower}} type fan at the intake. The fan forces {{air into the}} tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities. The low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the forced draft design {{is its ability to}} work with high <b>static</b> <b>pressure.</b> Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations. This fan/fin geometry is also known as blow-through.|$|E
25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. Whether it {{will come out of}} solution in the bulk of the solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth. This may include velocity changes and turbulence in fluids and local tensile loads in solids and semi-solids. Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas.|$|E
