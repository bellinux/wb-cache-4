Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even {{with the use of}} a physiologic saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic <b>storage</b> <b>fluid.</b> If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment.|$|E

He based his technique on the observation by Keller [...] {{that the loss of}} electrolytes from a kidney during storage could be prevented by the use of a <b>storage</b> <b>fluid</b> containing cations in quantities approaching those normally present in cells. In Collins' model, the dogs were well hydrated prior to nephrectomy, and were also given mannitol to induce a diuresis. Phenoxybenzamine, a vasodilator and lysozomal enzyme stabiliser, was injected into the renal artery before nephrectomy. The kidneys were immersed in saline immediately after removal, and perfused through the renal artery with 100-150 ml of a cold electrolyte solution from a height of 100 cm. The kidneys remained in iced saline {{for the rest of the}} storage period. The solution used for these successful cold perfusions imitated the electrolyte composition of intracellular fluids by containing large amounts of potassium and magnesium. The solution also contained glucose, heparin, procaine and phenoxybenzamine. The solution's pH was 7.0 at 25 °C. Collins was able to achieve successful 24-hour storage of 6 kidneys, and 30 hour storage of 3 kidneys, with the kidneys functioning immediately after reimplantation, despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies. Collins emphasised the poor results obtained with a Ringer's solution flush, in finding similar results with this management when compared with kidneys treated by surface cooling alone. Liu [...] reported that Collins' solution could give successful 48-hour storage when the solution was modified by the inclusion of amino acids and vitamins. However, Liu performed no control experiments to show that these modifications were crucial.|$|E

To be used as thermal energy <b>storage</b> <b>fluid,</b> low melting point {{is one of the}} utmost important thermal properties amongst other. Eutectic salt was defined as a combination of two or more salt at different composition producing lower melting point than of it purest form. Four types of salts, sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium nitrate (KNO 3), lithium nitrate (LiNO 3), and sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) were used to form fifteen mixtures of different composition to be tested on SS 316 L. The composition based on weight ratio was generated using response surface methodology (RSM). Eutectic composition of molten salt used as thermal energy <b>storage</b> <b>fluid</b> can possibly affect the corrosion occurrences due to the existence of Cl− ion and thereby influence the lifespan of the 316 L stainless steel. This study indicates that the compositional different of eutectic mixture significantly affected the lifespan of the 316 L stainless steel against corrosion. Two types of approaches are used in describing the corrosion behavior, which are resistance potential, Rp and corrosion rate. After test of 24 hours in total immersion condition, 316 L stainless samples have developed a scale of corrosion products made up of multiple oxides. Highest proportion of NaCl salt inhibits higher corrosion rate in eutectic molten salt as observed in resistance potential value and corrosion rate.

40|$|The overall {{efficiency}} of a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant {{depends on the}} effectiveness of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system. A Single tank TES system has potential to provide effective solution. In a single tank TES system, a thermocline region, which produces the temperature gradient between hot and cold <b>storage</b> <b>fluid</b> by density difference, is used. Preservation of this thermocline region in the tank during charging and discharging cycles depends on the uniformity of the velocity profile at any horizontal plane. One of the major challenges for the single tank thermocline is actually maintaining the thermocline region in the tank, so that it does not spread out to occupy the entire tank. Since the thermocline is a horizontal surface, the hot and cold fluid must be introduce {{in such a way that}} it does not disturb the thermocline. If the fluid is introduced in a jet stream, it will disturb the thermocline and mix the hot and cold fluids into a homogeneous medium. So the objective of this thesis is to preserve the thermocline region by maximizing the uniformity of the velocity distribution. An ideal distributor will minimize the thermocline spreading and hence maximize the useable form of thermal energy storage in a single tank system. The performance of two different types of distributors: pipe flow distributor and honeycomb distributor, were checked. The effectiveness of the pipe flow distributor was checked by varying the dimension of the geometry i. e. number of holes, distance between the holes, position of the holes and number of distributor pipes. ^ Thermal energy storage system from solar power relies on high temperature thermal storage units for continuous operation.
