5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> social spectrum, ranging from his conservative {{opposition to abortion}} to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As a proponent of both Chicago school and supply-side economics, he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and {{the architect of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.|$|E
5|$|Black Elk (Lakota) was a {{medicine}} man and heyokha, whose life <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> transition to reservations.

In the First World War, the Ottoman Turks were engaged with the British regular army in a campaign that <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> Arabian peninsula.

5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Steuben Bridge, {{originally}} the Weirton-Steubenville Bridge, was a suspension bridge which <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio to Weirton, West Virginia and carried U.S. Route 22 and then Ohio State Route 822 during its existence. Completed in 1928 and opened as a toll bridge, the Fort Steuben Bridge {{was a more}} direct route for the flow of traffic across the river; particularly for trucks and heavy vehicles from the industrial area. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 and closed in 2009 due to deterioration. The bridge was demolished by Joseph B. Fay Co. on February 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his career}} <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> {{desegregation}} and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E

5|$|Trajan, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of the Iazyges, led his legions into Dacia against King Decebalus, in the year 101. In order to cross the Danube with such a large army, Apollodorus of Damascus, the Romans' chief architect, created a bridge through the Iron Gates by cantilevering it from the sheer face of the Iron Gates. From this he created a great bridge with sixty piers that <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> Danube. Trajan used this to strike deep within Dacia, forcing the king, Decebalus, to surrender and become a client king.|$|E
5|$|Warburton Bridge is {{a privately}} owned {{statutory}} tolled undertaking which incorporates a public highway road length. The high-level cantilever bridge crosses the Manchester Ship Canal on the B5159 road, connecting the A57 with the A6144, and was commissioned under the Rixton & Warburton Bridge Act 1863. The original stone bridge <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> River Mersey {{prior to its}} later diversion into the Manchester Ship Canal. Both bridges and the unadopted approach roads are privately maintained. It {{is one of the}} few remaining pre-motorway toll bridges in the United Kingdom, and the only one in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|While in Scotland, Smith {{joined the}} Glasgow Emancipation Society and met {{people in the}} Scottish and English {{abolitionist}} movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery. When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States. He worked effectively with {{both black and white}} abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> years from 1846-65.|$|E

5|$|While jaguars {{now live}} only in the Americas, they are descended from Old World cats. Two million years ago, {{scientists}} believe, the jaguar and its closest relative, the similarly spotted leopard, shared a common ancestor in Asia. In the Early Pleistocene, the forerunners of modern jaguars crossed Beringia, the land bridge that once <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> Bering Strait and connected Asia and North America. These jaguar ancestors then moved south into Central and South America, feeding on the deer and other grazing animals that once covered the landscape in huge herds.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the county in Virginia closest to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Part of the original ten-mile-square District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846, act of Congress that took effect in 1847. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee. The county was connected to nearby Washington via the Long Bridge, which <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> Potomac River. On the river flats of the Virginia side of the river was Jackson City, a seedy entertainment district named after President Andrew Jackson and home to several racetracks, gambling halls, and saloons.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{the segment}} of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway within New York was {{designated}} NY3. At that time, it <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> full eastwest length of the state, extending from the eastern bank of the Niagara River in North Tonawanda to {{the western edge of}} Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh; however, the routing through the North Country was significantly different at that time from its modern alignment. The route was moved onto its modern routing east of Watertown as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; it was truncated to Sterling on its western end and rerouted to follow its current alignment from Sterling to Watertown roughly five years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of diplomatic history, was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with twenty-seven years of history, the series <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> longest time period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Rollins {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as an excellent defensive shortstop. In July 2001, Rollins became the Phillies' leadoff hitter, a role he retained for almost ten years. He made three All-Star Game appearances early in his career. While a Phillie, Rollins compiled a 38-game hitting streak, which <b>spanned</b> <b>the</b> end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season, the longest in team history. Rollins was named the National League Most Valuable Player in 2007, as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive seasons. He was also a key component of the 2008 World Series champion team. In his final season with the Phillies, he became the franchise's all-time leader in hits. During the offseason, he was traded to the Dodgers for the 2015 season.|$|E
