Using the channel and interference transfer functions and SNR estimates, {{we set up}} and solve an optimization problem to maximize the capacity. Sizable gains in performance margins (or bit rates) result. Furthermore, by design, the spectra are spectrally compatible with other services. While the framework is quite general — it {{does not depend on}} the exact choice of modulation scheme, for example — it is also extremely simple and of low computational complexity. Our results can be used either for dynamically adapting the signaling spectra to account for changing noise or interference conditions or for the design of new fixed transmit spectral masks using worst-case analysis. ...|$|R

50|$|Asymmetric digital {{subscriber}} line (ADSL) {{is a type of}} {{digital subscriber}} line (DSL) technology, a data communications technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary ADSL modems {{cannot be}} {{connected}} back-to-back, because the ATU-R (ADSL Termination Unit - Remote) units {{that are used}} by customers require specialized ATU-C (Central Office) support provided by phone company equipment, usually by a complex and expensive DSLAM (DSL access multiplexer). However some <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) modems such as the SpeedStream 5851 can be connected back-to-back, allowing upload and download speeds of about 2Mbit/s over substantial distances, using a simple twisted pair of wires.Back-to-back operation may also be possible with single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line (G.SHDSL) modems.|$|E
50|$|A <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>{{subscriber}}</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) is {{a digital}} subscriber line (DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires of the telephone network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, {{is identical to the}} bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric {{digital subscriber line}} (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth. SDSL is generally marketed at business customers, while ADSL is marketed at private as well as business customers.|$|E

5000|$|DSL {{originally}} {{stood for}} [...] "digital subscriber loop". In telecommunications marketing, the term {{digital subscriber line}} is widely understood to mean Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), the most commonly installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256 kbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric. With a <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.|$|E
50|$|Symmetrical {{high-speed}} {{digital subscriber}} line (SHDSL) {{is a form of}} <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL), a data communications technology for equal transmit and receive (i.e. symmetric) data rate over copper telephone lines, faster than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. As opposed to other DSL technologies, SHDSL employs trellis-coded pulse-amplitude modulation (TC-PAM). As a baseband transmission scheme, TC-PAM operates at frequencies that include those used by the analog voice plain old telephone service (POTS). As such, a frequency splitter, or DSL filter, cannot be used to allow a telephone line to be shared by both an SHDSL service and a POTS service at the same time. Support of symmetric data rates made SHDSL a popular choice by businesses for private branch exchange (PBX), virtual private network (VPN), web hosting and other data services.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bit rate}} of {{consumer}} DSL services typically ranges from 256 kbit/s to over 100 Mbit/s {{in the direction}} to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. Bit rates of 1 Gbit/s have been reached in trials, but most homes {{are likely to be}} limited to 500-800 Mbit/s. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of asymmetric service. In <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) services, the downstream and upstream data rates are equal. Researchers at Bell Labs have reached speeds of 10 Gbit/s, while delivering 1 Gbit/s symmetrical broadband access services using traditional copper telephone lines. These higher speeds are lab results, however. A 2012 survey found that [...] "DSL continues to be the dominant technology for broadband access" [...] with 365.1 million subscribers worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{provides}} {{a new approach}} to mitigate the crosstalk interference in the <b>symmetric</b> <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) upstream transmission. A vector channel equalizer has been proposed for the SDSL upstream receiver to enhance spectral compatibility for the SDSL services. This approach outperforms a conventional scalar equalizer, which used in the current SDSL systems, is about a 15 dB gain in mean squared error (MSE). It significantly suppresses the crosstalk degradation and ensures the quality of service (QoS) on the SDSL transmission throughput. Moreover, the enhancement of the SDSL receiver can benefit on the extension of the SDSL deployment coverage range and also guarantees its promising data rates on increasing numbers of customer subscribers. 1...|$|E
