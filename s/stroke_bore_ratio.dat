40|$|The {{authors have}} {{investigated}} experimentally {{the influences of}} <b>stroke</b> <b>bore</b> <b>ratio,</b> scavenging port angle and scavenging air flow quantity on the swirl characteristics in a model cylinder of diesel engine with uniflow scavenging system. In this test, the laser doppler velocity meter (LDV) was employed to measure the axial and circumferential velocity distributions precisely. As a result, the following behaviors have been made clear. (1) Swirl intensity does not almost vary {{in spite of the}} increase in <b>stroke</b> <b>bore</b> <b>ratio.</b> (2) The larger the <b>stroke</b> <b>bore</b> <b>ratio</b> is, the less influence of exhaust valve on swirl flow pattern is. (3) With a small scavenging port angle swirl intensity decreases downstream significantly, and the dead zone at the lower part of cylinder liner is larger as compared with the case of a large scavenging port angle. (4) In case of the large scavenging port angle, swirl intensity does not vary in entire region of cylinder, but there is a little inverse flow region {{near the center of the}} cylinder. (5) The velocity profiles are similar in a whole flow field at different air flow rate conditions...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{gaseous fuels}} i. e. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for {{automotive}} applications {{has been under}} taken {{in different parts of}} the world for varying reasons. CNG is considered to be a better alternative for transportation fuel due to its vast reserves and the economy in operation. Retrofitting a gasoline engine by CNG leads to a compromise on performances which is a major area of concern for all manufacturers. Hence developing a dedicated CNG engine technology stands inevitable. The present work is an attempt to develop a dedicated compressed natural gas engine technology whereby the performance oriented issues have been experimentally investigated upon by conducting an On-Road Test, subsequent modifications in the design have been worked upon on a 4 stroke, 100 cc, single cylinder gasoline engine to run on CNG. The present work is a carry forward of the previous investigations. The significance of ignition voltage as well as <b>stroke</b> to <b>bore</b> <b>ratios</b> is investigated in this paper. The OnRoad tests have yielded very good results and it has been found that the performances with CNG have actually improved compared to the base version of gasoline. The acceleration and the mileage issues have been duly investigated upon and it has been found that with the present set-up, CNG delivers better performances compared to gasoline in the same segment...|$|R
40|$|A free-piston linear {{alternator}} (FPLA) {{is being}} developed by the Beijing Institute of Technology to improve the thermal efficiency relative to conventional crank-driven engines. A two-stroke scavenging process recharges the engine and is crucial to realizing the continuous operation of a free-piston engine. In order to study the FPLA scavenging process, the scavenging system was configured using computational fluid dynamics. As the piston dynamics of the FPLA are different to conventional crank-driven two-stroke engines, a time-based numerical simulation program was built using Matlab to define the piston's motion profiles. A wide range of design and operating options were investigated including effective stroke length, valve overlapping distance, operating frequency and charging pressure to find out their effects on the scavenging performance. The results indicate {{that a combination of}} high effective <b>stroke</b> length to <b>bore</b> <b>ratio</b> and long valve overlapping distance with a low supercharging pressure has the potential to achieve high scavenging and trapping efficiencies with low short-circuiting losses.

40|$|The {{addition}} of alcohol to conventional hydrocarbon fuels for a spark-ignition engine can increase the fuel octane rating and the power for a given engine displacement and compression ratio. In this work, the influence of butanol addition to gasoline in a port fuel-injection, spark ignition engine was investigated. The experiments were realized in a single cylinder ported fuel injection SI engine with an external boosting device. The optical accessible engine was equipped {{with the head of}} commercial SI turbocharged engine with the same geometrical specifications (<b>bore,</b> <b>stroke,</b> compression <b>ratio)</b> as the research engine. The effect on the spark ignition combustion process of 40 % n-butanol blended in volume with gasoline was investigated by cycle resolved visualization. The engine worked at low speed, medium boosting and wide open throttle. Changes in spark timing and fuel injection phasing were considered in order to investigate normal and abnormal combustion. Comparisons between the parameters related to the flame luminosity and to the pressure signals were performed. The duration of injection for butanol blend was increased to obtain stoichiometric mixture. In open valve injection condition, the fuel deposits on intake manifold and piston surfaces decreased, allowing a reduction in fuel consumption. Butanol blend granted the performance levels of gasoline and in open valve injection allowed to minimize the abnormal combustion effects and the formation of ultrafine carbonaceous particles...|$|R
40|$|Air-powered {{engine is}} a {{promising}} one of the low emission engines, for the advantages of its simple structure and complete zero-pollution. In this paper, the two-stage expansion Air-powered engine (TSEAPE) was studied in theory firstly and then experiments. Based {{on the model of}} TSEAPE that has been developed on the thermodynamics and mechanics analysis, the effects of <b>bores</b> <b>ratio</b> on the performance of TSEAPE are investigated by simulation. The results of simulation indicate that the TSEAPE will performance well when its <b>bore</b> <b>ratio</b> is about 1. 4, which is a good balance between the power output and the efficiency. Guided by the results of theory analysis, a TSEAPE was developed based on an existing internal-combustion engine.

40|$|Ever tighter {{limits on}} {{pollutant}} emissions {{and the need}} to improve energy conversion efficiency have made the application of gasoline direct injection (GDI) feasible for a much wider scale of spark ignition engines. Changing the way fuel is delivered to the engine has thus provided increased flexibility but also challenges, such as higher particulate emissions. Therefore, alternative injection control strategies need to be investigated in order to obtain optimum performance and reduced environmental impact. In this study, experiments were carried out on a single-cylinder GDI optical engine fuelled with commercial gasoline in lean-burn conditions. The single-cylinder was equipped with the head of a commercial turbocharged engine with similar geometrical specifications (<b>bore,</b> <b>stroke,</b> compression <b>ratio)</b> and wall guided fuel injection. Optical accessibility was ensured through a conventional elongated hollow Bowditch piston and an optical crown, accommodating a fused-silica window. Experimental tests were performed at fixed engine speed and injection pressure, whereas the injection timing and the number of injections were adjusted to investigate their influence on combustion and emissions. UV-visible digital imaging was applied in order to follow the combustion process, from ignition to the late combustion phase. All the optical data were correlated with thermodynamic analysis and measurements of exhaust emissions. Split injection strategies (i. e. two injections per cycle) with respect to single injection increased combustion efficiency and stability thanks to an improvement of fuel air mixing. As a consequence, significant reduction in soot formation and exhaust emission with acceptable penalty in terms of HC and NOx were measured...|$|R
