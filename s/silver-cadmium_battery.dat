50|$|Ernst Waldemar Jungner (June 19, 1869 - August 30, 1924) was a Swedish {{inventor}} and engineer. In 1899 {{he invented}} the nickel-iron electric storage battery (NiFe), the nickel-cadmium battery (NiCd) and the rechargeable alkaline <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>battery</b> (AgCd). As an inventor he also fabricated a fire alarm based on different dilutions of metals. Worked on the electrolytic production of sodium carbonate. And patented a rock drilling device.|$|E
50|$|As Apollo 15 {{appeared}} {{from behind the}} Moon on its 73rd orbit, {{there were only two}} more orbits left before TEI. During this time the crew had to release the subsatellite and prepare for the rocket burn that would send them home. Like all parts of the CSM and LM, the SPS was highly redundant. The only parts that were not were the engine bell and the combustion chamber.The subsatellite was designed to measure the gravitational field of the Moon and investigate the Earth and Moon's magnetospheres. It was 31 inches (79 cm) long, with a 14-inch (36 cm) hexagonal body. Weighing a total of 78.5 pounds (35.6 kg), it was powered by solar cells for daytime operations and a <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>battery</b> for the nighttime. It had three booms that extended after release, which were 5 ft (1.5 m) long.|$|E
40|$|Interplanetary Monitoring Probe (IMP) spacecrafts H, I, and J utilize {{a direct}} energy {{transfer}} (DET) type of power system operating from a solar array source. A shunt type of regulator prevents the bus voltage from exceeding a preset voltage level. The power system utilizes a single differential amplifier with dual outputs {{to control the}} battery charge/shunt regulator and the discharge regulator. A two-voltage level, current limited, series charger and a current sensor control {{battery state of charge}} of the <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>battery</b> pack. Premature termination of the battery charge is prevented by a power available gate that also initiates charge current to the battery upon availability of excess power...|$|E

The batteries included silver-zinc batteries, nickel-cadmium <b>batteries,</b> and <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>batteries.</b> The cell performance characteristics and limitations {{are to be}} used by spacecraft power systems planners and designers.

50|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which {{employed a}} scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in 10 s; (2) a gamma-ray spectrometer {{mounted on a}} 1.8 m boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50-milliwatt transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and 6 <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>batteries</b> capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed {{to land on the}} Moon at 130 to 160 km/h (80 to 100 mph). The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the retro-rocket.|$|R
40|$|The {{launches}} of the International Sun-Earth Explorers in October 1977 (ISEE-A) and August 1978 (ISEE-C) {{marked the}} first successful implementation of an electrostatically clean spacecraft design on a US-built satellite. The power subsystem design selected was required to operate without induced or coupled electromagnetic interference while meeting the criteria of low cost, low weight (with the resulting removal of almost all redundancy), modular construction techniques, long life (more than 3 years), and maximum utilization of previously qualified/flown designs. To save money, both the ISEE-A and -C power subsystem designs had to be identical even though the two missions are flown in vastly different orbits. Additionally, the requirement for a three year mission utilizing a single <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>battery</b> had never been imposed before. A power subsystem configuration which met all of the specified requirements was developed. Excellent correlation between preflight and actual flight performance is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|IMP 11 was {{launched}} on October 3, 1964 from Cape Kennedy, Florida, by the Delta 26 Launch vehicle. The apogee achieved w a s 51, 600 n. m., which was l e s s {{than one-half of}} the planned altitude. This problem was attributed to the suspected failure of the igniter assembly of the third-stage motor, occurring after about 16 seconds of normal burning. The angle between the spacecraft spin-axis and the ecliptic plane was reduced by the third-stage malfunction, resulting in {{a wider range of}} incident sun-angles during the satellite lifetime. This caused low power output from the solar paddles and over-heating of the <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>battery.</b> Spacecraft performance was satisfactory until the + 50 "C tempera-ture environment (about two months after launch) caused the failure of the battery. Thereafter, the spacecraft operated only during periods of favorable incident sun-angles. In all, about five months of useful data was recorded. A s of mid- 1965, the spacecraft was operating intermit-tently with essentially no useful data being obtained. There is some possibility that perhaps as much as a month's more data might be'ob-tained in the future. ii r-...|$|E
50|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which {{employed a}} scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in 10 s; (2) a gamma-ray spectrometer in a 300 mm sphere {{mounted on a}} 1.8 m boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50 mW transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and six <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>batteries</b> capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed {{to land on the}} Moon at 130 to 160 km/h (80 to 100 mph). The instrument package floated in a layer of freon within the balsawood sphere. The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the retro-rocket.|$|R
50|$|This payload sphere {{contained}} six <b>silver-cadmium</b> <b>batteries</b> {{to power}} a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer {{that was designed}} with sensitivity high enough to detect {{the impact of a}} 5 lb meteorite {{on the opposite side of}} the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.|$|R
2500|$|At present, mostly (lead–acid) {{batteries}} {{are used as}} a power source. Many different types of batteries {{can be used as}} a power source for robots. They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to <b>silver–cadmium</b> <b>batteries</b> that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime and weight. Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need a fuel, require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage. Potential power sources could be: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{presence of}} cadmium {{in the environment}} is mainly due to its use in electroplating, paint pigments, plastics, alloy preparation, mining, ceramics and <b>silver–cadmium</b> <b>batteries.</b> The chronic exposure to Cd can lead to damages to humans both directly or indirectly throughout the food chain, thus this metal and its compounds are considered as carcinogens. The most common methods used to remove heavy metals from wastewater are ion-exchange, reverse osmosis and chemical precipitation, {{but all of them}} are too expensive. In recent years, a number of studies were carried out to search for alternative, less expensive sorbents such as living or dead organisms. Our studies on Cd removal, which are reviewed in this paper, focused on the application of living microorganisms ubiquitous in wastewaters, specifically Sphaerotilus natans and Zoogloea ramigera, or dead microbial biomass of Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis or even cellulosic biomass such as Agave americana fibers. Under the best operating conditions, Cd biosorption by dry biomass of A. platensis was very effective ranging from 149 to 357 mg g− 1. As far as living biomass is concerned, Z. ramigera and S. natans were able to remove up to 91 and 93 % of initial Cd concentration, respectively, whilst fibers of A. americana were able to remove only up to 12. 5 mg g- 1 of Cd. FT-IR spectroscopy as well as scanning electron and metallographic microscopy allowed us to get information on the mechanisms involved in Cd biosorption. Finally, Cd bioaccumulation was experimentally determined in living cells of A. platensis (maximum specific biosorption capacity of 2. 60 mg g- 1), and citotoxicity of extracts from contaminated cells evaluated as EC 50 against L 929 mouse fibroblasts...|$|R
