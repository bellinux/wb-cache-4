40|$|The current {{educational}} policy of educating <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> in regular schools {{has created a}} new classroom environment for teachers. Inclusive classrooms involve teachers dealing with a larger diversity of students in their classrooms and differentiating the curriculum to meet the wide range of student backgrounds, cognitive abilities, physical needs and interests. The purpose of this interpretive study was to investigate and understand pre-service teachers’ perceptions about their preparedness for teaching <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> in mainstream classrooms, and to identify aspects that may support their success and confidence. The participants were 20 pre-service and beginning teachers. Data were collected over a two-year period through individual interviews with pre-service teachers and small focus groups with beginning teachers using semi-structured and open-ended questions to allow for depth of discussion. The analysis of the data revealed that there are many connected aspects such as teachers’ perceptions, experience and background which appear to work together to influence their attitude towards <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> and their perceptions of these students. Teachers’ perceptions about their preparation for teaching <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> were found to relate to their attitude towards teaching inclusively.
