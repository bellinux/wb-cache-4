5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias)</b> and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} forms shoals or schools {{that tend to}} be larger during the winter and spring. Though fairly active, its {{swimming}} muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of creatine phosphokinase compared to the shallow-water spiny dogfish (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias),</b> suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed. The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy. Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} deep-sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host. Other known parasites of this species include the fluke Otodistomum cestoides, the copepods Neoalbionella fabricii and Neoalbionella centroscyllii, and the protozoans Haemogregarina delagei and Trypanosoma rajae.|$|E
5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias).</b> These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E
500|$|Sluggish in nature, the {{bramble shark}} feeds on smaller sharks (including the spiny dogfish, <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias),</b> bony fishes (including ling, catfishes, and lizardfishes), and crabs. The large {{size of its}} pharynx, {{relative}} to its mouth, suggests that it may capture prey by suction. This species is aplacental viviparous; females have two functional ovaries and two uteruses. Recorded litter sizes have ranged from 15 to 52, and newly born pups have been estimated to measure [...] long.

500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, lingcod, topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including elephantfishes (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias),</b> young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and ghost catshark (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a pregnant female, which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark. The young are probably under [...] long at birth. The length at sexual maturity has not been precisely determined but is thought to be around [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E

5000|$|The Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Squalus suckleyi, is {{a common}} species of the Squalidae (dogfish) family of sharks, {{which is part of}} the Squaliformes order. This species is closely related to <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias</b> and for many years they were treated as a single species. Recent research, using meristic, {{morphological}} and molecular data led to the resurrection of Pacific Spiny Dogfish as a separate species. The American Fisheries Society recommends the common name [...] "Pacific Spiny Dogfish" [...] for Squalus suckleyi over alternatives such as [...] "Spotted Spiny Dogfish" [...] and [...] "North Pacific Spiny Dogfish" [...] and [...] "Spiny Dogfish" [...] for <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias.</b>|$|E

50|$|Once {{the most}} {{abundant}} shark species in the world, populations of <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias</b> have declined significantly. They are classified in the IUCN Red List of threatened species as Vulnerable globally and Critically endangered in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning stocks around Europe have decreased by at least 95%. This {{is a direct result}} of overfishing to supply northern Europe's taste for rock salmon, saumonette or zeepaling. Despite these alarming figures, very few management or conservation measures are in place for <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias.</b> In EU waters, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) has been in place since 1999, but until 2007 it only applied to ICES Areas IIa and IV. It was also set well above the actual weight of fish being caught until 2005, rendering it meaningless. Since 2009 a maximum landing size of 1 m has been imposed in order to protect the most valuable mature females. The TAC for 2011 was set at 0 tons, ending targeted fishing for the species in EU waters. It remains to be seen if populations will be able to recover.|$|E
5000|$|Squalamine ( [...] ) is an aminosterol {{compound}} with potent {{broad spectrum}} antimicrobial activity {{discovered in the}} tissues of the dogfish shark (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias)</b> by {{a team led by}} Michael Zasloff. [...] Zasloff searched the tissues of the dogfish for compounds that might help explain the hardiness of this animal to infection, despite its [...] "primitive" [...] immune system. Using techniques that Zasloff's team had developed to isolate and identify antimicrobial peptides from animal tissues, the team extracted and characterized a novel bile acid-like compound containing a polyamine never before seen in nature. The compound was called [...] "squalamine", based on its source (<b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias)</b> and its chemical structure (a sterol linked to a polyamine). Further analyses of larger quantities of dogfish liver extracts revealed squalamine to be the most abundant member of a larger aminosterol family comprising at least 12 related compounds. One of these, [...] "MSI-1436" [...] or trodusquemine, although structurally similar to squalamine (it carries a spermine rather than a spermidine) and also quite potent as an anti-infective, exhibits a profoundly different pharmacology in vertebrates, causing weight loss and adipose tissue mobilization.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The piked dogfish <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias</b> {{is part of}} the bycatch {{of several}} South American {{longline}} fisheries, although in Argentina, it was only reported in the bycatch of benthic and demersal fisheries operating bottom nets. This communication represents the first record of S. acanthias bycatch in a commercial semi-pelagic longline fishery within Argentinean waters. In October-November 2005, 185 piked dogfish were captured (122 females and 63 males). The es-timated mean catch rate was 0. 37 sharks/ 1000 hooks (544, 320 hooks deployed). Nearly half of the captured females and over 50 % of captured males were morphometrically mature. The piked dogfish bycatch could have been influenced by the use of the Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus as bait; this squid {{is part of the}} shark’s natural diet. Although S. acanthias is abundant in the region, we believe that the bycatch species could be more vulnerable than the targeted ones since the signs indicating a declining population of non-target species in commercial catches and collapses in bycatch populations go unnoticed.

40|$|Abstract. —Large {{numbers of}} spiny dogfish <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias</b> {{moved into the}} area {{near the mouth of}} the Big Qualicum River, British Columbia, at the time hatchery-reared smolts of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and coho salmon O. kisutch were leaving the river in 1988 and 1989. A small {{percentage}} of the spiny dogfish preyed on the smolts, but the resulting smolt mortality {{is believed to have been}} large because of the large numbers of spiny dogfish in this area. Spiny dogfish also fed on adult salmon in the fall. The long-term decline in survival of chinook salmon produced at the Big Qualicum Hatchery was similar to the pattern of survival of other hatchery-produced salmon. We propose that this long-term decline in survival results from predation. Spiny dogfish <b>Squalus</b> <b>acanthias</b> are abundant in the Strait of Georgia.
