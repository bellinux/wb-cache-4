5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E

Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing.

50|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} <b>sleeps</b> <b>at</b> multiple times during a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic <b>sleep</b> occurs all <b>at</b> once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) {{if they have}} nothing better to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two <b>sleep</b> periods concentrated <b>at</b> the beginning {{and at the end}} of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|R
