5|$|In 2003, the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) {{launched}} {{a project to}} provide comprehensive support for autistic Singaporeans, which included plans {{to set up the}} first autism-focused <b>special</b> <b>school</b> in Singapore. The ARC collaborated with the Rainbow Centre over a period of five months to renovate the temporary campus, recruit school staff, decide on the school values and develop the school programmes. After opening in 2004 with 10 teachers and 41 students, Pathlight School conducted charity walks, merchandise sales and other events to raise funds for the introduction of more programmes for an expanding intake. In 2007, two teachers from Pathlight School won the inaugural Most Outstanding Special Education Teacher Award and Most Innovative Special Education Teacher Award, given by the Singaporean Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service.

30|$|According to HAKIELIMU (2008), Tanzania {{has three}} systems of {{education}} for children with special educational needs, namely, <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> integrated schools, and inclusive education. The then Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MOEVT) (2016) defines <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> integrated units, and inclusive <b>schools</b> as follows: <b>Special</b> <b>schools</b> are those schools which provide education to only one category of children with special learning needs. On the other hand, integrated units are units for children with special learning needs which are attached to regular schools. Again, inclusive schools are regular schools which cater for learners with special learning needs in a regular inclusive classroom where such learners are assisted by a specialized teacher. MOEVT (2016) further reveals that Tanzania has been running educational services for learners with special educational needs through <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> integrated units and inclusive schools for the following categories of learners with disabilities—deaf or children with impaired hearing who have 49 special schools/units (that is, 11 <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> 38 units); the visually impaired have 37 special schools/units (3 <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> 34 units); intellectually impaired have 160 special schools/units (5 <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> 155 units); those with deafness-blindness have 8 special schools; those with physical impairment have 8 special schools/units (2 <b>special</b> <b>schools,</b> 6 units); and finally those with autism have 8 units. It {{should be noted that}} the data on schools/units provided above are for pre-primary and primary levels. Secondary schools which enrol children with disabilities are not included.|$|R

The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E

5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's <b>Special</b> <b>School</b> in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|From 1807 to 1809, Champollion {{studied in}} Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman {{to attempt to}} read the Rosetta stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès, and with Raphaël de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in {{addition}} to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit of dressing in Arab clothing and calling himself Al Seghir, the Arab translation of le jeune. He divided his time between the College of France, the <b>Special</b> <b>School</b> of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the Rosetta stone, working from a copy made by the Abbé de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the readings of the demotic previously made by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the Rosetta stone.|$|E
