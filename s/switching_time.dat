Research suggests that intrinsic <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> of a QCA cell is at best in the order of terahertz. However, the actual speed may be much lower, in the order of megahertz for solid state QCA and gigahertz for molecular QCA, due to the proper quasi-adiabatic clock switching frequency setting.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{potential}} of the thermal reverse flow reactor for reducing the methane emission has been demonstrated, but the further optimization of the structure parameters and operation parameters of the reactor is necessary because the intrinsic feedback of heat {{gives rise to a}} complex dynamic behavior. The effects of <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> and velocity on the stability of the reactor were studied experimentally using the presented pilot scale reactor. Emphasis was the effect of <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> from a perspective of minimizing the thermal energy loss to the outlet stream. Based on detailed analyses, it was found that for the lower velocity, the longer <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> should be used, on the other hand, for the higher velocity, the shorter <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> should be used. Further, for a given reacting section length, the production of velocity and <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> is a constant. The <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> determined by the method can ensure to accumulate more energy within the reactor and sustain itself under the lower methane concentration conditions...|$|R

25|$|Quasi-adiabatic switching, however, {{requires}} that the tunneling barriers of a cell be switched relatively slowly compared to the intrinsic switching speed of a QCA. This prevents ringing and metastable states observed when cells are switched abruptly. Therefore, the switching speed of a QCA is limited not {{by the time it}} takes for a cell to change polarization, but by the appropriate quasi-adiabatic <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> of the clocks being used.|$|E

Using the fractal theory, we can predict fluctuations of the load and calculate the multi-fractal characteristic parameter of different times.

25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E
2500|$|A well-thought-out design {{procedure}} {{is considered to}} be the first significant step to a successful synthesizer project. In the system design of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many [...] "best" [...] design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers. System analysis of a frequency synthesizer involves output frequency range (or frequency bandwidth or tuning range), frequency increments (or resolution or frequency tuning), frequency stability (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> (compare settling time and rise time), and size, power consumption, and cost. James A. Crawford says that these are mutually contradictive requirements.|$|E
2500|$|RO is {{the first}} and the slowest opto-isolator: its <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> exceeds 1 ms, and for the lamp-based models can reach {{hundreds}} of milliseconds. Parasitic capacitance limits the frequency range of the photoresistor by ultrasonic frequencies. Cadmium-based photoresistors exhibit a [...] "memory effect": their resistance depends on the illumination history; it also drifts during the illumination and stabilizes within hours, or even weeks for high-sensitivity models. Heating induces irreversible degradation of ROs, whereas cooling to below −25°C dramatically increases the response time. Therefore, ROs were mostly replaced in the 1970s by the faster and more stable photodiodes and photoresistors. ROs are still used in some sound equipment, guitar amplifiers and analog synthesizers owing to their good electrical isolation, low signal distortion and ease of circuit design.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} time-optimal motions for a mobile platform in a planar environment. The platform has two nonsteerable, independently driven wheels. The overall mission of the robot is {{expressed in terms of}} a sequence of via points at which the platform must be at rest in a given configuration (position and orientation). The objective is to plan time-optimal trajectories between these configurations, assuming an unobstructed environment. Using Pontryagin’s maximum principle (PMP), we formally demonstrate that all time-optimal motions of the platform for this problem occur for bang-bang controls on the wheels (at each instant, the acceleration on each wheel is at either its upper or its lower limit). The PMP, however, provides only the conditions necessary for time optimality. To find the time-optimal robot trajectories, we first parameterize the bang-bang trajectories using the <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> on the wheels (the times at which the wheel accelerations change sign). With this param-eterization, we can fully search the robot trajectory space and find the <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> that will produce particular paths to a desired final configuration of the platform. We show numer-ically that robot trajectories with three <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> (two on one wheel and one on the other) can reach any position, while trajectories with four <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> can reach any configuration. By numerical comparison with other trajectories involving sim-ilar or greater numbers of <b>switch</b> <b>times,</b> we then identify the sets of time-optimal trajectories. These are uniquely defined using ranges of the parameters and consist of subsets of trajec-tories with three <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> (for the problem when the final orientation of the robot is not specified) or four <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> (when a full final configuration is specified). We conclude with a description of the use of the method for trajectory planning for one of our robots and discuss some comparisons of sample time-optimal paths with minimum length paths. 1...|$|R

50|$|For a {{frequency}} synthesizer, the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> or more colloquially the switching speed {{is the amount}} of time from when the command for the next frequency is requested until the time that the synthesizer's output becomes usable and meets the specified requirements. Such requirements will vary depending on the design of the synthesizer. In the 1970s switching speeds ranged from 1 millisecond to 10 microseconds. A more general statement has been given by James A. Crawford: 50 reference cycles as a rule of thumb. By this rule, a reference frequency of 50 kHz has a settling time of 1 millisecond. Two other authors state (Hamid Rategh and Thomas H. Lee) that the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> (i.e., settling time) {{is a function of the}} percentage change in the feedback division ratio.
