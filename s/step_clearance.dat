Elliot et al. studied {{the effects of}} the horizontal and vertical illusion, and how the perceived illusion can influence visuo-motor coordination, i.e. motor activity dependent on sight. The study specifically focused on how the perceived height of a step, manipulated by the vertical and horizontal illusion, influenced stepping strategy as shown in toe elevation during <b>step</b> <b>clearance.</b> Their results showed an increased toe elevation in conditions where an illusion was perceived, leading them to conclude that there was a correlation between visual illusion and visuo-motor coordination.

First coined reference in 2015 in New York from Rentrak's chief client officer when discussing time spent with media and various media usage metrics. Text messaging among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction and reduced situation awareness, and may lead to increases in unsafe behavior leading to injury and death. Recent studies conducted on cell phone use while walking showed that cell phone users recall fewer objects when conversing, walk slower, have altered gait and are more unsafe when crossing a street. Additionally, some gait analyses showed that stance phase during overstepping motion, longitudinal and lateral deviation increased during cell phone operation but step length and clearance did not; a different analysis did find increased <b>step</b> <b>clearance</b> and reduced step length.|$|E

Transcriptional activation of many TLR-responsive genes requires an initial de-repression step in which NCoR co-repressor complexes are actively removed from target gene promoters to relieve basal repression 3, 4. Ligand-dependent SUMOylation of liver X receptors (LXRs) potently suppresses TLR 4 -induced transcription by preventing the NCoR <b>clearance</b> <b>step</b> 5 – 7, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic.

SUMOylated LXRs block NCoR turnover by binding to a conserved SUMO 2 / 3 interaction motif in Coro 2 A and preventing actin recruitment. Intriguingly, the LXR transrepression pathway can itself be inactivated by inflammatory signals that induce CaMKIIγ-dependent phosphorylation of LXR, leading to its deSUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP 3 and release from Coro 2 A.

Methods and resultsThe purification process involves one centrifugation, two filtration, five chromatography columns and two dedicated pathogen <b>clearance</b> <b>steps</b> (solvent/detergent treatment and 20 nm nanofiltration). The key purification step uses an affinity resin (VIIISelect) with high specificity for FVIII, removing essentially all host-cell proteins with > 80 % product recovery. The production-scale multi-step purification process efficiently removes process- and product-related impurities and results in a high-purity rhFVIII product, with an overall yield of ∼ 50 %.

Examples from four different mineral spirits-based microemulsion systems were evaluated, each having a different primary surfactant component. Particular attention is given here to determination, using surface-sensitive analytical techniques (ATR-FTIR, XPS and ToF-SIMS), of possible microemulsion surfactant residues remaining on paint films after wet cleaning treatment. Three different test paint films were subjected to simulated cleaning treatments: Golden Heavy Body Acrylic PY 3 (azo yellow); Liquitex Heavy Body Artist Acrylic PY 3 (azo yellow); and Liquitex Heavy Body Artist Acrylic PW 6 (titanium white).

A large-scale flow visualization test facility is used to conduct an experimental investigation into the leakage resistance and flow characteristics of worn labyrinth seals. Wear in labyrinth seals is a consequence of contact between the rotating and stationary components of the seal, due to thermal expansion, centrifugal growth, and rotordynamic vibration. The test facility is a large-scale, 2 -D planar design, using water as the working fluid. Externally adjustable seal elements, constructed from plexiglass, simulate both straight-through and stepped labyrinth seals. Plexiglass attachments are used to simulate worn teeth tips and rub-grooves in the opposing surface. Two flow visualization methods are used to digitally record flow patterns in the labyrinth seal, and selected images are extracted and enhanced using a computer. Both worn and unworn labyrinth seals are tested over a range of Reynolds numbers, <b>step</b> heights, <b>clearances,</b> and axial offset distances. For all small clearance geometries, the throughflow "pinching" effect, which causes a high speed throughflow and increased turbulence dissipation, heavily outweighs most throughflow trajectory effects in the labyrinth chamber. At larger clearances, other effects contribute to the performance of a seal. One effect is throughflow penetration into the rub-groove cavity of a worn seal, caused by the vena contracts as the throughflow approaches the tooth clearance. If rub-groove penetration occurs, the throughflow trajectory angle into the downstream labyrinth cavity is sometimes altered. The throughflow trajectory angle is another important effect, because it determines if the throughflow directly approaches the downstream tooth, leading to carry-over, or if it approaches at a large angle, giving a larger vena contracts velocity. Another important effect is the presence of large, highspeed recirculation zones in the labyrinth cavity, which lead to greater turbulence. In nearly all cases, a geometry with worn teeth tips performs worse than its counterpart with unworn teeth tips, due to the nozzling effect of the worn teeth. Similarly, for nearly all medium and large clearance cases, a geometry with a rub-groove performed worse than its unworn counterpart. Finally, in general, a seal's leakage resistance coefficient is decreased by increasing the width of the rub-groove...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{and rapid}} immune {{response}} upon challenge by an infectious agent {{is vital to}} host defense. The encounter of leukocytes (white blood cells of the immune system) with their targets {{is the first step}} in this response. Analysis of the kinetics of this process is essential not only to understanding dynamic behavior of the immune response, but also to elucidating the consequences of many leukocyte functional abnormalities. The motion of leukocytes in the presence of targets typically involves a directed, or chemotactic component. These immune cells orient the direction of their motion in the presence of gradients in chemical attractants generated by pathogens. Fisher and Lauffenburger (1987. Biophys. J. 51 : 705 - 716) developed a model for macrophage/bacterium encounter in two dimensions which includes chemotaxis, and applied it to the particular system of alveolar macrophages (phagocytic leukocytes on the lung surface). Their model showed that macrophage/target encounter is likely the rate-limiting <b>step</b> in <b>clearance</b> of bacteria from the lung surface (Fisher, E. S., D. A. Lauffenburger, and R. P. Daniele. 1988. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 137 : 1129 - 1134). We have extended this model to analyze the effects of cell motility properties and geometric parameters on cell-target encounter in three dimensions. The differential equation governing encounter time in three dimensions is essentially the same as that in two dimensions, except for changed probability values. Our results show that more highly directed motion is necessary in three dimensions to achieve substantially decreased encounter times than in two dimensions, because of the increased search dimensionality. These general results were applied to the particular system of neutrophils operating in three dimensions in response to a bacterial challenge in connective tissue. Our results provide a plausible rationalization for both the chemotactic and chemokinetic behavior observed in neutrophils. That is, these cells exhibit in vitro a greater chemotactic bias and a more dramatic variation of speed with attractant concentration than alveolar macrophages, and our results indicate that these behaviors can have a greater influence in three-dimensional connective tissue infection situations than in two-dimensional lung surface infection cases. In addition, we show that encounter apparently is not generally the rate-limiting step in this neutrophil response. These findings have important implications for correlating in vitro measured defects in cell motility and chemotaxis properties with in vivo functions of host defense against infection...|$|R
40|$|Initially {{identified}} as an inhibitor of oriC-initiated DNA replication in vitro, the ArgP or IciA protein of Escherichia coli has subsequently {{been described as a}} nucleoid-associated protein and also as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in DNA replication (dnaA and nrdA) and amino acid metabolism (argO, dapB, and gdhA [the last in Klebsiella pneumoniae]). ArgP mediates lysine (Lys) repression of argO, dapB, and gdhA in vivo, for which two alternative mechanisms have been identified: at the dapB and gdhA regulatory regions, ArgP binding is reduced upon the addition of Lys, whereas at argO, RNA polymerase is trapped at the <b>step</b> of promoter <b>clearance</b> by Lys-bound ArgP. In this study, we have examined promoter-lac fusions in strains that were argP or argP or that were carrying dominant argPmutations in order to identify several new genes that are ArgP-regulated in vivo, including lysP, lysC, lysA, dapD, and asd (in addition to argO, dapB, and gdhA). All were repressed upon Lys supplementation, and in vitro studies demonstrated that ArgP binds to the corre-sponding regulatory regions in a Lys-sensitive manner (with the exception of argO, whose binding to ArgP was Lys insensitive). Neither dnaA nor nrdA was ArgP regulated in vivo, although their regulatory regions exhibited low-affinity binding to ArgP. Our results suggest that ArgP is a transcriptional regulator for Lys repression of genes in E. coli but that it is noncanonical in that it also exhibits low-affinity binding, without apparent direct regulatory effect, to a number of additional sites in the genome...|$|R
40|$|Clearance of {{apoptotic}} {{cells is}} of key importance during development, tissue homeostasis and wound healing in multicellular animals. Genetic {{studies in the}} nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a set of genes involved in the early <b>steps</b> of cell <b>clearance,</b> in particular the recognition and internalization of apoptotic cells. A pathway that orchestrates the maturation of phagosomes containing ingested apoptotic cells in the worm has recently been described. However, many steps in this pathway remain elusive. Here we show that the C. elegans SNX 9 -family member LST- 4 (lateral signaling target) and its closest mammalian orthologue SNX 33 play an evolutionary conserved role during apoptotic cell corpse clearance. In lst- 4 deficient worms, internalized apoptotic cells accumulated within non-acidified, DYN- 1 -positive but RAB- 5 -negative phagosomes. Genetically, we show that LST- 4 functions at the same step as DYN- 1 during corpse removal, upstream of the GTPase RAB- 5. We further show that mammalian SNX 33 rescue C. elegans lst- 4 mutants and that overexpression of truncated SNX 33 fragments interfered with phagosome maturation in a mammalian cell system. Taken together, our genetic and cell biological analyses suggest that LST- 4 is recruited through a combined activity of DYN- 1 and VPS- 34 to the early phagosome membrane, where it cooperates with DYN- 1 to promote recruitment/retention of RAB- 5 on the early phagosomal membrane during cell corpse clearance. The functional conservation between LST- 4 and SNX 33 indicate that these early steps of apoptotic phagosome maturation are likel...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} Parkin {{are a major}} cause of recessive Parkinson's disease. Recent work has shown that Parkin translocates from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria and induces their autophagic removal (mitophagy). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkin-mediated mitophagy are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether Parkin interacts with autophagy-regulating proteins. We purified Parkin and associated proteins from HEK 293 cells using tandem affinity purification and identified the Parkin interactors using mass spectrometry. We identified the autophagy-promoting protein Ambra 1 (activating molecule in Beclin 1 -regulated autophagy) as a Parkin interactor. Ambra 1 activates autophagy in the CNS by stimulating the activity of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) complex that is essential for the formation of new phagophores. We found Ambra 1, like Parkin, to be widely expressed in adult mouse brain, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Endogenous Parkin and Ambra 1 coimmunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells, SH-SY 5 Y cells, and adult mouse brain. We found no evidence for ubiquitination of Ambra 1 by Parkin. The interaction of endogenous Parkin and Ambra 1 strongly increased during prolonged mitochondrial depolarization. Ambra 1 was not required for Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria but was critically important for subsequent mitochondrial clearance. In particular, Ambra 1 was recruited to perinuclear clusters of depolarized mitochondria and activated class III PI 3 K in their immediate vicinity. These data identify interaction of Parkin with Ambra 1 as a key mechanism for induction of the final <b>clearance</b> <b>step</b> of Parkin-mediated mitophagy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In the {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, polymerase inhibitors successfully suppress HBV DNA production. However, the production of viral proteins continues unhindered, which hampers viral clearance. Here, we screen for compounds that suppress HBV transcription, which would prevent viral protein production. A total of 640 FDA-approved drugs were evaluated {{for their ability to}} inhibit HBV transcription in a transfection-based HBV reporter assay. The assay was performed in the presence and absence of the HBV accessory protein X (HBx), which is essential for in vivo HBV RNA transcription. We observed that in the absence of HBx 47, and in the presence of HBx 24 compounds suppressed transcription by more than 20 %. We selected the 24 most potent compounds in each condition for further analysis. On average, the selected compounds reduced transcription by 33. 9 % (range: 24. 1 - 65. 8 %) in the absence of HBx expression, and 30. 6 % (range: 20. 4 - 48. 9 %) in the presence of HBx. The two selections of 24 compounds had 12 compounds in common, resulting in a final selection of 36 compounds, which were evaluated for their capacity to suppress HBV replication in constitutively HBV-replicating HepG 2. 2. 15 cells. Twenty-three of these compounds reduced HBV replication by interfering with RNA transcription. Further analysis revealed that one of the compounds, terbinafine, potently and specifically suppressed HBx-mediated HBV RNA transcription in HepG 2 cells. Inhibition of HBV protein production is a promising <b>step</b> towards HBV <b>clearance.</b> In combination with an HBV polymerase inhibitor, the added suppression of HBV RNA transcription may markedly improve antiviral treatment outcom...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{transcription}} of the Escherichia coli argO gene, which encodes an arginine (Arg) exporter, {{requires the}} LysR-family regulator protein ArgP (previously called IciA) and is induced {{in the presence}} of Arg or its naturally occurring antimetabolite analog canavanine. Lysine (Lys) addition, on the other hand, phenocopies an argP mutation to result in the shutoff of argO expression. We now report that the ArgP dimer by itself is able to bind the argO promoter-operator region to form a binary complex, but that the formation of a ternary complex with RNA polymerase is greatly stimulated only in presence of a coeffector. Both Arg and Lys were proficient as coeffectors for ArgP-mediated recruitment of RNA polymerase to, and open complex formation at, the argO promoter, although only Arg (but not Lys) was competent to activate transcription. The two coeffectors competed for binding to ArgP, and the ternary complex that had been assembled on the argO template {{in the presence of}} Lys could be chased into a transcriptionally active state upon Arg addition. Our results support a novel mechanism of argO regulation in which Lys-bound ArgP reversibly restrains RNA polymerase at the promoter, at a step (following open complex formation) that precedes, and is common to, both abortive and productive transcription. This represents, therefore, the first example of an environmental signal regulating the final <b>step</b> of promoter <b>clearance</b> by RNA polymerase in bacterial transcription. We propose that, in E. coli cells, the ternary complex remains assembled and poised at the argO promoter at all times to respond, positively or negatively, to instantaneous changes in the ratio of intracellular Arg to Lys concentrations...|$|R
