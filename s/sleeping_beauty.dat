5|$|When <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> was {{released}} in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades. Aurora herself received negative reviews for her passivity and overall similarity to Snow White. Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her {{a reputation as one}} of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> from the perspective of its villain.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: ‘Sleeping beauties’, i. e. {{publications}} {{that are not}} cited for a long while, present interesting findings in science. This study analysed the citation trends of <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties</b> in paediatric research. Methods: The study used bibliometric software to analyse the papers citing <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties</b> in paediatric research, to understand {{the context in which}} paediatric <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties</b> were finally cited and the impact of these <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties</b> on paediatric research. Results: Two paediatric <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties,</b> addressing medical homes and the transition from paediatric to adult health care, respectively, awakened in response to organizational needs. Both presented novel concepts of paediatric service organization that became important because of an increased need for optimization of services. Conclusion: All <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties</b> bring new knowledge that becomes important only after several years. Paediatric <b>sleeping</b> <b>beauties</b> exhibited unique characteristicshowever, their presence in paediatric research shows that knowledge acquisition in paediatrics resembles that in other disciplines...|$|R
50|$|House of the <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauties</b> is a 1961 novella by the Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata. It is a {{story about}} a lonely man, Old Eguchi, who {{continuously}} visits the House of the <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauties</b> in hope of something more.|$|R
5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel {{was simply too}} passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, while Greg Beeman directed. Actress Kristin Bauer van Straten was cast {{at the last}} minute and guest starred as the sorceress Maleficent, a {{character}} from Disney's 1959 animated film <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty.</b> Mary Margaret's (Ginnifer Goodwin) loft as well as most of the interior shots of the episode were filmed in Vancouver, while many exterior shots were shot in nearby Steveston, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Tchaikovsky wrote many {{works that}} are {{popular with the}} {{classical}} music public, including his Romeo and Juliet, the 1812 Overture, his three ballets (The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, The <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty)</b> and Marche Slave. These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto, the last three of his six numbered symphonies and his operas The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin, are among his most familiar works. Almost as popular are the Manfred Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, the Capriccio Italien and the Serenade for Strings.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's castle {{was used}} {{prominently}} in the advertising of the film (acting as {{the backdrop of the}} film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including Cinderella, <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty,</b> The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and often these buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. A fairy tale castle stands at the centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for Buena Vista International.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the classic fairy tale {{character}} has been very well received by film critics and the public, and {{is considered one of}} Disney's most iconic and menacing villains. Besides in the film, the Evil Queen has made numerous appearances in Disney attractions and productions, including not only these directly related to the tale of Snow White, such as Fantasmic!, The Kingdom Keepers and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, sometimes appearing in them alongside Maleficent from <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty.</b> The film's {{version of the}} Queen has also become a popular archetype that influenced a number of artists and non-Disney works.|$|E

5|$|Copeland was a {{standout}} among her peers. In her {{first season as}} a soloist at New York City Center, in which avant-garde ballets works were performed, she received good notices in The New York Times for a Balanchine Ballo della Regina role. Also in 2007, she created {{a leading role in}} C. to C. (Close to Chuck), choreographed by Jorma Elo to A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close, Études 2, 9 & 10, by Philip Glass. Her performances of Tharp's works in the same season were recognized, and she was described as more sophisticated and contemporary as a soloist than she had been as a corps dancer. Her summer 2008 Metropolitan Opera House (the Met) season performances in Don Quixote and <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> were also well received.|$|E
5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.|$|E
5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty.</b> Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E

5|$|In Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of the {{animated}} film in which <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> is retold {{from the perspective}} of the villain, Aurora is portrayed by actress Elle Fanning, while actress Janet McTeer voices an elderly version of the character in the role of film's narrator. The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the fairy in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the fairy kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E
5|$|The Little Mermaid, Disney's first {{animated}} {{fairy tale}} since <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> (1959), {{is an important}} film in animation history for many reasons. Chief among these are its re-establishment of animation as a profitable venture for The Walt Disney Company, as the company's theme parks, television productions, and live-action features had overshadowed the animated output since the 1950s. Mermaid was the second film, following Oliver & Company, produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and became Disney's first animated major box office and critical hit since The Rescuers in 1977. Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded {{as a result of}} Mermaid and increasingly successful follow-ups — Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in Burbank, California, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France.|$|E

Elspeth gets cornered, tackled, and killed by the gnomes, who have been freed from their enchantments. Freed from Elspeth, the Green-Eyed One is able to go his way. Snow White and Alfred {{live happily ever after}} while the dwarfs decide to move on to find <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty.</b>|$|E

5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty</b> (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E

He created the rôle of the Prince in Mikhail Baryshnikov's production of Cinderella, the leading male rôle in Antony Tudor's The Tiller in the Fields (1978), Glen Tetley's Contredances (1979), the title rôle of Peter Darrell's Chéri (1980) {{and the lead}} rôle in Lynne Taylor-Corbett's Estuary (1983). In 1984, Bissell starred as a guest artist with the Universal Ballet Company in its first production, Adrienne Dellas's Cinderella. He was partnered by its leading ballerina and general director, Julia Moon. He also performed as a guest artist with the National Ballet of Canada, Scottish Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet.

5|$|The {{collaboration}} between Disney and Square {{resulted in a}} mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and {{come in a variety of}} shapes and sizes. Maleficent, from the 1959 film <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Beauty,</b> leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.|$|E
