50|$|The Ferguson rifle used a tapered <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> {{inserted}} {{perpendicular to}} the axis of the barrel. It was charged with ball and powder and required only one rotation to permit loading. While novel and effective, cost was a factor for its limited acceptance.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of the value C, stem d', spring E, adjustable cap D, and pin-hole d whereby the valve may be either held upon its seat with a variable yielding pressure or may be elevated therefrom or held immovably thereon, as an ordinary <b>screw</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One {{solution}} to this for side-valve engines was to place a <b>screwed</b> <b>plug</b> directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the <b>screwed</b> <b>plug</b> provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less [...] "dead space". One solution was to place the spark plug in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space. However this also placed the spark plug further away from the main combustion chamber, leading to long flame paths and slower ignition.|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveBronchopleural fistula is a {{critical}} complication that may occur after pulmonary resection. Early closure of the fistula is required to prevent thoracic empyema or aspiration pneumonia. We have designed a novel procedure for bronchoscopic occlusion of the fistula with a collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> and assessed its feasibility in an experimental animal model. MethodsAdult beagle dogs underwent right or left pneumonectomy, and the bronchial stump was closed with the Sweet method. A silicone bar (2 mm in diameter) was then placed {{in the middle of}} the bronchial stump. Seven days after the operation, the silicone bar was removed bronchoscopically, and fistula formation was confirmed. A screw-shaped 2 % collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> (20 mm long and 3 mm in diameter) was mounted at the end of a modified endoscopic cannula and then inserted into the fistula. Autologous platelet-rich plasma was then soaked onto the inserted plug. ResultsNine of 10 beagle dogs with bronchopleural fistula were treated successfully by plug occlusion. One dog died of pneumothorax caused by dislocation of the plug. Pathologic examination revealed that the collagen sponge had been replaced by fibrous tissue and that the fistula was covered with normal epithelium. Although soaking with platelet-rich plasma made the plug airtight immediately, the use of platelet-rich plasma seemed to make no distinct difference with respect to the treatment result or pathologic findings. ConclusionBronchoscopic occlusion with a collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> is a promising option for treatment of small bronchopleural fistulas after pulmonary surgery...|$|R

50|$|Go ring gauges {{provide a}} {{precision}} tool for production comparative gauging {{based on a}} fixed limit. Go gauges consist of a fixed limit gauge with a gauging limit based on the plus or minus tolerances of the inspected part. A go ring gauge's dimensions {{are based on the}} maximum OD tolerance of the round bar or part being <b>gauged.</b> A go <b>plug</b> <b>gauge's</b> dimensions are based on the minimum ID tolerance of the hole or part being <b>gauged.</b> The go <b>plug</b> (ID) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a plus gaugemakers' tolerance from the minimum part tolerance. The go ring (OD) gauge should be specified to a minus gaugemakers' tolerance from the maximum part tolerance.|$|R
40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) {{points out}} to be a good {{technology}} for training in the field of maintenance and assembly, as instructions or rather location-dependent information can be directly linked and/or attached to physical objects. Since objects to maintain usually contain a large number of similar components (e. g. <b>screws,</b> <b>plugs,</b> etc.) the provision of location-dependent information is vitally important. Another advantage is that AR-based training takes place with the real physical devices of the training scenario. Thus, the trainee also practices the real use of the tools whereby the corresponding sensorimotor skills are trained. ...|$|R
50|$|The burner of the Wells light used a {{vaporiser}} that heated the oil {{before it}} escaped the nozzle, so vaporising immediately. As the lamp {{was intended for}} use with heavy, sooty oils as well, this vaporiser was constructed of a square frame of straight tubes. Each tube was closed with a <b>screwed</b> <b>plug</b> that could be removed for cleaning. For initial lighting, the vaporiser would be preheating by burning a little oil in a tray beneath the burner. The burners were mounted horizontally, although some models were produced with a flexible hose to the burner that allowed it to be rotated vertically.|$|R
50|$|While {{rounding}} out {{a line of}} vacuum pumps and compressors and of creating a demand for the pumps was slow. A micrometer <b>plug</b> <b>gauge,</b> another invention of Nash's, was made and generated enough profits to keep the company afloat.

40|$|The rate of {{production}} of oil and turpentine in the effluent from the <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder {{at the exit from}} the presteamer of a fibreboard pilot plant was determined after a steady state of operation had been reached. From these data, the recovery of turpentine from the <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder effluent, as a proportion of that available in the wood chips, was shown to be 27 %. Turpentine levels in wood of Pinus radiata D. Don were determined and compared with previous data, along with causes of variations in these data.

5000|$|A spark <b>plug</b> gap <b>gauge</b> is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|R
5000|$|A few minor {{modifications}} {{were also}} made to internal parts, notably {{to the film}} pressure plate spring that changes {{through a variety of}} shapes from rod to flat shape. Most, if not all shutters alternatives have a No. 5 Cable Release socket with a tiny removable coin-slotted <b>screw</b> <b>plug,</b> while the later ones also have a Kodak type flash synchroniser contact post. A metal band inscribed [...] "Made in U.S.A." [...] was attached {{to the top of the}} shutter housing cover plate, save for the last year or two of production.

50|$|Various breech-loading flintlocks were {{developed}} starting around 1650. The most popular action has a barrel which was unscrewed {{from the rest}} of the gun. Obviously this is more practical on pistols because of the shorter barrel length. This type is known as a Queen Anne pistol because it was during her reign that it became popular (although it was actually introduced in the reign of King William III). Another type has a removable <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> set into the side or top or bottom of the barrel. A large number of sporting rifles were made with this system, as it allowed easier loading compared with muzzle loading with a tight fitting bullet and patch.|$|R
50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. <b>Screwing</b> the <b>plug</b> in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. <b>Screwing</b> the <b>plug</b> valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R
5000|$|In machining, {{where the}} thou is often {{treated as a}} basic unit, 0.0001 inches can be {{referred}} to as [...] "one tenth", meaning [...] "one tenth of a thou". (The metric comparison is discussed below.) Machining [...] "to within a few tenths" [...] is often considered very accurate, and at or near the extreme limit of tolerance capability in most contexts. Greater accuracy (tolerance ranges inside one tenth) apply in only a few contexts: in <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> and gauge block manufacturing or calibration, they are typically expressed in millionths of an inch or, alternatively, in micrometres; in nanotechnology, nanometres or picometres are used.|$|R

40|$|Unbleached {{kraft pulp}} for making sack paper is usually first refined {{in a high}} {{consistency}} process followed by low consistency refining {{in order to achieve}} desired paper properties, such as high strain at break and high tensile energy absorption at low airflow resistance. Conventional atmospheric high consistency refining is compared to treatments using two types of compressive screw equipment, Bivis equipment and the pressure expansion (PREX) <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder, commonly used in thermo mechanical pulp (TMP) plants. The <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> pretreatments were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 120 °C and 130 °C. Treatment in the Bivis equipment was performed under different compressive and shear conditions. After the Bivis and <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatments, the pulp samples were refined in a low consistency process using the Escher-Wyss refiner. Paper properties were evaluated on freely dried sheets which were produced in order to simulate paper made under industrial sack paper drying conditions. The highest levels of the tensile energy absorption index and strain at break were achieved from curled and kinked fibres, pre-treated under the most compressive and highest shear stress conditions before low consistency refining. These results were obtained at very low airflow resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper, and with very low energy consumption during pre-treatment with the <b>plug</b> <b>screw.</b> The pulp samples pre-treated at high consistency in a <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder under steam-pressurised conditions or in the Bivis equipment showed, after low consistency refining, increased shrinking ability compared to the pulp samples pre-treated in high consistency refining under atmospheric conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a novel optical thread <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread.

5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The snap gauge has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly machined part will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge.

50|$|Fig 4 shows a 10-inch {{studless}} Palliser shell Mk II {{with automatic}} gas-check. The gas-check {{is the same}} as the one in Fig 3. However, in contrast to Fig 3, the protrusion on the base of the shell in Fig 4 is not part of the shell, but is instead a wrought iron disc attached to the shell by the <b>screw</b> <b>plug.</b> Initially, all studless shells 9 - 17.72 inches, including Palliser shells, were made in one piece as in Fig 3. These shells were identified as Mark I. However, it was found that casting Palliser shells in brittle metal in one piece was extremely difficult, especially for smaller calibres, and that the protusions were liable to chipping during handling. As a result, later Palliser shells 9 - 12.5 inches were made in two pieces as in Fig 4, and identified as Mark II. The separate protrusions were made from wrought iron, cast steel or malleable cast iron.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a threaded <b>plug</b> <b>gauge.</b> There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints. At a modern machine-building enterprise, threaded gauges are important in controlling threaded joints of parts. There had been built a functional model of the caliber life-cycle. The article shows possible applications of threaded gauges and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope. The application of this method is expedient in the conditions of modern production, since that usage reduces time expenses and requirements for the operators' qualification, as well as increases the reliability {{of the results of the}} average thread diameter control...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of quality}} control was {{a sketch of}} the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> and ring gauges. However, this {{did not address the}} problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of decreasing the sheet density of paper made from unbleached kraft pulp for the middle layer in board production. The objective was to evaluate how treatments in a compressive screw equipment pressure expansion (PREX) <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder, atmospheric (HCatm) and pressurised high-consistency refining (HCpress refining) affect both fibre and paper properties and, in particular, how fibre curl affects sheet density. The <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> pre-treatments and HC refining were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 100 degrees C, 125 degrees C and 175 degrees C. Even though fibre curl increased considerably during <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatment and HCatm and HCpress refining, {{the density of the}} paper sheets did not decrease, as had been expected. A possible explanation for this result may be that the fibres become more flexible during curl treatment, resulting in increased sheet density. In order to obtain fibres that were both very curly and stiff, three ways of improving the fibre stiffness were tested: 1) lowering the pH during refining, 2) drying the fibres (hornification) and 3) treating the fibres with 1, 2, 3, 4 -ButaneTetraCarboxylic Acid (BTCA). If the fibres are dried (hornified), there is a lowering effect on sheet density. However, fibre curl does not have any lowering effect on sheet density. If the pH is decreased during <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatment, the sheet density may be reduced but, again, the fibre curl does not have any positive effect on sheet density. Fibres treated with BTCA had a marked lowering effect on sheet density. With this treatment, the fibre curl does {{have a positive effect on}} sheet density. The BTCA-treated fibres were also used to lower sheet density. A mixture of 15 % by weight BTCA- treated fibres resulted in an approximately 9 % density reduction...|$|R
