5|$|That summer, Hašek officially {{announced}} his retirement <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> spend {{time with his family}} and other hobbies.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicists}} to use Monte Carlo methods, which he used to model electron and proton initiated particle showers. He invented the quantometer <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> measure the intensity of high-energy X-ray beams.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{had little}} formal education. He {{lived with his}} {{grandfather}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> receive a common education at Donald Robertson's school with James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline. He was also tutored at home, as was usual for Virginian planters' children of the period. His grandfather trained {{him to be a}} surveyor.|$|E
60|$|But when <b>he</b> says <b>that</b> Christ ascended {{far above}} all heavens, {{we are to}} believe this--that he ascended to God himself. <b>So</b> high <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go no higher; <b>so</b> far <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go no farther.|$|R
50|$|English: <b>He</b> was <b>so</b> startled, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak.|$|R
60|$|His visitor still {{remained}} silent. There was <b>so</b> little <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say.|$|R
5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miller had the {{upcoming}} Test series against England in 1946–47 {{to look forward}} to. He therefore approached his employers for two months leave <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> travel to the United States to marry Wagner, which would allow him time to return {{in preparation for the}} international series. Vacuum Oil refused, so, with the comfort of job security in England, Miller resigned.|$|E
5|$|Kizirian, who {{was active}} in sports, was offered a {{scholarship}} to LaSalle Academy. He declined the offer <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> attend the local Mt. Pleasant High School and be closer to his friends. Kizirian became a top athlete in his class; he played {{on the football team}} for three years and became captain in his senior year.|$|E
60|$|Ferdinand bowed, but was <b>so</b> perplexed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not say a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tomorrow you {{two will}} go through the {{exercise}} together," [...] said Mr. Castle to Toby and Ella, {{at the close of}} one of Toby's lessons, after he had become <b>so</b> skillful <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stand with ease on the pad, and even advanced <b>so</b> far <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> jump through a hoop without falling more than twice out of three times.|$|R
60|$|He {{held her}} fingers <b>so</b> firmly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feel the pulse beat in them.|$|R
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Hindu sect Pushtimarg – Vallabhacharya (1479–1531) is {{believed}} to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba (called Vitthalnath or Vitthalnathji in the sect) and have children <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be born as Vallabhacharya's son. Later, Vallabhacharya married. His second son and successor was recognized as a manifestation of Vithoba and named Vitthalnath, also known as Gusainji.|$|E
5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his motorcade. The South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a large hydroelectricity project in highland Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} view from the boundary of the Nackington Road end of the St. Lawrence Ground with Canterbury Cathedral visible in the background. The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to Johnny Tyldesley. Tayler compressed the view of the playing area <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feature all of Kent's eleven players while keeping them recognisable and reasonably sized.|$|E
60|$|Meyer took {{no notice}} of his threats; indeed the man seemed <b>so</b> {{exhausted}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely stand.|$|R
60|$|She {{told him}} the story little by little, and {{sometimes}} she sobbed <b>so</b> much <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly understand.|$|R
60|$|He came up {{and kissed}} Goody through the hole; but <b>he</b> was <b>so</b> fat <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not get out.|$|R
5|$|After {{his move}} to Oxford United in January 2008, {{he stated that}} the reason for the move was <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be closer to his family home in Southampton. On his arrival at Exeter City in July 2008, he moved into a house with fellow Exeter forward, Ben Watson. McAllister stated that it would make a huge {{difference}} living near the training ground, instead of travelling long distances to get to training and matches.|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, Smith studied {{drama and}} {{creative}} {{writing at the}} University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles {{as part of the}} National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon in The Master and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film {{in order to avoid}} distracting the audience.|$|E
60|$|It was now indeed <b>so</b> dark <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} see {{the face}} of the man he was speaking to.|$|R
5000|$|... '(Hannibal) came to Crete <b>so</b> <b>that</b> there <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{consider}} (in {{order to}} consider) where {{he should go}} to next' ...|$|R
60|$|The groom hesitated, for the mare, {{who was a}} high-spirited {{animal and}} thorough-bred, plunged <b>so</b> violently <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} hold her.|$|R
5|$|Although Koniecpolski had a stutter, {{when he was}} 15, {{through his}} father's {{influence}} in the royal court, he secured an appointment as starosta (mayor) of Wieluń. In 1603 he began studying at the Kraków Academy, and after several years {{he was sent to}} the royal court by his father <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue his education in a more practical fashion. He is believed to have stayed there a year or two. He may also have undertaken a tour of Western Europe for several months, spending the majority of his time in France before returning to his family's estates.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{pressing}} of 1,000 {{copies of}} the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo {{to ask for the}} remaining copies to be returned <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he felt was a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 {{copies of the}} recording were produced in total.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{free access}} to {{all parts of the}} theater as a famous and popular actor who had {{frequently}} performed at Ford's Theatre and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> check that his intended victim had made it to the play and observe the box's occupants.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pike was <b>so</b> angry <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{complete}} the threat. After spluttering {{for a moment}} he made a fresh attempt.|$|R
60|$|Up {{struggled}} Mr. Meeson {{on to his}} knees--his {{legs were}} <b>so</b> stiff <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not stand--and began to stare wildly about him.|$|R
50|$|His {{colleague}} at university said that Peng Koen {{was a very}} serious person. <b>So</b> serious <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not even make a funny joke.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944 it {{was also}} {{apparent}} that Germany had abandoned the development of its own bomb and Rotblat asked to leave the project. Chadwick was then shown a security dossier in which Rotblat was {{accused of being a}} Soviet spy and that, having learned to fly at Los Alamos, he was suspected of wanting to join the Royal Air Force <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> fly to Poland and defect to the Soviet Union. In addition, he was accused of visiting someone in Santa Fe and leaving them a blank cheque to finance the formation of a communist cell.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E
60|$|Our visitor was <b>so</b> excited <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly articulate, {{but at last}} in gasps and bursts his tragic story {{came out}} of him.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{suspicious}} of magic coffee, but it smelled <b>so</b> good <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not resist it; so he answered: [...] "If you please, Madam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “What {{have they}} done?” gasped the manufacturer. “Tell me quickly! Did they blow open the safes?” <b>He</b> was <b>so</b> {{agitated}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely speak.|$|R
