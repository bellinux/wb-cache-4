5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical <b>storm</b> (<b>wind</b> speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E

5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; {{this was}} the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical <b>storm.</b> <b>Wind</b> shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.|$|E

500|$|Storm surge {{flooding}} {{was minimal}} {{due to the}} storm's landfall near the time of low tide. However, Charleston still recorded their highest tide since 1940. Along the coast of southern South Carolina, the storm tide was measured up to [...] above mean lower low water (the average level of the lowest low tide each day). The United States Coast Guard vessel Bramble evacuated people stranded in Savannah and Charleston on September 30. Gracie killed 10people in South Carolina and Georgia, mainly due to wind and rain-induced automobile accidents, falling trees and electrocution by live wires. The Garden Club of South Carolina replaced numerous trees after the <b>storm.</b> <b>Wind</b> damage was quite significant across South Carolina, particularly the city of Beaufort, South Carolina, with many downed trees, telephone poles, and streetlights. Also, numerous windows were shattered and shingles were torn off of roofs. A number of creeks overflowed causing floodwaters that, in areas, were several feet deep. The opening of the Beaufort Center of the University of South Carolina was delayed due to Gracie. It would be 30years before another major hurricane struck South Carolina; Hurricane Hugo in September 1989.|$|E
500|$|Tracking west-northwestward {{around the}} southwestern {{periphery}} of a mid-level ridge over central Mexico, Cosme became better organized on June24. A large area of very cold cloud-tops developed over and just {{southeast of the}} center of the storm, and convective banding wrapping into the mass began to form, mainly in the north and east semicircles. Though the cloud pattern became elongated north to south during the pre-dawn hours of the following day, a rapid improvement of the inner core on microwave and the structure on satellite imagery became apparent. A timely AMSU pass indicated an eyewall nearly closed with an accompanying intensity estimate of , and a transient eye became visible on early morning satellite images. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Cosme to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on June25. Given the light wind shear, warm sea surface temperature, and moist air environment, the agency predicted further intensification for the following hours. Around 00:00UTC on June26, Cosme attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg). Thereafter, a decrease in sea surface temperatures caused convection {{on the west side of}} the circulation center began to erode significantly. Late on June26, the system weakened to a tropical storm. The tropical <b>storm</b> <b>wind</b> radii expanded early the following day, but the inner core of Cosme, specifically the structure of the eye, began to degrade; the low-level circulation became decoupled with the upper-level circulation as well, and all thunderstorm activity dissipated. Reduced to a swirl of low to mid-level clouds, winds decreased below tropical storm-force and deep convection did not reform over the center. At approximately 12:00UTC on June27, Cosme degenerated into a remnant low pressure area while situated about [...] west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. The remnant low of Cosme continued northwestward for the next several days, before degenerating into an open trough on July 1 about [...] east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the whole}} {{of the rest of the}} morning I wandered about the island.

It had been sadly wet and discolored by rain, and dried and curled up by the wind and sun. I pulled it out, and found it to be a novel in French. On one of the fly-leaves was written [...] "Emily." [...] Reasoning from the dilapidated appearance of this book, I began to believe that the family must have left this place some time ago, and that, therefore, their return might be expected at a proportionately early period.
