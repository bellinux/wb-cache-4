500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song and rated it {{four out of five}} stars. He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if <b>she</b> <b>slips</b> up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she opens her mouth, <b>she</b> <b>slips</b> into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do. And of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E

Carey then appears in a Lamborghini Murcielago {{speaking}} on her PDA with Chris Tucker, who as a cameo, appeared {{on the set of}} the video shoot, as the man in the passenger's seat. As Carey leaves her lover a second message, he is seen frolicking pool-side with two other women, while she says [...] "with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets." [...] Her phone breaks up as she drives past the [...] "Hollyhood" [...] sign, so she tells him, [...] "Hold on," [...] singing, [...] "Save this recording, because I'm never coming back home."

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910.

That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, <b>she</b> <b>slips</b> out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} a special five-minute {{extended}} [...] "Previously on NYPD Blue" [...] segment that retraces Simone's (Jimmy Smits) whole character history. The final portion of the prolog presents Lt. Arthur Fancy's (James McDaniel) prior episode persuasion of a police widow to directly donate her husband's heart to give Simone a chance to live. [...] The regular portion of the episode begins after the completed heart transplant. The episode focuses on whether Simone's heart transplant was successful. [...] It starts ten days after the heart transplant with his anticipated hospital release. [...] Simone's [...] recovery is hampered by an internal chest infection, which leaves him weakened. [...] The doctors attempt diagnosis of the infection and weakness, which appear to be minor, with tests. Tensions run high in the department from almost {{the beginning of the}} episode. Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) has a scene where his verbal aggression with a citizen complainant provides a respite and represents the frustration and helplessness of Simone's friends and colleagues. [...] James Martinez' (Nicholas Turturro) generally good manners are also tested. Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) displays deep emotions to his wife ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence). The doctors differ in their opinions of which treatment to use. One advises Simone and wife Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) to pursue surgery, while another advises natural progression. Sipowicz's ex-wife Katie (Debra Monk) catches him offguard by appearing at the station drunk and asking for his help. She is preparing a pro se defense against DWI charges, but when Sipowicz is about to respond with assistance, <b>she</b> <b>slips</b> away. The personal turmoil drags him away from his compassionate watch. When he is distracted, Simone's health deteriorates to the point where his demise seems imminent. Dr. Carreras suggests ending the suffering, while Dr. Swan disagrees, but Carreras believes his sentiment is masking office politics that govern how statistics are attributed to various departments. Russell is conflicted on which doctor to take advice from. Sipowicz manages his wife's crisis by negotiating agreed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. After Simone receives his last rites, his colleagues say their goodbyes, while Simone dreams aloud of his mentor Patsy Ferrara. In Simone's waking dream, Patsy acts as a medium, helping Simone transition out of life. In the end, with his wife Russell by his side, Simone fades away, and the screen fades to white (as opposed to black).|$|E
