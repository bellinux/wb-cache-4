25|$|In some applications, it {{is useful}} to compute the {{probability}} that a Kalman filter with a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> (prior distribution, transition and observation models, and control inputs) would generate a particular observed signal. This probability is known as the marginal likelihood because it integrates over ("marginalizes out") the values of the hidden state variables, so it can be computed using only the observed signal. The marginal likelihood can be useful to evaluate different parameter choices, or to compare the Kalman filter against other models using Bayesian model comparison.|$|E
25|$|The models {{described}} {{on this page}} describe {{the evolution of a}} single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving neutrally. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approach allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> describing the variance in the total rate of substitution across sites.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{next-generation}} sequencing {{has also made}} large-scale population sequencing feasible, for example the 1000 Genomes Project to characterize variation in human population groups. While common variation is easily captured, rare variation poses a design challenge: too few samples with significant sequence redundancy risks not having a variant in the sample group, but large samples with light redundancy risk not capturing a variant in the read set that is actually in the sample group. Wendl and Wilson report a simple set of optimization rules that maximize the probability of discovery for a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters.</b> For example, for observing a rare allele at least twice (to eliminate the possibility is unique to an individual) {{a little less than}} 4-fold redundancy should be used, regardless of the sample size.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} application {{where such}} a (log) likelihood of the observations (given the filter parameters) is used is multi-target tracking. For example, consider an object tracking scenario where {{a stream of}} observations is the input, however, it is unknown how many objects are in the scene (or, the number of objects is known but is greater than one). In such a scenario, it can be unknown apriori which observations/measurements were generated by which object. A multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) typically will form different track association hypotheses, where each hypothesis {{can be viewed as}} a Kalman filter (in the linear Gaussian case) with a specific <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> associated with the hypothesized object. Thus, it is important to compute the likelihood of the observations for the different hypotheses under consideration, such that the most-likely one can be found.|$|E

Namely, to answer the second question, one designs a calculation (see below) that identifies the required <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> to define the theory, the starting point being some specific initial assumption, such as some local Lagrangian density which is a function of field variables and needs to be modified by including all the required parameters.

40|$|Abstract. Pseudoframes for subspaces {{have been}} {{recently}} introduced by S. Li and H. Ogawa {{as a tool}} to analyze lower dimensional data with arbitrary flexibility of both the analyzing and the dual sequence. In this paper we study Gabor pseudoframes for affine subspaces by focusing on geometrical properties <b>of</b> their associated <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters.</b> We first introduce a new notion of Beurling dimension for discrete subsets of Rd by employing a certain generalized Beurling density. We present several properties of Beurling dimension including a comparison with other notions of dimension showing, for instance, that our notion includes the mass dimension as a special case. Then we prove that Ga-bor pseudoframes for affine subspaces satisfy a certain Homogeneous Approximation Property, which implies invariance under time-frequency shifts of an approximation by elements from the pseudoframe. The main result of this paper is a classification of Gabor pseudoframes for affine subspaces by means of the Beurling dimension <b>of</b> their <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters.</b> This pro-vides us, in particular, with a Nyquist dimension which separates <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> pseudoframes from those of non-pseudoframes and which links a fixed value to <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> pseudo-Riesz sequences.
