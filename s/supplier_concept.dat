40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial {{economics}} *KAR OK KONF juni 2016 *Oceaneering AS (OAS) {{is one of}} the world’s largest ROV service {{suppliers and}} a front runner within the subsea inspection and intervention field. OAS acquired a new company called AGR Field Operations late 2011 to increase their inspection capabilities. AGR Field Operations were incorporated as Oceaneering Asset Integrity AS (OAI). OAI want to invest in a new custom tensile test machine (TTM). The TTM will be unveiled at the grand opening of the new OAS facilities on Forus, Stavanger (December 2014). OAI invited four local TTM suppliers to compete for the contract in the end of 2013. The main requirements were a TTM with; 750 T rating, an internal test length of 15 meters and an internal test diameter of 1. 5 meters. The proposed concepts did not satisfy OAI. OAI decided to hold off on the contract award decision, based on TTM functionality and price. This masters’ thesis was established to develop a concept which should compete alongside with the supplier concepts. The tender process deadline for submitting a concept was mid February (2014). The master thesis concept was submitted within the date set forth by OAI. The thesis concept was the one selected; OAI concluded that the new developments provided an edge compared to existing designs whilst satisfying OAI needs. The original scope of the thesis was to design and perform finite element analysis (FEA) on the three main functions in the TTM. The main functions are; the structure and the two opposing modules inside which transfer load to the tested item. The structure itself is called the main frame and the internal function which applies the load to the tested item is called a force module. The third function scoped by the thesis is the test item restraint function, called a tailstock module. A detailed design was made for all three functions, combined with designs of other supplementary functions. The FEA analysis revealed satisfactory results and gave an insight in how the internal components interact during loading. The overall design process has been extensive. Over a 100 3 D components was designed during the thesis period. The designed components and functions are a combination of existing design and new development. The designed functions are products of research and functional analysis. The main focus was to generate a design which facilitates testing of the most frequently tested items, identified during the thesis process. The thesis design process ended in June 2014, followed by a thorough design review. The review concluded that the design of the TTM main functions covered the requirements listed in the invitation to tender (ITT), and additional requirements added during the thesis process. Budget estimates indicate a total price of 4. 5 million NOK for the thesis TTM, while the preferred <b>supplier</b> <b>concept</b> had a fixed price of 6. 2 million NOK. The TTM project will be given additional resources to finish the detail design within the end of July. The drafting and production process will be initiated when the final design is definite. The overall thesis output was classified as a success and OAI want the thesis writer (Torleif Carlsen) to be the technical project manager {{for the remainder of the}} project. The established design and the calculations presented through the thesis is constructed by the thesis writer, with guidance from; OAS, OAI and UIS...|$|E

Recycling, as {{a key factor in}} sustainable development, is seriously considered by many manufacturers during the process of procurement. In order to establish long-term green purchasing relationships between multi-stakeholders (suppliers and manufacturers), in this study the <b>supplier</b> selection <b>concept</b> model suggested by de Boer is updated, and an evolutionary game model is developed to observe the cooperation tendency of multi-stakeholders. The newly proposed game model intensively studies the trade behavior which can be realized as strategies and payoff functions of the suppliers and manufacturers. In addition, a replicator dynamic system is formulated to study evolutionarily stable strategies of multi-stakeholders. To verify the theoretical results, simulation experiments are conducted with meaningful results: the manufacturing industry can form the patterns of sustainable development, and the recycling capability of suppliers directly determines how green a supply chain is. The results can guide stakeholders to make better decisions in the future. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

The concept of the micro-winery is not as easily accepted as that of the microbrewery, however, as the general public has been conditioned to associate a winery as having a vineyard. A winery uses similar wine-making equipment as a major commercial winery, just on a smaller scale. Glass carboys and sanitary plastic pails are often seen in the facilities of a micro-winery. Typically, each batch of wine yields 23 Liters (6 US gallons).One of the primary differences of a micro-winery as compared to a typical winery is that a micro-winery is typically able to offer a wider range of wines; as it is not tied to the grapes it grows.

40|$|This paper elaborates on {{why and how}} {{business}} relationships develop {{through an}} indepth study of a world-leading industrial tooling company (ITC). The study of the ITC focuses {{on the development of}} a “preferred <b>supplier</b> ” <b>concept,</b> developed in the UK subsidiary since the mid- 1990 ’s. The aim was to capture business volume at customers through greatly increased embeddedness from a legal, technical and social point of view. In brief, the ITC offers greater productivity at the customer plant through productivity analysis using its network knowledge of cutting, milling and drilling operations and the tools involved. This has been codified in a software package. The ICT also offers automated, real-time stock control and consignment stocks. The case study highlights some important implications of business relationships. It shows that strong ties can be built relatively fast if a working methodology exists and if buyers are willing to give suppliers a greater role. The main driver for the relationship in general, commitment, investments and trust, is the explicit methodology and documentation of achievements in terms of productivity gains and cost savings. It is the network knowledge of the ITC that is exchanged, not the tools themselves but rather the optimization of the activities that they perform. For the ITC, what was previously a fragmented but stable market is becoming a winner-takes-all market, at the customer level. This indicates that increased levels of supplier-customer embeddedness can lead to fierce competition among suppliers...|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{increases}} the competition among small and medium sized companies. It {{is possible for}} their customers, often large systems integrators, to choose suppliers {{from all around the}} world. Swedish suppliers are often not competitive only regarding cost consequently simple work tasks are more and more located in low wage countries. One way for the Swedish suppliers to compete is to collaborate with other suppliers,thus adding extra value for their customers. If companies plan to collaborate they need however to coordinate their activities to enable efficient product realization. The companies have different production systems and manufacturing strategies that should be coordinated. The purpose of this research is to investigate the role of manufacturing strategies and the relations between manufacturing strategies and design of production systems in different organizational settings. Organizational aspects on collaborative manufacturing settings are also studied. The research has been carried out through a number of case studies, thus adding empirical value to existing theory. A production system framework is proposed that links the competitive priorities of the company and the manufacturing strategies to the design of the production system. This framework can be used to highlight the dynamic interaction between companies in inter-organizational collaborative manufacturing settings involving small- and medium sized enterprises. In collaborative settings, there is one main flow of information, i. e. from a dominating partner, normally the systems integrator, to a more subordinate partner, normally the <b>supplier.</b> The <b>concept</b> of asymmetric domination is introduced, showing this asymmetric situation. The asymmetric domination gives input to decisions regarding which competitive priorities the collaborative setting should aim at fulfilling with its production systems. The selforganizing aspect on collaborative settings is introduced as a mean to enable more efficient operations. Mutual work tasks are facilitated through reduction of the formal control. Finally, experiences from a number of studies of manufacturing networks in Sweden are synthesized and an integration framework for handling the complexity in collaborative networks is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Global Commerce Initiative (GCI) {{established}} the Global Upstream Supply Initiative (GUSI) {{in order to}} provide a standard framework for consumer goods manufacturers and their suppliers of ingredients, raw materials and packaging to better integrate across a number of supply chain processes. Without Internal Data Alignment, for example, Global Data Synchronization (GDS) will definitely not improve business performance and will, in fact, magnify the negative impact of poor quality data. What’s more, collaborative initiatives such as those included in Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) will not be economically deployable on a wide scale without the consistently accurate and available information that will result from an Internal Data Alignment program. GDS is based on a global network of data pools, or electronic catalogues, which are all inter-operable and compliant with the same business requirements and standards. Interoperability means that a manufacturer can publish a product and partner data on one single Data Pool without having to worry about the fact that customers may select different Data Pools to access the data.

An exploratory study in the German automotive industry using inductive Grounded Theory was conducted. This involved data collection via 28 semi-structured interviews with 16 companies in order to form a set of 35 tentative propositions that have been validated via a questionnaire survey receiving 110 responses from 52 companies. The research has resulted in the consolidation of the validated propositions into a novel concept termed Collaborative Enterprise Governance. The core of the concept is a competence based contingency framework that helps decision makers in selecting the most appropriate governance strategy (i. e. sourcing strategy) for an inter-firm R&D relationship between a buyer and its <b>supplier.</b> Thereby, the <b>concept</b> does not draw on whole company-to-company connectivity. It rather conceptualises an inter-firm relationship to be composed of autonomous cross-functional units of the individual partner companies that contribute value to a particular joint R&D project via the possession of task specific competencies. The novel concept and its elements have been evaluated in a focus group with industrial experts of the German automotive industry and revealed positive effects on the sustainable competitive success of the whole partnership and the individual partner companies. However, it also showed that current practice does not apply the right mechanisms for its implementation and hence guidelines for practitioners and decision makers involved in inter-firm R&D collaboration in the automotive industry are offered on how to facilitate the implementation and usage of the Collaborative Enterprise Governance philosophy.

40|$|The report {{describes}} {{the state of}} the art video equipment used and experiences gained from the 6, 800 mile field test. The first objective of this project was to determine if laser disc equipment could capture and store usable roadway images while operating in a mobile environment. The second objective was to evaluate methods of using optical disc storage and retrieval features to enhance highway planning and design function. Several highway departments have attempted to use video technology to replace the traditional 16 and 35 mm film format used in photologging. These attempts have met with limited success because of the distortion caused by video technology not being capable of dealing with highway speeds. The distortion has caused many highway signs to be unreadable and, therefore, clients have labeled the technology unusable. Two methods of using optical laser disc storage and retrieval have been successfully demonstrated by Wisconsin and Connecticut Departments of Transportation. Each method provides instantaneous retrieval and linking of images with other information. However, both methods gather the images using 35 mm film techniques. The 35 mm film image is then transferred to laser disc. Eliminating the film conversion to laser disc has potential for saving $ 4 to $ 5 per logging mile. In addition to a cost savings, the image would be available immediately as opposed to delays caused by film developing and transferring to laser disc.

There are many international business opportunities available to Australian firms yet small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) seem unable to fully capitalise on them. The underlying reason for this dilemma it seems, is a lack of financial, production and personnel resources in SMEs to fully take advantage of international opportunities. The first research issue of the thesis investigates whether social capital may aid small firms overcome these lack of resources. In recent years industry cluster development initiatives have been widely promoted as the cure-all for resource poor SMEs. However, whilst most firms may be happy to form long and lasting relationships with <b>suppliers,</b> the <b>concept</b> of working and sharing information with competitors is yet another story. However to gain economies of scale, and to compete globally, firms may have little choice but to do so. The issue therefore, is how firms can overcome inherent cultural traits of individualism and non- cooperation among competitors to achieve these objectives. In recent years the concept of social capital has been put forth as a possible remedy to overcome distrust and aid cooperation in attaining shared goals for mutual outcomes in groups. The overall goal of this research therefore, is to provide an understanding of how social capital may benefit SMEs in the internationalisation process and to examine if social capital can be externalised by SMEs when forming exporting clusters. This leads to the research problem for the research: How does a firm’s social capital contribute to export ready clusters situated in SE Queensland? A review of the relevant literature provides a foundation and focus for the research and the basis for the methodological approach, which could enrich the insights into the phenomenon under study. A theory building methodology was used and data collected through semi structured interviews with industry group and government participants. Four preliminary interviews with government and export industry experts confirmed and reinforced the research issues identified in the literature review. Nine firms across three clusters were examined in the main study. The main findings of the research indicate that SMEs may export without the existence of social capital in their firms however, social capital may aid a firm’s state of export readiness by overcoming some of the resources often lacking in SMEs. It would seem however, that social capital is an important ingredient for potential export cluster members if cluster success and sustainability was to be attained. The thesis concludes with the contributions of the research including the development of an export readiness framework for SMEs and a model of social capital and export cluster formation.

As the definition of logistics (Ben Sassi, 2008) suggests that „it is the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods, services and related information from point of origin to point of consumption for the purpose of confirming to consumer requirement“, the large number of business entities which are involved in the area of business logistics could be expected. Also, we may suppose possible number of business relationships, and costs that are results of inefficient and inadequate development of relationships between logistics members. The main purpose oft his paper is to explain the importance of trust between trade companies and their suppliers. Namely, literature review (Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Papakiriakopoulos & Pramatri, 2010) suggests that the trust and commitment between business subjects are the most salient factor in the effectiveness of complex organization structures (as we fin din the area of logistics today).

40|$|To {{deal with}} dynamic and {{uncertain}} business environments, agile manufacturing {{is of interest}} to academics and practitioners. However, {{in order to achieve}} agile manufacturing, one of its dimensions is of major importance - manufacturing flexibility. It is not possible to achieve agile manufacturing with ineffective management of manufacturing flexibility. Most firms acknowledge how flexibility can be improved but few can successfully implement it to its full potential. In addition, manufacturing firms today tend to improve and implement manufacturing flexibility at a strategic level. This means higher perception of benefits and better awareness of risks. This research studied the current awareness and practices of manufacturing flexibility improvement in a manufacturing setting, particularly the Thai automotive industry. Through case studies, they can extract more information about the experiences of companies in the planning, implementation and operations of manufacturing flexibility. Thus, the following contributions were made: First, this research will provide comprehensive overviews and insights on various manufacturing flexibility improvements on aspects of pragmatic management perspectives. Second, this research explored the issues or factors taken into account when manufacturing firms, especially Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), improve their flexibility. Third, the research also explored and validated the major problems in achieving manufacturing flexibility and operating issues critical to manufacturing flexibility performance within manufacturing and supply chain aspects, especially <b>suppliers.</b> The underlying <b>concepts</b> to enhance manufacturing flexibility as well as barriers and enhancers of manufacturing flexibility within individuals and between OEMs and suppliers can be then obtained. In consequence, a framework of manufacturing flexibility improvement incorporating key elements from case studies and surveys was derived. Finally, the decision-making framework including managerial guidance and strategic evaluation methodology for better evaluating flexibility improvement strategies and achieving manufacturing flexibility were developed and tested. This is sought to create a formal and rational process that guides manufacturers through the strategic evaluation process in relation to manufacturing flexibility improvement. These can be the basis for follow up research in a specific area within flexibility improvement and enhance the development/deployment of flexibility in automotive and other manufacturing enterprises. Overall, an operations strategy can be well established and the highest level of manufacturing flexibility can be achieved. Hence, the firm can maintain or increase its competitive advantages and profitability under uncertain circumstances of manufacturing and supply chain.

Therefore, in the first place an approach to the matter requires the identification both of specific themes and juridical institutes to be deepened and of interpretation criteria to be followed. The approach that has been followed in writing this thesis – a choice which implied to consider interdisciplinary question regarding public, administrative and private law, besides European Community laws on commercial and competition matters – tries to recover the central position of private law in a disciple, such as the one on public services, exceedingly governed by administrative law. During the last years, the juridical evolution has been characterised by a progressive retraction of direct State intervention on the supply of public utilities and by an increasing use that local authorities make of private law instruments for the management and the supply of public services (especially local ones). This trend has given a new central position to the debate concerning the category of “public enterprise”. Even though the supply of public services is an entrepreneurial activity, for a long time it has been subtracted to the principle of free enterprise and subjected to public direction. Only in the last few years, following EU interventions and directives, there has been a growing favour for competition policies also in this sector. At the same time, though, legislative interventions have been mainly directed to avoid the creation of monopolistic positions and to guarantee the performance of obligations concerning universal or public services. The liberalisation – carried out to accomplish EU directives – of a sector traditionally and historically managed by “public power” has not been an easy task. The contact between private law organisational models (such as companies limited by shares) and administrative ones has been characterised by problems and contradictions: private companies – since their first appearance in this sector – have been seen as entities pursuing their own interest often conflicting with the public one. Therefore, the Lawmaker, on the one side, has encouraged local authorities to entrust private entities for the supply of public services, on the other side, has deeply intervened to avoid the risk of private opportunism. The described approach of Public Authority has deprived private companies of their private juridical character, turning them into a formal container of public control and decisions: public entities with in a private vest. Under this profile, the research carried out in this work has tired to verify whether the presumed incompatibility between private entities and the protection of public interest is grounded or not. This attempt requires, in the first place, the identification of the concept of “public service” and, in particular, of “public local service”. As well known, the above mentioned concepts are defined by legislative provisions. Nevertheless, marking the exact boarders of legislative definitions is a task assigned to the construction of insiders. The result that has been reached analysing rules and regulation governing the matter and author’s opinions is that the public nature of the service does not depend and is not connected with the public or private ownership or character of the entity that supplies it. On the contrary, a public service can be defined as every activity that aims to pursue general interest, besides the juridical nature of its <b>supplier.</b> The <b>concept</b> of public service emerged from the investigations carried out in writing this paper, confirms that in our legal system {{there is no reason to}} consider a private entity unsuitable to pursue general and public interest implied by the supply of a public utility. As a matter of fact, a public interest can be fulfilled both by a governmental or local body and a joint-stock company. The above said assumption has been the basis for a critical analysis of case law (especially Administrative Law Courts precedents) which, for a long period has qualified, and still partially qualifies public enterprises supplying general utilities as entities that cannot be subsumed into the legal category of juridical collective organisations governed by the civil code. In particular, Law Courts, have often enlarged the concept of “public entity” or have tried to apply rules and regulations provided for local authorities or for governmental bodies to deny the private juridical nature of such enterprises and to transform them into administrative agencies. The described approach has, for example, led to impose to mixed public-private enterprises supplying public services territorial bounds, not allowing them to provide their services outside a limited geographical area, forgetting that this kind of restriction is totally incompatible with the juridical discipline of private enterprises’ capacity to act which cannot be submitted to any territorial restraint. Many Authors, analysing privatisation attempts carried out in Italy, have pointed out that, until central or local authorities continue holding a majority stake in a company, it is not possible to qualify the company itself as private. Doctrine and jurisprudence have developed a general trend, intended to sustain the neutrality of the formal vest in the identification of the public nature of an entity. However, this trend leads to the risk of loosing the basic principle, according to which public enterprise and joint stock companies are two different and distinguished juridical entities, which cannot be treated as one and in relation to which the legal system provides a different discipline. Considering the increasing number of bodies and entities created by the law and – at least formally – put in charge to pursue general interest, a resolution to all the questions involving interaction between “private” and “public”, cannot come from the attempt to redefine private aspects in a “public way”. Doing so would bring to two aberrations: on the one hand there would be a nullification of the juridical alternatives provided by the law, which are intended to define different management models. On the other hand, the described kind of approach would partially make private law inapplicable. In order to reach this conclusion, a step back must be taken to remember the famous statement of Massimo Severo Giannini, according to which private law converts itself in “in a law valid for both public and private entities”, “regardless of the general or particular nature of the issues involved. Its enforceability to the activity of public authority is as general as the so-called “private law capacity” of governmental bodies and of other public entities”. An important decision of the Italian Supreme Court – even if not so recent – following the above said construction, stated that neither the Government nor other public entities have the domain on issues of public interest, and that “a body which institutionally pursues aims that can be defined as public, does not have to be necessarily qualified as public enterprise: such a body could undoubtedly be qualified as private. In other words, private companies can undoubtedly pursue aims which are in competition to those pursued by the Government and other public entities by means of bodies which – nevertheless – will maintain their private nature. It is obvious that this will be possible only when no prohibition is set by the Government, nor any provision is put in favour of the Government itself”. To us, this statement finds an important acknowledgement in the so-called principle of horizontal subsidiarity which – by being a constitutional rank provision – invites local authorities to apply private law solutions, in order to bring over activities whose specific aims are of general interest. As well known, the provision 118, paragraph IV, of the Italian Constitution provides that “State, regions, metropolitan cities, provinces and municipalities support autonomous initiatives promoted by citizens, individually or in associations, in order to carry out activities of general interest, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle”. Therefore, it is the law itself that allows to widen the concept of freedom of contract and legitimates private enterprises to compete with public authorities for the supply of public utilities. Therefore the claimed incompatibility between private companies and the public interest pursued does not subsist. It does not seem necessary to give to private companies supplying public utilities a public discipline nor to consider them as “abnormal” entities existing within our legal system. They are an integral part of those bodies governed by the civil code and characterised by a profit-making purpose, as confirmed in the systematics of the civil code itself which mentions government controlled enterprises. The conclusions reached in this work are further confirmed by the analysis of a new process know as “objectification of private law” that has recently led to consider private law and the juridical institutes disciplined by the civil code as universal models that can be used for purposes unrelated to egoistic and individual aims, such as pursuing public interest not only in the sector regarding public services and utilities. The last part of the thesis has investigated the tendencies emerging form recent laws and legislative interventions governing enterprises supplying public utilities. The latest interventions, nevertheless, confirm that public authorities continue to mistrust private enterprise and when the latter supply a public utility, they are still bounded within the strict boarders of public control. ...|$|R
