For validation, experimental data including muscle activity are required.

Volunteers were subjected to two different autonomous braking test cases of 1. 1 g, wearing a <b>standard</b> <b>belt</b> and a reversible pre-tensioned belt activated 200 ms before deceleration onset. The following data were collected: muscle activity with electromyography, kinematics with video tracking, footwell force, belt force and belt pay-out. Head and T 1 displacements were shorter with a pre-tensioned belt while head rotation was similar for both test cases. Kinematics did not display any significant gender differences. Average muscle activity with a pre-tensioned belt increased rapidly before onset of deceleration for females, but not for males. Muscle activity, predominantly in the cervical and lumbar extensors, increased soon after vehicle deceleration onset for all volunteers wearing the <b>standard</b> <b>belt.</b> All muscles were significantly more active during braking than normal driving.

In this study, nine frontal sled tests using a Hybrid III 6 YO and three tests performed with a child-size adult PMHS were compared, with focus on the kinematic responses (especially of the head) and the seatbelt forces generated during the impact. Two different restraint systems (a pretensioning, force-limiting seatbelt, and a non pretensioning force-limiting <b>standard</b> <b>belt)</b> and two different impact speeds (29 km/h and 48 km/h) were compared.

40|$|Habitat {{restoration}} is {{an important}} tool in reducing the current decline in biodiversity. To determine the success of restoration, ecologists have previously focused on species richness or {{on the presence of}} rare species; little is known of species interactions. This study examines both the potential of restored landfill sites to support pollinating insects and how flower-insect interactions can be used in determining successful restoration. These are important attributes of ecosystem function. <b>Standard</b> <b>belt</b> transects were used to record flowering insect pollinated plants and flower-visiting insects on nine paired restored landfill and reference nature sites, in the broader Northamptonshire region (UK). Over the duration of this study, an area of 25, 000 m 2 was surveyed for floral characteristics and approximately 138, 000 floral units were counted from 98 plant species. A total of 201 flower visitor surveys were performed, with 942 flower-visiting insect samples taken. Flowering plant species richness and abundance of floral resources on restored landfill sites were not found to be significantly different from those on reference sites and the flower-visiting insect assemblages were similar in terms of species-richness and abundance. Interaction structures were examined and whilst the plant-insect assemblages had few species in common, both showed similar levels of nestedness and connectance. The differences in the species but similarity in the functioning of these assemblages emphasise the importance of examining interaction structures within a functional approach to the evaluation of restoration. There are 2, 200 landfill sites in England and Wales covering some 28, 000 ha, and this study highlights that their restoration can potentially provide an important resource for the conservation of pollinating insects and the services that they provide for both natural and agricultural plants...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess gender {{differences}} in the posture and muscular activity of occupants in response to pretension from motorized seatbelts. Male and female vehicle occupants were tested in both front seat positions during normal driving and autonomous braking. This data is useful for the development of human body models (HBM), and increases the understanding of the effects of motorized belts. Kinematics and electromyography (EMG) were analyzed for 18 volunteers (9 male, 9 female) subjected to autonomous braking (11 m/s 2 deceleration) during real driving on rural roads. Two restraint configurations were tested: a <b>standard</b> <b>belt</b> and a motorized belt, activated 240 ms before the initiation of braking. Statistical comparison of volunteers’ posture and normalized EMG amplitudes was performed to understand differences incurred by the motorized belts, as well as to compare response across gender and role (occupant position within the vehicle). Data was analyzed both prior to and at vehicle deceleration, which occurred 240 ms after motorized belt onset. Motorized belts significantly affected all postural metrics, and significantly elevated the activity of all muscles compared to typical riding. Though increases in muscle activity were small at deceleration onset compared with typical riding for male occupants and female passengers, female drivers demonstrated significantly larger increases in muscular activity: between 5 and 13 % of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). At deceleration onset, standard belts showed little change in posture or muscle activation, with the median changes being well within the ranges exhibited during typical riding for all groups (i. e. not distinguishable from typical riding). Typical riding postures of males and females were similar, as were muscular activation levels—generally less than 5 % of the MVC. However, drivers exhibited significantly higher muscular activity in the arm and shoulder muscles than passengers. Limitations include the repeated nature of the testing, as prior work has shown that habituation across trials alters occupant response compared to that of unaware occupants. However, randomization of the trial order helped mitigate potential habituation effects. Another limitation is the sample size of 18 volunteers. An important finding of this study is that the increase in occupant muscular activation seen with motorized belts was gender-specific: at deceleration, the change in activation of most muscles was significantly different across gender and belt type, with female drivers exhibiting larger increases in muscular activation than male drivers or passengers of either gender, particularly in the arm muscles. These activations appeared to be startle responses, and may have implications for interactions with the steering wheel and motion during a braking or crash event. This warrants further studies and stresses the importance of quantifying male and female subjects separately in future studies of pre-crash systems...|$|E
40|$|Summary This study {{examines}} patterns {{of diversity and}} abundance of fish, invertebrates and algae on intertidal to subtidal rocky reefs and their adjacent sediments within the Derwent Estuary. It is based on two quantitative survey methods that {{formed the basis of}} a detailed survey of the estuary, primarily undertaken between February-April 2010. The survey area ranged from Claremont Point to Tinderbox and encompassed up to 24 sites along this estuarine gradient, surveying the typical range of depths that rocky reefs and adjacent sediments occur in along that gradient. The primary aims of the study were: (1) to provide a substantial quantitative baseline of current biological assemblages in these habitats as a snapshot by which future change could be measured, spatial patterns could be recognised, and management issues identified; (2) to undertake a detailed search for the threatened seastar Marginaster littoralis, and other rare seastar species that could be resident in the Derwent estuary to better understand their conservation status; (3) to quantitatively describe the current distribution of introduced species within the estuary and better understand the threats they might provide to native species. The two survey methods utilised included (1) a <b>standard</b> <b>belt</b> transect methodology widely used by TAFI for biodiversity surveys in temperate Australia; (2) a 20 minute timed swim (and intertidal search) with multiple replicates at multiple depth bands, recording fishes, readily identifiable fishes, invertebrates and brown and green macroalgae. For method 1, fifty four species of fish, thirty five species of mobile macro-invertebrates, twenty one species of sessile invertebrates and seventy two species of brown, green and red algae were recorded along standard subtidal rocky reef surveys. Fish, invertebrate and algal diversity generally increased from northern to southern-most sites within the estuary, in a pattern typical of estuarine diversity gradients. Fish species such as Trachinops caudimaculatus (Hulafish), Latridopsis forsteri (Bastard trumpeter), Dinolestes lewini (Long-fin pike), Notolabrus tetricus (Blue-throat wrasse) and Acanthaluteres vittiger (Toothbrush leatherjacket) were the most abundant. The abundance of these species increased towards the southern sites of the estuary with the exception of Hulafish which were more abundant towards the northern parts of the estuary. The most abundant invertebrates were the echinoderms Patiriella regularis (introduced regular seastar), Heliocidaris erythrogramma (Purple urchin), Meridiastra calcar (Eight-armed seastar), Amblypneustes ovum (Short-spined urchin) and the Triton shell Cabestana spengleri. Introduced species of echinoderms and crustaceans were more abundant in the northern sites of the estuary whereas native invertebrates were more abundant {{in the southern part of}} the estuary. Overall, introduced species numerically dominated the mobile macro-invertebrates within the estuary from Claremont Point to Bellerive Bluff. Dominant algae included species of encrusting Peyssonnelia (red algae) and the brown kelp Ecklonia radiata, Lessonia corrugata and Carpoglossum confluens, but the distribution of most foliose algae was restricted to sites seaward of Rosny Point, with filamentous red algae in particular dominating the northern section of the estuary. Bellerive Bluff to Rosny Point marked the most significant transition in algal assemblages and corresponded with a change from silty tube-worm matting dominated reef systems to reefs with an increasing cover of encrusting corraline algae and encrusting sponges. Notable features of the algal surveys included the abundance of the red algae Aodes nitidissima in the Rosny Point region where other foliose algae are rare, and the presence of the North Pacific kelp Undaria pinnatifida between the Grange and Alum Cliffs. Undaria is an introduced species of brown algae that is seasonally abundant with peaks in early summer. We suspect that Aodes is also an introduced species given its restricted range in this survey and the distribution of past specimens collected in Tasmania that are also restricted to the estuary. For method 2, seventy four species of fish, one hundred and forty seven species of macro-invertebrates and forty six species of brown and green algae were recorded throughout the timed intertidal and subtidal surveys. As with results from standard surveys, diversity of fish, invertebrate and algae increased from northern to southern-most sites within the estuary. Fish species such as T. caudimaculatus, N. tetricus, Fosterygion varium (introduced Many-rayed threefin), Grahamina gymnota (introduced Estuarine threefin) and Neoodax balteatus (Little rock whiting) had the largest rank abundances. Spatial distribution patterns were clearest for the two introduced threefin species which were most strongly associated with the mid-upper estuarine sites. The upstream assemblage was characterised by high abundance of gobies, blennies and threefins. A similar, but reversed pattern was evident with many marine species, particularly the numerically abundant N. tetricus, a species essentially absent upstream from Rosny Point. The most abundant invertebrates were Mytilus galloprovincialis (Blue mussel), Petrolisthes elongatus (introduced New Zealand porcelain crab), the introduced echinoderms Asterias amurensis (Northern Pacific seastar), P. regularis and the introduced fan worm Myxicola infundibulum. Some clear patterns of species distribution occurred along the estuary, including an increased abundance of P. regularis at sites upstream from Bellerive Bluff and high abundance of M. calcar at sites seaward of that location. For algae, the most abundant brown and green taxa were Ulva spp., E. radiata, Codium fragile, L. corrugata and Dictyopteris muelleri. These algae generally increased towards the southern part of the estuary with the exception of Ulva spp., which was consistently present in most sites. Most foliose algae were not present at sites upstream of Bellerive Bluff. Ecklonia radiata, present at Bellerive Bluff in depths to below 5 m, was not present at Rosny Point at any depth, despite the close proximity, indicating a very strong environmental gradient between these sites that was also reflected in the distribution of many other species, and the extent of cover of silt laden tube-worm matting that was prevalent across depths at the more upstream sites. Overall, this survey has successfully provided a comprehensive quantitative snapshot of the current distribution of much of the epifaunal biodiversity associated with reef systems in the Derwent estuary. It revealed many strong spatial patterns in species distributions and should provide a robust baseline from which to measure and assess future change. The clear break in biological assemblages between Rosny Point and Bellerive Bluff deserves further investigation to assess causes underlying this, including the extent that the tube-worm matting dominating the reef at Rosny Point and upstream sites plays. This matting may represent an alternative stable state to the algal dominated reef historically described from Rosny Point, the restoration of which may be seen to be an ultimate management goal with respect to amelioration of human impacts within the estuary. Despite thorough searching for the presence of the threatened Derwent river seastar Marginaster littoralis, none were found. This is despite extensive searching both intertidally and subtidally within the core habitat of this species. The co-occurrence and super-abundance of P. elongatus and P. regularis in these habitats suggests that if any individuals of M. littoralis are left they would be subject to severe competition and predation by these species. Consideration of the difficulty of exploiting an intertidal habitat within the core range of M. littoralis suggests that winter low salinity coupled with summer desiccation during spring tides and high temperatures would make an obligate mid-estuarine intertidal niche’ impossible. If the species is valid and continues to persist, in addition to the intertidal zone it is described from, it must also occupy subtidal habitats below salinity lows during winter, or additional intertidal habitats away from the influence of physical extremes. Our searches included many of these habitats but failed to detect any specimens. As P. regularis displayed great morphological variability within the central area of occupancy of M. littoralis, some specimens of which displayed similar features (such as an off-white marginal fringe), we suggest a revision of the taxonomy of this species be undertaken with regard to the variability of M. calcar characters, and a molecular genetic comparison to be made between these species once molecular techniques evolve to cope with the formalin preserved type specimens. Despite the rare species focus of our surveys, and the possibility of encountering several species of rare seastars known from adjacent coastal areas, no such species were found. If they are present, they would presumably be in low numbers and in isolated populations. Clearly, such species are difficult to detect, and require greater intensity of search effort to delineate their range than was possible in this survey. This was illustrated from our soft sediment searches undertaken adjacent to the reef margins, as these searches detected only one Spotted handfish Brachionichthys hirsutus despite many of our survey sites falling within the range and core habitat of this species. Introduced species numerically dominate the mobile invertebrate fauna at most of the sites we surveyed upstream from Bellerive Bluff. At many sites they contributed well over 80...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare postures of male and female vehicle occupants, tested in both front seat positions, during normal driving and {{deceleration}} onset. These data are useful for the development and initialisation of computational human body models. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of reversible, motorised seat belts in these events. Kinematics were analysed for volunteers driving on rural roads, prior to autonomous braking (11 m/s 2 deceleration). Two restraint configurations were tested: a standard versus a motorized belt, activated 200 ms before braking initiation. Kinematic metric comparison via ANCOVA was performed to understand postural differences across gender, role (driver/passenger), and belt type (standard/motorised). Data was analysed prior to and at vehicle deceleration, termed typical riding and initial braking, respectively. While males and females displayed similar postures during typical riding, differences existed between drivers and passengers, especially with respect to neck posture. Drivers displayed more protracted neck postures, with significantly smaller (by 22 ‐ 27 mm, depending on gender) head‐to‐sternum horizontal distances, than passengers. Motorised belts significantly changed posture during initial braking, notably of the chest (which was shifted posteriorly by approximately 13 mm, depending on gender and role), while <b>standard</b> <b>belts</b> did not.
