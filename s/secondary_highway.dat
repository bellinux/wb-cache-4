5|$|A roadway has {{connected}} Benton City to Richland {{since at}} least 1926, while a road with an alignment more {{similar to that of}} the current highway first appeared on maps in 1939, with termini at the concurrent highways U.S. Route 410 and PSH3. The highway now known as SR224 was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH3R) between 1937 and the 1964 state highway renumbering, which abolished the Primary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>highway</b> numbers, replacing them with Sign Route numbers, later renamed State Routes.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway 141, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 141, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. Its western terminus is at Highway 400 south of Horseshoe Lake in Seguin Township while its eastern terminus is at Highway11 near Port Sydney. The route was designated in 1974 when Highway532 was renumbered and upgraded from a <b>secondary</b> <b>highway</b> to a King's Highway. The route has remained generally unchanged since, though it was extended by several kilometres on October 7, 2003 when Highway400 was extended north of Mactier.|$|E
5|$|CR492 was {{previously}} {{known as the}} Marquette–Negaunee Road before it was made {{a part of the}} State Trunkline Highway System. It was originally designated as a part of M-15 as early as 1917. The superintendent of the Marquette County Road Commission, Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer, painted the first rural highway centerline on the roadway on Dead Man's Curve. The highway was later a part of M-28 before being transferred back to county control. The highway assumed its current form by 2001. The eastern section along Brookton Road in Marquette Township was redesignated as a county <b>secondary</b> <b>highway</b> when a new connection to US41/M-28 was opened, and the designation was extended along Wright Street on the west and north sides of Marquette.|$|E
25|$|When the Primary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Highways</b> {{were formed}} in 1937, the current SR108 became <b>Secondary</b> State <b>Highway</b> 9D (SSH9D). SSH9D became SR108 in 1964 during the 1964 highway renumbering, {{in which the}} Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{replaced}} the previous system of Primary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Highways</b> with a new system called State Routes, which is still in use today.|$|R
50|$|After a {{reconstruction}} of the Primary and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Highways</b> in 1943, the road that later became SR 409 was established as <b>Secondary</b> State <b>Highway</b> 12F (SSH 12F).

5|$|The {{highway that}} became US730 within Oregon has been {{designated}} by the Oregon State Highway Commission as the easternmost segment of Columbia River Highway No. 2 since November 27, 1917, created {{as part of the}} initial named state highway system. The segment of US730 within Washington was added to the state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road3 and kept its designation as a branch of PSH3 during the creation of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>highway</b> system in 1937. The United States Highway System was adopted on November 11, 1926, by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and included US730, traveling northeast along the Columbia River from US30 in Umatilla to US410 south of Wallula.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park Highway in Tacoma and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a <b>secondary</b> <b>highway</b> maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass Highway in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass Highway in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no highway ever has.|$|E
5|$|MT 287 {{begins at}} a T-intersection with MT 41 {{in the town}} of Twin Bridges. MT 41 heads west along Fourth Street to cross the Beaverhead River and north along Main Street. MT 287 heads south on Main Street and veers {{southeast}} out of the town. The two-lane highway parallels an inactive Montana Rail Link line through the valley of the Ruby River between the Ruby Range to the southwest and the Tobacco Root Mountains to the northeast. MT 287 follows Main Street through the town of Sheridan, where the route passes the H.D. Rossiter Building, Christ Episcopal Church and Rectory, and the William O'Brien House. The highway passes by the Robbers Roost and to the west of St. Mary of the Assumption Church in the hamlet of Laurin before reaching {{the southern end of the}} rail line in the unincorporated village of Alder, through which the highway follows Main Street and meets the northern end of Upper Ruby Road, which is designated <b>Secondary</b> <b>Highway</b> 357 (S-357).|$|E

5|$|In 1918, when Wisconsin {{initially}} numbered its highway system, {{the route}} of what later became US141 followed two separate state highways: WIS17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered <b>secondary</b> <b>highway.</b> In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state {{did not have a}} highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS57 at the state line.|$|E
5|$|The first {{portion of}} Port Republic Road {{to become a}} part of the state highway system was from Main Street (now SR 605) in Port Republic north to Pineville Road (now SR 672). That highway, SR 809, ran from Greenville through Waynesboro and Grottoes to SR 17 (now US 33) at Montevideo between Harrisonburg and Elkton by 1928. In 1930, the state highway was {{relocated}} to the east side of the South River from Grottoes to Port Republic along South River Road (now SR 825). SR 809 was not paved along Port Republic Road until 1932. As of 1932, the remainder of Port Republic Road followed highways maintained by the city of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. These included county route (CR) 31 from Harrisonburg through the junction with CR 12 (now SR 276) near Cross Keys to Goods Mill Road (now SR 708), on which CR 31 continued. Port Republic Road continued along CR 214 to Battlefield Road (then CR 7, now SR 679). The road continued along CR 7 to the junction with SR 809. CR 31 was paved from Harrisonburg to about the modern city limits of Harrisonburg, and CR 7 was paved from SR 809 to the Battlefield Road split. By July 1933, after the passage of the Byrd Road Act that established Virginia's <b>secondary</b> <b>highway</b> system and transferred maintenance responsibility for local highways from the county to the state, all of Port Republic Road's route numbers changed. SR 807 became part of SR 340, which became SR 12 in 1936. After the East Side Highway, the modern route of US 340, was completed from Grottoes to Elkton in 1941, SR 12 was moved to the new highway by 1944; the old highway became SR 865.|$|E
