50|$|Jack PC is a {{thin client}} device that is {{approximately}} {{the size of a}} network wall port. Its design allows for one's monitor, keyboard & mouse to <b>plug</b> <b>straight</b> into the wall-mounted unit. Jack PC operates in an SBC (Server Based Computing) environment.|$|R
25|$|The Enviro500 is {{the first}} model of second-generation low-floor buses for Kowloon Motor Bus, with <b>straight</b> {{staircase}} and <b>plug</b> door (only at the exit) fitted. All KMB's Enviro500 buses had a bronze band added to the champagne livery to differentiate them from the first-generation low-floor buses.|$|R
50|$|In January 2003, Kowloon Motor Bus {{received}} the first Wright-bodied Super Olympian with a 2.55 metre-wide body (once {{known as the}} Wright Explorer). Like the Alexander Dennis Enviro500, it featured a <b>straight</b> staircase and <b>plug</b> exit door. It was numbered AVW1 and was registered on 20 March 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing [...] "Butterfingers", Daily Music Guide {{described}} it as showing [...] "the new Bomb the Bass <b>plug</b> <b>straight</b> into a place where scuffed Formica is sexier than leather, and red LED is the font of all knowledge. Having worked through all those zeroes and ones only to come up wanting, Bomb the Bass have seemingly gone back to come forwards once again, with the result being a track that easily lives up to {{the sum of its}} parts." ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to analyze the {{evolution}} of the air/water flow structure along a horizontal 60 mm i. d. <b>straight</b> pipe. <b>Plug</b> and slug flow regimes were observed. In order to investigate the local structure of the flow, dynamic void fraction measurements have been performed by means of ring impedance probes. From dynamic void fraction measurements the mean void fraction values, the probability distributions of void, the liquid film height in the gas cavities and the slug frequencies have been evaluated. The analysis of the results showed that the flow structure deeply modifies along the pipe and that minor effects have to be ascribed to gas injection mode. The examination of the probability distribution function enabled the identification of the operating conditions at which the transition occurs, thus making it possible to propose a new objective criterion of identificatio...|$|R
40|$|A lightweight, quick {{starting}} reactor utilizes {{a highly}} active and physically durable methanation catalyst composed of ruthenium on alumina. The {{use of this}} improved catalyst permits a single <b>straight</b> through <b>plug</b> flow design with an average lean component H 2 /CO 2 conversion efficiency of over 99 % over a range of H 2 /CO 2 molar ratios of 1. 8 to 5 while operating with flows equivalent to a crew size of one person steadystate to 3 persons cyclical. The reactor requires no heater operation after start-up even during simulated 55 minute lightside/ 39 minute darkside orbital operation over the above range of molar ratios and crew loadings. Subsystem performance was proven by parametric testing and endurance testing {{over a wide range}} of crew sizes and metabolic loadings. The subsystem's operation and performance is controlled by a microprocessor and displayed on a nineteen inch multi-colored cathode ray tube...|$|R
50|$|The next {{upgraded}} {{product was}} the Sportband kit, which {{was announced in}} April 2008. The kit allows users to store run information without the iPod Nano. The Sportband consists of two parts: a rubber holding strap which is worn around the wrist, and a receiver which resembles a USB key-disk. The receiver displays information {{comparable to that of}} the iPod kit on the built-in display. After a run, the receiver can be <b>plugged</b> <b>straight</b> into a USB port and the software will upload the run information automatically to the Nike+ website.|$|R
5000|$|After {{completing}} the tour for her previous project Biophilia (2011), which featured {{a series of}} apps and instruments created especially for the live show, Bj√∂rk expressed interest in using the same instruments for her next project. She told The Independent: [...] "I happen to {{know some of the}} best app programmers in the world, and I have the instruments I can just <b>plug</b> <b>straight</b> into the iPad and play whatever I have. So it seems kind of natural to work on an album where I don't have three years of prepping. But at the same time, {{it is a kind of}} extreme project." ...|$|R
5000|$|Foldback {{is the use}} of performer-facing {{loudspeaker}} cabinets {{known as}} monitor speakers or stage monitors on stage during live music performances in which a PA system or sound reinforcement system is used to amplify the performers' singing, music, speech and other sounds for the audience. Monitor speakers often include a single full-range loudspeaker and a horn in a cabinet. Monitor speakers have numerous features which facilitate their transportation and protection, including handles, metal corner protectors, sturdy felt covering or paint and a metal grille to protect the speaker. There are two types of monitors: passive monitors consist of a loudspeaker and horn in a cabinet (they must be plugged into an external power amplifier); active monitors have a loudspeaker, horn and a power amplifier in a single cabinet, which means the signal from the mixing board can be <b>plugged</b> <b>straight</b> into the monitor speaker.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sound at}} popular music and rock music concerts is amplified with power {{amplifiers}} through a PA system or sound reinforcement system. With {{the exception of}} the smallest venues, such as coffeehouses, most mid- to large-sized venues use two sound systems. The main or [...] "front of house" [...] (FOH) system is a PA system/sound reinforcement system which amplifies the onstage sounds for the main audience. The monitor system consists of monitor speakers aimed at the on-stage performers rather than the audience and power amplifiers. The sound signal for the monitor speakers may be produced on the same mixing console as the main mix for the audience (called the [...] "front of house" [...] mix), which is often the case in small venues, such as pubs where singer/guitarists perform. Monitor systems have a huge range of sizes and complexity. A small pub or nightclub may have a single, 100 watt powered monitor speaker onstage so that the lead vocalist can hear her/his singing, with the [...] "aux send" [...] signal from a small powered mixer <b>plugged</b> <b>straight</b> into the monitor cabinet, and the singer setting her/his own levels with the onstage mixer. On the other hand, a stadium rock concert may use a large number of monitor wedges, big racks of power amplifiers with thousands of watts of power, and a separate mixing board and sound engineer for the monitors.|$|R
5000|$|... Continuum Fashion and 3D {{printers}} Shapeways created world's first 3D printed bikini called N12 (short {{form for}} Nylon 12) in 2011 using Rhino 3D CAD software {{along with an}} algorithm written by 3D modeling expert Jenna Fizel.* New York inventor Andrew Schneider invented a solar bikini in 2011 covering it with 40 flexible photovoltaic cells feeding into a USB connection that can <b>plug</b> <b>straight</b> into an iPod. Two hours of sunbaking is claimed {{to be enough to}} charge an iPod shuffle.* In 2003, chemical company BASF embedded nanoparticles of titanium dioxide into a nylon fabric, which was used for a prototype sun-protective bikini that maintained its UV protection when wet.* French designer John Nouanesing created the Geekini in 2008, incorporating NES game controls into a bikini.* Canadian swimwear makers Solestrom introduced two different types of UV indicator in its Smartswim bikinis in 2008 - Photochromatic beads that darken with increased UV levels and an integrated LED display.* First2Print, a digital fabric printing pioneer, collaborated with ESPI Fashion Design in 2005, to create the first digitally printed bikini that allowed exclusive artwork to be transferred onto bikinis. Houston based bikini manufacturer Relleciga started mass marketing digitally printed bikinis in 2013.* Amateur inventor Jill Silver introduced a backless and strapless bikini, named the Demikini, that used a gel under the arm to fix the top.* Cole of California introduced in 1992 an inflatable bikini with push-up pads that worked like air-pump shoes.* First introduced in 1969, [...] "tan-through swimwear" [...] uses fabric perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.|$|R
