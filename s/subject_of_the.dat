5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active phrase becomes the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passive phrase, and the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E
