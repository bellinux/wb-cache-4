5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} social and {{psychological}} well-being. These effects may include <b>social</b> <b>isolation,</b> stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. The stigma of epilepsy can also affect {{the families of those}} with the disorder.|$|E
5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and <b>social</b> <b>isolation,</b> and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E

5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and <b>social</b> <b>isolation.</b> Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and <b>social</b> <b>isolation.</b> Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>isolation</b> has a {{hindering}} {{effect in}} AHN whereas normal regulation of androgens increases AHN. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block <b>social</b> <b>isolation,</b> {{which results in}} hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out {{the negative effects of}} <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> on AHN.|$|E
50|$|Cast {{and crew}} are {{from across the}} {{national}} spectrum: Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, all full of disturbing stories of the war. The play's themes of confused <b>social</b> values, <b>isolation,</b> single-parent families, alcoholism, xenophobia and violence were a strong fit, although Pasovic tweaked cultural references somewhat and adjusted dialogue {{to make it more}} accessible to a Bosnian audience.|$|R
30|$|Critical realism {{provided}} the methodological underpinning for this study. Critical realism assumes ontological and hierarchical stratification of reality (Danermark 2002) making it {{suitable for the}} examination of social and psychosocial phenomenon such as socio-economic stratification, <b>social</b> exclusion, <b>isolation</b> and cultural context. We will present here {{the findings of the}} qualitative (intensive) study supported by findings from the previously reported quantitative studies (Eastwood et al. 2012 a, b).|$|R
50|$|Social {{genomics}} is {{the field}} of research that examines why and how different social factors and processes (e.g., <b>social</b> stress, conflict, <b>isolation,</b> attachment, etc.) affect {{the activity of the}} genome. Social genomics as a field is very young (< 20 years old) and was spurred by the scientific understanding that the expression of genes to their gene products, though not the DNA sequence itself, is affected by the external environment. Social genomics researchers have thus examined the role of <b>social</b> factors (e.g. <b>isolation,</b> rejection) on the expression of individual genes, or more commonly, clusters of many genes (i.e. gene profiles, or gene programs).|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1959, Harlow and his {{students}} began publishing their observations {{on the effects of}} partial and total <b>social</b> <b>isolation.</b> Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in bare wire cages that allowed them to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but provided no opportunity for physical contact. Total <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> involved rearing monkeys in isolation chambers that precluded any and all contact with other monkeys.|$|E

25|$|Rats have a {{specific}} social organization within colonies. In <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> models, pups which are placed in separate cages after being weaned show behavioural changes as adults and altered neural development. These changes remain after being re-introduced into the colony in adulthood. The behavioural deficits caused include neophobia, a larger response to new stimulus, locomotor hyperactivity, and increased aggression. <b>Social</b> <b>isolation</b> rats' inability to habituate to new environments {{may be caused by}} an increased mesolimbic dopaminergic activity.|$|E

50|$|A {{telecentre}} is {{a public}} place where people can access computers, the Internet, and other digital technologies {{that enable them to}} gather information, create, learn, and communicate with others while they develop essential digital skills. While each telecentre is different, their common focus is on the use of digital technologies to support community, economic, educational, and <b>social</b> development—reducing <b>isolation,</b> bridging the digital divide, promoting health issues, creating economic opportunities, and reaching out to youth for example.|$|R
25|$|While Beach often {{organized}} the famous gala-like social gatherings that Leyendecker {{was known for}} in the 1920s, he apparently also contributed largely to Leyendecker's <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> in his later years. Beach reportedly forbade outside contact with the artist in {{the last months of}} his life.|$|E
25|$|People who are {{homeless}} {{tend to be}} socially isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health. Studies have correlated that those who {{are homeless}} and have a strong support group tend to be more physically and mentally healthy. Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of shame of revealing their current homeless state. <b>Social</b> <b>isolation</b> ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking with those who are not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.|$|E
25|$|The two {{facilities}} provide accommodation for 83 residents, most of {{whom have}} experienced homelessness and <b>social</b> <b>isolation.</b> Sacred Heart Community provides an 'ageing in place' approach.

50|$|David Lyon insinuates {{that social}} sorting through {{surveillance}} {{is a modern}} threat to freedom. Byproducts of <b>social</b> sorting are <b>isolation,</b> segregation and marginalization. Social sorting has called into account issues that primarily involve equity and fairness. Different societies sort in different ways.|$|R
50|$|Without {{sufficient}} personal hygiene, sores {{can develop}} and minor wounds may become infected. Existing health problems may be exacerbated, due to insufficient attention {{being paid to}} them by the individual. Neglect of personal hygiene may mean that the person suffers <b>social</b> difficulties and <b>isolation.</b>|$|R
30|$|Gaming {{addiction}} {{could be}} a significant health hazard with harmful impact on physical, emotional, mental and social health. It is associated with sleep deprivation, eating irregularities, physical strain and fatigue, obesity, mood disorders, <b>social</b> incompetence and <b>isolation</b> {{from friends and family}} (Brunborg et al. 2014 : Choo et al. 2010; Young 1998).|$|R
25|$|Another {{theory is}} {{that there may be}} shared risk factors that can lead to both {{substance}} abuse and mental illness. Mueser hypothesizes that these may include factors such as <b>social</b> <b>isolation,</b> poverty, lack of structured daily activity, lack of adult role responsibility, living in areas with high drug availability, and association with people who already misuse drugs.|$|E
25|$|Social {{conditions}} such as poverty, <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> and inability to get or prepare preferred foods can cause unintentional weight loss, {{and this may be}} particularly common in older people. Nutrient intake can also be affected by culture, family and belief systems. Ill-fitting dentures and other dental or oral health problems can also affect adequacy of nutrition.|$|E
25|$|Yemenite Jews (called Temanim, {{from the}} Hebrew) are Oriental Jews whose {{geographic}} and <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> {{from the rest}} of the Jewish community allowed them to maintain a liturgy and set of practices that are significantly distinct from other Oriental Jewish groups; they themselves comprise three distinctly different groups, though the distinction is one of religious law and liturgy rather than of ethnicity.|$|E

50|$|Reichelt {{hypothesized}} that long term exposure to these opiate peptides may have effects on brain maturation {{and contribute to}} <b>social</b> awkwardness and <b>isolation.</b> On this basis, Reichelt and others have proposed a gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet for sufferers of autism to minimize the buildup of opiate peptides. Reichelt has also published a number of trials and reviews concluding that this diet is effective.|$|R
25|$|The primary sector, {{although}} the largest contributor, is subsistence at best: supported by an ageing (mostly female) population; individual parcels {{are small and}} over-subdivided; producers that support familial or local clients; a production that is primarily concentrated on personal consumption; poor commercial networks; and physical and <b>social</b> <b>isolation,</b> with limited educational supports. Between 60-70% of the production is supported by subsidies.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of war rape in Rwanda on its victims include <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> (the social stigma attached to rape meant that some husbands left their wives who had become victims of war rape, or that the victims became unmarriageable), unwanted pregnancies and babies (some women resorted to self-induced abortions), sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV/Aids (access to anti-retroviral drugs remains limited).|$|E
25|$|Harry Frederick Harlow (October 31, 1905 – December 6, 1981) was an American {{psychologist}} {{best known}} for his maternal-separation, dependency needs, and <b>social</b> <b>isolation</b> experiments on rhesus monkeys, which manifested the importance of caregiving and companionship to social and cognitive development. He conducted most of his research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow worked with him {{for a short period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the continual}} bleeding, {{the woman would}} have been {{continually}} regarded in Jewish law as a niddah or menstruating woman, and so ceremonially unclean.

25|$|For those enslaved in {{situations}} of forced labor, learned helplessness can also manifest itself through the trauma of living as a slave. Reports indicate that captivity for the person and financial gain of their owners adds additional psychological trauma. Victims are often cut off from all forms of <b>social</b> connection, as <b>isolation</b> allows the perpetrator to destroy the victim's {{sense of self and}} increase his or her dependence on the perpetrator.|$|R
