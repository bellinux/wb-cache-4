60|$|In a cage near by (for {{there is}} quite a little menagerie here) are three small Sapajous, {90} two of which belong to the island; as abject and selfish as monkeys usually are, and as uninteresting; save for the plain signs which they give of being {{actuated}} by more than instinct,--by a 'reasoning' power exactly like in kind, though not equal in degree, to that of man. If, as people are now too much induced to believe, the brain makes the man, and not some higher Reason connected intimately with the Moral Sense, which will endure after the brain has turned to dust; if to foresee consequences from experience, and to adapt means to ends, be the highest efforts of the intellect: then who can deny that the <b>Sapajou</b> proves himself a man and a brother, plus a tail, when he puts out a lighted cigar-end before he chews it, by dipping it into the water-pan; and that he may, therefore, by long and steady calculations about the conveniences of virtue and inconveniences of vice, gradually cure himself and his children of those evil passions which are defined as 'the works of the flesh,' and rise to the supremest heights of justice, benevolence, and purity? We, who have been brought up in an older, and as we were taught to think, a more rational creed, may not be able yet to allow our imaginations so daringly hopeful a range: but the world travels fast, and seems travelling on into some such theory just now; leaving behind, as antiquated bigots, those who dare still to believe in the eternal and immutable essence of Goodness, and in the divine origin of man, created in the likeness of God, that he might be perfect even as his Father in heaven is perfect.|$|E
6000|$|My first {{feeling on}} {{entering}} the high woods was helplessness, confusion, awe, all but terror. One is afraid {{at first to}} venture in fifty yards. Without a compass or the landmark of some opening to or from which he can look, a man must {{be lost in the}} first ten minutes, such a sameness is there in the infinite variety. That sameness and variety make it impossible to give any general sketch of a forest. Once inside, 'you cannot see the wood for the trees.' [...] You can only wander on as far as you dare, letting each object impress itself on your mind as it may, and carrying away a confused recollection of innumerable perpendicular lines, all straining upwards, in fierce competition, towards the light-food far above; and next of a green cloud, or rather mist, which hovers round your head, and rises, thickening and thickening to an unknown height. [...] The upward lines are of every possible thickness, and of almost every possible hue; what leaves they bear, being for the most part on the tips of the twigs, give a scattered, mist-like appearance to the under-foliage. For the first moment, therefore, the forest seems more open than an English wood. But try to walk through it, and ten steps undeceive you. Around your knees are probably Mamures, {129a} with creeping stems and fan-shaped leaves, something like those of a young coconut palm. You try to brush through them, and are caught up instantly by a string or wire belonging to some other plant. You look up and round: and then you find that the air is full of wires--that you are hung up in a network of fine branches belonging to half a dozen different sorts of young trees, and intertwined with as many different species of slender creepers. You thought at your first glance among the tree-stems that you were looking through open air; you find that you are looking through a labyrinth of wire-rigging, and must use the cutlass right and left at every five steps. You push on into a bed of strong sedge-like Sclerias, with cutting edges to their leaves. It is well for you if they are only three, and not six feet high. In the midst of them you run against a horizontal stick, triangular, rounded, smooth, green. You take a glance along it right and left, and see no end to it either way, but gradually discover that it is the leaf-stalk of a young Cocorite palm. {129b} The leaf is five-and-twenty feet long, and springs from a huge ostrich plume, which is sprawling out of the ground and up above your head a few yards off. You cut the leaf- stalk through right and left, and walk on, to be stopped suddenly (for you get so confused by the multitude of objects that you never see anything till you run against it) by a gray lichen-covered bar, as thick as your ankle. You follow it up with your eye, and find it entwine itself with three or four other bars, and roll over with them in great knots and festoons and loops twenty feet high, and then go up with them into the green cloud over your head, and vanish, as if a giant had thrown a ship's cables into the tree-tops. [...] One of them, so grand that its form strikes even the Negro and the Indian, is a Liantasse. {129c} You see that at once by the form of its cable--six or eight inches across in one direction, and three or four in another, furbelowed all down the middle into regular knots, and looking like a chain cable between two flexible iron bars. At another of the loops, about as thick as your arm, your companion, if you have a forester with you, will spring joyfully. With a few blows of his cutlass he will sever it as high up as he can reach, and again below, some three feet down, and, while you are wondering at this seemingly wanton destruction, he lifts the bar on high, throws his head back, and pours down his thirsty throat a pint or more of pure cold water. This hidden treasure is, strange as it may seem, the ascending sap, or rather the ascending pure rain-water which has been taken up by the roots, and is hurrying aloft, to be elaborated into sap, and leaf, and flower, and fruit, and fresh tissue for the very stem up which it originally climbed, and therefore it is that the woodman cuts the Water-vine through first {{at the top of the}} piece which he wants, and not at the bottom, for so rapid is the ascent of the sap that if he cut the stem below, the water would have all fled upwards before he could cut it off above. [...] Meanwhile, the old story of Jack and the Bean-stalk comes into your mind. In such a forest was the old dame's hut, and up such a bean stalk Jack climbed, to find a giant and a castle high above. Why not? What may not be up there? You look up into the green cloud, and long for a moment to be a monkey. There may be monkeys up there over your head, burly red Howler, {131a} or tiny peevish <b>Sapajou,</b> {131b} peering down at you, but you cannot peer up at them. The monkeys, and the parrots, and the humming birds, and the flowers, and all the beauty, are upstairs--up above the green cloud. You are in 'the empty nave of the cathedral,' and 'the service is being celebrated aloft in the blazing roof.' ...|$|E

Managing {{director of the}} Théâtre des Variétés from 1830 to 1836, he also directed Le Nain couleur de rose, a political, literary and moral newspaper from 15 September 1815 to 5 May 1816 and collaborated with La Foudre by Alphonse de Beauchamp.|$|E
5000|$|The {{success of}} the ballet, a true bridge between the Enlightenment and Romanticism, {{was so great that}} many theatres in Paris and the French provinces put on the {{original}} version or competing works inspired by the same theme. There were over 160 productions in a single year. The Duchesse de Berry assisted in the first production in person, and the success was such that many things, such as dresses, fans, hairstyles and even a type of bread were nicknamed [...] "jocko." [...] It was revived three times that year and had many imitators. Jules Perrot, also in 1825, put on his version at the Théâtre de la Gaîté, entitled <b>Sapajou.</b>|$|E

We’ve put together a list of China-related books that will make great gifts — {{and all of them}} are appropriate for the general-interest reader. For: The Nostalgic Reader Earnshaw Books has been reprinting a number of older books, including many expat memoirs from early 20 th century China. We’ve previously reviewed Shanghai: High Lights, Low Lights, Tael Lights, an entertaining glimpse into 1930 s Shanghai penned by Maurine Karns and Pat Patterson. The press is also releasing a three-volume set of drawings by White Russian cartoon artist <b>Sapajou,</b> which Paul French writes about here. For: The Budding Entrepreneur Another old title now available again is Carl Crow’s 400 Million Customers, which is a sharp-tongued set of observant essays about {{the ins and outs of}} doing business in China. Much of what Crow has to say about China in the 1930 s is still true today, and his book serves as both a how-to guide and a cautionary tale for those who dream of cracking the China market. For a more current look at Chinese business culture, check out the documentary Win in China (see here for a China Beat interview with director Ole Schell) ...|$|E
