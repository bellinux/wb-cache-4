In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can <b>sometimes</b> <b>feel</b> {{that they are not}} part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

500|$|... "Dangerous" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics.

[...] Music critic Nelson George said of the song, [...] " [...] a pile driving track...that explodes from radio speakers. 'Dangerous' in fact, opens another window into Michael's artistic process."

500|$|The explicitness of the album's lyrics {{mandated}} a Parental Advisory logo in the United States, {{largely due}} to the lurid nature of the songs as well as their usage of profanity.

[...] In spite of its graphic lyrics, the underlying female themes in many of the songs led some journalists to tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, which Love was not directly associated with.|$|E
500|$|Love's lyrical {{content is}} {{composed}} from a female's point of view, and her lyrics {{have been described}} as [...] "literate and mordant" [...] and noted by scholars for [...] "articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness". According to a 2014 interview, lyrics have remained the most important component of songwriting for Love: [...] "I want it to look just as good on the page as it would if it was in a poetry book". A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature. Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things...

While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes, Yukari is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life. Yukari tells Takao nothing about herself, including her name, while Takao opens up to her, sharing {{his passion for}} shoes by offering to make a pair for her. When Takao learns Yukari's identity, emotions come to a head as both learn {{that they have been}} teaching each other [...] "how to walk". Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of [...] "lonely sadness", based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for [...] "love", and uses shoes as a metaphor for life. The story's motifs include rain, Man'yōshū poetry, and the Japanese garden. The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and disjointedly people mature, where even adults <b>sometimes</b> <b>feel</b> no more mature than teenagers, according to Shinkai.|$|E

Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch. I remember Saldhana the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pelé. The man could play in any position". Former Manchester United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated; [...] "I <b>sometimes</b> <b>feel</b> as though football was invented for this magical player."

500|$|Robinson {{incorporated}} utopian {{themes in}} his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a [...] "utopian novelist" [...] in that he claims [...] "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>feel</b> a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and [...] "struggles over the nature of Islam" [...] as recurring themes.|$|E

I <b>sometimes</b> <b>feel</b> like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course.

Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her".

The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E
500|$|February was a busy {{month for}} the club. Benfica trailed Porto by 11 points in the Primeira Liga, with crucial European and {{domestic}} cup matches between league matches. The first was on 2 February against Nacional. Like past home performances, Benfica failed to score and lost points in another scoreless draw. Camacho tried to explain his team's performance: [...] "We did not lack attitude, but at home, we <b>sometimes</b> <b>feel</b> disturbed, pressured. We played two forwards and we still did not score." [...] He saw his first white handkerchiefs, an action commonly seen as a request for resignation. Benfica regained their feet with a home win against Paços de Ferreira in the Portuguese Cup. An opening goal by Pedrinha in the second minute was answered with an equaliser by Cardozo before half-time. In the second half, Cardozo, Rui Costa and Nuno Assis scored to send Benfica to the quarter-finals. On 14 February, Benfica hosted 1. FC Nürnberg {{in the first of}} two games against the German team. Recent acquisition Ariza Makukula scored the only goal in the 43rd minute, a 20-meter strike which fooled goalkeeper Jaromír Blažek. Camacho called the narrow victory important. Three days later, Benfica played Naval at the Municipal José Bento Pessoa. Cristian Rodríguez scored the club's opening goal in the 18th minute, with László Sepsi assisting Nuno Assis on a second goal in the final minute. On 21 February, Benfica played the second leg of their European double-header with Nürnberg. The Bundesliga side scored twice in seven minutes during the second half before Cardozo scored in the 89th minute and Di María tied the game in the 92nd, sending Benfica to the round of 16 with Spanish side Getafe. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica made some defensive errors in the second half that put them in a though spot. They managed to react and continued their search for goals until they arrived." [...] In domestic-league play, Benfica hosted Braga on 24 January. Braga scored first with a fifth-minute goal by Zé Manel, with Luisão tying the game in the 21sth minute. The draw complicated the league race, with Porto increasing their lead. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica did everything they could win. They tried to score from every way possible, but could not". The club ended the month with a 2–0 victory over Moreirense in the Portuguese Cup, sending them to the semi-finals.|$|E
