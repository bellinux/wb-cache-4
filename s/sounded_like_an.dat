[...] The axles were unlubricated, as grease would capture dust which would act as sandpaper and immobilize the cart.

500|$|During rehearsals {{and even}} during {{the run of the}} show, the music was {{repeatedly}} revised by Rodgers in an attempt to gear the songs to Traubel's voice. According to Bruce Pomahac of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, [...] "as she began to get cold feet about what her New York fans would think about her as a belter, the keys of each of her numbers edged upward." [...] One of Traubel's numbers saw three different versions before being scrapped in favor of, according to Pomahac, [...] "something that <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> excerpt from Traubel’s Vegas act." [...] "All At Once You Love Her" [...] saw some popularity when recorded, during the run of the show, by Perry Como; in what Pomahac speculates was an attempt to appease Traubel, a reprise of the song was added for her, and provided [...] "one of the loveliest moments in all of Pipe Dream". The Organization announced that a new vocal score would be published in 2012, though it has not appeared as of 2017—the existing score reflects revisions made when Nancy Andrews took over the part.|$|E

Dan LeRoy of NJ Star Ledger observed that the song <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outtake from Brandy Norwood's debut album, while New York Daily News compared it to Houston's 1999 song [...] "It's Not Right but It's Okay".

Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as [...] "the reason [...] was put on the Earth."

This {{was evident in}} the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the {{negative}} tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] began as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife. He asked singer Jem Archer to collaborate with him and during their first collaborative session, they wrote a song called [...] "Silly Thing", inspired by Sigsworth's wife. He said: [...] "I never write love songs, but I was moved to write one for her. I've never had a problematic relationship with her, there's not been a lot of drama.

Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that [...] "he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys." [...] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, [...] "or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a [...] "superstar" [...] in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while [...] "successfully [...] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult." [...] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the [...] "Queen of Pop". Klein argued that [...] "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.".|$|E

Similarly, Tiny Mix Tapes' Embling also believed the recording {{was one of the few}} satisfying tracks, as it is [...] "invigorating" [...] and [...] "transcends its sometimes clumsy analogies and manages to be charming and unabashedly sweet, without coming across as cloying."

[...] Mike Diver from BBC, labeled the single [...] "sweet, summertime RnB" [...] and its chorus, finalizing [...] "much of this impressive set showcases a deep appreciation of one of hip hop's four elements, MCing". In a negative review, Bob Hoose from web magazine Plugged In Online, once a magazine that published reviews from a Conservative Christian's perspective, harshly criticized the lyrics for being [...] "corny" [...] and [...] "steer around typical hip-hop excesses." [...] Hoose, also noticed the use of swear words and sexual references. M.T. Richards of Slant Magazine, while {{reviewing the}} album, gave [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] a negative review, calling it [...] "anticlimactic" [...] and found it to be a [...] "slow, lulling song that sounds like it was recorded in the midst of a drab winter, and I'll take Sacha Baron Cohen's Bruno over Bruno Mars."

2500|$|After Stern left WCCC {{for being}} denied a raise in salary, {{he began a}} new morning shift at WWWW, a {{struggling}} rock outlet in Detroit, Michigan on April 21, 1980.

Stern held a bra-burning event and wrestled women outside the studios, and invited listeners to confess the most outrageous places where they had sex, and record their calls for the air. A stunt in which listeners paid $1.06 (the station's FM frequency) to hit a Japanese car with a sledgehammer earned Stern national mention. [...] For his performance, Stern won a Billboard award for [...] "Best Album-Oriented Rock Disc Jockey" [...] and was featured in the Drake-Chenault [...] "Top Five Talent Search" [...] contest in the AOR category. Published in January 1981, the fall Arbitron ratings showed that Stern trailed his three rock competitors with a 1.6% market share of the listening audience during an average quarter-hour.

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{coinciding with the}} 50th anniversary of the album's release, for The Guardian, author and {{musician}} Bob Stanley lamented that Rubber Soul was often overlooked in appraisals of the Beatles' recording career, whereas Revolver and the White Album had each gained in stature. Stanley highlighted Rubber Soul as having been [...] "a good 18 months ahead of its time" [...] and [...] "the first album of the rock era that <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> album". Also writing in December 2015, in Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield especially admired the singing and the modern qualities of the female characters depicted in the lyrics. He said that the album was [...] "way ahead of what anyone had done before" [...] and, given the short period {{in which they had}} to record, he called it the Beatles' [...] "accidental masterpiece". Conversely, Jon Friedman of Esquire finds the work vastly overrated, with only the Lennon-dominated songs [...] "Norwegian Wood", [...] "Nowhere Man", [...] "In My Life" [...] and [...] "Girl" [...] worthy of praise, and he dismisses it as [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "the Beatles' most inconsequential album". Although he considers that McCartney [...] "comes off third-string" [...] to Lennon and Harrison, Plagenhoef defends the album's subtle mood; highlighting the influence of cannabis on the Beatles throughout 1965, he writes: [...] "With its patient pace and languid tones, Rubber Soul is an altogether much more mellow record than anything the Beatles had done before, or would do again. It's a fitting product from a quartet just beginning to explore their inner selves on record." [...] In his review for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham highlights the musical arrangements, three-part harmonies and judicious use of new sounds, in addition to the band's improved musicianship and songwriting. He says that Rubber Soul usually trails the Beatles' next four albums in critics' assessments of their work, yet [...] "it's undoubtedly their pre-acid, pre-antagonism masterpiece: beat music as high art".|$|E
