5|$|The Apollo {{program has}} been called the {{greatest}} technological achievement in human history. Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 <b>spinoff</b> <b>products</b> as of 2015. The flight computer design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems, the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits (IC).

Termed by the group "a remarkable stability achievement," the Givens Buoy raft offers the first major advance in inflatable survival equipment in many years. It is a <b>spinoff</b> <b>product</b> resulting in part from NASA technology and in part from years of research by Jim Givens, president of Res-Q-Raft, Inc., of Lake Worth, Florida and Seattle, Washington. NASA used inflatable rafts to transfer astronauts returning from space between their ocean-landed spacecraft and a recovery ship. NASA found a problem in the use of conventional flat-bottom inflatables; they tended to overturn when exposed to the downdraft from helicopters of the recovery fleet. So Johnson Space Center developed a new and highly-effective method of raft stabilization for which NASA secured a patent. Working separately, Jim Givens came up with a very similar system.

40|$|The National Aeronautics & Space Administration {{has many}} {{missions}} {{but they can}} all {{be reduced to a}} common denominator: to explore Earth and its surroundings, conduct aeronautical research, and put the results to work for the benefit of mankind. At times the benefit may be dimly perceived. Take, for instance, last year's monumental triumph of exploration, the landing of robot spacecraft on Mars. How, some ask, does probing a neighbor planet improve the lot of Earth's people? In two ways: scientific gain and technological advancement. Though perhaps little understood, they are concrete benefits, assets as tangible as sunshine, more valuable than gold. Technological advancement, on the other hand, offers equally important but more immediate returns. Technology is science applied. It is the ability of a society to make things that improve the quality of human existence. It is compounded of intellect and skill, which draw upon the scientific base to bring forth new ideas, inventions, materials and processes. It is, in a word, knowledge. It builds like an inverted pyramid, each level broader than the one. before as successive generations contribute to the cumulative lore. Knowledge is readily transferable. If you build a better mousetrap, you may acquire experience {{in the course of the}} project that can be applied to a need totally unrelated to mouse-traping. This transfer process has been going on since the dawn of technology. In the last two decades it has accelerated enormously, spurred by the immense flow of aerospace-stimulated technology. There have been literally thousands of <b>spinoffs,</b> new <b>products</b> and processes that owe their origins to aerospace research.

40|$|Advances in {{materials}} technology {{have demonstrated that}} it is possible to get the advantages of diamond in a number of applications without the cost penalty, by coating and chemically bonding an inexpensive substrate with a thin film of diamond-like carbon (DLC). Diamond films offer tremendous technical and economic potential in such advances as chemically inert protective coatings; machine tools and parts capable of resisting wear 10 times longer; ball bearings and metal cutting tools; a broad variety of optical instruments and systems; and consumer products. Among the American companies engaged in DLC commercialization is Diamonex, Inc., a diamond coating <b>spinoff</b> of Air <b>Products</b> and Chemicals, Inc. Along with its own proprietary technology for both polycrystalline diamond and DLC coatings, Diamonex is using, under an exclusive license, NASA technology for depositing DLC on a substrate.

40|$|By their {{challenging}} nature, NASA {{programs are}} particularly demanding of technological input. Meeting the aeronautical and space {{goals of the}} past four decades has necessitated leading edge advancements across a diverse spectrum that embraces virtually every scientific and technological discipline. Technology is simply knowledge and, like other forms of knowledge, it is often broadly applied and transferable. For that reason, the vast storehouse of technology NASA has built is a national resource, a bank of knowledge available for commercial applications and enhancements to the quality of life-"spinoff"-to new products and processes of benefit to the national economy, industrial efficiency and human welfare. Multiple use of technology has never been more important. Budgetary stringency is reducing the amount of government funding available for new research and development, {{but at the same time}} intensifying international competition demands increasing technological innovation to strengthen the U. S. posture in the global marketplace. Reuse of technology offers a relatively inexpensive supplementary means of partnering with industry focused on bringing new products and processes to the market. More than a thousand of <b>spinoff</b> <b>products</b> and processes have emerged from reapplication of technology developed for NASA mission programs. Each has Contributed some measure of benefit to the national economy, productivity or lifestyle; some bring only moderate increments of gain, but many generate benefits of significant order with economic values in the millions of dollars. Other technologies with moderate economic return have added measurably to the quality of life of U. S. citizens. Collectively, they represent a substantial dividend on the national investment in aerospace research. By Congressional mandate, it is NASA's responsibility to promote expansion of spinoff in the public interest. Through its Technology Transfer Program, NASA seeks to encourage greater use of its technological resources by providing a link between the technology and those who might be able to put it to advantageous use. The program's aim is to broaden and accelerate the transfer accomplishments and thereby to gain national benefit in terms of new products, services, and new jobs. This publication is an instrument of-and documents the outcome of-that purpose. It is intended to heighten awareness of the technology available for transfer and its potential for public benefit. Spinoff 1996 is organized in three sections: Section 1, summarizes NASA's current mainline programs, whose objectives require development of new technology and therefore replenish and expand the bank of knowledge available for reapplication. Section 2, the focal point of this volume, contains a representative sampling of <b>spinoff</b> <b>products</b> and processes that resulted from secondary application of NASA technology.

40|$|Technology is knowledge, the {{technical}} "know-how" employed by a society to produce things that {{improve the quality}} of human life. Like other forms of knowledge, it is transferable; once developed, technology can be applied to uses different-and often remote-from the original application. Thus, the technology that NASA has developed in more than two decades of space and aeronautical research constitutes a valuable national resource, a bank of knowledge available for secondary utilization, or "spinoff. " NASA mainline programs, by their challenging nature, are particularly demanding of technological advance; meeting their goals has forced extraordinary advancements in virtually every scientific and technological discipline. For that reason, the wealth of aerospace-generated knowledge available for transfer is exceptionally diverse, and much of it is readily applicable to secondary use over a broad spectrum of public needs and conveniences. Through its Congressionally mandated Technology Utilization Program, NASA seeks to promote wider use of this technological resource. The program provides a link between the technology bank and those in either the private or public sectors who might be able to re-use the technology productively. Its aim is to accelerate the transfer process, to bring to the marketplace sooner those spinoffs which might eventually occur in the normal course of events, and to gain thereby more immediate economic benefit in terms of new products and new jobs. The program has been remarkably successful. Since its inception 17 years ago, thousands of <b>spinoff</b> <b>products</b> and processes have emerged. Some of these innovations bring only moderate increments of economic gain or lifestyle improvement, but many others amount to significant public benefits, with economic values often running to millions of dollars. Collectively, spinoffs provide a substantial bonus return on the funds invested in aerospace research. This publication is intended to increase public awareness of the resource that is NASA's technology bank and its potential for further public benefit. It is devoted primarily to the NASA technology transfer process, but in the interests of perspective it also describes related areas of NASA endeavor. Section 1 consists of a resume of NASA's current mainline programs. These programs are producing direct public benefit through direct application of technology; at the same time, they are contributing to indirect benefit-spinoff-by generating new technology which may find secondary application in the future. Section 2 is the focal point of this volume. It contains a representative sampling of <b>spinoff</b> <b>products</b> and processes employed in various avenues of everyday life, and it describes briefly the NASA technology from which these transfers derived. Section 3 details the mechanisms of the technology transfer process, including the means by which NASA seeks to stimulate technology utilization. Also described are NASA's activities in a related area of technology transfer: provision of assistance to agencies interested in exploiting the benefit potential of satellite remote sensing technology...|$|E
40|$|Recognizing {{the great}} {{potential}} of the technology bank, Congress charged NASA with stimulating the widest possible use of this valuable resource in the national interest. NASA's instrument of that purpose is the Technology Transfer Program, which seeks to broaden and accelerate the spinoff process. Its intent is to spur expanded national benefit, in terms of new products and new jobs, by facilitating the commercial application of the technology; it encourages greater use of the storehouse of knowledge by providing a channel linking the technology and those {{who might be able}} to put it to advantageous use. In July 1994, NASA implemented an Agenda for Change - a new way of doing business in partnership with the private sector. This Agenda marks {{the beginning of a new}} focus to further improve our contributions to America's economic security through the pursuit of aeronautics and space missions. This publication is an implement of the Technology Transfer Program intended to heighten awareness among potential users of the technology available for transfer and the economic and social benefits that might be realized by applications of NASA technology to US commercial interests.

40|$|Since its {{inception}} 40 years ago, NASA's Technology Transfer Program {{has led the}} way for our nation to benefit from cutting-edge aerospace technologies. In addition to contributing to U. S. economic growth, these technologies are {{improving the quality of}} life on Earth while finding new ways to protect and preserve it. NASA's research and development efforts have advanced areas in medicine, communications, manufacturing, computer technology, and homeland security. These breakthroughs, translated into commercial products, are enhancing the lives of Americans everywhere. When a congressional mandate led NASA to develop the Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Program, the Agency began a wide dissemination of its research and development results. In doing so, NASA recognized that many of its technologies were transferable to industry for the development of commercial products. As a result, the Technology Utilization Program was born in 1962. The successful program went through several changes over the years, as its philosophy, mission, and goals adapted into the Technology Transfer Program we know today. The program strives to make the latest technologies available to industry as soon as they are developed. Each year, NASA's Spinoff publication showcases new products and services resulting from commercial partnerships between NASA and private industry. In the 2002 issue, the NASA field centers reflect upon the growth that has made these innovations available to the public. The Research and Development section examines past achievements, current successes, and future goals for each of the ten NASA centers. The Commercial Benefits section proudly highlights 51 new <b>spinoff</b> <b>products,</b> including a heart pump for patients needing a heart transplant, as well as an air purifier that destroys anthrax spores.
