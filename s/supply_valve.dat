25|$|A pneumofathometer <b>supply</b> <b>valve,</b> which {{supplies}} gas to the pneumofathometer for the diver. This valve {{is usually}} near the main <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> {{but with a}} different handle. It is usually a needle type valve as it must be finely adjustable, but {{it must also be}} large enough to allow a fairly high flow rate, as the air may be used as an alternative breathing air source, or to fill small lift bags.|$|E

50|$|Marotta also {{continued}} {{its support of}} the space program by <b>supplying</b> <b>valves</b> for the Apollo-Soyuz mission and the Space Shuttle. Marotta provided high pressure control valves and manifolds on the FFG-7 Oliver H. Perry Class and DD-963 Spruance Class ships, as well as Trident Class submarines.|$|R
25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage flow control valve where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|E
25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E
25|$|Before launch, two Captive Firing Tests were {{conducted}} on the rocket which was to launch HTV-1. The first test, which consisted of firing the first stage for ten seconds, was originally scheduled to occur at 02:30 UTC on 27 March 2009, however it was cancelled after the launch pad's coolant system failed to activate. This was later discovered to {{have been due to}} a manual <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> not being open. The test was rescheduled for 1 April, but then postponed again due to a leak in a pipe associated with the launch facility's fire suppression system. The test was rescheduled for 2 April, when it was successfully conducted at 05:00 UTC. Following this, the second test, which involved a 150-second burn of the first stage, was scheduled for 20 April. This was successfully conducted at 04:00 UTC on 22 April, following a two-day delay due to unfavourable weather conditions. A ground test, using a battleship mockup of the rocket was subsequently conducted on 11 July.|$|E
25|$|All {{electrical}} wiring {{in the power}} system bay was sheathed in stainless steel, and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel. The fuel cell oxygen <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen.

50|$|ESCO {{survived the}} Great Depression {{primarily}} as a jobbing foundry, making castings for sawmills, pulp and paper mills. In 1932, ESCO opened its first stainless steel industrial service center. During the 1940s, ESCO added new products to meet demand for <b>supply</b> <b>valves,</b> pump bodies, anchor chains and other components for warships and tanks. In 1946, ESCO developed the two piece tooth tooth system and, in 1948, the company entered the cable excavator bucket market.|$|R
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> should that not happen.|$|E
50|$|However, {{during the}} launch attempt on 14 April, a primary helium <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> {{used in the}} stage {{separation}} system failed a pre-launch diagnostic test approximately one hour prior to the scheduled launch, so the SpaceX launch manager scrubbed the mission. In ground tests following the scrub, the redundant backup helium <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> tested okay so the mission would likely have succeeded; however, it is SpaceX policy to not launch with any known anomalies.|$|E

50|$|Ideally each storage {{cylinder}} has an independent {{connection to the}} filling panel with a contents pressure gauge and <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> dedicated to that cylinder, and a filling gauge connected to the filling whip, so the operator can see at a glance the next higher {{storage cylinder}} pressure compared to the receiving cylinder pressure.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option for}} the surface {{supplied}} diver is to breathe air supplied through the pneumofathometer hose of the umbilical. The diver inserts the hose into the air space of the helmet of full face mask, and the panel operator opens the <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> sufficiently to provide enough air to breathe on free flow. Pneumo air can be supplied to another diver by a rescuer in the surface supply equivalent of Octopus air sharing. This procedure would save the bailout gas which would then be available if the situation deteriorates further. Pneumo breathing air supply is not applicable to environmentally sealed suits for contaminated environments.|$|E
50|$|Another flight on March 23, 2016, {{suffered}} an underperformance anomaly {{on the first}} stage burn and shut down five seconds early. The Centaur proceeded to boost the Orbital Cygnus payload, the heaviest on an Atlas to date, into the intended orbit by utilizing its fuel reserves {{to make up for}} the shortfall from the first stage. This longer burn cut short a later Centaur disposal burn. An investigation of the incident revealed that this anomaly was due to a fault in the main engine mixture-ratio <b>supply</b> <b>valve,</b> which restricted the flow of fuel to the engine. The investigation and subsequent examination of the valves on upcoming missions led to a delay of the next several launches.|$|E
50|$|A wet-pipe {{sprinkler}} system is an automatic {{sprinkler system}} in which the <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> are open and the system is charged with water under supply pressure at all times. For this reason, they are the quickest at getting water on the fire and are the simplest to maintain. Wet pipe systems are installed where indoor temperatures can he maintained at or above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Below that temperature, there is the danger of freezing pipes. If the outside temperature is below freezing and the interior temperature is less than forty degrees Fahrenheit, the steel sprinkler piping, which rapidly conducts heat and rapidly loses it, will drop below freezing. The frozen area may be isolated and near an opening or uninsulated portion of the building. It may be a small area, but it could be enough to put the whole system out of service.|$|R
50|$|In {{plants with}} {{remote-controlled}} process operation, {{such as oil}} refineries and petrochemical plants, some 2-way valves can be designated as normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) during regular operation. Examples of normally-closed valves are sampling valves, which are only opened while a sample is taken. Other examples of normally-closed valves are emergency shut-down valves, which are kept open when the system is in operation and will automatically shut by taking away the power supply. This happens {{when there is a}} problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system. Examples of normally-open <b>valves</b> are purge-gas <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> or emergency-relief valves. When there is a problem these valves open (by switching them 'off') causing the unit to be flushed and emptied.|$|R
50|$|Directional {{control valves}} are usually {{designed}} to be stackable, with one valve for each hydraulic cylinder, and one fluid input <b>supplying</b> all the <b>valves</b> in the stack.|$|R
50|$|Operation {{required}} several valves; {{when the}} reservoir was empty {{at the start}} of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet. This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.|$|E

Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship.|$|E
