Throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, the school's Attendance figures rivalled those of schools in more affluent areas of the city. In addition to operating a conventional prefect system where older pupils <b>supervised</b> <b>areas</b> at break and lunchtimes, the school also instigated an 'Adopt a Zone' initiative in which every form looked after an area of the school building, keeping corridors tidy and safe and ensuring that plants were watered and display boards undamaged.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} with radiation sources and facilities is {{the protection of}} both radiation workers and the general public. The biological shields of the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory of the Radiation Protection Institute (RPI) Ghana had been evaluated for a collimated isotropic cesium- 137 source for calibration purpose using MCNP 5 code. The dose rate at <b>supervised</b> <b>areas</b> ranged from 0. 57 to 8. 35 :Sv/h and 0. 26 to 10. 22 :Sv/h at control areas when the source was panoramic. When the source was collimated, the dose rate ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 30 :Sv/h at <b>supervised</b> <b>areas</b> and 0. 23 to 8. 88 :Sv/h at control areas for 22. 2 GBq of the cesium- 137 source. The scatter contribution from the surfaces of the walls and roofs were also accounted for. The scatter radiation in the room decreased to 400 :Sv/h when the source was first collimated and to 3. 5 :Sv/h when the source was further collimated. These results agreed quite well with experimental measurement. To effectively protect the staff, a narrow beam of 1. 2 cm diameter which was defined at 1. 0 m by the total surface of the ISO slab phantom was recommended to reduce the dose rate to less than 1. 5 :Sv/h outside the calibration bunker even when the current activity is doubled. It was concluded that the 4. 7 cm diameter of the existing narrow beam should be decreased to 1. 2 cm by further collimation of the beam...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the shielding designs of a 6 MeV x-ray linear accelerator scanner used for cargo-container scanning at the port of Tema in Ghana. Workload of the facility had increased significantly over time necessitating review of the installed shielding. There had been introduction of x-ray unit with higher energy (from 5 MeV to 6 MeV) increasing absorbed dose per scan. The number of scans per day had increased from an average of 60 to 95 scans. New structures had been built around the facility without particular attention to their distances and orientations with respect to the radiation source. The principle that the product of the weekly time average dose rates (Rw) and the occupancy for a particular point of interest (location) should not exceed the design dose limit, P (i. e. P ≥ RwT) for that location was partly used to determine the adequacy of the shielding afforded by the barriers. In addition to P ≥ RwT, calculated and measured hourly time average dose rates (Rh) were used to establish the adequacy of the shieldings based on the dose limit of 0. 5 µSv/h for public and <b>supervised</b> <b>areas</b> (uncontrolled areas). The Rw, calculated Rh and measured Rh all fell below the dose limit showing that the primary and secondary barriers are adequate...|$|E

Accurate event detection as well as reliable and real time transmission is basic needs of a good WSNs. This paper describes a survey on event detection and event transmission protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks. Classification of protocols are based on mainly two types i. e. sink centric event detection and transmission protocols and node centric event detection and transmission protocols. Paper also consists of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each protocol. Finally the paper concludes with the comparison of each protocol with different parameters.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) {{have been adopted}} {{in a wide range}} of {{industrial}} and consumer applications to perform various monitoring tasks such as search, rescue, disaster relief, target tracking and smart environments control.

Node localization is required to gain spatial awareness of the <b>supervised</b> <b>area.</b> In this work a simultaneous localization and routing algorithm is proposed. The localization is obtained by a ranging technique, exploiting network topology provided by the routing algorithm to reduce the network signaling communication, which is the most power-consuming operation in WSN, as much as possible. To this end, Shadow Edges, a novel class of links, is considered to take into account the lack of communication among nodes...|$|R

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) can be {{typically used}} to achieve continuous monitoring (CM) or event detection inside the <b>supervised</b> <b>area.</b> In CM applications, each sensor node transmits periodically its sensed {{data to the}} sink node, while in event-detection driven (EDD) applications, once an event occurs, it is reported to the sink node. Hence, CM applications entail much higher energy consumption since all nodes are actively transmitting information much longer than typical EDD applications. Furthermore, in highly dense WSNs, the energy consumption is even higher. As such, the use of autonomous devices that provide a constant energy supply is becoming relevant for these environments. In this work, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the electromagnetic waves found in the radio-electric spectrum in order to supply the energy to each node in the network. To this end, the antenna and the storage and amplifications system for such device are designed. Additionally, the performance of dense CM WSN is studied using a Markov chain in order to calculate the lifetime of the system.|$|R
