Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E

5|$|Frank Fetter {{was born}} in Peru, Indiana to a Quaker family {{during the height of}} the American Civil War. Fetter proved an able <b>student</b> <b>as</b> a youth, as {{demonstrated}} by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 when he was only sixteen years old. At Indiana, he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Fetter was on track to graduate with the class of 1883, but left college to run his family's bookstore upon news of his father's declining health. Working in the bookstore offered an opportunity for the young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative. Chief among the intellectual influences Fetter encountered at this time was Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879).|$|E

However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school <b>student</b> <b>as</b> a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comUntil recently, most clinical teachers and medical students have regarded using medical <b>students</b> <b>as</b> surrogate patients for peer teaching of physical examinations and clinical skills as practical and uncontroversial. Recent changes to medical curricula and changes in hospitalized patient populations have led to questions about the ethical acceptability of this practice. This paper explores the ethical issues inherent {{in the use of}} medical <b>students</b> <b>as</b> surrogate patients. It suggests that, ethically, there are parallels with two situations: when students conduct physical examinations on patients and when <b>students</b> participate <b>as</b> subjects in research. Drawing on accepted ethical practice in these two germane areas, the paper argues that there are both ethical strengths and weaknesses in the practice of using <b>students</b> <b>as</b> surrogate patients. Strategies to promote free and informed involvement of <b>students</b> <b>as</b> surrogate patients are suggested. Braunack-Mayer, A. J...|$|R

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that the presence of violent objects such as a gun can trigger aggression.

They were then led to believe they were delivering electric shocks to another <b>student,</b> <b>as</b> in the Milgram experiment. Those who had been in the presence of the gun administered more shocks. It is possible that a violence-related stimulus increases the likelihood of aggressive cognitions by activating the semantic network.|$|E
