5|$|In November 2003, {{two years}} after Adams's death and 23 years after the {{production}} on the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Phase</b> had ceased, a new radio adaptation of Adams' unadapted novel Life, the Universe and Everything was announced. This would become the third series of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on radio. Dirk Maggs, a friend of Adams, was chosen to create, direct and co-produce the adaptations. Maggs had previously consulted with Adams on potential radio adaptations for the final three books in 1993 and 1997. The project was restarted in September 2001 by Maggs, Helen Chattwell and Bruce Hyman, with help from Jane Belson and Ed Victor.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a <b>secondary</b> <b>phase</b> of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|E

40|$|The {{corrosion}} of the UAl-Al research reactorfuel type in synthetic MgCl 2 -rich brine (static batch-type experiments) {{was investigated}} {{with respect to}} the longtermsafety of directly disposed research reactor fuel elements in salt formations. During corrosion, crystalline <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> were formed, which may serve as a barrier against radionuclide migration. For an optimized identification and quantification of the <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> using Xray diffraction, a sample treatment to separate and enrich the <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> is necessary. A grain size fractionation was carried out in iso-propanol. A chemical composition and phase characterization of the <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> was accomplished.

The separation and enrichment of <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> were carried out reproducible and successfully. Due to the phase characterization by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction the following <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> were unambiguously identified: Mg-Al-Cl layered double hydroxide, lesukite, Fe layered double hydroxide (green rust), lawrencite, Fe (elemental), and traces of uncorroded fuel (UAl 4). The quantitative analysis showed that LDH compounds and lesukite are the major crystalline phases. All other observed compounds were only present in trace amounts, i. e. constituting accessories.

25|$|Some samples {{contained}} {{a small amount}} of metallic melt (less than 0.5%), composed of silver and indium (from the control rods). A <b>secondary</b> <b>phase</b> composed of chromium(III) oxide was found in one of the samples. Some metallic inclusions contained silver but not indium, suggesting a sufficiently high temperature to cause volatilization of both cadmium and indium. Almost all metallic components, with the exception of silver, were fully oxidized; however even silver was oxidized in some regions. The inclusion of iron and chromium rich regions probably originate from a molten nozzle that did not have enough time to be distributed through the melt.|$|E

25|$|The {{adaptation}} of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series {{in comparison to the}} second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in a different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly Harmless are now foreshadowed in the {{adaptation of}} So Long and Thanks For All The Fish, while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Phase.</b> While Mostly Harmless originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.|$|E

With the arrival of the Beaker peoples around 2200 BCE, the local culture entered a new period of development that mixed the Beaker people burial rites, while maintaining other traditions. It is likely that the Beaker people's presence within this region also resulted in <b>secondary</b> <b>phase</b> of development of this culture. The inter-cultural exchanges between groups were more frequent, and their influence spread to distances of 1000 kilometres or greater, {{as was the case with}} the Treilles, in the French Languedoc.

After 1900 BCE there is a decentralization in the Iberian peninsula, resulting in a dispersion of many of theses artifacts to as far as Bohemia.|$|E

Reinforced by paratroopers, the French and their Vietnamese allies tightened a net around the defending Viet Minh, but delays in the movement of French forces left gaps through which most of the Viet Minh guerillas, and many of the arms caches the operation was expected to seize, escaped. For the French, this validated the claim {{that it was impossible to}} operate tight ensnaring operations in Vietnam's jungle, due to the slow movement of their troops, and a foreknowledge by the enemy, which was difficult to prevent. From then on, the French focused on creating strong fortified positions, against which Viet Minh General Giáp could pit his forces, culminating in Operation Castor and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermal crack {{initiation}} and pitting corrosion are frequently {{caused by the}} formation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> such as sigma phase, delta-ferrite <b>phase,</b> carbides and <b>secondary</b> austenite <b>phase</b> in steel. Traditionally, heat treatment is used to minimize these detrimental effects of the <b>secondary</b> <b>phases.</b> In this study, we have applied pulse to the 316 L stainless steel and observed the considerable effects. In comparison to the heat treatment, the electropulsing can effectively suppress the precipitation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> in a temperature range (1161 K– 1173 K). Austenite grain size becomes larger under electropulsing compared to the heat treatment at annealing temperatures due to enhanced interface migration. The kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of electropulsing can be used to explain the effects of electropulsing on the evolution of microstructure for 316 L stainless steel. 1...|$|R

Common phases include ZnS, SnS, CuS, and Cu2SnS3.

Detailed study of <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> can be done using different approaches, based on microscopic, microstructural and microchemical analyses, as well as mineralogical methods. In the present study are reported {{the results of the}} application of punctual mineralogical analysis by synchrotron through-the-substrate microdiffraction (tts-μXRD) to analyse <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> precipitated in ancient pottery (Bronze Age pottery form Frattesina in Italy and Mesolithic pottery form Al Khiday in Sudan). Although the chemical composition of these <b>secondary</b> <b>phases</b> in many cases almost matches with the stoichiometric composition of a known mineral, only some of them were actually true mineral phases (i.e. with crystallinity and therefore showing diffraction peaks), while others were amorphous. Some phases, the occurrence of which was previously attested only {{on the basis of their}} chemical composition (determined by scanning electron microscope or the electron microprobe analysis), were univocally identified as true vivianite (Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O) and crandallite (CaAl 3 (PO 4) 2 (OH) 5 ·H 2 O) minerals.
