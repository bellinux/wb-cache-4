40|$|The {{regulatory}} systems controlling {{expression of the}} ctxAB genes encoding cholera toxin (CT) in the classical and El Tor biotypes of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae have been characterized and found to be almost identical. Notwithstanding this, special in vitro conditions, called AKI conditions, are required for El Tor bacteria to produce CT. The AKI conditions involve biphasic cultures. In phase 1 the organism is grown in a <b>still</b> <b>tube</b> for 4 h. In phase 2 the medium is poured into a flask to continue growth with shaking. Virtually no expression of CT occurs if this protocol is not followed. Here we demonstrated that CT expression takes place in single-phase still cultures if the volume-to-surface-area ratio is decreased, both under air and under an inert atmosphere. The expression of key genes involved in the regulation of CT production was analyzed, {{and we found that}} the expression pattern closely resembles the in vivo expression pattern...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{refers to}} the {{characterization}} of API 5 L-X 80 pipeline joints welded with self-shielded flux cored wire. This process was evaluated under preheating conditions, with an uniform and steady hear input. All joints were welded in flat position (IG), with the pipe turning and the torch <b>still.</b> <b>Tube</b> dimensions were 762 mm in external diameter and 16 mm in thickness. Welds were applied on single V-groove, with six weld beads, along with three levels of preheating temperatures (room temperature, 100 degreesC, 160 degreesC). These temperatures were maintained as interpass temperature. The filter metal E 71 T 8 -K 6 with mechanical properties different from parent metal was used in undermatched conditions. The weld characterization is presented according to the mechanical test results of tensile strength, hardness and impact test. The mechanical tests were conducted according to API 1104, AWS and ASTM standards. API 1104 and API 51 were used as screening criteria. According to the results obtained, {{it was possible to}} remark that it is appropriate to weld API 5 L-X 80 steel ducts with Self-shielded Flux Cored wires, in conformance to the API standards and no preheat temperature is necessary...|$|E

50|$|The product {{must now}} be cooled and this is usually {{achieved}} by pulling the extrudate through a water bath. Plastics are very good thermal insulators and are therefore difficult to cool quickly. Compared to steel, plastic conducts its heat away 2,000 times more slowly.

50|$|Most commercially {{manufactured}} {{one to two}} kilowatt linear amplifiers used in amateur radio <b>still</b> use vacuum <b>tubes</b> (valves) and {{can provide}} 10 to 20 times RF power amplification (10 to 13 dB). For example, a transmitter driving the input with 100 watts will be amplified to 2000 watts (2 kW) output to the antenna. Solid state linear amplifiers are more commonly in the 500 watt range and can be driven by as little as 25 watts.|$|R
5000|$|As {{technology}} in amplification has progressed, harmonica players have introduced other effects units to their rigs as well, such as reverb, tremolo, delay, octave, additional overdrive pedals, and chorus effect. John Popper of Blues Traveler uses a customized microphone that encapsulates {{several of these}} effects into one handheld unit, as opposed to several units in sequence. Many harmonica players <b>still</b> prefer <b>tube</b> amplifiers to solid-state, owing to the perceived difference in tone generated by the vacuum tubes.

Many amplifiers designed for electric guitar are also used by harmonica players, such as the Kalamazoo Model Two, Fender Bassman, and the Danelectro Commando. Some expensive, handmade boutique amplifiers, however, are built {{from the ground up}} with characteristics that are optimal for amplified harmonica.|$|R

40|$|The {{productivity}} of the solar still {{is determined by the}} temperature of water in the basin and the glass temperature. Various active methods have been adopted to increase the temperature of the basin, so as to improve the {{productivity of}} solar still. Most of the previous research works have been focusing on flat plate collector and concentrating collector. In this experimental study, a single slope solar still directly augmented with evacuated tubes was used to increase the daily productivity by reducing heat losses. Evacuated tubes were directly coupled to the lower side of the single slope solar still with an area of 1 m 2. Black gravel is used to increase the productivity by means of reducing quantity of water in the basin. Extensive experiments were conducted to explore the performance of solar still in several modes namely still alone, still with black stones, <b>still</b> with evacuated <b>tubes,</b> and <b>still</b> with evacuated <b>tubes</b> and black gravel. The experimental setup was designed and installed at Solar Energy Park, Tamilnadu College of Engineering, Coimbatore (77 ˚E, 11 ˚N), Tamilnadu, India.
