40|$|Using MIL-HDBK- 419 A, MATLAB and Nomographs, Shielding Effectiveness for the Magnetic Field, Electric Field, and Plane Wave were {{calculated}} over a frequency range from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. The three <b>shielding</b> <b>tapes</b> used included superalloy, aluminum, and mumetal. Calculations for Shielding Effectiveness involve the computation of Absorption Loss, Reflection Loss, and Re-Reflection Correction Factor. From {{the outcome of}} the calculations, it was suitable to conclude that all three metals fulfill the 40 dB Shielding Effectiveness requirements for SGEMP fields for frequencies greater or equal to 1 MHz. Accordingly, all three <b>shielding</b> <b>tapes</b> provide at least 40 dB of shielding to protect certain frequencies against SGEMP Magnetic Field. However, results vary for frequencies below 1 MHz...|$|R
50|$|América de Cali {{is known}} as The Red Devils because the shield of the team sports a devil, with horns, tail and trident, which lead to some players masking their own <b>shield</b> with <b>tape</b> to {{overcome}} the curse, apparently to no avail. During Gabriel Ochoa's twelve-year tenure as coach, the crest {{was removed from the}} uniform for personal religious reasons and, after returning to the uniforms, it was removed again in 1992. In 2010 the crest with the devil was revived and the team went into severe financial problems that moved the Colombian football authorities to ask the team to pay its debts if they wanted to play during the 2011 season.|$|R

50|$|A {{young girl}} who was {{attacked}} by an unknown assailant in 1975 comes forward and claims that an E-Fit printed in a local newspaper {{is similar to that}} of her attacker. Although initially dismissed by her local police, the girl's mother refuses to let the matter drop, and demands to speak to the original investigating officer, Hobson. Meanwhile, the police receive two letters pertaining to be from the 'Ripper'. Although initially dismissed by Oldfield and his team, the murder of 42-year-old Vera Millward throws the validity of the letters into question as it appears that details of Vera's murder were suggested before the murder took place. Later, Oldfield receives a package in the post containing a tape perpetrating to be an audio recording of the killer. He initially decides to <b>shield</b> the <b>tape</b> from the press, in order to pursue discreet enquiries in the hope of identify the killer through vocal recognition. But when news of the tape is mysteriously leaked to the press, Oldfield is outraged and accuses Hobson.|$|R
40|$|Magnetisation loss is an {{important}} factor in the design of superconducting transformers and motors. In these devices the tapes are usually placed face-to-face. Then the magnetisation loss is influenced by the mutual magnetic <b>shielding</b> between adjacent <b>tapes.</b> The <b>shielding</b> is investigated by measuring the magnetisation loss in stacks with various numbers of Bi- 2223 tapes, exposed to a 48 -Hz perpendicular magnetic field at 77 K. In a stack the penetration field is increased and the magnetisation loss below penetration is greatly decreased, compared to the behaviour of a single tape. The loss at high magnetic-field amplitudes is unaffected. The measured loss is compared to the loss calculated with two different models. The effect of shielding is qualitatively well described with an analytical model. However, predictions made with a numerical model display a better quantitative agreement with the measurement results...|$|R
40|$|The authors designed, {{implemented}} and tested cryogenic RF filters with zero DC resistance, based on wires with a superconducting core inside a resistive sheath. The superconducting core allows low frequency currents to pass with negligible dissipation. Signals above the cutoff frequency are dissipated in the resistive {{part due to}} their small skin depth. The filters consist of twisted wire pairs <b>shielded</b> with copper <b>tape.</b> Above approximately 1 GHz, the attenuation is exponential in {radical}{omega}, as typical for skin depth based RF filters. By using additional capacitors of 10 nF per line, an attenuation of at least 45 dB above 10 MHz can be obtained. Thus, one single filter stage kept at mixing chamber temperature in a dilution refrigerator is sufficient to attenuate room temperature black body radiation to levels corresponding to 10 mK above about 10 MHz...|$|R
40|$|Increase of {{data density}} on tape systems {{requires}} reduced read gaps (< 0. 4 #mu#m), sensors with lower magnetic thickness (< 100 A), and smaller track width (< 10 #mu#m). Spin-valve sensors offer higher output, lower sensing current and lower magnetic thickness {{when compared with}} anisotropic magnetoresistance sensors, which makes them good candidates for high-density tape applications. This work consists on the fabrication of <b>shielded</b> spin-valve <b>tape</b> heads, starting with blank ceramic substrates (A 1 TiC) and ending with the characterization of prototypes on 1 / 2 " (12. 7 mm) DLT-IV tape at high linear densities (170 kfci or 5503 frmm). Heads were fabricated with 5 - 9 #mu#m track width, 0, 5 - 1, 9 #mu#m height, and 0, 35 - 0, 51 #mu#m gap length, using inverted (NiO) and non-inverted (TbCo, MnRh) spin-valves. The procedures for the wafer-level sensor fabrication and for micromachining the tape contact surface are discussed. Signal amplitudes up to 1. 6 mVpp/#mu#m are measured for isolated pulses. The high-density output - up to 115 #mu#Vpp measured at 170 kfci (5503 frmm) - is compared with a linear model. Low-density waveforms show a 16 % asymmetry, also evidenced in MFM images of the recorded tape, which is attributed to the thick mediaAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{successfully}} constructed a 200 m high temperature superconducting (HTS) cable test facility for DC transmission in 2010. This coaxial power cable {{is composed of}} two superconducting (SC) conductors of DI-BSCCO tapes spirally surrounding a copper former. The tapes are arranged closely to make the magnetic field lines surrounding the cable uniformly. The number of tapes in each conductor is different because of their different radii. Previously, wehaveinvestigated the dependenceof critical current(Ic) onthegap betweenthe tapesin orderto optimizethe cable configuration for DC transmission. This paper report the investigation of Ic distributionsin the multi-layer conductors which consistof 2, 3 and 4 tapes with a tape-on-tape structure by setting currents in each tape separately. The Ic measurement is performed with four probe method at 77 K. The Ics of the tapes in the different structures are measured and {{compared with that of}} the single one. The enhancement and degradation of Ic are observed due to magnetic field interaction and magnetic <b>shielding</b> between the <b>tapes</b> in the multi-layer conductors. We will present the experimental results and show the dependence of the Ic distribution in the multi-layer conductors on the structures and transport currents in the neighboring tapes...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for calculating the AC losses of {{a stack of}} second-generation high temperature superconductor tapes. This model takes {{as a starting point}} the model of Clem and co-workers for a stack in which each tape carries the same current. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the magnetic flux lines lie parallel to the tapes within the part of the stack where the flux has not penetrated. In this paper we allow for the depth of penetration of field to vary across the stack, and use the Kim model to allow for the variation of Jc with B. The model is applied to the cases of a transport current and an applied field. For a transport current the calculated result differs from the Norris expression for a single tape carrying a uniform current and it does not seem possible to define a suitable average Jc which could be used. Our method also gives a more accurate value for the critical current of the stack than other methods. For an applied field the stack behaves as a solid superconductor with the Jc averaged locally over several tapes, but still allowed to vary throughout the stack on a larger scale. For up to about ten tapes the losses rise rapidly with the number of tapes, but in thicker stacks the <b>tapes</b> <b>shield</b> each other and the losses become that of a slab with a field parallel to the faces...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} signal propagation characteristics of shielded power cables, including attenuation, electromagnetic propagation velocity, and characteristic impedance, are determined mainly by the dielectric properties of cable insulation and semiconductive shields, {{as well as}} the metallic sheath structure. High frequency attenuation in two transmission class XLPE cables with differing ground structures is studied by computation and measurement. High {{frequency signal}} propagation in <b>tape</b> <b>shield</b> power cables is related to the conduction of the tape laps as the corrosion thereof forces sheath current to spiral down the tape. Computations and measurements have been conducted to study high frequency signal propagation characteristics in such cable as a function of fraction of spiraling sheath current and cable material properties. ^ Optimization of partial discharge (PD) detection technology based on historical evolution of key technologies is investigated with the conclusion that a fully digital is presently practical for a bandwidth in the range of 20 MHz which will increase to 100 MHz within a few years. ^ Three dimensional finite element analysis is applied to calculate PD magnitude as a function of discharge characteristics in a complex object, in this case, a separable connector. The PD magnitude is estimated from the product of the change of capacitance when discharge occurs and the partial discharge extinction voltage (PDEV). The calculated PD magnitude is compared with measurements for a controlled 2 ̆ 2 defect 2 ̆ 2 in a separable connector. ...|$|R
