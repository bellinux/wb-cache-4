In this paper, the failure mechanism of <b>square</b> <b>elbow</b> was investigated by using electron microscopy (OM), electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The research {{results show that the}} elbow products failed due to its low impact toughness after carburizing and quenching. The erosion angle is nearly ninety-degree. By increasing the tempering temperature, reducing the surface hardness and improving toughness, the serious erosion phenomenon can be effectively avoided. There are two main reasons of the elbow products burst. One reason is the high inclusion content of the material. The other is the low impact toughness. Raising the quality specification of materials can appropriate increase the low impact toughness after heat treatment. It is pointed out that the product would be more safety by improve its impact toughness...|$|R

40|$|Various {{alternatives}} of high pressure-system geometry including <b>square</b> <b>elbows</b> and prolongation {{of liquid}} waveguide were elaborated {{to be able}} to simulate real tools used to generate high-speed water jets. Variable geometrical parameters of the model were selected and the computational model was prepared {{in such a way that}} the geometry and meshing of the model is generated automatically after entering the parameters. This approach facilitates and speeds up preparation of models for simulation of propagation of pressure pulsations in high-pressure system for generation of pulsating water jets. The paper presents results of simulation of propagation of pressure pulsations through various geometries of the high-pressure system...|$|R
60|$|The captain <b>squared</b> his <b>elbows,</b> and, {{for a few}} seconds, {{nothing was}} heard but his stertorous {{breathing}} and the scratching of the pen; then a muttered execration, and Captain Fazackerly put down his pen with a woe-begone air.|$|R
60|$|Supplied {{with this}} fluid, which having been made too thick {{required}} {{a good deal}} of water to thin it, Tottie again <b>squared</b> her <b>elbows</b> on the table; the parents sat down, and the Bu'ster re-mounted guard with the blotting-paper, this time carefully out of earshot.|$|R
60|$|Later, {{when they}} were {{surveying}} the long dinner tables at the table d'hote with something of the uncomfortable and shamefaced loneliness of the provincial, Phoebe uttered a slight cry and clutched her father's arm. Mr. Hopkins stayed the play of his <b>squared</b> <b>elbows</b> and glanced inquiringly at his daughter's face. There was a pretty animation in it, as {{she pointed to a}} figure that had just entered. It was that of a young man attired in the extravagance rather than the taste of the prevailing fashion, which did not, however, in the least conceal a decided rusticity of limb and movement. A long mustache, which looked unkempt, even in its pomatumed stiffness, and lank, dark hair that had bent but never curled under the barber's iron, made him notable even in that heterogeneous assembly.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{results for}} numerical predictions of air flow and pressure {{distribution in two}} commonly used elbows: (1) 90 ° mitered duct elbows with turning vanes having 0. 05 m radius, 0. 038 m vane spacing and (2) 90 ° mitered duct elbows without turning vanes, in 0. 2 × 0. 2  m (8  in. × 8  in.) duct cross section using the STAR-CD computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. A k-ε turbulence model for high Reynolds number and k-ε Chen model were used for that purpose for comparative purposes. The simulation used 13 different Reynolds numbers chosen between the range of 1 × 105 and 2 × 106. To validate the CFD results, the results of two experimental papers using guided vanes were compared with simulated vane runs under the same condition. The first experimental study used a 0. 6 × 0. 6  m (24  in. × 24  in.) <b>square</b> <b>elbow</b> with 0. 05 m radius, 0. 038 m vane spacing and air velocities at 2. 54 m/s (500 fpm) and 25. 4 m/s (5, 000 fpm), the second experiment used a 0. 81 × 0. 2  m (32  in. × 8  in.) rectangular elbow geometry with 0. 05 m radius, 0. 038 m vane spacing with air velocities from 10. 16 m/s (2, 000 fpm) to 13. 97 m/s (2, 750 fpm). For Reynolds numbers (1. 00 – 2. 00) × 105 the pressure drop difference between vaned and unvaned elbows {{was found to be}} 35 Pa as compared to 145 Pa. The simulations also agreed reasonably well with published experimental results. For the 0. 6 × 0. 6  m (24  in. × 24  in.) <b>square</b> <b>elbow</b> and 0. 81 × 0. 2  m (32  in. × 8  in.) rectangular elbow with vanes, the difference in pressure drop was 3. 9 and 4. 1 % respectively and indicates that CFD models can be used for predictive purposes in this important HVAC applications area...|$|R

"Very well," [...] said Tottie, dipping her pen in the ink-bottle, {{which was}} a stone one, and had been {{borrowed}} from a neighbour {{who was supposed to}} have literary tendencies in consequence of his keeping such an article in his cottage. <b>Squaring</b> her <b>elbows,</b> and putting her head very much on one side, to the admiration of her parents, she prepared to write.|$|R

6000|$|A sheet was {{procured}} from a neighbouring tobacconist.

60|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the fact that}} <b>squaring</b> the <b>elbows</b> and clenching the fists are gestures by no means universal with the men of all races, when they feel indignant and are prepared to attack their enemy, so it appears that a helpless or apologetic frame of mind is expressed {{in many parts of the}} world by merely shrugging the shoulders, without turning inwards the elbows and opening the hands. The man or child who is obstinate, or one who is resigned to some great misfortune, has in neither case any idea of resistance by active means; and he expresses this state of mind, by simply keeping his shoulders raised; or he may possibly fold his arms across his breast.|$|R

60|$|The brandy-and-water luke, and the inkstand, {{having been}} carried {{into the little}} parlour, and the young lady having {{carefully}} flattened down the coals to prevent their blazing, and carried away the poker to preclude {{the possibility of the}} fire being stirred, without the full privity and concurrence of the Blue Boar being first had and obtained, Sam Weller sat himself down in a box near the stove, and pulled out the sheet of gilt-edged letter-paper, and the hard-nibbed pen. Then looking carefully at the pen to see that there were no hairs in it, and dusting down the table, so that there might be no crumbs of bread under the paper, Sam tucked up the cuffs of his coat, <b>squared</b> his <b>elbows,</b> and composed himself to write.|$|R

60|$|Archie {{was not a}} {{man with}} a wide visiting-list among people with families, and it was so long since he had seen a growing boy in action at the table that he had {{forgotten}} what sixteen is capable of doing with a knife and fork, when it really <b>squares</b> its <b>elbows,</b> takes a deep breath, and gets going. The spectacle which he witnessed was consequently at first a little unnerving. The long boy's idea of trifling with a meal appeared to be to swallow it whole and reach out for more. He ate like a starving Eskimo. Archie, in the time he had spent in the trenches making the world safe for the working-man to strike in, had occasionally been quite peckish, but he sat dazed before this majestic hunger. This was real eating.|$|R
60|$|No word, good or bad, did Mrs Boffin say; but she tenderly {{took care}} of Bella, and glanced at her husband as if for orders.

60|$|To this ignominious {{avenue of}} approach, Mr. Crisparkle repaired, {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} a short, squat omnibus, with a disproportionate heap of luggage on the roof—like a little Elephant with infinitely too much Castle—which was then the daily service between Cloisterham and external mankind. As this vehicle lumbered up, Mr. Crisparkle could hardly see anything else of it for a large outside passenger seated on the box, with his <b>elbows</b> <b>squared,</b> and his hands on his knees, compressing the driver into a most uncomfortably small compass, and glowering about him with a strongly-marked face.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} created to address an {{important}} issue currently faced by test facilities measuring static pressure for air-conditioning and heat pumps. Specifically, ASHRAE Standard 37, the industry standard for test setup, requires an outlet duct of a certain length, based on the unit outlet geometry, and this ducting added to the unit height {{may result in a}} test apparatus height that exceeds psychometric test room dimensions. This project attempted to alter the outlet duct in a way that reduces the test apparatus height while maintaining the reliability of the ASHRAE Standard 37 testing setup. The investigation was done in two scenarios, the first, which altered the direction of the flow after the unit with an elbow and measured static pressure downstream of the elbow, and the second which inserted a passive resistive piece in the flow to decrease the required distance between the unit and the static pressure measurement. Three air handling units were used in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 testing, with the two smallest units additionally being tested in Scenario 1 with an over-sized duct. The scenario tests were required to be within 5 % power and 2. 5 % airflow of a baseline test following ASHRAE Standard 37. he results for Scenario 1 have shown that ASHRAE Standard 37 can be modified to reduce testing height restrictions by using a <b>square</b> <b>elbow</b> with turning vanes, provided it is oriented in a specific way in relation to the blower. Furthermore, additional Scenario 1 testing on the over-sized outlet duct shows that possibilities exist for using a single over-sized duct to successfully meet ASHRAE Standard 37 testing conditions when testing a variety of units. Finally, the results of Scenario 2 have shown that the height constraints of the outlet duct can be reduced by installing a passive resistive device consisting of a mesh at the outlet; however, this approach applies only to those units with the heat exchanger located downstream of the blower. As a result of specific issues or problems that were encountered during the project that were beyond the scope, eleven case studies were presented and recommended for future work...|$|R
60|$|The big {{carryall}} appeared, and, {{with much}} creaking and swaying Mrs. Kipp was {{got into the}} back seat, where the big bonnet gloomed like a thunder-cloud. Polly, in a high state of indignation, which only made her look ten times prettier, sat in front with Toady, who was a sight to see as he drove off with his short legs planted against the boot, his <b>elbows</b> <b>squared,</b> and the big whip scientifically cracking now and then. Away they went, leaving poor Mrs. Snow to bewail herself dismally after she had smiled and nodded them out of sight.|$|R
60|$|In {{reply to}} the last interrogation, the small servant, {{with a look of}} {{infinite}} cunning mingled with fear, screwed up her mouth very tight and round, and nodded violently. Whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp, or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason; or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance; certain it is, that he planted his <b>elbows</b> <b>square</b> and firmly on the desk, and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands, looked at her fixedly.|$|R
60|$|A special {{contrast}} Mr. George {{makes to}} the Smallweed family. Trooper was never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him. It is a broadsword to an oyster-knife. His developed figure and their stunted forms, his large manner filling {{any amount of}} room and their little narrow pinched ways, his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones, are in the strongest and the strangest opposition. As {{he sits in the}} middle of the grim parlour, leaning a little forward, with his hands upon his thighs and his <b>elbows</b> <b>squared,</b> he looks as though, if he remained there long, he would absorb into himself the whole family and the whole four-roomed house, extra little back-kitchen and all.|$|R
60|$|It {{would seem}} that Jacopo had his instructions, for no sooner did he make sure that Don Camillo had retired, than he {{threaded}} the throng with {{the air of a}} man whose course was decided. By this time, both the squares were full, and at least half of those who spent the night in those places of amusement, were masked. The step of the Bravo, though so unhesitating, was leisurely, and he found time, in passing up the Piazzetta, to examine the forms, and, when circumstances permitted, the features of all he met. He proceeded, in this manner, to the point of junction between the two <b>squares,</b> when his <b>elbow</b> was touched by a light hand.|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. Barker, though inexperienced in love, {{was a good}} fighter. The best of the sex are.

And I have yet to learn {{what you mean by}} talking about a rendezvous! And I want to know," [...] she continued, suddenly stopping her rocking and tilting the rockers impertinently behind her, as, with her <b>elbows</b> <b>squared</b> on the chair arms, she tilted her own face defiantly up into Mrs. Horncastle's, [...] "how a woman in your position--who doesn't live with her husband--dares to talk to ME!" ...|$|R
60|$|Babalatchi ceased speaking. Lingard {{shifted his}} feet a little, uncrossed his arms, {{and shook his}} head slowly.

With the palms of his hands on his knees, his <b>elbows</b> <b>squared</b> out, he looked down on Babalatchi who sat in a stiff attitude, inexpressive and mute as a talking doll the mechanism of which had at length run down.|$|R
6000|$|The {{above is}} a rough summary of this momentous conversation, in which I have been chiefly careful to {{preserve}} the plums of the Commissary; but {{the remainder of the}} scene, perhaps because of his rising anger, has left but little definite in the memory of the Arethusa. The Commissary was not, I think, a practiced literary man; no sooner, at least, had he taken pen in hand and embarked on the composition of the procès-verbal, than he became distinctly more uncivil, and began to show a predilection for that simplest of all forms of repartee: [...] "You lie." [...] Several times the Arethusa let it pass, and then suddenly flared up, refused to accept more insults or to answer further questions, defied the Commissary to do his worst, and promised him, if he did, that he should bitterly repent it. Perhaps if he had worn this proud front from the first, instead of beginning with a sense of entertainment and then going on to argue, the thing might have turned otherwise; for even at this eleventh hour the Commissary was visibly staggered. But it was too late; he had been challenged; the procès-verbal was begun; and he again <b>squared</b> his <b>elbows</b> over his writing, and the Arethusa was led forth a prisoner.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the wide-open}} ears of Jacob his father's words {{sounded like a}} doom, giving an awful finish to the dirge-like effect of the whole announcement. His face had been {{gathering}} a wondering incredulous sorrow {{at the notion of}} Mordecai's going away: he was unable to imagine the change as anything lasting; but at the mention of [...] "hard times for Jacob" [...] there was no further suspense of feeling, and he broke forth in loud lamentation. Adelaide Rebekah always cried when her brother cried, and now began to howl with astonishing suddenness, whereupon baby awaking contributed angry screams, and required to be taken out of the cradle. A great deal of hushing was necessary, and Mordecai feeling the cries pierce him, put out his arms to Jacob, who {{in the midst of his}} tears and sobs was turning his head right and left for general observation. His father, who had been--saying, [...] "Never mind, old man; you shall go to the riders," [...] now released him, and he went to Mordecai, who clasped him, and laid his cheek on the little black head without speaking. But Cohen, sensible that the master of the family must make some apology for all this weakness, and that the occasion called for a speech, addressed Deronda with some elevation of pitch, <b>squaring</b> his <b>elbows</b> and resting a hand on each knee:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Not the {{slightest}} cause appeared for any apprehension in that quarter. Mrs. Wragge was {{seated at the}} table absorbed in the arrangement {{of a series of}} smart circulars and tempting price-lists, issued by advertising trades-people, and flung in at the cab-windows as they left the London terminus. [...] "I've often heard tell of light reading," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, restlessly shifting the positions of the circulars as a child restlessly shifts the position of a new set of toys. [...] "Here's light reading, printed in pretty colors. Here's all the Things I'm going to buy when I'm out shopping to-morrow. Lend us a pencil, please--you won't be angry, will you? I do so want to mark 'em off." [...] She looked up at Magdalen, chuckled joyfully over her own altered circumstances, and beat her great hands on the table in irrepressible delight. [...] "No cookery-book!" [...] cried Mrs. Wragge. [...] "No Buzzing in my head! no captain to shave to-morrow! I'm all down at heel; my cap's on one side; and nobody bawls at me. My heart alive, here is a holiday and no mistake!" [...] Her hands began to drum on the table louder than ever, until Magdalen quieted them by presenting her with a pencil. Mrs. Wragge instantly recovered her dignity, <b>squared</b> her <b>elbows</b> on the table, and plunged into imaginary shopping {{for the rest of the}} evening.|$|R
