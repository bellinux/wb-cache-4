50|$|Levitt Luzern Custer (July 27, 1888 - August 30, 1962) was the {{inventor}} of the <b>statoscope</b> and early motorized wheelchair, called the Custer chair.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Dayton, Ohio on July 27, 1888 to Levitt Ellsworth Custer. He {{graduated}} from Oberlin College in 1909 and then the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1913. His first patented invention was the <b>statoscope</b> which showed whether a aerostat was ascending or descending. Custer produced the device for the United States Navy at his factory, Custer Specialty Company, on North Ludlow Street in Dayton, Ohio. He invented a motorized wheelchair in 1919.|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} the rate-of-climb {{indicator}} is developed in a form adapted for application to the instrument in its present-day form. Compensations for altitude, temperature, and rate of change of temperature are discussed from the designer's standpoint {{on the basis of}} this theory. Certain dynamic effects, including instrument lag, and the use of the rate-of-climb indicator as a <b>statoscope</b> are also considered. Modern instruments are described. A laboratory test procedure is outlined and test results are given...|$|E
