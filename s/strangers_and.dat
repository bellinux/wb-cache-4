5|$|Two one-sheet posters for {{the film}} were {{released}} in August 2007, one showing the three masked <b>Strangers,</b> <b>and</b> the other displaying a wounded Liv Tyler. In April 2008, roughly {{two months before the}} film's official theatrical debut, the final, official one-sheet {{for the film}} was released, featuring Liv Tyler standing in a darkened kitchen with a masked man looming behind her in the shadows.|$|E
5|$|At a party {{thrown by}} himself and his wife Marge, Homer humiliates himself by getting drunk, telling off <b>strangers,</b> <b>and</b> leering at Maude Flanders' cleavage. The {{following}} day at church, Marge signs up for a weekend retreat of marriage counseling hosted by Reverend Lovejoy and his wife Helen. Homer finds out that the retreat {{will be held at}} Catfish Lake and packs his fishing equipment, despite Marge telling him that all they will be doing is resolving their differences. On the way to the retreat, Homer stops at a bait shop and learns of the legendary catfish General Sherman.|$|E

5|$|The {{living and}} {{economic}} activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements {{could have had}} over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes {{with no more than}} 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic people before them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from <b>strangers</b> <b>and</b> to avoid conflicts, especially along the limits of their tribal territories.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} <b>Strangers</b> <b>and</b> the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a {{shooting}} spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two <b>strangers</b> <b>and</b> wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, {{that he had not}} been sane {{at the time of the}} incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.|$|E

5|$|Labradors have a {{reputation}} as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source ("alarm barking"), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with <b>strangers</b> <b>and</b> therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.|$|E

25|$|Neapolitan Mastiffs, as a breed, are {{extremely}} intelligent dogs with {{a tendency to}} be independent thinkers.
