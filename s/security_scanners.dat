25|$|Hard X-rays can {{traverse}} relatively thick objects {{without being}} much absorbed or scattered. For this reason, X-rays {{are widely used}} to image the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical radiography and airport <b>security</b> <b>scanners,</b> but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. industrial radiography and industrial CT scanning) and research (e.g. small animal CT). The penetration depth varies with several orders of magnitude over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient transmission through the object {{and at the same}} time provide good contrast in the image.|$|E

40|$|Network <b>Security</b> <b>Scanner</b> (NSS) is a {{tool that}} allows {{auditing}} and monitoring remote network computers for possible vulnerabilities, checks your network for all potential methods that a hacker might use to attack it. Network <b>Security</b> <b>Scanner</b> is a complete networking utilities package that includes {{a wide range of}} tools for network security auditing, vulnerability Auditing, scanning, monitoring and more. Network <b>Security</b> <b>Scanner</b> (NSS) is an easy to use, intuitive network <b>security</b> <b>scanner</b> that can quickly scan and audit your network computers for vulnerabilities, exploits, and information enumerations. Vulnerability management is an on-going process that protects your valuable data and it is a key component of an effective information security strategy, which provides comprehensive, preemptive protection against threats to your enterprise security. N. S. S is built on an architecture that allows for high reliability and scalability that caters for both medium and large sized networks. NSS consists of six modules. They are Host Scanning, Port Scanning, Pinging, NSLookup, Vulnerability Auditing and Trace route. NSS also performs live host detection, operating system identification, SNMP Auditing. Finds rouge services and open TCP and UDP ports. The ability varies to perform scanning over the network identifying the live hosts and guess the operating system of the remote hosts and installed programs into the remote hosts. Apart identifying the live hosts we could map the ports and list the services which are running in the host...|$|R
