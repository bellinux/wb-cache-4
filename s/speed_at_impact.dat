500|$|Three {{investigators}} from the Department of Civil Aviation began {{work at the}} crash scene {{the day after the}} accident. They found the Amana had crashed in a heavily timbered area on the Inkpen family property Berry Brow, on the easterly track between Perth airport and Kalgoorlie, at a point where the elevation was about [...] above sea level. The aircraft struck the tops of tall gum trees while descending at an angle of about 15° below horizontal. Its <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> was estimated at [...] It crashed through large trees, breaking them off as if they were matchsticks, before impacting the ground violently and gouging a long, wide furrow. The left wing was torn away from the fuselage and then the aircraft broke up and burst into flames. Only the rear fuselage with the fin and rudder were not affected by fire. The wreckage trail was about [...] long and [...] wide. At the time of impact the Amana's left wing was lower than its right, suggesting it may have been turning left. It was heading north, not east towards Cunderdin. Investigators speculated that the crew may have been turning with the intention of returning to Perth airport; or they may have been preparing for a crash-landing in a large clear area {{to the north of the}} crash site.|$|E

The downswing is at a slightly shallower angle and therefore the arms and hands should come from the inside-out on the downswing.

50|$|Shaft flex {{has a very}} {{pronounced}} effect on the power and accuracy of a wood. Every wood {{is somewhere in between}} the two extremes of flex, from the extra whippy, to the extra stiff. Whippy shafts are used by those who have low swing speeds and stiff by those who have faster swing speeds. The flex of a shaft allows it to store energy from a player's downswing, and release it as the head makes contact for increased club <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> A shaft that is too stiff cannot be flexed by the golfer during their downswing, which reduces club <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> A shaft that is too whippy will retain some of its stored flex at contact, wasting energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} was {{hampered by the}} lack of data recorder evidence and the official report was not released until February 2013. After the crash, searchers were unable to find either the voice or flight data recorders. As the aircraft impacted in nearly vertical angle in high speed, this, causing most of the aircraft's components in the wreckage became severely damaged, or even unidentifiable. About 60% of the wreckage was recovered. Due to high <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact,</b> the crash created a crater with smoke emanated profusely from the crater. The smoke continued for several days. Investigators stated that the crash wasn't survivable.|$|E

The fifth and sixth carriages crushed into each other, one lifting from the tracks. A 24-year-old man was cut free from wreckage crushing his head and abdomen and died {{from a heart attack}} on the way to hospital. A 59-year-old female passenger died three days later from injuries sustained. Just over half, 542 other passengers were injured, exacerbated as many of the seated passengers had stood up ready to depart.

40|$|The modern {{golf swing}} {{is a complex}} and {{asymmetrical}} movement that places an emphasis on restricting pelvic turn while increasing thorax rotation during the backswing to generate higher clubhead <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> Increasing thorax rotation relative to pelvic rotation preloads the trunk muscles by accentuating their length and allowing them to use the energy stored in their elastic elements to produce more power. As the thorax and pelvis turn back towards the ball during the downswing, more skilled golfers are known to laterally slide their pelvis toward the target, which further contributes to final clubhead speed. However, despite the apparent performance benefits associated with these sequences, {{it has been argued}} that the lumbar spine is incapable of safely accommodating the forces they produce. This notion supports a link between the repeated performance of the golf swing and the development of golf-related low back injuries. Of the complaints reported by golfers, low back injuries continue to be the most prevalent, but the mechanism of these injuries is still poorly understood. This review highlights that there is a paucity of research directly evaluating the apparent link between the modern golf swing and golf-related low back pain. Furthermore, there has been a general lack of consensus within the literature with respect to the methods used to objectively assess the golf swing and the methods used to derived common outcome measures.

40|$|The golf stroke was {{computationally}} modelled using {{finite element}} analysis. Results for the impact between the club {{head and the}} ball compared well with previous research, both practical and theoretical. The results imply that for thick face club heads, such as irons, club head performance is independent of material stiffness but highly dependent on the friction of the interface and the clubhead geometry. The three ball flight predictors (speed, trajectory and spin rate) {{as a function of}} clubhead parameters are shown to be non-trivial. Acceptable models of impact could be achieved using rigid faces for thick face clubheads with the centre of mass and clubhead inertia accurately described. Results on ball construction effects imply that both the stiffness and mass distribution throughout the ball affect performance. The large deformations of the ball mean that classic rigid body mechanics cannot suffice in golf impact predictions. A model of the golf swing based on a double pendulum was constructed and shaft performance examined for various styles of golf swing. Shaft parameters thought to affect performance were quantitatively evaluated and results compared well with previous research. Increased club head <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> were achieved with shafts of lighter weight or reduced bending stiffness for all styles of golf swing examined. The cause of bending forward of the shaft <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> was identified to occur from the large centrifugal forces acting on the head and the increased bending stiffness of the shaft also due to centrifugal force. On a detailed level shaft behaviour was affected by vibrations which appeared chaotic due to the changing stiffness of the system. This is expected to be less of an effect in an actual golf shot due to the damping provided by the human participant...|$|R
50|$|Several {{witnesses}} saw Flight 266 {{take off}} and reported seeing sparks emanating from either engine #1 or {{the rear of the}} fuselage, while others claimed an engine was on fire. Salvage operations were conducted to recover the wreckage of the aircraft, along with what remains of the passengers and crew could be located, but not much useful information was gleaned as the cockpit instruments were not recovered. The wreckage was in approximately 930 feet (280 meters) of water and had been severely fragmented, however the relatively small area in which it was spread indicated an extremely steep, nose-down angle <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> The #2 and #3 engines suffered severe rotational damage from high RPM <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact,</b> but the #1 engine had almost no damage because it had been powered off. No evidence of any fire or heat damage was found on the engines, thus disproving the witnesses' claims. The small portion of the electrical system that was recovered did not provide any relevant information. NTSB investigators could not explain the sparking seen by witnesses on the ground and theorized that it might have been caused by debris being sucked into the engine, a transient compressor stall or an electrical system problem that led to the eventual power failure. They also were unable to explain the engine #1 fire warning {{in the absence of a}} fire, but this may have resulted from electrical system problems or a cracked duct that allowed hot engine air to set off the temperature sensors. Some tests indicated that it was indeed possible for the #2 generator to fail from an overload condition as a result of the operating load being suddenly shifted onto it following the #1 generator's shutdown, and this was maintained as a possible cause of the failure.|$|R

50|$|Medieval European knights {{attacked}} {{in several different}} ways, implementing shock tactics if possible, but always in formations of several knights, not individually. For defense and mêlée a formation of horsemen was as tight as possible {{next to each other}} in a line. This prevented their enemy from charging, and also from surrounding them individually. The most devastating charging method was to ride in a looser formation fast into attack. This attack was often protected by simultaneous or shortly preceding ranged attacks of archers or crossbowmen. The attack began from a distance of about 350 metres and took about 15-20 seconds to cross the contemporary long range weapon's effective distance. A most important element, and one not easily mastered, was to stay in one line with fixed spaces while accelerating and having the maximum <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> Often knights would come in several waves, with the first being the best equipped and armored. The lance as primary weapon pierced the enemy. If an enemy soldier was hit in full gallop by a knight's lance couched under the armpit, he was thrown backwards with such a momentum that he knocked over several of his compatriots, and was more often than not killed; in some cases, the lance would even skewer the man and kill or wound the soldier behind him. The heavy lances were dropped after the attack and the battle was continued with secondary weapons (swords, axes, or maces, for example).|$|E
5000|$|Shafts are {{quantified}} in {{a number}} of different ways. The most common is the shaft flex. Simply, the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when placed under a load.

Most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes. The most common are: L (Lady), A (Soft Regular, Intermediate or Senior), R (Regular), S (Stiff), and X (Tour Stiff, Extra Stiff or Strong). A regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed (80-94 mph), while an A-Flex (or senior shaft) is for players with a slower swing speed (70-79 mph), and the stiffer shafts, such as S-Flex and X-Flex (Stiff and Extra-Stiff shafts) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed, usually above 100 mi/h km/h.

40|$|Roadworks {{can cause}} {{dangerous}} situations for both road users and road workers. In the period 2000 - 2009, 2 % of all registered fatal crashes in the Netherlands {{took place at}} roadworks. In addition, roadworks seem to increase the crash rate. Lorries are relatively often involved in crashes at roadworks. Especially in urban areas cyclists are insufficiently taken into consideration at roadworks. Therefore, a number of urban crashes was indeed caused by slow traffic entering a closed off road. Crashes at roadworks on rural roads are relatively often rear-end collisions, while some crashes involve work vehicles, impact attenuators and other objects.

Sixteen Australian Rules (AR) footballers performed two different warm-ups on different days. One warm-up involved five minutes of sub-maximum running followed by seven practice kicks, while the other also included 4. 5 minutes static stretching of the hip flexors and quadriceps after the running. A modified Thomas test was conduced before and after each warm-up. Players performed maximum effort drop punt kicks into a net while being videotaped to determine the ROM of the kicking leg and foot <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> with the ball. There were no significant changes in flexibility (p > 0. 05) as a result of either warm-up and {{there were no significant differences}} between the warm-ups in the kicking variables (p > 0. 05). It was concluded that the Thomas test may not have been sensitive to possible acute changes in flexibility from the warm-ups, and that stretching had no influence on kicking ROM or foot speed, possibly because of the complexity of the kicking skill...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Golfers are used extensively for equipment testing and development, however, they are inconsistent in performance and they tire. Golf swing simulation devices overcome these shortcomings producing consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for golf research conducted by manufacturers governing bodies and academic institutes. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested {{to ensure that the}} swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. An extensive 3 D kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum model of the swing along with ball launch and shaft deflection data. A technique for generating golf robot motion commands from the kinematic swing data was then developed using interpolation algorithms to increase the continuity of command derivatives. Six golfers' swings with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially availablem odem golf robot and a bespokem otion control system. Quantitative data captured from 20 golfers were compared using gender and skill classifications. All golfers were found to perform consistent swing motions and the kinematic sequencing of joint segments supported the summation of speed principle. Higher skill rated golfers were found to perform swings with greater consistency, faster clubhead <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact,</b> faster down swings and greater delayed wrist releases. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data and a feed-forward control enables in dividual golfer's swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability. The capability for golfers' swings to be replicated accurately using a mechanical device provides new impetus for both clubfitting methodologies and optimisation of swing technique. However, the boundary constraint of the club at the robot's gripping mechanism was found to provide poor representation of golfers' grip, and consequently, the first bending mode of the club was excited during simulations and resultant shaft deflection and ball launch data correlated less well with the golfers' data. Development of the club gripping mechanism has been identified as an area for future research as the benefits of the new robot control system will only be fully realised if this interface is improved...|$|R

Airspeed beyond design limits snapped the suspension cables and tore open the envelope; eventually the gondola completely separated from the falling balloon.

Twenty-four players hit drives into a net with clubs of different shaft flexes. This was repeated with vibration applied. Club kinematics were stable across flex conditions with no vibration, and it is probable that players varied the application of torques during the downswing to compensate for changes in club mechanics. With vibration, for eleven players, club head speed and grip <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> increased with flex.

40|$|The {{downswing}} of {{an expert}} golfer can be dissected into two distinct stages. In the first stage the left arm and clubshaft form a right angle which is firmly maintained while the combined system rotates with ever increasing angular velocity.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Sports Engineering [© Wiley-Blackwell] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] perception of ‘feel’ during a ball-implement impact is considered a significant determinant in equipment selection. Previous studies in golf have found that the perceived time for which the ball and clubface are in contact is a factor in the ‘feel’ of the shot. This factor appears to have become more significant with the development of the latest metal ‘woods’. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether golfers’ perceptions of impact duration correspond to measured values or whether the perceptions are created by other factors. A technique has been developed to measure the duration of impact by creating an electrical circuit in which the ball and clubface form a ‘switch’, completing the circuit whilst contact is maintained between the two bodies. Measurements were taken of the duration of impact between five different types of clubhead and two different constructions of golf ball. Further tests, also reported in this paper, investigated the effect of both clubhead <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> and ball compression on the impact duration. The results suggest that the ball has a greater effect on impact duration than the type of clubhead with lower compression balls producing longer impact durations than higher compression balls and two piece balls producing shorter impact durations than three piece, wound balls. It was also found that the duration of impact decreased as the clubhead <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> was increased. Finally, results suggest that there is no correlation between the perception of the golfer and the actual duration of impact and therefore other factors are responsible for creating this perception...|$|E
40|$|The force {{propagation}} {{speed in}} granular matter {{is a very}} difficult property to be measured. A new technique has been developed to calculate the force propagation speed in granular matter based on measuring experimentally the contact time. The contact time for a particle hitting a bed of particles is estimated as the time taken for a particle to strike a bed of particles till the time of its ejection, and it is calculated using the discrete element method. The speed of force propagation in a bed of particles is estimated by plotting the dependence of the path length of the contact force on the contact time and finding the gradient of such dependence. Such approach leads to accurate results if the impact speed is below the yield velocity, i. e. no plastic deformations. It is found that the force propagation speed in spherical granular matter is proportional to the impact speed of the incident particle, which is different from force propagation in continuum matter. It is also found that the propagation speed is dependent on the material and diameters ratio of the interacting particles, but it is not dependent on the number of bed layers. The propagation speed in granular matter is normalized by dividing it by a reference propagation speed, i. e. the propagation <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> an <b>impact</b> <b>speed</b> of 1 m/s. It is found that the normalized propagation speed is independent of the material and diameter of the interacting particles, but it is logarithmically proportional to the impact speed. The proportionality constant is equal to 0. 16, which can be taken as a universal constant for force propagation in spherical granular matter...|$|R

30|$|In this figure, {{we can see}} that, for quartz sand, {{the forces}} induced on the target grains due to gravity are several orders of {{magnitude}} larger than inter-particle adhesive forces at 1 g and 10 − 2 g. Only at 10 − 5 g, these two forces are of the same order for the smaller target particles. This can explain the reason for lower ejected masses and larger average ejecta <b>speeds</b> (<b>at</b> the same <b>impact</b> <b>speed)</b> observed in reduced gravity compared to microgravity: in reduced gravity, only the fastest, lighter grains can overcome the gravity field and be ejected from the target. In microgravity, the gravity force is low enough to allow for most grains to get lifted, even the slower ones, and the average ejecta speed is accordingly lower. In addition, as the gravity and cohesion forces are of the same order in microgravity, the target material displays a more elastic behavior: cohesion forces between the particles seem {{to allow for a}} partially elastic response of the surface to the impact, thus leading to a rebound of the projectile (see Fig.  5, open triangles and diamonds), while in reduced-gravity environments, the presence of a constant downward force locks the particles in place (e.g., jamming; (Cates et al. 1998)) and increases the inter-particle forces due to friction inside the material (Murdoch et al. 2013), thus preventing projectile rebound.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Previously, forward dynamic {{models of}} the golf swing have been planar, {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) representa-tions. Research on live golfers has consistently demonstrated that the downswing is not planar. This paper introduces and evaluates the validity of a 3 D six-segment forward dynamics model of a golfer. The model incorporates a flexible club shaft and a variable swing plane. A genetic algorithm was developed to optimise the coordination of the model’s mathematically represented muscles (torque generators) in order to maximise clubhead <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> The kinematic and kinetic results confirmed previous findings on the proximal to distal sequencing of joints and the muscles powering those joints. The validity of the mathematical model was supported through comparisons of the model’s swing kinematics and kinetics with those of a live golfer. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the skill {{component of the}} wrist release in the golf swing by employing a three-dimensional dynamic model considering vibration of the club shaft.

Thus, {{the relationship between the}} timing of the wrist release and the shaft vibration is examined in this study. First, it is demonstrated that "natural release" at the zero-crossing point of the bending vibration of the shaft efficiently increases the head <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>impact.</b> In the next step, the "late hitting" condition is imposed upon the model. It is demonstrated that "late hitting" could further improve the efficiency of the swing motion. Finally, the skill component in the wrist release for the long drive is experimentally verified by measuring the movement of the wrist and the dynamic deformation of the shaft during the downswing...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{observations}} {{suggest that}} 3 C 75, {{located in the}} dumbbell shaped galaxy NGC 1128 {{at the center of}} Abell 400, hosts two colliding jets. Motivated by this source, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using {{a modified version of the}} GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement hydrodynamical parallel code (GAMER) to study colliding extragalactic jets. We find that colliding jets can be cast into two categories: 1) bouncing jets, in which case the jets bounce off each other keeping their identities, and 2) merging jets, when only one jet emerges from the collision. Under some conditions the interaction causes the jets to break up into oscillating filaments of opposite helicity, with consequences for their downstream stability. When one jet is significantly faster than the other and the impact parameter is small, the jets merge; the faster jet takes over the slower one. In the case of merging jets, the oscillations of the filaments, in projection, may show a feature which resembles a double helix, similar to the radio image of 3 C 75. Thus we interpret the morphology of 3 C 75 as a consequence of the collision of two jets with distinctly different <b>speeds</b> <b>at</b> a small <b>impact</b> parameter, with the faster jet breaking up into two oscillating filaments.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Introduction/Objective Motor vehicle {{collisions}} (MVC) are {{the leading}} cause of bladder injury in the United States. The National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS), a national population based sample, was used to investigate sources of bladder injury following frontal impact and side impact MVC. Methods We queried the NASS-CDS database from 2000 - 2008. Possible predictors included primary direction of force, general area of damage, <b>speed</b> change <b>at</b> <b>impact</b> (delta v), seatbelt use, airbag deployment, sex, injury severity score, pelvic Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and specific interior compartment sources. Backward stepwise logistic regression was utilized to assess important predictor variables as a cause of bladder injury following MVC. Final analyses accounted for sampling weights so that odd ratio estimates would be generalizable to the population. Age < 16, rollover MVCs, ejected passengers, and backseat occupants were excluded from analysis. Results After applying sampling weights, 39, 721, 871 occupants were available for analysis in NASS-CDS. Of these, 5, 780 occupants had a bladder injury that allowed determination of frontal or side impact MVC. More injuries were due to front impact (3, 155) than side impact (2, 625). Following front impact MVC, pelvic AIS (OR 8. 52, 95 %CI 4. 21, 17. 25) and the restraint system (OR 7. 64, 95 %CI 1. 17, 49. 89) were significant predictor variables for bladder injury. Among left (driver) side MVCs, pelvic AIS (OR 5. 40, 95 %CI 3. 84, 7. 59), ISS (1. 06, 95 %CI 1. 04, 1. 08) and the restraint system (4. 11, 95 %CI 1. 50, 11. 25) were the only variables that significantly predicted bladder injury. Among right side MVCs, the pelvic AIS (OR 8. 72, 95 %CI 5. 98, 12. 70) was the only variable that statistically predicted a bladder injury. Conclusion Exploratory analysis reveals there to be significant differences in the internal design elements of automobiles that are associated with bladder injury after MVC. These sources of injury differ depending on front or side impact...|$|R
