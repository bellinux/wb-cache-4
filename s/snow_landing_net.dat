Hamaya is one of Japan’s most celebrated and influential documentary photographers at both a national and international level. His <b>Snow</b> <b>Land</b> series presents an idyllic view {{of life in the}} small mountain villages of Japan’s Niigata Prefecture, emphasising a sense of community and spiritual meaning that Hamaya perceived to be lacking in modern society. In this sense, <b>Snow</b> <b>Land</b> constituted a critique of modernity. Through engagement with theorists such as Heidegger, Foucault and Barthes, as well as critical writings on agrarian ideology, this article investigates the underlying assumptions that govern Hamaya’s depiction of snow country, demonstrating that the series is shaped by a modern worldview and is tied to ideological discourses of agrarianism...|$|R

40|$|Effective live-trapping of beavers (Castor spp.) {{has been}} and will {{continue}} to be necessary for introductions, re-introductions, translocation, or to obtain animals for breeding and zoological gardens. Here we describe a new method of directly capturing beavers (C. fiber) alive. We captured beavers from 3 rivers in Telemark County, Norway, from 31 March to 23 September 1999. Working at night (2000 - 0845 hours) with a 2 -person team in a boat, we located beavers with a spotlight and captured them using 4 different <b>landing</b> <b>nets.</b> We captured 84 beavers during 22 nights and 130 hours of effort. We used 0. 3 nights/beaver and worked on average 5. 9 ± 2. 3 hours/night; mean capture effort was 1. 9 ± 1. 1 hours/beaver. Number of captures during a night ranged from 1 to 8. We captured 18 beavers on land with the <b>land</b> <b>net</b> or the scoopnet, 56 in water with the diving net, and 10 by scooping them directly out of the water with the scoop net. We captured beavers as early as 2120 hours and as late as 0755 hours, with the greatest capture rate recorded between 0200 and 0300 hours. We captured 39 beavers (47 %) between 2400 and 0300 hours, when it was completely dark. A major decrease in capture rate was recorded at 0300 - 0500 hours. Capture rates on cloudy versus c 1 ear nights did not differ. We captured 76. 2 % adults, 9. 5 % 2 -year-olds, and 14. 3 % one-year-olds. Mean weight of animals captured in the <b>landing</b> <b>nets</b> was 18. 4 kg± 6. 6 (range 3. 5 to 30. 5 kg). There was no difference in frequency of males and females captured. We also recaptured 10 selected beavers with a fine-mesh diving net during 14 hours of effort, with a mean recapture effort of 1. 8 ± 1. 0 hours/beaver. This capture technique is quick, efficient, and resulted in no mortalities or injuries to either beavers or researchers. Our method is best suited for large river systems but also may be used in lakes and large ponds or even on land...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} of the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon sink {{estimated}} using the Mauna Loa, Hawaii atmospheric CO 2 record, fossil fuel estimates, and a suite of ocean models suggests that {{the mean of the}} <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon uptake remained approximately constant for three decades and increased after 1988 / 1989. Due to the large variability in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake, {{it is not possible to}} determine the exact timing and nature of the increase robustly by visual inspection. Here, we develop a general methodology to objectively determine the nature and timing of the shift in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake based on the Schwarz Information Criterion. We confirm that it is likely that an abrupt shift in the mean <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon uptake occurred in 1988. After taking into account the variability in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake due to the influence of volcanic aerosols and the El Niño Southern Oscillation, we find that it is most likely that there is a remaining step increase at the same time (p-values of 0. 01 and 0. 04 for Mauna Loa and South Pole, respectively) of about 1 Pg C/yr. Thus, we conclude that neither the effect of volcanic eruptions nor the El Niño Southern Oscillation are the causes of the sudden increase of the land carbon sink. By also applying our methodology to the atmospheric growth rate of CO 2, we demonstrate that it is likely that the atmospheric growth rate of CO 2 exhibits a step decrease between two fitted lines in 1988 – 1989, which is most likely due to the shift in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake of carbon...|$|R

This causes Export <b>Land's</b> <b>net</b> exports over the five-year period to fall from 1 mbpd to 0.3 mbpd, a decrease of 70% -- resulting from a combination of increasing domestic consumption in Export Land and a 25% drop in production. Counter-intuitively, the fractional decline in exports is much greater than the sum of the fractional increase in domestic consumption and the fractional decline in production.|$|R
