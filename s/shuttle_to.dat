5|$|After the trials, {{the line}} to South Harrow opened in June 1903, from 23 June with a <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> Park Royal & Twyford Abbey (now Park Royal) for that year's Royal Agricultural Show. The rest of {{the line to}} South Harrow opened the {{following}} week on 28 June, with stations at North Ealing, Park Royal & Twyford Abbey, Perivale-Alperton (now Alperton), Sudbury Town, Sudbury Hill and South Harrow.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
5|$|Ripley, Lambert, and Parker {{agree to}} self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. Parker and Lambert {{are killed by}} the alien while {{gathering}} life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads with the cat to the <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> find the alien in her path. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. She returns to the shuttle, where the alien is gone, and she narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.|$|E

5|$|The {{off-peak}} District Hounslow branch <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> South Acton was discontinued on 29 April 1935 {{and replaced}} by an Acton Town to South Acton shuttle. This shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959, and the peak hour District line through service to Hounslow was withdrawn on 9 October 1964. In the 1970s the Hounslow branch became the Heathrow branch when it was extended to serve Heathrow Airport, first on 19 July 1975 to serve Hatton Cross and then on 16 December 1977 when Heathrow Central opened.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the IRT, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit, and {{the city}} agreed to the Dual System of Rapid Transit to exp{{and the city}}'s transportation. As part of the agreement, the {{existing}} IRT subway would be split into two north-south lines and a shuttle along 42nd Street. The section of the line south of 42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line stretching from 41st Street and Park Avenue to the Bronx, running via Lexington Avenue, while {{the section of the}} line north of 42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line heading south under Seventh Avenue. The section along 42nd Street was left as a <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> connect the new East Side and West Side Lines.|$|E

5|$|Director George Lucas has a cameo as Baron Papanoida, a blue-faced alien in {{attendance}} at the Coruscant Opera House. Lucas' son Jett portrays a young Jedi-in-training named Zett Jukassa. Lucas' daughter Amanda appears as a character called Terr Taneel, seen in the security hologram; while his other daughter Katie plays a blue-skinned Pantoran named Chi Eekway, visible when Palpatine arrives at the Senate after being saved by the Jedi, and talking to Baron Papanoida at the Opera House (she also has a brief speaking role {{in one of the}} deleted scenes where Padmé is meeting in secret with other senators). Christian Simpson appeared as a stunt double for Hayden Christensen. When Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Palpatine arrive via <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> the Senate docks after crash landing on Coruscant, the Millennium Falcon can be seen landing on one of the lower platforms as the shuttle approaches.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

5|$|In 2259, Enterprise {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} space station harvesting {{the power of a}} binary star. There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so Kirk and Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, Kirk and Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who call themselves the Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with a virus that makes them aggressive. Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{returns to}} Enterprise, {{which has been}} taken over by the Gorn. Kirk and Spock space dive to {{engineering}} and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board. They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance, and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar. Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes; in their closing logs, Kirk and Spock state T'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan, and that they have been ordered to Nibiru.|$|E
5|$|The last {{scheduled}} London Transport steam {{passenger train}} on the branch left Chesham at 12.11am on 12 September 1960. 1,917 passengers used {{the line that}} day, in comparison with a typical Sunday usage of around 100. Earlier on 11 September descendants of the Chesham residents who had attended Watkin's original meeting to promote the railway, along with 86-year-old Albert Wilcox who had been present {{at the opening of}} the line, rode the steam <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> Chalfont& Latimer and back, and attended a ceremony in Chesham's Council Chamber. (Although the 12.11am service from Chesham on 12 September 1960 was the last scheduled London Transport steam service to use the line, a steam train left Marylebone for Chesham each morning at 3.55am to deliver newspapers, returning as the first passenger train from Chesham at 5.58am. This journey to Marylebone was open to the public but was unadvertised and did not appear in published timetables. This arrangement continued to be operated by steam locomotive until 18 June 1962.) The Ashbury passenger cars, which by now had each covered around , were retired from service. The last steam-powered passenger services on the remaining non-electrified section between Amersham and Aylesbury ran on 9 September 1961. The line between Amersham and Aylesbury was handed over to British Rail, leaving Chesham as the westernmost point of the London Underground network. The goods yard at Chesham was closed in 1966, and a train hauled by a former GWR 5700 Class locomotive removed the track from the goods yard, the last steam service to use the line. On 17 October 1967 the newspaper train service and its return journey to Marylebone, by this time worked by a British Rail diesel multiple unit, was abandoned, leaving the branch exclusively operated by London Transport trains.|$|E
