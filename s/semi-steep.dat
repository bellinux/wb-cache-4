30|$|The walker may {{encounter}} 3 major types of inclined terrains if {{the surface is}} not flat: (1) a surface with a shallow slope, (2) a surface with a <b>semi-steep</b> slope range and (3) a surface with a slope {{equal to or greater}} than the critical slope threshold.|$|E
30|$|By {{increasing}} the surface slope (positive or negative) and {{the transition from}} the shallow slope range to the <b>semi-steep</b> slope range, the ability of the walker to ascend or descend the surface gradually becomes more limited, and the consumption of metabolic energy for reaching the destination with the beeline path from the origin point increased dramatically. However, the physiological constraints of human anatomy dictate that the walker avoids walking on slopes steeper than the so-called critical slope threshold (for more details, see [14, 63]). In this range, the human is no longer able to compensate for the incline effects by flexing the leg joints and maintaining the center of gravity over the feet.|$|E
