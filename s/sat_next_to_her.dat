25|$|On {{the night}} of his murder, Normand left Taylor's {{bungalow}} at 7:45pm in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her. They blew kisses {{to each other as}} her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive, and the Los Angeles Police Department subjected her to a grueling interrogation but ruled her out as a suspect. Most subsequent writers have done the same. However, Normand's career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished by revelations of her addiction, which was seen as a moral failing. According to George Hopkins, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at Taylor's funeral, Normand wept inconsolably throughout the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Gutzon Borglum had closely {{followed}} {{the events surrounding}} Ward's procrastination and firing {{as the two men}} had an argumentative past. [...] Borglum was convinced he could do a better job with the design and he also needed the money. [...] He set out to study as much as possible about Sheridan's life by reading his memoirs and biographies. [...] Borglum was able to secure an invitation to a Washington, D.C. party that Irene attended. [...] He <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and invited Irene to his studio in New York. [...] Borglum set out models of horses throughout the studio before she arrived and surprised Irene by how much he know about her husband. [...] At the behest of Irene, on July 2, 1907, Borglum received a contract to sculpt the memorial. [...] He was a Danish American artist who was greatly influenced by French sculptor Auguste Rodin. [...] Borglum {{is best known for his}} carvings at Mount Rushmore and Stone Mountain. [...] The Sheridan sculpture is his only equestrian monument in Washington, D.C. [...] Borglum's other works in Washington, D.C. include Rabboni at Rock Creek Cemetery and several statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol.|$|E
500|$|She was a {{favorite}} with her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, who called the little girl [...] "my precious." [...] Queen Victoria refused to permit the unhappily married Victoria and Ernst to divorce {{for the sake of}} Elisabeth. It was Elisabeth whom Queen Victoria asked to see first and to receive eightieth birthday greetings from in 1899. When the child heard Queen Victoria's pony cart approaching on the road below Windsor Castle, the four-year-old Elisabeth ran out on the balcony, waving and calling, [...] "Granny Gran, I'm here!" [...] Elisabeth's playfulness made the queen laugh out loud. [...] Elisabeth's grandmother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the Duchess of Edinburgh, brought five-year-old Elisabeth to see Queen Victoria on her death bed on 22 January 1901. After the queen died, the child was taken in to see her body and told that her great-grandmother had gone to be with the angels. [...] "But I don't see the wings," [...] Elisabeth whispered. Elisabeth <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> second cousin, Prince Edward of York (called David by family and friends, later to become King Edward VIII) during Queen Victoria's funeral. [...] "Sweet little David behaved so well during the service," [...] wrote his aunt Maud, [...] "and was supported by the little Hesse girl who took him under her protection and held him most of the time round his neck. They looked such a delightful little couple." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{story was}} fictionalised {{in the film}} Provoked, which was {{screened}} at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Naveen Andrews played Deepak and Aishwarya Rai {{played the role of}} Kiranjit.

60|$|After Randy returned, {{the boys}} {{introduced}} {{themselves to the}} girls, and learned {{that all of the}} latter were scholars at Clearwater Hall.

40|$|For 45 {{minutes the}} woman {{discussed}} her husband 2 ̆ 7 s distress {{and her own}} feelings of inadequacy as she struggled in vain {{to find ways to}} help him. I listened closely and suggested she contact a good counselor in her hometown - one familiar with alcohol use - to work with both of them. The conversation wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t have been particularly remarkable, except that she and I had just {{met for the first time}} on a brief airplane flight. I <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> said How 2 ̆ 7 s life? and she told me. In great detail...|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2010 {{interview}} with Larry King, Bush {{was asked about}} former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Bush remarked, [...] "I <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> once, thought she was beautiful, and I think she's very happy in Alaska, and I hope she'll stay there." [...] Palin responded, [...] "I don't want to, sort of, concede {{that we have to}} get used to this kind of thing, because I think the majority of Americans don't want to put up with the blue-bloods– and I say it with all due respect, because I love the Bushes– but, the blue-bloods, who want to pick and choose their winners, instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crandon's [...] "teleplasmic hand" [...] that {{allegedly}} appeared in photographs {{was said to}} resemble animal tissue and trachea, cut and sewn together. Allegations were made by some conjuring historians of Houdini and mediumship that her surgeon husband had altered her genitalia and this was where she concealed her teleplasmic hand. The [...] "hand" [...] did not move after its appearance {{on the table before}} her. It lay still as if it were dead and then supposedly vanished. She refused to wear tights, or to be internally searched, but no proof that Crandon had been surgically altered has ever been published. The [...] "hand" [...] appeared only when Crandon <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband, who held or controlled her right hand.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{most famous}} poem, [...] "Solitude", was first {{published}} in the February 25, 1883 (?) issue of The New York Sun. The inspiration for the poem came as she was travelling to attend the Governor's inaugural ball in Madison, Wisconsin. On her way to the celebration, there was a young woman dressed in black sitting across the aisle from her. The woman was crying. Miss Wheeler <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and sought to comfort her {{for the rest of the}} journey. When they arrived, the poet was so depressed that she could barely attend the scheduled festivities. As she looked at her own radiant face in the mirror, she suddenly recalled the sorrowful widow. It was at that moment that she wrote the opening lines of [...] "Solitude": ...|$|E
500|$|Alf {{first saw}} Julia Stanley at the 'Trocadero' club, a {{converted}} cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool. Although {{he did not}} speak <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at the time, he later saw Julia again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Alf, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", and <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Julia asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly took it off and threw it straight into the lake.|$|R
5000|$|Hassan Kobeissi died {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack on July 5, 2006. He had been previously suffering from searing chest pain, which he thought (and was told by his doctor) to be a result of stomach problems.Shortly before his death, he had called a close friend of his and asked <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go on a walk with him. They walked silently in a park. Hassan then asked his friend to sit down on a bench, and slowly went around the park, once, on his own. He then <b>sat</b> back <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and said, in Arabic, his last words, which were: [...] "Do you know how a man transcends his end?". Scarcely had he finished that phrase, he suffered {{from a heart attack}} and fell from the bench. He was declared Dead Upon Arrival to the hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an [...] "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked [...] "lovely", and <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly threw it straight into the Sefton Park lake.|$|R
2500|$|In 1903, {{during the}} wedding dinner for Princess Alice of Battenberg to her nephew Prince Andrew of Greece in Darmstadt, Prince Christopher {{recalled}} [...] "My brother George <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{and at a}} pause in the proceedings, snatched off her tiara {{and put it on}} his own head. Everybody laughed, Aunt Vera included, although she vowed vengeance on the culprit. Her turn came, as she thought, a little later, when the bride and bridegroom started on their honeymoon. We were all gathered at the door, throwing rice at them, when someone knocked off poor Aunt Vera's glasses, which were smashed to atoms on the stone steps." [...] An unfortunate man who happened to be standing next to the Grand Duchess, then became the object of her wrath. She knocked the man's hat off and began to hit him over the head with it.|$|E

40|$|I {{was seeing}} a new patient—a young woman {{presenting}} with {{symptoms of a}} urinary tract infection. I thought the visit would be fairly routine. But on entering the examination room, I noticed that the patient seemed almost overly alert. As I moved closer, I saw small reddened areas on her arm {{as though she had}} been scratched or cut. <b>Her</b> boyfriend <b>sat</b> silently <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as, in response to my questions, she gave me a list of medications she was taking, both for her chronic back pain and her depression and anxiety. The patient also detailed a long psychiatric history, as well as multiple hospitalizations for back pain. She could not remember the names of any of her previous doctors or her psychiatrist. Almost as an afterthought, she confided that she had tried to stab herself with a knife earlier in the day. Somehow her boyfriend had gotten the knife away from her. Her boyfriend calmly confirmed her story. I thought that this situation was beyond my expertise. I suggested that {{it might be a good}} idea to call a mental health clinic for an evaluation. The patient immediately became agitated and started loudly accusing me of calling her “crazy. ” I didn’t know what to do. I felt as though my suggestion had made things worse. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cards, billiards, and betting"--there was the {{inscription}} legibly {{written on the}} manner and appearance of Captain Peterkin. The bright-eyed yellow old lady who kept the boarding-house would have been worth five thousand pounds in jewelry alone, if the ornaments which profusely covered her had been genuine precious stones. The younger ladies present had their cheeks as highly rouged and their eyelids as elaborately penciled in black {{as if they were}} going on the stage, instead of going to dinner. We found these fair creatures drinking Madeira as a whet to their appetites. Among the men, there were two who struck me as the most finished and complete blackguards whom I had ever met with in all my experience, at home and abroad. One, with a brown face and a broken nose, was presented to us by the title of [...] "Commander," [...] and was described as a person of great wealth and distinction in Peru, traveling for amusement. The other wore a military uniform and decorations, and was spoken of as [...] "the General." [...] A bold bullying manner, a fat sodden face, little leering eyes, and greasy-looking hands, made this man so repellent to me that I privately longed to kick him. Romayne had evidently been announced, before our arrival, as a landed gentleman with a large income. Men and women vied in servile attentions to him. When we went into the dining-room, the fascinating creature who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him held <b>her</b> fan before her face, and so made a private interview of it between the rich Englishman and herself. With regard to the dinner, I shall only report that it justified Captain Peterkin's boast, in some degree at least. The wine was good, and the conversation became gay to the verge of indelicacy. Usually the most temperate of men, Romayne was tempted by his neighbors into drinking freely. I was unfortunately seated at the opposite extremity of the table, and I had no opportunity of warning him.|$|R
60|$|A great bell {{brought all}} down, and Anne was pleased <b>to</b> see that <b>her</b> seneschal made no {{question}} about placing Harry Clifford beside the Prioress, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Lord of Peelholm, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the young daughter {{of the house in}} the seat of honour.|$|R
60|$|The hysterical young man, Henry March, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{turned a}} wild scared face upon her, and then, as if fearful of being {{dragged into the}} conversation, {{disappeared}} hastily after Mrs. Dumphy.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} Miss Holmes. She {{came down to}} breakfast looking very charming but rather pale. Again I <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and took some {{opportunity}} to ask her how she had rested that night.|$|E

60|$|In the Empire {{one evening}} he <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> two girls. He {{was aware of}} the one beside him. She was rather small, common, with a fresh {{complexion}} and an upper lip that lifted from her teeth, so that, when she was not conscious, her mouth was slightly open and her lips pressed outwards in a kind of blind appeal. She was strongly aware of the man <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> so that all her body was still, very still. Her face watched the stage. Her arms went down into her lap, very self-conscious and still.|$|R

60|$|He {{made her}} a little inclination, and turned away, while Barbara sat still, looking {{straight}} in front of her, but quite oblivious of the music, until she turned with a laugh, and the girl who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> glanced round.|$|E
6000|$|... "O no, indeed. I merely stepped down, Clym, to ask you--" [...] Here he {{followed}} her through the doorway into the private room beyond, and, the door closing, Eustacia and the mummer who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> the only other witness of the performance, saw and heard no more.|$|E

60|$|They {{reached the}} church. Fred {{led the way}} to the pew, {{followed}} by the cousin, then Anna. She felt very conspicuous and important. Somehow, this young man gave her away to other people.

60|$|By {{this time}} the party had taken their place round the long board, Mr Gresham sitting at the top, in the place usually {{occupied}} by Lady Arabella.
