40|$|Nowadays, {{existing}} Voice over IP (VoIP) {{clients are}} <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol</b> dependant. This {{means that they}} can only support one <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol.</b> One disadvantage of these VoIP clients {{is that they are}} rich clients, and the other is that the problem of interoperability between two clients supporting different <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> must be solved by a <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol</b> translator. We propose a VoIP Web Services architecture, taking advantage of the Web Services technology to solve the above problems. This paper explores the design and implementation of a VoIP Web Services system architecture. We first propose a VoIP Web Service architecture, and then we focus mainly on designing the <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol</b> Web Services, and illustrate the call procedures between the Simple Client and the normal H. 323 /SIP client under this architecture.

The implementation feasibility of these protocols should be evaluated during their design phase, so that possible performance bottlenecks are identified and removed. In this paper we present a methodology for evaluating the performance of BISDN signalling systems under design. New performance parameters are introduced and their network-dependent values are extracted through a message flow model which has the capability to describe the impact of call and bearer control separation on the <b>signalling</b> performance. <b>Signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> are modelled through a modular decomposition of the seven OSI layers including the service user to three submodels. The workload model is user descriptive {{in the sense that}} it does not approximate the direct input traffic required for evaluating the performance of a layer protocol; instead, through a multi-level approach, it describes the actual implications of user signalling activity for the general signalling traffic. The <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol</b> model is derived from the global functional model of the <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> and information flows using a network of queues incorporating synchronization and dependency functions. The same queueing approach is followed for the signalling transfer network which is used to define processing speed and signalling bandwidth requirements and to identify possible performance bottle-necks stemming from the realization of the related protocols.
