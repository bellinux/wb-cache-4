Juniper <b>stockholders</b> alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly. In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003. This was followed by a $169 million settlement with <b>stockholders</b> in February 2010.|$|E

40|$|The inverse {{relationship}} between <b>stockholder</b> concentration and executive compensation reflects the reduced asymmetry of information that accompanies greater <b>stockholder</b> concentration. Using a sample of firms with separate salary and bonus data for the CEO, we find <b>stockholder</b> control to be a highly significant determinant of bonus and simultaneously an insignificant determinant of salary, supporting the contention that <b>stockholder</b> monitoring and incentive contracts are alternate means of ensuring managerial compliance with <b>stockholder</b> objectives. This reconciles the "monopoly" view that managers of firms are able to exploit the information asymmetry, with the "competitive view" that the market for managers is efficient...|$|R

This job overlapped with that of president of the New Orleans and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he invented a system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by <b>stockholders</b> who wished to take direct management of the company.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{established}} a foreign trade department for the railroad, hoping {{to take advantage}} of the railway's ability to connect to the Mississippi Valley and Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. In 1915, when the railway lost 12percent of its revenue owing to disruptions in trade caused by the start of World War I, Harrison was concerned about longer-term changes underway. In the annual report that year he warned <b>stockholders</b> that automobile ownership could severely impact railroad passenger revenues. His words proved to be prophetic, as automobiles eventually resulted in the disappearance of most passenger train traffic.|$|E

According to one source, the final program aired on only five stations nationwide. It appears that the boxing show was syndicated to a few other east coast stations until 1958, but likely not as a production of DuMont or its successor company.|$|E

40|$|This Comment {{considers}} whether, {{in spite}} of the Kaiser Steel decision, a bankruptcy trustee should be able to recover a fraudulent conveyance made to a <b>stockholder</b> 2 ̆ 7 s brokerage account {{in the form of a}} Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Payment. The Comment summarizes the Kaiser Steel opinion and questions the court 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the prior case law. The Comment then explains why an LBO payment to a <b>stockholder</b> 2 ̆ 7 s brokerage account should not qualify as an exempt 2 ̆ 2 settlement payment 2 ̆ 2 under section 546 (e) and thus should be rcoverable as a fraudulent conveyance under section 548. The Comment assumes that such a payment is recoverable as a fraudulent conveyance from the initial transferee of such payment, and considers whether the initial transferee is the <b>stockholder</b> or the stockbroker who accepted the payment into the <b>stockholder</b> 2 ̆ 7 s account. The Comment concludes that section 546 (e) should be construed to allow recovery from a <b>stockholder</b> of a fraudulent conveyance made in the form of an LBO payment. It also concludes that a bankruptcy trustee, or a debtor in possession, should be permitted to recover an LBO payment from a <b>stockholder</b> but not from a stockbroker who merely functions as an innocent conduit in the LBO payment process...|$|R
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new <b>stockholders,</b> Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first {{legislative}} initiative was {{to propose a}} dramatic increase in spending for the Works Progress Administration in order to increase employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with an economic downturn the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank <b>stockholders.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} oversaw the {{construction}} of a ten-storey expansion to the property. This added a further 200 rooms to the lodge, for which permission was given although the Nevada State Park Advisory Committee opposed the move. They sought to re-open the Cal Neva on July 1, 1969, but instead it partly opened in May of that year with the new expansion opening the following month. The Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust purchased the lodge in 1970 for $6 million, with the aim to lease it to the U.S. Capital Corporation, who in turn sought to sublease it to Tahoe Crystal Bay Inc. The <b>stockholders</b> of the Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust filed a lawsuit against the company in 1973, which resulted in the Cal Neva being placed into federal receivership. After opening year round since Sinatra purchased the lodge, it closed for the winter season in 1974 due to a drop in visitors blamed on the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E
