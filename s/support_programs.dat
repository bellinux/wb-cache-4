The Raptors Foundation was one of three parts of the Raptors' community service program. The other projects are Raptors Community Relations and Raptors Basketball Development, both of which focus on providing basketball development programs. The Toronto Raptors lead the NBA for amount of money donated to the community. In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the other charitable arms of MLSE's other sports franchises to form the Team Up Foundation.|$|E

25|$|In Bangladesh, prelacteal feeding is {{a common}} custom; this is the {{practice}} of feeding other foods to infants before breast milk {{during the first three}} days of life. A study found that in a region of rural Bangladesh, 89.3% of infants were fed prelacteally, and only 18.8% of these infants were exclusively breastfed between three days and three months postpartum. 70.6% of infants who were not fed prelacteally were exclusively breastfed up to three months.

25|$|Beginning in 1990, the {{government}} expanded its agricultural <b>support</b> <b>programs</b> {{to include a}} guaranteed purchase price for major agricultural crops, subsidies, favorable interest rates, government investment, and favorable foreign-trade policies. Primarily because of government support for domestic agriculture, between 1989 and 2003 the import volumes of wheat, sugar, and red meat declined by 77.7 percent, 39.6 percent, and 88.2 percent, respectively. Concurrently, the value of agricultural exports increased from US$461.5 million in 1989 to US$1.7 billion in 2004. However, {{over the same period}} total food and live animal imports increased from US$1.37 billion to US$2.65 billion.|$|E

25|$|Reconstruction {{government}} established {{public education}} for the first time, and new charitable institutions, together with improved prisons. There was corruption, but it was mostly white Southerners who benefited, particularly by investments to develop railroads and other infrastructure. Taxes had been exceedingly low before the war because the planter class refused to <b>support</b> <b>programs</b> such as education welfare. The exigencies of the postwar period caused the state debt to climb rapidly. When Republicans {{came to power in}} 1868, the debt stood at $5.4 million. By the time Republicans lost control in 1877, state debt had risen to $18.5 million.|$|E
25|$|Forecasting life {{expectancy}} and mortality forms an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in {{life expectancy}} have huge implications for old-age <b>support</b> <b>programs</b> like U.S. Social Security and pension since the cash flow in these systems {{depends on the}} number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of the European financial crisis, and continued latency in the Portuguese economy did not escape the election campaign. The unemployment rate in the Azores had grown to 15.6%, which was above the national rate (15.0%), and 5.9% greater than {{the same time in}} 2011. It was predicted that the unemployment rate would reach 16% by 2013. The region is heavily dependent on the public sector-driven economy, and the Government has not reduced, but actually hired more people to the Regional Secretaries (through public competition or through unemployment <b>support</b> <b>programs).</b> These activities have actually hidden the real increase in the unemployment rate, while measures to curtail the rise in public spending and implement austerity measures to reduce the debit did not occur.|$|E

25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse {{is a bigger}} problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family <b>support</b> <b>programs</b> often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E
25|$|Kean’s {{inclusive}} {{practice of}} government remains {{central to his}} legacy. This legacy found expression in his urban policies and outreach to traditional Democratic constituencies, his aggressive divestment of public retirement funds from South Africa, embrace of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{as an opportunity to}} raise awareness of race on a statewide basis, and his successful primary sponsorship of the bill that established the Educational Opportunity Fund. This fund appropriated $2 million for direct student aid and <b>support</b> <b>programs</b> for low-income students who demonstrated academic capability but lack sufficient preparation for college. It continues to serve disadvantaged New Jersey students nearly 50 years later. The fund’s longevity is indicative of Kean’s long-term outlook and the overall strength of his legislation.|$|E
25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the <b>support</b> <b>programs</b> to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E
