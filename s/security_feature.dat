They are used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives, including the prime minister and Cabinet, and most courts, including the Supreme Court, as well as the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It is also present on all pre-polymer denominations of Canadian banknotes (in fact, the way the arms were printed on each bill is a <b>security</b> <b>feature),</b> as well as the 50¢ coin, and on the cover of Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's cypher, has formed the sovereign's standard for Canada, for use by the Queen in her capacity as monarch of Canada. Since, six additional standards for use by other members of the Canadian Royal Family have been created.|$|E

25|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{redesigning}} the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current £2 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> called 'iSIS' (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).|$|E
25|$|The twenty pound {{note was}} issued in November 1992 and last in 2000.

25|$|The differing {{sizes of}} other nations' {{banknotes}} are a <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> that eliminates {{one form of}} counterfeiting to which U.S. currency is prone: Counterfeiters can simply bleach the ink off a low-denomination note, such as a $1 or $5 bill, and reprint it as a higher-value note, such as a $100 bill. To counter this, the U.S. government has included in all $5 and higher denominated notes since the 1990 series a vertical laminate strip imprinted with denomination information, which under ultraviolet light fluoresces a different color for each denomination ($5 note: blue; $10 note: orange; $20 note: green; $50 note: yellow; $100 note: red).|$|E
25|$|The V8 <b>Security</b> <b>Feature</b> Pack (a mid-release product update {{designated}} 8.5) added {{important new}} security features designed to lock down Pervasive.SQL data files. Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data {{was controlled by}} the operating system's security mechanism. This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying data files. 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user {{has access to the}} underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations no longer require the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI connection string.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, New Zealand {{changed from}} paper {{banknotes}} to polymer banknotes.

25|$|These are {{the first}} Canadian notes {{produced}} on polymer. In place of a watermark are two visual features: a translucent maple leaf and a transparent window. The leaf includes a <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> that, when viewed close to the eye with a single-point light source behind, produces a circular image displaying the note's denomination. The window is fringed by maple leaves; at its top is a smaller version of the portrait, and at its bottom a light-refracting metallic likeness of an architectural feature from the parliament buildings. The portraits on the face are more centred on the note. The backs of the notes introduce new cultural and thematic imagery, but the literary quotation is not continued. The polymer notes continue the tactile feature, from the Canadian Journey series.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 {{the biggest}} changes came; {{the size of}} the 1-peseta coin was {{significantly}} reduced, however not discontinued (making it the smallest, lightest circulating coin in Western Europe and perhaps the world at that time). The 2-peseta coin was discontinued. Smaller aluminum-bronze 5 pesetas were introduced, and reduced aluminium-bronze 25 pesetas were also introduced which had a hole in the center. Smaller 50 peseta coins were also issued the same year in cupro-nickel with the distinct Spanish flower shape that would eventually be used by many countries, most notably the 20-cent coin of the euro. At the same time, the 200-peseta coin was made larger and included an identifiable edge with incuse lettering. In 1999, a laser-etched hologram was added to the 500-peseta coin as a <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> to help discourage counterfeiting. During this period, all coins except the 1 and 500 pesetas went through a commemorative redesign each year, in a similar vein to the U.S. State commemorative quarters program until their discontinuation in 2001 preceding the introduction of the euro common currency.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some technical and maintenance crew at SICEC has been barred entry to their workplace for months. The reason was due to they have not received their passes from the organisers. An anonymous worker told the press that their passes had several problems on it. They were issued temporary passes earlier in September, but they have since expired. They were not let in without proper credentials. The workers who do not have passes have been given a day off from work, whereas the rest who had passes worked double {{to get ready for the}} meetings. An industry source stated that about 200 to 300 workers faced the same problem with their passes. The managing director from Showtec Corporation told the press around twenty of his crew were sent home as no pass have been issued to them, despite most of them submitted their forms a few months ago. A full strength of sixty is required to run the meetings. He added that a number of the passes did not come with an “S” at the bottom left hand corner of the card, which is a <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> for the person to be allowed into the Programme of Seminars which brings all the ministers and high-level delegates from 184 countries.|$|E
