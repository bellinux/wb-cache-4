Lime, limestone, caustic soda and lime-soda ash mixtures were compared as reagents for neutralising raffinates and for removing amines and heavy metals including radium from solution.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} of voltage-dependent calcium channels in porcine adrenal chromafiin cells, calcium (<b>barium)</b> currents, rise <b>of</b> intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and catecholamine release responses induced by stimulation with high K+ (60 mM) were measured by whole-cell voltage clamp technique, microfluorometry and HPLC-ECD method, respectively. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Voltage-current relationship of calcium current indicated that porcine adrenal chromaffin cells possess only high voltage-activated type of calcium channels. The calcium current was inhibited by ω-conotoxin GVIA, nifedipine and ω-agatoxin IVA dose-dependently, though the magnitudes of inhibition were various. The degree of inhibition by maximal doses of these three agents was 78 %, 15 % and 6 %, respectively. When these three agents were applied onto the same cell, calcium current was inhibited additively. 2. When 1 -s depolarizing pulses were applied in the absence and presence of calcium channel blockers, ω-conotoxin GV IA-sensitive currents inactivated faster than nifedipine or ω-agatoxin IVA-sensitive currents. 3. Rises in [Ca 2 +]i and catecholamine release in response to stimulation by high K+ were inhibited to about 50 % by either ω-conotoxin GVIA (1 μM) or nifedipine (10 μM) but not by ω-agatoxin IVA (0. 1 μM). In addition, these responses were almost abolished by the combined application of ω-conotoxin GVIA and nifedipine. 4. A strong depolarizing pulse (a prepulse to + 100 mV) applied prior to a test pulse caused about 20 % increase <b>of</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> current evoked by the test pulse (facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents). The degree of the facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents was increased {{with the increase in}} the voltage (in a range over + 20 mV) and duration of the prepulses. Moreover the facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents was decreased with increase in intervals between the prepulses and the test pulses. 5. The application of 8 -Bromo-cAMP (1 mM) or forskolin (10 μM) decreased the amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents without affecting the degree <b>of</b> facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents by the prepulses. In addition, an intracellular application of Rp-cAMPS, an inhibitor of PKA, did not have any effects on the amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents and the degree <b>of</b> facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents. 6. The intracellular application of GTPγS (100 μM) decreased the amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents, but not affected those in the presence of prepulses. On the other hand, the application of GDPIβS (100 μM) caused a slight increase in the amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents but had no effects on the amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents in the presence of prepulses. Consequently, the degree of facilitation increased in the presence of GTPγS and decreased in the presence of GDPβS. 7. GTPγS-sensitive component <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> current was sensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA but not to nifedipine. The facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents by the prepulses was abolished by ω-conotoxin GVIA but not by either ω-agatoxin IVA or nifedipine. Furthermore, Bay K 8644 caused about 80 % increase <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents in amplitude but showed no effect on the facilitation by prepulses. 8. GTPγS applied intracellularly slowed the time course <b>of</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> current (kinetic slowing). The kinetic slowing <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents by GTPγS was abolished by ω-conotoxin GVIA or the depolarizing prepulses. 9. Pertussis toxin did not affect the amplitude <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents and the degree <b>of</b> facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents. Cholera toxin, however, increased the degree <b>of</b> facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents without effects on the amplitudes <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents. Based on these results, it is clarified that porcine adrenal chromaffin cells possess ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive N- and nifedipine-sensitive L- and ω-agatoxin IVA-sensitive P/Q-type calcium channels and that L- and N-type channels mainly contribute to the rise in [Ca 2 +]i and catecholamine release by depolarizing the cells. N-type calcium channels are mainly involved in the depolarizing prepulse-induced facilitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> currents. The facilitatidn seems to result from the prepulse-induced relief of tonic inhibition on calcium channels by G-protein but not from PKA-induced phosphorylation of channels during the prepulse. Moreover, Gs-type but not Gi-type G-protein may be involved in this mechanism...|$|R

It depended on the viscosity of the contrast media and the angle of the phantom. Viscosity was correlated with CPT. CPT was 3 to 6 seconds at an angle of 15 degrees, and 1. 5 to 4 seconds at an angle of 30 degrees. We can refer to these findings to decide the density <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> suspension and to get timely exposure...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of the various concentrations of sulfamic acid, the pure and the mixed sulfates <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> and strontium are precipitated by the KCP reaction. The conentrations of sulfamic acid are used from equimolar to sufficient excess against those of the reaction ions, and the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> ion are used lower than the that of strontium ion. 　Strontium sulfate of the mixed precipitates in the simultaneous reaction decreases at the initial stage of reaction compared to the single reaction, but it increases at the later stage of reaction (Figs. 7 and 8). Such increase is due to the promotion of the precipitation recation of strontium sulfate by the precipitate <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate formed during the initial stage of reaction. These phenomena, however, are not observed in case of the lowest concentration <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> ion relation to the concentration of strontium ion on equimolar reaction, but strontium sulfate of mixed precipitates increases at the initial stage of reaction (Fig. 7). The rate of increase of precipitation in equimolar reaction is grown with decrease in the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> ion (Fig. 7). 　The hetrogeneous distribution coefficients (λ) of barium-strontium mixed sulfates in {{the presence}} of various concentrations of sulfamic acid are also determined by the use of several methods of analysis in the previous paper. The results obtained by the above methods are shown in the relation <b>of</b> λ and <b>barium</b> ion concentrations (Tables 5 and 6). 　The growth process of particles of the precipitates of the pure and the mixed sulfates <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> and strontium is observed with a microscope. The results obtained from the measurement of the particles diameter by the microscope are shown in microphotographs. The growth <b>of</b> particles <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate precipitate is increased with increase in reaction times (Photogs. 2 to 5). The size of these particles is larger than that of the other data, but it is smaller than particles size of strontium sulfate. The growth rate of particles of mixed precipitates is increased with decrease in the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> ion (Photogs. 11 and 13) ...|$|R
40|$|Aspiration <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is a well-recognized complication, {{occurring}} accidentally during {{examinations of}} the upper gastrointestinal system using contrast media. Rarely, large amounts <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> <b>sulphate</b> are inadvertently aspirated into the lung. Certain conditions affecting the anatomical and functional integrity of the oropharynx and oesophagus suggest predisposing factors. Aspiration <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{is not expected to}} cause severe lung injury due to its relatively non-irritant matter. On the other hand, acute inflammation or even death attributed either to high or low density preparations <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> have been reported. We present two patients, both with a history of schizophrenia, who developed acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, following aspiration of large amounts <b>of</b> <b>barium,</b> during an upper gastrointestinal radiographic contrast study. One patient died following massive aspiration which led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, while the other, although sub- acutely complicated by pneumonia, was successfully treated. Beside presentation of cases, several aspects of investigation, differential diagnosis, treatment and prevention are discussed. Complications <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> <b>sulphate</b> aspiration depend upon the density and quantity of the aspirated solution, the extent of tracheobronchial distribution and the general physical condition of the patient. In severe cases, early treatment and close follow up with high-resolution computed tomography are mandatory to prevent progression towards fibrosis. Patients with psychiatric disorders, apart from other conditions predisposing to aspiration, should be dealt with particular caution, when performing the above-mentioned procedures...|$|R

Examinations of cathode inserts from long duration ion engine tests show deposits of tungsten at the downstream end that appear to block the flow <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> from the interior. In addition, a numerical model <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> transport in the insert plasma indicates that the barium partial pressure in the insert may exceed the equilibrium vapor pressure of the dominant barium-producing reaction, and it was postulated previously that this would suppress barium loss in the upstream part of the insert. New measurements of the depth <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> depletion from a cathode insert operated for 30, 352 hours reveal that barium loss is confined to a narrow region near the downstream end, confirming this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of the various concentrations of sulfamic acid, the pure and the mixed sulfates <b>Of</b> <b>barium</b> and lead ions are precipitated by the kinetically controlled precipitation (Precipitation from homogeneous solution) reaction. 　The concentrations of sulfamic acid are used for both those <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> and lead ions from equimolar to sufficient excess molar. The concentration ratios <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> ion to the various concentrations of lead ion are not changed variously. 　At the equimolar reaction, the precipitates of lead sulfate in the mixed precipitation are observed at the initial stage of reaction independent of concentrations of lead ion, but they are observed less than those <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate. That <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate increases at the initial stage of reaction, but it is insufficiently observed in the precipitation molar fraction (Fig. 10). 　At the simultaneous reaction, the quantity of lead sulfate in the mixed precipitates decreases at the initial stage Of reaction compared with the single reaction, but it increases at the following stage of reaction. The increasing of lead sulfate is due to the promotion of the precipitation reaction of lead sulfate by the precipitation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate formed at the initial stage of reactions. 　The precipitation molar fractions of lead sulfate in the mixed precipitates obtained by the excess molar reaction become larger than the theoretical values with decrease in the concentrations of lead ion (Table 5). These fracnons grow larger with increase. In the concentrations of lead ion {{as in the case of}} the same excess molar concentrations of the sulfamic acid (Fig. 11). 　In this case, that fractions <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate become larger than lead sulfate from the start to the last of reaction periods...|$|R
