60|$|The cholera of 1832 {{had been}} {{especially}} terrible in the unwholesome precincts of the Devonshire seaports, {{and the effect}} was a great craving for religion. The Church was in no condition to avail herself of it; in fact, she would have viewed it with distrust as excitement. Primitive Methodism and Plymouth Brethrenism supplied the void, gave opportunities of prayer, and gratified the quickened longing for devotion; and therewith arose that association of the Church with deadness and of Dissent with life, which infected even the most carefully tended villages, and with which Patteson was {{doing his best to}} contend at Alfington. The stage of gaining the people's affection and confidence, and of quickening their religious life, he had attained; and the further work of teaching them that the Church alone gives <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> union with Christ, was yet to come when his inward call led him elsewhere.|$|R

The purpose of the research is to explore the consequences of the decision by the City of Johannesburg to reduce leave benefits of existing employees after transformation.

We argue that the City employees’ leave benefits should be benchmarked against best practices from municipalities, for example, municipalities in developed countries, which embrace employee benefits as a social responsibility. The research recommends that the City’s leave benefits be restructured to encapsulate best practices that ensure full <b>security</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> plan as well as maintenance of healthy life styles, that is, in line with the ILO convention’s best practices.

40|$|Abstract- With {{the advent}} of internet, various online attacks have been {{increased}} and among them the most popular attack is phishing. Phishing is an attempt by an individual or a group to get personal confidential information such as passwords, credit card information from unsuspecting victims for identity theft, financial gain and other fraudulent activities. Fake websites which appear {{very similar to the}} original ones are being hosted to achieve this. In this paper we have proposed a new approach named as an “Image based authentication using Visual Cryptography ” {{to solve the problem of}} phishing. The use of visual cryptography is explored to preserve the privacy of an image by decomposing the original image into two shares (one with user and one with server) such that the original image can be revealed only when both are simultaneously available; the individual sheet images do not reveal the identity of the original image. Using this website cross verifies its identity and proves that it is a genuine website before the end users. The emphasis of the project is to prevent the user from visiting a phishing website.
