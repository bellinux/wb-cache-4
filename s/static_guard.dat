Given a polygon (with or without holes) and a parameter k, we compute {{a set of}} k routes inside the polygon such that any point inside the polygon is visible from at least one point along one route. We measure {{the quality of our}} solutions by either the length of the longest route and the sum of route lengths, where the goal is to minimize each. We start by computing a set of <b>static</b> <b>guards</b> [2], construct k routes that visit all the <b>static</b> <b>guards</b> and further shorten the routes while maintaining full coverage of the polygon. We implemented the algorithm and present extensive results to evaluate our methods, including a comparison with lower bound routes based on the idea of visiting large number of visibility-independent “witness points”. Our experiments showed that for a large suite of input data our heuristics give efficient routes that are comparable with the optimal solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|A watchman, in the {{terminology}} of art galleries, is a mobile guard. We consider several watchman and guard problems for different classes of polygons. We introduce {{the notion of}} vision spans along a path (route) which provide a natural connection between the Art Gallery problem, the m-watchmen problem and the watchman route problem. We prove that finding the minimum number of vision points, i. e., <b>static</b> <b>guards,</b> along a shortest watchman route is NP-hard. We provide a linear time algorithm to compute the best set of <b>static</b> <b>guards</b> in a histogram polygon. The m-watchmen problem, minimize total length of routes for m watchmen, is NP-hard for simple polygons.

5000|$|Police {{effectiveness}} of Black Brigades was, in best terms, feeble. Aside from particularly strong and well equipped Brigades (such as VIIIth [...] "Aldo Resega" [...] of Milan, 2000 strong) that were exceptions, the average Black Brigades were at most 2-300 men strong, poorly equipped and armed, with {{little if any}} military training, and were hardly in conditions to defend themselves from partisan attacks, not to mention provide support to military authorities. Many of their members were obscure figures evicted from police or army, and conspicuous were also the hardline fascists who were pushed by resentment and revenge towards that part of Italian population who, in their eyes, betrayed the Fascist regime. Many were also old [...] "Squadristi" [...] fascists who {{had served in the}} '20s, and who were eager to retake a first-place role in the ranks of the Fascist Party. In general terms, poor average discipline made all these individuals difficult to control, and prone to abuses. As the military situation worsened, German mistrust towards the RSI military grew, and even Social Republic authorities looked at the Black Brigades with contempt. All these factors contributed to push the Black Brigades into political radicalization and an increasingly hostile behaviour towards the population itself, among which they gained a fearsome reputation of fanatical brutality and summary procedures. Apart from a few Black Brigades who had been found reliable enough to be committed in regular combat against Partisans and Allies, most of these formations had poor military or even police capabilities and were mainly employed in <b>static</b> <b>guard</b> duties, patrols, and were often unleashed in brutal reprisals and retaliations against Partisans' attacks and ambushes to RSI military personnel. There, they usually performed well enough, displaying undeniable bravery but also brutality (which the Partisans promptly reciprocated), in the merciless guerrilla warfare that ravaged northern Italy in 1944-45. Therefore, they were an important law enforcement instrument for German and Italian authorities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} problem of multi-robot area {{coverage}} and present a new approach in the case where the map of the area and its static obstacles are known and the robots have a limited visibility range. The proposed method starts by locating a set of <b>static</b> <b>guards</b> on the map of the target area and then builds a graph called Reduced-CDT, a new environment representation method based on the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Multi-Prim’s is used to decompose the graph into a forest of partial spanning trees (PSTs). Each PST is then modified through a mechanism called Constrained Spanning Tour (CST) to build a cycle which is then assigned to an individual robot. Subsequently, robots start navigating the cycles and consequently cover the whole area. We show that the proposed approach is complete and robust with respect to robot failure. I...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{networking}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly important and popular way of providing global information access to users on the move. One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of simple and robust Channel Allocation algorithm. The radio propagation environment and related handoff challenges are different in cellular structures. A handoff algorithm with fixed parameters cannot perform well in different system environments. In this paper, motivated by the facts that the scarce spectrum should be utilized efficiently, a new Dynamic Channel allocation scheme is proposed. Performance of the proposed dynamic channel allocation scheme is compared with existing channel allocation schemes such as fixed channel, <b>static</b> <b>guard</b> channel and Guard Channel with Channel Borrowing. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods in bandwidth utilization, handoff dropping rate and new call blocking rate...|$|E
40|$|A major {{criterion}} {{in evaluating}} a cellular {{system is the}} handover failure probability {{the probability that a}} mobile call in progress will be forced to abort during a handover because it could not be allocated a radio channel in the new cell. One factor that influences the handover failure probability is the channel allocation policy within each cell. This policy is used to determine how to allocate the limited set of available channels in the cell to two kinds of calls: new calls originating within the cell, and handovers that migrate into the cell from neighboring cells. Two classes of such policies are explored in this paper's nonreserving and reservation-based. Nonreserving policies do not set aside resources for exclusive use by handover calls, whereas reservation-based policies do reserve resources. For the former class, this paper presents an optimal policy and, for the latter, an adaptive traffic-driven reservation policy that improves on <b>static</b> <b>guard</b> channel policies. Analytic and simulation results are provided for policies in each class...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of 3 G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network towards higher data rates {{is through the}} introduction of High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) enhancement to the existing 31 d Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) standards. In this paper, an access control protocol is proposed for an integrated voice, video and non real-time data traffic on the forward link (cell-site to mobile). The protocol involves predicting the residual capacity available for the HSDPA traffic. This paper evaluated the performance of three video traffic models in predicting the number of data packets that could be scheduled at the next time slot. All three video traffic models exploit the frame properties of Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) traffic. The traffic models are based on Markovian, Autorcgressive (AR) and two-sided Markov Renewal Model (TSMR) processes. Simulation results are obtained using Network Simulator 2 (ns 2) with the Enhanced UMTS Radio Access Network Extensions (EURANE) using real video traces. The performance of the proposed estimation schemes are compared with estimation scheme using <b>static</b> <b>guard</b> margin. Findings of this paper {{can be used to}} improve the downlink performance of non-real time data traffic in the presence of MPEG video traffic in 3 G CDMA networks...|$|E

5000|$|Wide {{differences}} in proficiency existed between various guard units in training, leadership and equipment, so {{that for the}} most part units came to the border with only basic drilling as experience. Units were initially assigned as <b>static</b> <b>guards</b> for railroad bridges and border crossing points, but as training made them more proficient, they were assigned an increasing responsibility for the patrolling the border that resulted in encounters with smugglers and bandits who still posed an occasional threat. Records of the Utah National Guard indicate that it participated in three skirmishes after it arrived at Camp Stephen J. Little on the Arizona border in July 1916. The final action of the three, occurring January 26, 1917, resulted in an all-day border skirmish between Utah cavalrymen and Mexicans in which the guardsmen were reinforced and ten Mexicans were killed or wounded. While incapable of conducting organized combat operations with other units, the border security mission proved an excellent training environment for the officers and men of the National Guard, who were again inducted into federal service after the United States declared war on the German Empire in April 1917. Many National Guard leaders in both World Wars traced their first federal service to the Mexican Expedition.

40|$|Typeset in LATEX Pictures where done using xfig and {{inserted}} as Postscript 1 figures 1 Postscript {{is a registered}} trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Abstract Many problems that arise in everyday situations involve guarding or illuminating objects or regions. Some examples are: placing TV-cameras in the local supermarket, positioning radar observation stations in a mountainous terrain, or arranging the lighting in one's living room. The art gallery problem is a famous problem in computational geometry that formally models these types of applications. The problem is that of placing the minimum number of guards in an art gallery so that the whole gallery is seen by the guards. The art gallery is represented geometrically by a polygon in the plane, where the edges correspond to {{the walls of the}} gallery. The geometric interpretation of a guard in this original setting is to be a point in the art gallery representing a static sensor system that can see things along straight lines. As a first step of this work, we generalize the problem to placing either mobile or <b>static</b> <b>guards</b> in a gallery subject to an optimization criterion, and possibly some locality restrictions. In this way, we can model many new practical problems such as guiding robots through a burning building in search of victims, or having robots survey a nuclear reactor. Unfortunately, the original art gallery problem can be shown to be intractable, which also implies that our generalized version is intractable. Hence, we have to content ourselves with solving restricted cases of the problem. This work is divided into two parts where we investigate two variations of the problem. The first part addresses the following specific problem: given an art gallery and the route followed by a robot guarding the gallery, what is the minimum number of points on the route where the robot must engage its sensor system? We show that, in general, this problem is also intractable, but we solve it for some interesting special classes of art galleries...|$|R

The latter {{was to be the}} responsibility of a mobile reserve which provided interior security during wartime - designated Défense Opérationnelle du Territoire (DOT) armoured cavalry regiments. Initially equipped with AMLs and jeeps modified for scouting purposes, these units worked closely with the French police and National Gendarmerie. Their goal was to intercept hostile special forces or airborne units which specialised in deep penetration behind the front line. Secondary tasks included counter-insurgency, passive observation, and <b>guarding</b> <b>static</b> installations.|$|R

50|$|Most M8s and M20s {{remaining}} in US service had been allocated {{to one of}} five reorganized armored cavalry regiments by the early 1950s.

A small number of M20s were modified by US or South Korean forces as assault vehicles equipped with ring-mounted flamethrowers during that conflict. All the US Army M8s and M20s were retired from active duty due to age and increasing obsolescence shortly after the Korean War. The majority of decommissioned vehicles were then shipped abroad as aid to various armies, especially the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, save for a small number which were retained by Army National Guard units.

Although war was declared, the division, serving under Northern Command, still with the 146th, 147th and 148th Infantry Brigades under command, was initially engaged in <b>static</b> defensive duties, <b>guarding</b> vital points and little time was allotted for training. However, training began soon afterwards with the overall intention being that the division, once fully trained, would join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France.

50|$|Although most Elands were {{gradually}} {{removed from}} front-line service with the SADF after 1984, being {{relegated to the}} role of training vehicles for Ratel-90 crews, a large number continued to be deployed by the SWATF during internal counter-insurgency operations against SWAPO. The armoured cars frequently patrolled the roads to deter guerrilla raids and escorted local convoys. South Africa equipped the SWATF with a single regiment of Eland-90s and Eland-60s at its inception in 1980, drawing their crews from local national servicemen. The regiment rarely operated as a cohesive unit. Rather, its squadrons were attached on a rotating basis to a variety of modular infantry battalions. In concert with the supporting infantrymen, Eland crews carried out search and destroy operations, manned road patrols and road checkpoints, and <b>guarded</b> <b>static</b> installations.In August 1987, the SADF launched Operation Moduler to turn back a major FAPLA offensive in southern Angola, sparking the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. During Moduler, the SWATF's 201 Battalion was ordered to deploy as far as north as Ongiva and prevent Angolan units from re-occupying that settlement. For the purposes of this operation they were provided with an oversized squadron of Eland-90s. Most of the infantrymen were armed with a combination of anti-tank rifle grenades and RPG-7s in the event they needed to support the Elands against FAPLA tanks. Due to a shortage of troop-carrying vehicles, some were transported riding atop the armoured cars. They took up concealed positions on the road between Ongiva and Xangongo, and on October 5 a large FAPLA motorised contingent was sighted approaching the settlement, consisting primarily of truck-mounted infantry and a few BTR-60 and BTR-40 armoured personnel carriers. The advance was being screened by a reconnaissance troop of BRDM-2s, which blundered into the killzone and were engaged by the Eland-90s. While taking evasive action, one of the BRDMs drove off the road and collided with an Eland, causing momentary confusion. Most of the FAPLA column was destroyed in the ensuing firefight. Following this incident, FAPLA began deploying the more heavily armed BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles for convoy support purposes in areas where it was likely to encounter South African armour.|$|R
