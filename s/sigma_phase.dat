5000|$|As {{one of the}} {{requirements}} for stress corrosion cracking {{is the presence of}} stress in the components, one method of control is to eliminate that stress, or at least reduce it below the threshold stress for SCC. This is not usually feasible for working stresses (the stress that the component is intended to support), but it may be possible where the stress causing cracking is a residual stress introduced during welding or forming.Residual stresses can be relieved by stress-relief annealing, and this is widely used for carbon steels. These have the advantage of a relatively high threshold stress for most environments, consequently it is relatively easy to reduce the residual stresses to a low enough level. In contrast austenitic stainless steels have a very low threshold stress for chloride SCC. This, combined with the high annealing temperatures that are necessary to avoid other problems, such as sensitization and <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> embrittlement, means that stress relief is rarely successful as a method of controlling SCC for this system.For large structures, for which full stress-relief annealing is difficult or impossible, partial stress relief around welds and other critical areas may be of value. However, this must be done in a controlled way to avoid creating new regions of high residual stress, and expert advice is advisable if this approach is adopted.Stresses can also be relieved mechanically. For example, hydrostatic testing beyond yield will tend to ‘even-out’ the stresses and thereby reduce the peak residual stress. Similarly laser peening, shot-peening, or grit-blasting tend to introduce a surface compressive stress, and are beneficial for the control of SCC. The uniformity with which these processes are applied is important. If, for example, only the weld region is shot-peened, damaging tensile stresses may be created at the border of the peened area. The compressive residual stresses imparted by laser peening are precisely controlled both in location and intensity, and can be applied to mitigate sharp transitions into tensile regions. Laser peening imparts deep compressive residual stresses on the order of 10 to 20 times deeper than conventional shot peening making it significantly more beneficial at preventing SCC. [...] Laser peening is widely used in the aerospace and power generation industries in gas fired turbine engines.|$|E

40|$|MasterDuplex {{stainless}} steels consisting of ferrite and austenite represent excellent mechanical properties and superior corrosion resistance, and accordingly they {{are widely used}} as the structural components for chemical and nuclear power industries. Recently, to meet the need for higher performance (enhanced life in more severe corrosive environment) of materials, hyper duplex {{stainless steels}} with PREN value of over 50 is being developed. However, hyper duplex stainless steels often reveal undesired microstructure after heat treatment at certain temperature range and holding time, resulting in the degradation of excellent properties. One {{of the main reasons}} is known to be due to the precipitation of <b>sigma</b> <b>phase.</b> Therefore, it is important to control the amount of <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> during heating, holding and cooling. In this work, by the addition of various alloy elements, W, Ce, Cu, microstructure and mechanical properties of hyper duplex stainless steel were investigated with the special emphasis on the mechanical properties variation of in relation to precipitation of <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> and chi phase. Based on TTT diagram of secondary phases and the results of mechanical tests, optimum alloy compositions were suggested. Important results obtained in this study is summarized as follows. Toughness was drastically reduced by the precipitation of secondary phases, <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> and chi phase. Increasing the amount of the precipitation of the precipitation of <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> was significantly suppressed, slowing down the toughness reduction of the alloy. However with the increase of the chi phase, the toughness was not noticeably changed. The tensile properties were also changed by the precipitation of secondary phases. The yield strength was increased and the total elongation was reduced with the increase in the amounts of secondary phases. It was observed that the <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> played more important role in influencing the tensile properties because cracks were formed to follow along the <b>sigma</b> <b>phase</b> rather than the chi phase. The ultimate tensile strength was similar between the before and after heat treatment due to the change of hardening rate.
