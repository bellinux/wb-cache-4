Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly at the end of bars, phrases, and sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty-two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different <b>scales</b> <b>for</b> different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>scales</b> <b>for</b> rating the {{strength}} of tornadoes.

An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.|$|E

5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} to cut Nebraska's lead before halftime. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback, and Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 20-yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a carry to the left. From the Tech 40-yard line, Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska's {{half of the}} field. Nebraska committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty. Virginia Tech was forced to use a timeout {{in order to stop}} the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third-down play. With 57 seconds remaining in the first half, Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a five-yard pass to Cornelius White, but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line, Tech was again forced to call a timeout to stop the clock with 25 seconds remaining. On the next play, Druckenmiller completed a six-yard pass to Shawn <b>Scales</b> <b>for</b> Tech's second touchdown of the game. The score came with 19 seconds remaining in the first half, and the extra point was good, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger <b>scales.</b> <b>For</b> example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{examine the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities. Background. Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities is a behavioural rating scale comprising eight subscales that represent different cognitive domains. It is based on observations during contact between nurse and patient. Design. Observational study. Methods. A total of 50 patients from two geriatric wards in acute care hospitals participated in this study. Reliability was examined via internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. Construct validity of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities and its subscales were explored by means of convergent and divergent validity and post hoc analyses for group differences. Results. Cronbach's alpha s of the total Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities and its subscales were 0. 98 and 0. 66 - 0. 93, respectively. The item-total correlations were satisfactory (overall > 0. 4). The intra-class coefficients were good (37 of 39 items > 0. 4). The convergent validity of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities against cognitive ratings (MMSE, NOSGER) and severity of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating) demonstrated satisfactory correlations (0. 59 - 0. 70, p 0. 05). The divergent validity of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities against depressive symptoms was low (0. 12, p > 0. 05). The construct validity of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities subscales against 13 specific neuropsychological tests showed correlations varying from poor to fair (0. 18 - 0. 74; 10 of 13 correlations p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Validity and reliability of the total Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities are excellent. The correlations between the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities subscales and standard neuropsychological tests were moderate. More conclusive results may be found if the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities subscales were to be validated using more ecologically valid tests and in a patient population with less cognitive impairment. Relevance to clinical practice. Use of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities yields standardised, reliable and valid information about patient's cognitive behaviour in daily practice. The Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities aids in tailoring nursing interventions to patients' specific cognitive needs. We advocate the implementation of the Nurses' Observation <b>Scale</b> <b>for</b> Cognitive Abilities both in research and at geriatric units in acute care hospitals...|$|R
