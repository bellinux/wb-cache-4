5|$|As the 1970s progressed, {{silencing}} {{technology in}} submarines rendered acoustic-band sonobuoys and trigger devices ineffective. During 1961 and 1962, the Soviet Union conducted {{research and development}} into an explosive sound system (ESS) – used to locate deep-diving submarines – under the name Udar (Blow). In 1965, work had started on <b>sonobuoy</b> systems using ESS to be integrated with the Berkut radar. The programme was postponed {{when one of the}} aircraft intended to carry it, the Ilyushin Il-38, was found to be incompatible. The developments instead resulted in the Udar-75, which was featured in a new search and targeting system (STS) of the Taganrog-built Tu-142Ms.|$|E
5|$|The main Allied {{detector}} at {{this time}} was the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD). MAD entered service in 1943, only to find its targets had vanished from coastal waters. It was able to plot and recognise distortions in Earth's magnetic field caused by submarines. It took some skill to use and only worked if it was directly above the target. It also was only effective at low altitudes. It had some success in the Gibraltar strait, but was ineffective in British waters owing to different conditions. The only recorded MAD victory in British waters was the sinking of U-1055 on 30 April 1945 off Ushant. Another invention was the American 3-cm radar and <b>sonobuoy.</b> These devices, along with the Mark 24 Mine (Fido), {{was responsible for the}} destruction of U-905 and U-296, sunk by No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 120 Squadron RAF.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} involved: two Garrett/Honeywell TPE-331-15AW turboprop engines, each {{rated at}} 1,227kW (1,645 shp), with four-blade propellers. The upgrade also included new mission equipment of AN/AQS-92F digital <b>sonobuoy</b> processor, A/NARR-84 99-channel <b>sonobuoy</b> receiver, Litton AN/APS-504 radar, AN/ASQ-504 MAD and AN/AAS-40 FLIR. The new turboprop engines {{resulted in a}} payload increase of 500kg. Usually carries depth charges, Mk. 44, and Mk 46 lightweight ASW homing torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose <b>sonobuoys</b> relay {{various types}} of oceanographic data to a ship, aircraft, or satellite. There are three types of {{special-purpose}} <b>sonobuoys</b> in use today. These <b>sonobuoys</b> are not designed for use in submarine detection or localization.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the defense}} {{products}} Magnavox manufactured were the AN/ARC-164 UHF radio, AN/SSQ-53 series <b>sonobuoys,</b> AN/ALQ-128 EW equipment, AN/SSQ-62 series <b>sonobuoys,</b> and the Advanced Field Artillery Data System (AFATDS).|$|R
50|$|Active <b>sonobuoys,</b> {{containing}} a sonar transmitter and receiver, can be dropped from fixed-wing {{maritime patrol aircraft}} (e.g., P-3, Nimrod, Chinese Y-8, Russian and Indian Bear ASW variants), antisubmarine helicopters, and carrier-based antisubmarine aircraft (e.g., S-3). While {{there have been some}} efforts to use other aircraft simply as carriers of <b>sonobuoys,</b> the general assumption is that the sonobuoy-carrying aircraft can issue commands to the <b>sonobuoys</b> and receive, and to some extent process, their signals.|$|R
25|$|General Atomics {{hopes to}} test a <b>sonobuoy</b> launch {{capability}} from the Guardian in 2016 to demonstrate its ability to carry them, control them, and send information {{back to the ground}} station over a SATCOM link.|$|E
25|$|Normal crew access was via {{a ladder}} on the aft {{bulkhead}} of the nosewheel well to a hatch {{on the left}} side of the wheel well, then forward to the observer nose or up through another hatch to the main deck. There was also a hatch in the floor of the aft fuselage, near the <b>sonobuoy</b> chutes.|$|E
25|$|Acoustic {{searching for}} North Pacific right whales {{has been done}} with two types of {{listening}} devices. Directional and ranging <b>sonobuoy</b> are floating devices that are deployed from ships are monitored for {{short periods of time}} (hours) from ships. Alternate listening devices are permanently moored acoustic recorders that acoustically sample over long periods (months) until the acoustic is retrieved by a ship.|$|E
50|$|Helicopters can be {{used for}} antisubmarine warfare by {{deploying}} fields of active/passive <b>sonobuoys</b> or can operate dipping sonar, such as the AQS-13. Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy <b>sonobuoys</b> and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them. Processing from the <b>sonobuoys</b> or Dipping Sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship. Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS-20A.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sonobuoys</b> are {{classified}} into three categories: active, passive and special purpose.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s an {{ammunition}} quality evaluation unit was added by the Bureau {{to expand its}} quality control system. As the complexity and sophistication of weapons increased in the 1950s and 1960s, Crane’s activities, capabilities and expertise expanded in scope under the newly formed Bureau of Weapons to include small arms, <b>sonobuoy</b> surveillance, microwave tubes, POLARIS missiles and other scientific and engineering support to the Bureau.|$|E
25|$|CH-124B2 : 6 CH-124B's were {{upgraded}} to the CH-124B2 standard in 1991-1992. The revised CH-124B2 retained the <b>sonobuoy</b> processing gear to passively detect submarines but, the aircraft was now also {{fitted with a}} towed-array sonar to supplement the ship's sonar. Since anti-submarine warfare {{is no longer a}} major priority within the Canadian Forces, the CH-124B2 were refitted again to become improvised troop carriers for the newly formed Standing Contingency Task Force.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, the Fleet Air Arm were {{patrolling the}} North Sea and the GIUK gap for patrol and {{potentially}} anti-submarine warfare {{in search of}} Whiskey, Zulu and Foxtrot submarines. Patrol aircraft operated from RAF Ballykelly in Northern Ireland. A means was needed for the initial detection of submarines in the area. Once detected, other methods such as radar or <b>sonobuoy</b> hydrophones {{could be used to}} track and target the contact.|$|E
40|$|This report treats part of {{the problem}} of optimal {{placement}} of <b>sonobuoys</b> with the purpose of detecting and tracking hostile submarines in a shallow water, archipelagic scenario. The methods - the Hyperbolic Fix Method and the Sonar Equation - used to estimate the position of a submarine and its stochastic variance using (simulated) passive <b>sonobuoys</b> are described. Finally, the function and architecture of the currently completed programs PathEd and SubTrack version 1, are described.

25|$|Other sonars {{such as the}} {{airborne}} sonar Mihir are in trials, whilst work is proceeding apace on {{a new generation of}} sonars. Sonars may be considered one of DRDO's most successful achievements as the Indian Navy's most powerful ships rely on DRDO made sonars. The standard fit for a front line naval ship would include the HUMSA-NG hull mounted sonar and the Nagin towed array sonar. The Mihir is a dunking sonar meant for use by the Naval ALH, working in conjunction with its Tadpole <b>sonobuoy.</b> The Panchendriya is in production for the Kilo class submarine upgrades.|$|E
25|$|Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) {{fire control}} radars are {{installed}} {{one on the}} roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The <b>sonobuoy</b> processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.|$|E
25|$|The P-1 is {{equipped}} with many newly developed technology and features, particularly {{in terms of its}} avionics and missions systems. One such key feature is the use of a fly-by-light flight control system. This has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to the sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system. Various onboard systems are provided by Honeywell, who is the largest non-Japanese supplier to the project, such as the auxiliary power unit, environmental and pressurization control systems, ram air turbine, <b>sonobuoy</b> dispensers and elements of the avionics.|$|E

25|$|The Nimrod MR2 {{carried out}} three main roles – Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti-Surface Unit Warfare (ASUW) and Search and Rescue (SAR). Its {{extended}} range enabled {{the crew to}} monitor maritime areas far {{to the north of}} Iceland and up to 4,000km out into the Western Atlantic. With Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR), range and endurance was greatly extended. The crew consisted of two pilots and one flight engineer, two navigators (one tactical navigator and a routine navigator), one Air Electronics Officer (AEO), the <b>sonobuoy</b> sensor team of two Weapon System Operators (WSOp ACO) and four Weapon System Operators (WSOp EW) to manage passive and active electronic warfare systems.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates.

2500|$|Active sonar uses a sound {{transmitter}} and a receiver. [...] When {{the two are}} in the same place it is monostatic operation. [...] When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation. [...] When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation. [...] Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. [...] Active <b>sonobuoy</b> fields may be operated multistatically.|$|E
