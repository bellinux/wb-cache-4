5|$|On 30 November 1974, an {{assassination}} attempt was made on Kiep, during which a man fired three <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> {{the door of his}} sauna, though he remained uninjured. The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive. As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later, some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas.

5|$|The U.S. {{struggled}} {{to move to}} the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi.|$|E

5|$|The insurgents were poorly armed, and {{eventually}} were {{overwhelmed by the}} tsarist regular military. Most of the barricades fell by 24 June; {{the last of the}} barricades (in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest—including occasional <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> police or military patrols—would continue for days afterwards.|$|E
5|$|This officer, to {{encourage}} his regiment; {{which had never}} before been in action, and which had been ordered to lie down to protect itself from the enemy's fire, arose to his feet, advanced in front of the line, and himself fired several <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the enemy at short range, being fully exposed to their fire at the time.|$|E

Two of the women reportedly fired <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft {{does not move}} forward, but hovers {{in front of the}} boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's <b>shots.</b> <b>At</b> the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E

5|$|Later that day, {{the ship}} {{captured}} a barge {{out from under}} the guns of Fort Powell, a fortification guarding another entrance to Mobile Bay further north. Chickasaw fired 25 <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the fort and was struck once, another hit on her smokestack. On 6 August, the ship bombarded Fort Gaines for two hours in support of troops besieging the fort. Beginning on 13 August, she intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan until the fort surrendered on 23 August. Between 15–17 August, Chickasaw was operating further north in Mobile Bay and engaged several of the ships defending Mobile without result.|$|E

5|$|Norwich {{got back}} into the game against Chelsea with a goal from Anthony Pilkington but conceded two late goals to finish 1–3 to the visitors. This was {{followed}} up with a 4–1 away defeat by Arsenal. The home fixture against Cardiff City finished in controversy during when Leroy Fer put the ball {{in the back of the}} net when passing the ball back to goalkeeper David Marshall. This resulted in a melee in which both Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing to control their players. The game was also notable with Norwich having 31 <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> goal despite the game finishing as a draw.|$|E

40|$|In the epistemic steps, we {{approach}} a competitive performance behavior model build after a quantitativeanalysis of certain {{data collected from}} the official International Handball Federation protocols on theperformance of the first four teams of the World Men's Handball Championship - Croatia 2009, duringsemifinals and finals. This model {{is a part of}} the integrative (global) model of the handball game, which will be graduallyinvestigated during the following research. I have started the construction of this model from the premise that the finalization represents theessence of the game. The components of our model, in a prioritized order: <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the goal from 9 m- 15 p; <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the goalfrom 6 m- 12 p; <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the goal from 7 m- 12 p; fast break <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the goal - 11, 5 p; wing <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the goal - 8, 5 p;penetration <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the goal - 7 p...|$|R

After this he was quiet with few possessions and left the field with cramp in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{won their}} last major trophy in 1973, in a 1–0 victory over Don Revie's Leeds United in the FA Cup Final.

Ian Porterfield scored a volley in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have equalled Sunderland's {{achievement}} of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.|$|E

This {{was the first time the}} Ravens had ever defeated the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the goal.

They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above the surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
