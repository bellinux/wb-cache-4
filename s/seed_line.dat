Two species {{that have been}} selected as <b>seed</b> <b>lines</b> for flowering pot plant markets are Brunonia australis (Goodeniaceae) and Calandrinia sp. (Portulacaceae). B. australis is an annual or perennial herb that produces blue inflorescences on tall slender stalks. Calandrinia sp. (not yet fully classified) is a succulent herb with violet to pink flowers and a contrasting throat. Developing these species as new <b>seed</b> <b>lines</b> requires knowledge of the environmental factors that regulate seed germination, vegetative growth and flowering to allow potential growers to schedule flowering and meet market requirements. For many species, temperature, daylength and light intensity are the main factors that control flowering when water and nutrients are non-limiting. However, juvenility and the stage of plant development can alter plant responses to environmental stimuli. Development and flowering requirements of B. australis and Calandrinia sp. were investigated using controlled growth environments and field trials {{with a focus on}} seed germination, juvenility, floral ontogeny, time to flowering and growth habit. The outcomes of these studies, benefits to floriculture and future work are discussed.

40|$|The {{inheritance}} of seed coat color in B. carinata was studied in crosses between two yellow <b>seeded</b> <b>lines,</b> and one brown <b>seeded</b> <b>line.</b> <b>Seed</b> coat color in these crosses {{was controlled by}} two alleles at one locus with repression of pigmentation incompletely dominant over pigment production. Agronomic and quality characteristics of B. carinata cultivars and lines were compared with those for B. napus, B. campestris and B. juncea cultivars. In tests at Saskatoon in 1984 and 1985 B. carinata cultivars and lines were lower in seed yield, oil percentage and fibre content but had higher protein levels than standard cultivars of other Brassica species. The association of seed coat color with seed weight, oil, protein and crude fibre content of B. carinata was investigated. Yellow <b>seeded</b> <b>lines</b> produced heavier <b>seed</b> (0. 3 g/lOOO seeds), higher oil (2. 2 %) and protein (2. 1 %) and lower crude fibre content (1. 3 %) than brown <b>seeded</b> <b>lines</b> from the same genetic background. In addition, seed weight {{was positively correlated with}} oil and protein and negatively correlated with fibre content in both yellow and brown seeded populations. Low erucic acid plants were grown from half seeds of the BC 1 F 2 generation of the interspecific cross of (B. carinata cv. S- 67 X B. juncea Zem 2330) X (B. carinata cv. Dodola). The presence of low erucic alleles in both genomes of these low erucic acid plants may have resulted from either a substitution of all or part of a chromosome or from crossing over between chromosomes of the A and C genomes. The development of low glucosinolate B. carinata was studied in an interspecific cross involving the allylglucosinolate type B. carinata cv. Dodola and the 3 -butenylglucosinolate type B. juncea line 60143. Three allylglucosinolate type BClF 2 plants with an approximately 50 % reduction in allylglucosinolate content were identified following a backcross to the cultivar Dodola. It has been demonstrated that interspecific crossing of selected B. carinata and B. juncea lines can be used in the development of low erucic, reduced glucosinolate B. carinata.

5000|$|The {{selection}} committee uses {{a number of}} factors to place teams on the S-curve, including record, strength of schedule, and the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). Relative subjective comparison of individual teams close on the S-Curve are also considered. Though the brackets only feature the seed numbers 1-16 in each region, the committee assembles an S-curve of teams seeded from 1 through 68. In theory, the teams 1-4 on the seed list will all be #1 seeds (the #1 [...] "seed line"), 5-8 will be #2 seeds (the #2 <b>seed</b> <b>line),</b> and so on; however, bracketing rules often lead to some deviation from this. The S-curve is most important for keeping each region balanced, the ideal being that each region will be equally strong. For example, the committee will try to ensure that the number 1 team on the seed list, the national #1 seed, will be in the same region as the weakest #2 seed. The committee tries to ensure that the top four seeds in each region are comparable to the top four teams in every other region. For example, if one region has the best #1 seed (#1 overall), the weakest #2 seed (#8 overall), the best #3 seed (#9 overall), and the weakest #4 seed (#16 overall), its seeds add up to 34, the ideal number. But if a region has the best team for every given seed, its seeds would add up to 28, and a region with the weakest team in every seed would add up to 40, making the two regions very unbalanced. It is extremely unusual that an at-large bid can be lower than a #12 seed, but it has occurred, most recently with BYU and Iona being #14 seeds in the 2012 Tournament. While the seeds are almost never perfectly balanced throughout the four regions, the committee strives to ensure that they differ from each other by only a few points. The process is identical for the women's tournament, with the exception that seeding occurs to 64.|$|E

40|$|Seed vigor, {{although}} not well understood, {{is a key}} critical component for yield and is {{in part due to}} a well establishment and vigorous stand of canola (Brassica napus) seedling under less than ideal conditions in Western Canada. My objective was to determine what constitutes vigor by studying the response of a black <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> and a yellow <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> imbibed at 8 ºC in either water, saline or osmotic solutions, abscisic acid (ABA), ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, gibberellin (GA 4 + 7), inhibitor of GA biosynthesis and a germination promoter, fusicoccin. Also tested was the effect of seed coat (testa) on seed germination rate and percent germination. Previous studies have established that seed vigor is in part hormonal controlled and genetically controlled. In our study, gene expression was investigated by using transcriptome analysis and hormonal analysis was used to quantitate the changes in hormones and their metabolites during germination. Both the black and the yellow canola seed lines were very sensitive to increasing concentrations of saline and osmotic solutions; however, at the same osmotic potential, osmotic solutions were more inhibitory. The yellow <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> was more sensitive to these conditions than the black <b>seed</b> <b>line.</b> As expected, ABA delayed seed germination, whereas GA 4 + 7 enhanced seed germination and GA 4 + 7 partially overcame the inhibitory effect of ABA. The seed coat was a major factor affecting the germination rate of the yellow seed line; however, GA 4 + 7 overcame the inhibitory effect of the seed coat, whereas ABA exacerbated it. Fusicoccin was more stimulatory to germination than GA 4 + 7; however, unlike GA 4 + 7, it was unable to overcome the inhibitory effect of paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor. Fluridone, an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, was unable to overcome the inhibitory effects of a saline solution suggesting that the inhibitory effect was not due to elevated ABA levels. Ethylene, a stimulator of germination, {{did not appear to be}} involved in the germination of these two lines. Controlled deterioration at 35 ºC, 85 % RH was either partially or completely overcome by exogenous GA 4 + 7. This study demonstrates that the role of hormones, salinity and seed coat on the germination of canola seed under low temperature environmental conditions. During germination, ABA declined while GA 4 increased. Higher ABA was found in un-germinated seeds compared to germinated seeds. GA 4 + 7 was lower in seeds imbibed in the saline solution compared to seeds imbibed in water. Un-germinated seeds imbibed in ABA had lower GA 4 + 7 compared to un-germinated seeds imbibed in water; however, the contents of GA 4 + 7 were similar for germinated seeds imbibed in either water or ABA. Phaseic acid (PA) and dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) increased in seeds imbibed in either water, the saline solution or ABA, while they decreased in seeds imbibed in GA 4 + 7. In addition, we found that ABA inhibited GA 4 biosynthesis, whereas, GA had no effect on ABA biosynthesis, but altered the ABA catabolic pathway. Gene expression profiles revealed that there are significant differences between un-germinated and germinated seeds. Seeds imbibed in water, GA 4 + 7, a saline solution or ABA had different gene profiles. LEA genes, hormone-related genes, hydrolase-related genes and specific seed germination-related genes were identified and their expression profiles were finely associated with seed germination performance...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned a SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) gene from Medicago truncatula (MtSERK 1) and {{examined}} its expression in culture using real time PCR. In {{the presence of}} the auxin 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) alone, root differentiation occurs from the proliferating calli in both the cultured highly embryogenic <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> (2 HA) and a low to nonembryogenic <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> (M. truncatula cv Jemalong). Auxin stimulated MtSERK 1 expression in both 2 HA and M. truncatula cv Jemalong. Embryo induction in proliferating calli requires a cytokinin in M. truncatula and unlike root formation is substantively induced in 2 HA, not M. truncatula cv Jemalong. On embryo induction medium containing NAA and the cytokinin 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP), expression of MtSERK 1 is elevated within 2 d of initiation of culture in both M. truncatula cv Jemalong and 2 HA. However, MtSERK 1 expression is much higher when both NAA and BAP are in the medium. BAP potentiates the NAA induction because MtSERK 1 expression is not up-regulated by BAP alone. The 2 HA genotype is able to increase its embryo formation because of the way it responds to cytokinin, but not because of the cytokinin effect on MtSERK 1. Although the studies with M. truncatula indicate that somatic embryogenesis is associated with high SERK expression, auxin alone does not induce somatic embryogenesis as in carrot (Daucus carota) and Arabidopsis. Auxin in M. truncatula induces roots, and there is a clear up-regulation of MtSERK 1. Although our analyses suggest that MtSERK 1 is orthologous to AtSERK 1, which in Arabidopsis is involved in somatic embryogenesis, in legumes, MtSERK 1 may have a broader role in morphogenesis in cultured tissue rather than being specific to somatic embryogenesis...|$|E

Fourteen of these Wfteen lines were found to be homozygous for the dominant fuzzless seed allele N 1. Only one line was homozygous for the recessive fuzzless seed allele n 2. The measured lint percent of each line was very stable through time, however, large variability existed between many of the N 1 lines ranging from 0. 7 to 23. 6 % lint. The lint percent for the n 2 line was 24. 4 %. Scanning electron microscopy was used to diVer-entiate patterns of lint initiation on 1 day post anthesis ovules. General patterns included: Wrst, lint initiation restricted to the chalazal end of the seed crest; second, lint initiation along the seed crest and laterally around the chalazal end of the ovule; and third, lint initiation covered all but the micropylar end of the ovule.

40|$|Cotton is an {{important}} crop {{in the world and}} is a major source of oil for human consumption and cotton meal for livestock. Cottonseed nutrition (seed composition: protein, oil, and minerals) determine the quality of seeds. Therefore, maintaining optimum levels of cottonseed nutrition is critical. Physiological and genetic mechanisms controlling the levels of these constituents in cottonseed are still largely unknown. Our previous research conducted under greenhouse conditions showed that seed and leaf nutrition differed between fuzzless and fuzzy seed isolines. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate the seed fuzz phenotype (trait) effects on seed protein, oil, N, C, S, and minerals in five sets of near-isogenic mutant cotton lines for seed fuzz in a two-year experiment under field condition to evaluate the stability of the effect of the trait on seed nutrition. The isolines (genotypes) in each set differ for the seed fuzz trait (fuzzless/linted <b>seed</b> <b>line,</b> N lines, and fuzzy/linted <b>seed</b> <b>line,</b> F lines). Results showed that seed protein was higher in the fuzzy genotype in all sets, but seed oil was higher in fuzzless genotype in all sets. The concentrations of seed Ca and C were higher in all fuzzless genotypes, but N, S, B, Fe, and Zn were higher in most of the fuzzy genotypes. Generally, minerals were higher in leaves of F lines, suggesting the translocation of minerals from leaves to seeds was limited. The research demonstrated that fiber development could be involved in cottonseed composition. This {{may be due to the}} involvement of fiber development in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and the mobility of nutrients from leaves (source) to seed (sink). This information is beneficial to breeders to consider fuzzless cottonseed for potential protein and oil use and select for higher oil or higher protein content, and to physiologists to further understand the mobility of minerals to increase the quality of cottonseed nutrition for food and feed...|$|E

40|$|Background: The Medicago truncatula 2 HA <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> {{is highly}} embryogenic while the parental line Jemalong rarely {{produces}} embryos. The 2 HA line was developed {{from one of}} the rare Jemalong regenerates and this method for obtaining a highly regenerable genotype in M. truncatula is readily reproducible suggesting an epigenetic mechanism. Microarray transcriptomic analysis showed down regulation of an ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 -like gene in 2 HA callus which provided an approach to investigating epigenetic regulation of genes related to ethylene signalling and the 2 HA phenotype. Ethylene is involved in many developmental processes including somatic embryogenesis (SE) and is associated with stress responses. Results: Microarray transcriptomic analysis showed a significant number of up-regulated transcripts in 2 HA tissue culture, including nodule and embryo specific genes and transposon-like genes, while only a few genes were down-regulated, including an EIN 3 -like gene we called MtEIL 1. This reduced expression was associated with ethylene insensitivity of 2 HA plants that was further investigated. The weak ethylene insensitivity affected root and nodule development. Sequencing of MtEIL 1 found no difference between 2 HA and wild-type plants. DNA methylation analysis of MtEIL 1 revealed significant difference between 2 HA and wild-type plants. Tiling arrays demonstrated an elevated level of miRNA in 2 HA plants that hybridised to the antisense strand of the MtEIL 1 gene. AFLP-like methylation profiling revealed more differences in DNA methylation between 2 HA and wild-type. Segregation analysis demonstrated the recessive nature of the eil 1 phenotype and the dominant nature of the SE trait. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that EIL 1 of Medicago truncatula (MtEIL 1) is epigenetically silenced in the 2 HA <b>seed</b> <b>line.</b> The possible cause is an elevated level of miRNA that targets its 3 'UTR and is also associated with DNA methylation of MtEIL 1. Down regulation of MtEIL 1 makes it possible to form nodules in the presence of ethylene and affects root growth under normal conditions. Segregation analysis showed no association between MtEIL 1 expression and SE in culture but the role and mechanism of ethylene signalling in the process of plant regeneration through SE requires further investigation. The work also suggests that epigenetic changes to a particular gene induced in culture can be fixed in regenerated plants...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is {{a mechanism}} with great importance in plant fitness and it inhibits seed germination until is broken and seeds can germinate under optimal environmental conditions favorable for successful reproduction. Primary dormancy is contingent {{to the environment}} that seeds and the mother plant experience. Temperature {{is a major factor}} participating in the regulation of this complex trait. High and low levels of dormancy are induced during seed maturation by cold and warm temperatures respectively but the mechanism at the basis of temperature signaling in seeds is not well understood. Climate change and increased weather variability threaten the constant supply of high quality seeds into the market hence agriculture productivity. Therefore, understanding and taking control of the molecular mechanism behind the regulation of seed dormancy and germination will help to control and predict seed behavior in the field. Here I describe and discuss a forward genetic screen for the selection of mutant <b>seed</b> <b>lines</b> with altered <b>seed</b> dormancy in response to cool temperature during seed set. Putative mutant <b>seed</b> <b>lines</b> designated awake 1 to awake 52, were preliminarily characterized. Eleven awake lines were selected for further analysis and one was investigated in more detail. It was revealed that awake 1 seeds shares common phenotype with seeds of a suberin deficient mutant which were previously reported to display increased dormancy but, here, I show they also display a reduction of seed dormancy. Segregation analysis suggests that the reduced dormancy phenotype is maternally inherited as the suberin deficient mutants. Also, transcriptomic analysis shows that many suberin associated genes are temperature-regulated. I conclude that control of suberin deposition {{may play a role in}} the regulation of dormancy in response to cool temperature...|$|R

In addition, the largest firms are increasingly networked through agreements to cross-license transgenic seed traits. seed industry; consolidation; concentration; oligopoly; information graphics...|$|R
40|$|Preparing silicon wafers is a tedious {{multi-step}} {{process that}} includes etching, polishing, and cleaning. The minimum wafer thickness attainable in current high volume wafer production processes is generally 160 to 300 µm, and the kerf loss for these processes {{is up to}} 40 % of the total volume. Thin silicon wafers (~ 30 to 100 µm) are very expensive to produce and the wafering process is not cost effective due to the high amount of material loss (more than 80 % at these dimensions) during {{the process and the}} risk of breakage of the wafers during wafering. In this thesis, a new method called Vapour-Liquid Interface Growth (VLIG) is proposed. VLIG is capable of directly growing a sheet of single crystal silicon without wafering with a thickness of about 30 to 50 µm. The features of the process are 1) low temperature operation; 2) the resulting silicon sheet is easily detachable and self-supporting; 3) the resulting sheet has uniform thickness and is single crystal. The system operates in a supersaturated growth solution of an indium-silicon melt. A <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> in a substrate facing down is employed. A layer of single crystal silicon grows on the see...|$|E

Several {{kinds of}} main stalk and stubble processing technologies and corresponding machines used in Liaoning Province are researched in this paper. The key parameters influenced stubble chopping are analyzed {{on the basis}} of understanding the principles of “ 2 BISJ- 2110 precision planter”. In order to solve the shortcoming of disturbing much soil and more power loss of“ 2 BISJ- 2110 precision planter ” and achieve saving materials, reduce the cost and the water massive disappearing due to the agitation of the soil, entire stubble chopping is changed to <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> stubble chopping. Using the computer VB language to study the parameters of stalks and stubbles according to mathematical model about coulter ends and the path. In order to realize the narrow band and shallow treatment of the stalks and stubbles, taking single ridge width as 100 - 110 mm and using the Solidwork software to design and draw rotary blade, L stubble breaking blade, cutter head,blade holder, roller and so on. 2 kinds of feasible knife roll disposition plans are presented, which provides a design basis for new type narrow band rotary cultivation stalk and stubble chopper...|$|E
40|$|Twin-line (two seed lines 7. 25 in apart per bed) and {{conventional}} single <b>seed</b> <b>line</b> per bed cotton production systems were compared at 16 sites across Arizona and Blythe, Ca. in 2002. The twin-line system produced more lint than the conventional single-line system at 4 of 16 locations; the yields of the twinline and single-line systems were 1273 and 1186 lb/acre, 1572 and 1461 lb/acre, 1478 and 1290 lb/acre, and 1309 and 1210 lb/acre, respectively, at the Grasty, Ramona, Rovey, and Wells sites, respectively. There {{were no significant}} differences in yield or fiber micronaire in 7 of the 16 experiments. The twin-line system produced less lint than the conventional system at 5 of 16 locations; yields of the twin-line and single-line systems were 2019 and 2189 lb/acre, 1400 and 1489 lb/acre, 1537 and 1845 lb/acre, 1065 and 1200 lb/acre, and 1271 and 1431 lb/acre, respectively, at the Chaffin (75 K), Cooley, Hull, Papago, and Wakimoto sites, respectively. Fiber micronaire was reduced in five experiments; the micronaire values were 4. 25 and 4. 73, 4. 46 and 4. 78, 4. 60 and 4. 85, 4. 76 and 4. 98, and 4. 93 and 5. 15, in the twin-line and single-line systems, respectively, at the Rogers, Papago, Grasty, Hull, and Perry sites, respectively.

40|$|Early {{characterization}} of genotypes, through the previous assessment of physiological {{quality of their}} seeds and their enzymatic systems, can provide parameters capable of aiding {{in the selection of}} new maize cultivars tolerant to water stress. Thus, this study was aimed at assessing seed performance of five different maize lines subjected to four different water stress levels. The physiological quality of seeds germinated under the osmotic potentials of 0. 0, - 0. 3, - 0. 6 and - 0. 9 MPa was assessed by germination test, number of strong normal seedlings and T 50, {{as well as by the}} expression of the isozymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), esterase (EST), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and of heat-resistant proteins. The osmotic potential of - 0. 9 MPa affected the physiological quality and vigor of seeds of all maize lines assessed. The highest values for the germination percent, in the lowest osmotic potentials assessed, were found in the <b>seeds</b> of <b>line</b> 63. However, <b>seeds</b> of <b>line</b> 91 were superior in regard to vigor. Increased expression of the enzymes SOD and CAT, considered as enzymes of the antioxidant system, was observed in <b>seeds</b> of <b>lines</b> 44 and 91. Thus, line 91 was considered as promising for tolerance to water stress...|$|R
40|$|Amaranthus tuberculatus (Common Waterhemp) is a prevalent, {{problematic}} weed in Midwestern USA, where genetically-modified {{crops are}} widely grown, resulting in multiple annual applications of glyphosate. Such practices provide the selection pressure for {{the evolution of}} glyphosate resistance. Evolutionary theory predicts that adaptation to novel stresses, such as herbicide application, will incur a cost in the original (herbicide-free) environment. This project aims to identify whether glyphosate resistance in a population of Amaranthus tuberculatus was associated with a fitness cost in the absence of glyphosate. Initial dose response experiments on the study population determined a resistance index of 3. 2 compared to a standard sensitive population. To generate appropriate material for comparisons between phenotypes, individual plants were cloned and their resistance status determined by glyphosate application. Parent plants were designated as resistant or susceptible and appropriate crosses were performed to generate <b>seed</b> <b>lines.</b> The incomplete segregation of resistant and susceptible <b>seed</b> <b>lines</b> indicated that resistance was controlled by a quantitative trait. EPSPS gene amplification was elucidated as the primary mechanism of glyphosate resistance. There was a strong positive relationship between half-sibling seed family LD 50 and relative EPSPS gene copy number indicating that resistance was primarily caused by target-site gene amplification. Subsequent fitness experiments used seed families to determine that no fitness trade-off was associated with resistance (or gene copy number) when plants are grown without competition, in glasshouse and polytunnel growth environments. However, a small growth penalty was associated with elevated gene copy number in plants grown in a polytunnel, without competition (10 % biomass reduction at + 20 EPSPS copies), this led to competition experiments. A fitness cost was associated with resistance under intra-phenotypic competition; however, the cost was mitigated under inter-specific competition with maize. A cost was associated with glyphosate resistance and this cost was influenced by interactions with biotic and abiotic factors...|$|R
