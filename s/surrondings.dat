50|$|Mostly {{the same}} as the {{original}} biblical story, but with notable differences such as, once again, the expanded and sympathetic role of Delilah (Bauer), the introduction of the garrison commander (Stern) who is friends with Samson (Hamilton), more focus upon Samson's relationship with his first wife, a different handling of the 30 garments bet, and, perhaps the most crucial alteration is to the climax. In the original story, maintained in the 1949 film and the 1996 TV remake, is that Samson only regains his strength after his hair has grown long again, thus allowing him to tear down the Philistine temple. Here, however, Samson is taken to the Philistine temple just after his hair has been cut short, and he prays to God to restore his immense strength despite his short hair, and God complies, allowing Samson enough strength to tear down the stone pillars, thus destroying the temple. Delilah is saved through what looks like the intervention of Jehovah. She then brings the body of Samson home to his tribe. Also Philistea is portrayed as a theocracy with the high priest of Dagon as overlord.One might note that good philistines , most notably Delielah and her <b>surrondings</b> are given an egyptaic air while evil ones have a rather mediterranean air. Indeed the philistines were originally a european people related to the greek that entered the middle east through the doric migrrations around 1200 BC.|$|E

40|$|The {{web based}} {{learning}} resources {{is believed to}} be playing {{an active role in the}} learning environment of higher education today. This qualitative study is exploring how students at Bergen University College incorporate web-based learning resources in their learning activities. At the core of this research is the problem of retrieving good web-resources after their first discovery. Usefull and knowledge granting web-resources are discovered within a context of topics, objectives. It is here argued that this knowledge of the <b>surrondings</b> of the resource is valuable to keep. Not only the resource itself but also the relations the resource have to the surronding topics it was initially discovered within. The result from the study is a partial proposal of a online learning model for a new learning platform fascilitating use and sharing of Web Based learning resources in Bergen University College. Visual Concept maps are good tools to show relationships between topics. By organizing learning resources visually in a concept map, a bigger understanding can be achieved by the student. By constructing shared mindmaps, students can mediate their knowledge within their community on common topics...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} how adolescents experience having asthma. Data was recorded from 39 adolescents, 18 girls and 21 boys, interviewed by using Focus Groups. Mean age was 14 year (12 to 16 years). They were observed and interviewed within 7 groups. Most (80 %) had had asthma for more than 10 years. All but two, used inhaled steroids. Only 33 % had experienced respiratory symptoms more than once a week during the last 14 days. The adolescents did not experience themselves as having a disease, and to discuss having asthma with other youths were unusual for most. Some felt that they had to deal with a demanding environment without the aid of a supportive network. They expressed mistrust by teachers and friends related to physical training and school activities as most traumatically. Adolescents are at high risk for poor outcomes from asthma owing to lifestyle and developmental changes. The result of the study suggest a need to better inform the people in the adolescent´s <b>surrondings</b> (i. e. school teachers and friends) about asthma. Teachers and parents have an important task: to find physically challenging activities as well as leisure activities that strengthen the adolescent´s selfesteem and ability to cope with their asthma. The focus group´s methods allowed the adolescents to experience a supportive social enviroment and created openness conserning their health problems. There is a need for further studies about the adolescents, chronic disease and quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Available X-ray {{data are}} {{collected}} and organized concerning the iron and gas content of galaxy clusters and groups, {{together with the}} optical luminosity, mass and iron abundance of cluster galaxies. Moving from such a restricted number of cluster parameters several astrophysical inferences are drawn. These include the evidence for rich clusters having evolved without much baryon exchange with their <b>surrondings,</b> and having experienced very similar star formation histories. Groups are much gas-poor compared to clusters, and appear instead to have shed a major fraction of their original cosmic share of baryons, which indicates that galaxy clusters cannot have formed by assembling groups similar {{to the present day}} ones. It is argued that this favors low-Ω universes, in which the growth of rich clusters is virtually complete at high redshifts. It is also argued that elemental abundances in clusters are nearly solar, which is consistent with a similar proportion of supernovae of Type Ia and Type II having enriched both the solar neghborhood as well clusters as a whole. Much of the iron in clusters appears to reside in the intracluster medium rather than inside galaxies, the precise ratio being a function of the Hubble constant. It appears that the baryon to star conversion in clusters has been nearly as efficient as currently adopted for the universe as a whole. Yet the metallicity of the clusters is ∼ 5 times higher than the global metallicity adopted for the nearby universe. It is concluded that the intergalactic medium should have a metallicity ∼ 1 / 3 solar if stellar nucleosynthesis has proceeded in stars within field galaxies with the same efficiency as in stars within clusters of galaxies...|$|E
40|$|The liver is {{the largest}} gland and, apart from the skin, also the biggest organ in the body. They are a central {{laboratory}} for processing proteins, carbohidrates and fat, and they also detoxify our body. Liver failure {{is a result of}} cronic or acute liver disease or hepatic impairment. Many diseases of the liver are accompained by icterus as a result of increased level of bilirubin in the system. Today we can live without other organs important for metabolism, such as eg. the kidney or pancreas, because their function can be replaced. But we cannot live without the liver because their functions are too varied and complex. Therefore, when we have incurable disease of the liver we need liver transplantation. Life with a child who needs liver transplantation is very hard for all family members. Especially at the begining of treatment, life for all family members, and in particular for the parents, is very stressfull. Nurses must have sufficinet knowledge, she should {{be able to talk to}} parents in plain language with a high degree of optimism. We make them feel that they are not alone and we encourage them. Nurses must believe in successful treatment, so that they can inspire courage in parents. Quality of life is not in perfection, but rather in the way how we manage to live with imperfection. A person who is in any way affected, can perceive his quality of life as very good. Here, his personal attitude and attitude to his <b>surrondings</b> is most important. This is a higher quality than that obtainable by knowledge alone and which can be measured or evaluated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo conhecer as concepções de educadores sobre o enfrentamento de circunstâncias envolvendo álcool e outras drogas no contexto escolar, seja pelo consumo ou pelo tráfico de substâncias ilícitas. A partir de um enfoque teórico ancorado na teoria das representações sociais, entendida como um conhecimento socialmente elaborado e partilhado por um conjunto social, procurou-se entender as construções sociais e a produção de sentidos evocadas pelo tema drogas e escola. As construções teóricas abordaram temas como marcos legais e as políticas públicas sobre drogas, contextos de vulnerabilidade juvenil e o conceito de situações-problema na escola. Essas concepções foram complementadas com outros referenciais teóricos, como a teoria da Complexidade e a Psicossociologia Francesa. Foram sujeitos desta pesquisa 2288 educadores de todo o Brasil, integrantes da 4 ª edição do Curso a distância de Prevenção do Uso de Drogas para Educadores de Escolas Públicas, executado em 2010 pelo PRODEQUI/PCL/UnB. Os dados foram coletados através de um questionário disponibilizado na plataforma virtual do curso, que continha perguntas abertas e fechadas sobre situações-problema relacionadas ao tema no contexto escolar. Como metodologia de análise de base foi utilizada a abordagem qualitativa, realizada com o auxílio do {{software}} ALCESTE de análise lexical. Em uma segunda etapa, foram construídos indicadores qualitativos, a partir do conceito de subjetividade social e analisados os seguintes descritores: a escola, o educador, a família, o adolescente, a droga, a rede da escola e a rede do tráfico, sempre com o foco no enfrentamento à situação-problema. Os resultados identificaram que as situações-problema relacionadas a drogas que afetam o contexto escolar estão presentes nas imediações, dentro da escola, dentro da sala de aula e até da família. Os educadores tem medo e sentem-se despreparados para lidar com as situações de risco identificadas no contexto escolar. Reconhecem a importância de um trabalho articulado com as diversas redes, com destaque para a rede de segurança pública, a família e a rede de saúde. Foram identificadas também, necessidades de capacitação específicas que incluam aspectos teóricos sobre o tema e sobre o adolescente. Espera-se que este estudo possa contribuir no enfrentamento das situações-problema relacionadas ao uso de drogas na escola, bem como na formulação de políticas públicas que levem em conta ações preventivas específicas para este contexto. ______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis study aims at {{knowing the}} views of educators on the confrontation of circumstances involving alcohol and other drugs in the school environment, either by consumption or trafficking in illicit substances. From a theoretical approach based in social representations theory, understood as a socially constructed knowledge, shared by a social group, we tried to understand the social constructions {{and the production of}} meaning evoked by the drug theme and school. In the theoretical constructs, the topics covered include the legal frameworks and public policies about drugs, adolescent vulnerability contexts and the concept of problem situations at school, among others. These views were supplemented with other theoretical frameworks, such as complexity theory and the French Social Psychology. The sample of this research was composed of 2288 educators from all of Brazil, who participated in the 4 th edition of the distance course on Drug Use Prevention for Public Schools Educators. Data were collected through a questionnaire, available on the course’s virtual platform, which contained open and closed questions about problem situations related to the theme in the school context. As a basic analysis methodology, a qualitative approach was used, with the support of ALCESTE software, that performed lexical analysis. In a second step, qualitative indicators were constructed, from the concept of social subjectivity. The following indicators were analyzed: the school, the educator, the family, the adolescent, the drugs, the school network and the network of trafficking, always with the focus on countering the problem situation. The results indicate that the problem situations related to drugs that affect the school context are present in the <b>surrondings,</b> within the school, within the classroom and even the family. Educators feel scared and unprepared to deal with risk situations identified in the school context. They recognize the importance of acting in conjunction with the various networks, with emphasis on public safety network, family and the health network. Specific training needs on the theme were identified, including theoretical aspects and the issue of the approach to adolescents. We hope this study may help in coping with problem situations related to drug use in schools, as well in the formulation of public policies with specific preventive actions for this context...|$|E
