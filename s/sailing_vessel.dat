5|$|On 28 May 1917, Oberleutnant zur See Ernst Ulrich {{replaced}} Schwarz, and, soon after, UB-14 sailed on {{the first}} German patrol {{of the year in}} the Black Sea. On 5 June, UB-14 sank the 155-ton Russian <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> Karasunda north of Poti; Karasunda was the last ship credited to UB-14. Other than to note that Oberleutnant zur See Bodo Elleke succeeded Ulrich in March 1918, there is no mention in sources of UB-14s activities between June 1917 and November 1918.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} main boom and gaff breaking away, crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel,</b> O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E

5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} {{to be more of a}} threat to Hawaii than Pauline because Rick was further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner than Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower than the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E
5|$|Kapitänleutnant Erich von Rohrscheidt assumed {{command of}} UB-42 on 6 April 1918, and six week later, led the U-boat in {{capturing}} the motor <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> Sergij as a prize {{six weeks later}} off Novorossisk. In September, Kapitänleutnant Hans Georg Lübbe (who had succeeded Herbert Nolde after his two-month stint as commander of UB-42) led the U-boat in sinking her final ship. On the night of 7/8 September, the 1,833-ton Italian steamer Vicenza was sent down south of Salonica. UB-42s commanding officer was changed twice more {{before the end of}} the war, but the submarine sank no more ships.|$|E

5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most {{idiosyncratic}} 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute {{the plans for the}} park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye {{in the form of a}} swan. The lake originally had a snow (a <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel)</b> for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police also}} {{purchased}} various boats for work along Canada's coasts and rivers. The Keewatin, a <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel,</b> was bought in 1890 {{for use on}} Lake Winnipeg, but it capsized later the same year. In 1902, the steamboat Vidette was acquired to transport the police along the Yukon River, supported by three launches. Redwing, a small steamer, was purchased for transport on Lake Winnipeg in 1905. The police had the Rouville steamer specially constructed for patrolling in the far north in 1906, but tests demonstrated it burnt through too much fuel, and it was never deployed. By 1919, however, the Victory, Duncan, Lady Borden and Chakawana motor vessels were patrolling the far north and the west coast.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{or twenty}} barges were still using {{the river in}} the 1880s, {{although}} the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were {{the owners of the}} railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the gasworks continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring pleasure craft by 1903, and the company was still doing so in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> {{was always}} {{at the mercy of}} the wind for propulsion, and those that did carry oars were placed at a {{disadvantage}} because they were not optimized for oar use. The galley did have disadvantages compared to the <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> though. Their smaller hulls were not able to hold as much cargo and this limited their range as the crews were required to replenish food stuffs more frequently. The low freeboard of the galley meant that in close action with a <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel,</b> the <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> would usually maintain a height advantage. The <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> could also fight more effectively farther out at sea and in rougher wind conditions because of the height of their freeboard.|$|E
