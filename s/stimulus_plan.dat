5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan,</b> which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, {{the city}} {{unveiled}} a $300-million <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> {{to create jobs}} and revitalize neighborhoods, financed by city bonds and paid for by earmarking about 15% of the wagering tax. The city's plans for revitalization with the Next Detroit Neighborhood Initiative, a 501 (c)(3) organization, include 7-Mile/Livernois, Brightmoor, East English Village, Grand River/Greenfield, North-End, and Osborn. Private organizations have pledged substantial funding to neighborhood revitalization efforts.|$|E

25|$|On 21 January 21, 2010, the Volcker Rule was {{endorsed}} by President Obama. It was a proposal by US economist Paul Volcker to restrict banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their customers. Volcker had argued that such speculative activity {{played a key role}} in the recent worldwide financial crisis. Plans for a new $180 billion <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> were announced by Obama in September 2010.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, Sharmarke {{announced}} that his administration was {{developing a new}} nationwide taxation policy. According to the Prime Minister, the initiative aims to increase government income and further buttress the commercial sector. It {{is part of a}} broader socioeconomic <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan,</b> which will be centered on comprehensive feasibility and goal-oriented analysis. The new taxation bill is scheduled to be put before parliament for deliberation. Additionally, Sharmarke indicated that his administration would seek to attract direct foreign investments.|$|E
25|$|As late as April 2009, central {{bankers and}} finance ministers {{remained}} cautious about the overall global economy, but by in May the Financial Times was reporting {{that according to}} a package of leading indicators there were signs that recovery was imminent in Europe too, after a trough in March. The US {{was one of the}} last major economies to implement a major <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan,</b> and the slowdown there looked set to continue for at least a few more months.|$|E
500|$|Although Zhou's ideas had {{not been}} broadly accepted, leaders meeting in April at the 2009 G-20 London summit agreed to allow $250 billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF, to be {{distributed}} globally. <b>Stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> were credited for contributing to a better than expected economic outlook by both the OECD ...|$|R
50|$|They also {{committed}} {{to maintain the}} supply of credit by providing more liquidity and recapitalising the banking system, and to implement rapidly the <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans.</b> As for central bankers, they pledged to maintain low-rates policies as long as necessary. Finally, the leaders decided to help emerging and developing countries, through a strengthening of the IMF.|$|R
40|$|Since August 2007, {{the world}} economy has fallen into {{recession}} and been confronted by a severe financial crisis. In {{the midst of this}} global recession, what hope can we place in the fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> that have been announced? This Working Paper evaluates whether the measures implemented in the euro area and the US will be adequate responses. It indicates that while these measures will undoubtedly prove useful in limiting the scale and duration of the downturn, they will not be sufficient by themselves to prevent a lengthy recession followed by a tepid recovery. The paper argues that to maximise the effectiveness of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans,</b> they should be accompanied by accommodative monetary policy. Furthermore, to accelerate and underpin a recovery in global economic activity, fiscal and monetary policies should also be supplemented by measures aimed at re-establishing banking and financial sectors that function properly...|$|R
25|$|With no funding {{available}} to perform needed inspections and repairs, the locks were closed in January 2008. In April 2009, {{as part of}} the federal government's economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan,</b> $1.8 million was allocated to repair and inspect the locks, with an additional $900,000 allocated in October 2009 for additional repairs and operational costs. The locks reopened in January 2010 with the Willamette Queen the first vessel to pass. The locks were open through the summer of 2010, and then {{due to a lack of}} federal funding for operations, were not scheduled to reopen for 2011.|$|E
25|$|Keynesian ideas also {{attracted}} considerable criticism {{in this time}} period. While from late 2008 to early 2010 there was broad consensus among international leaders concerning the need for coordinated stimulus, the German administration initially stood out in their reluctance to fully embrace Keynesian policy. In December 2008, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück of Germany criticised Gordon Brown's advocacy of Keynesian stimulus, saying “The switch from decades of supply-side politics {{all the way to}} a crass Keynesianism is breathtaking.” However, by the end of January 2009 Germany had announced a second <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> which, relative to GDP, was larger than Britain's.|$|E
25|$|After the Conservative {{government}} tabled {{its fiscal}} update, NDP leader Jack Layton asked his predecessor, Ed Broadbent, to contact former Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien {{to discuss a}} coalition to oust the Conservatives from power. The plan became public almost immediately. Labelling {{the absence of an}} economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> as irresponsible and the removal of public funding to parties as an attack against democracy, the opposition threatened to topple the weeks-old government by voting against the fiscal update. The opposition parties counted on the probability that Governor General Michaëlle Jean would invite a Liberal-NDP coalition able to hold the confidence of the House of Commons to form a government, instead of any other options available to her.|$|E

5000|$|David Weigel wrote that, [...] "where Rasmussen Reports really distinguishes itself, and {{the reason}} it’s so often cited by conservatives, is in its issue polling. Before the {{stimulus}} debate began, Rasmussen asked voters whether they’d favor <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> that consisted entirely of tax cuts or entirely of spending. Tax cuts won every time, and Republicans began citing this when they argued for a tax-cut-only stimulus package." ...|$|R
2500|$|Economist Edward Prescott (author of {{the real}} business-cycle model that post-Keynesians hold failed to {{forecast}} the crisis) [...] and economist Eugene Fama argued that <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> are unlikely to have a net positive effect on employment, and may even harm it. Economist Jeffrey Sachs doubted a positive effect because the stimulus and associated policies [...] "may work {{in the short term}} but they threaten to produce still greater crises within a few years".|$|R
25|$|Sound {{economic}} policies, maintained consistently {{since the}} 1980s, {{have contributed to}} steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates. Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 4.0% GDP growth. The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6 percent. Real GDP growth reached 5.7 percent in 2005 before falling back to 4 percent in 2006. GDP expanded by 5 percent in 2007. Faced with an international economic downturn the government announced an economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> to spur employment and growth, and despite the global financial crisis, aimed for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3 percent of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent. Real GDP growth in 2012 was 5.5%. Growth slowed to 4.1% {{in the first quarter}} of 2013.|$|E
500|$|The Congressional Budget Office and a {{broad range}} of economists credit Obama's <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> for {{economic}} growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1million, while conceding that [...] "It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed {{in the absence of the}} stimulus package." [...] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II. The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Corker {{was one of}} {{the only}} sixteen Senators who opposed the tax rebate <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan,</b> criticizing it as “political stimulus” for electoral campaigns. He later {{described}} the stimulus package that passed Congress as [...] "silly".|$|E
50|$|In {{developing}} and emerging economies, {{responses to the}} global crisis mainly consisted in low-rates monetary policy (Asia and the Middle East mainly) coupled with the depreciation of the currency against the dollar. There were also <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> in some Asian countries, in the Middle East and in Argentina. In Asia, plans generally amounted to 1 to 3% of GDP, with the notable exception of China, which announced a plan accounting for 16% of GDP (6% of GDP per year).|$|R
40|$|The 2008 Great Recession {{and slow}} {{recovery}} {{have created a}} new interest in a broader fiscal union for the EU. Drawing on the U. S. experience from 1973 - 2009, Robert P. Inman identifies three key lessons for creating efficient macroeconomic policy in a fiscal union: that state level fiscal policies have spillover effects; central government must pick the most cost effective stimulus policies; and that economic efficiency does not always equate with political feasibility. His findings are particular relevant {{to the challenge of}} creating effective <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> and broader growth...|$|R

2500|$|The {{economic}} agenda under development initially focused on short-term measures intended {{to hold off}} widespread economic losses so that a longer-term {{economic agenda}} could then be formulated. That approach subsequently shifted to a longer-term <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan,</b> with a goal of creating 2.5 million jobs over a two-year period. With a cost of $700 to $800billion, the <b>stimulus</b> <b>plan</b> would cost {{more than a quarter}} million dollars per job created (divide 750 billion by 2,500,000 yielding $300,000). In a nationally televised interview on December 7, he acknowledged that his agenda has changed over the past month, and that a short-term stimulus package had again become his first priority. He wanted to emphasize [...] "shovel ready" [...] infrastructure projects to create new jobs quickly.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{empirical}} {{studies suggest that}} the average marginal propensity to consume (MPC) has declined. This paper explains the declining trend of the MPC with a standard representative consumer model where borrowing constraints become more relaxed as suggested by data. With an increase in available credit, the consumer can easily spread out negative income shocks by credit card borrowing or consumer loans. As a result, consumers under relaxed borrowing constraints have lower MPCs than they had a generation ago. This result suggests that policy makers should now account for the less responsiveness of consumers to fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> aiming at boosting consumption...|$|R
40|$|The current wave of {{globalization}} has profound labour market effects, accentuated, in many cases, {{by the current}} financial and economic crisis. This paper reviews general labour market trends and country examples, arguing that the current globalization process makes labour’s position more precarious, a trend magnified by the current crisis. This {{is consistent with the}} policy reactions to the crisis: governments have (rightly) acted as a banker of last resort to avoid the collapse of the financial system, but, despite <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> and monetary easing and some labour market policies, have not really acted as an employer of last resort...|$|R

50|$|The {{financial}} {{phase of}} the crisis led to emergency interventions in many national financial systems. As the crisis developed into genuine recession in many major economies, economic stimulus meant to revive economic growth became the most common policy tool. After having implemented rescue plans for the banking system, major developed and emerging countries announced plans to relieve their economies. In particular, economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>plans</b> were announced in China, the United States, and the European Union. In the final quarter of 2008, the financial crisis saw the G-20 group of major economies assume a new significance as a focus of economic and financial crisis management.|$|R
