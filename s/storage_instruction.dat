40|$|Increased systems level {{integration}} {{has meant}} {{the movement of}} many traditionally off chip components onto a single chip including a processor, <b>instruction</b> <b>storage,</b> data path, and local memory. The design of these systems is driven by two conflicting goals, the need for reduced area {{and the need for}} rapid development times. The two current design options for <b>instruction</b> <b>storage,</b> ROM and Flash, are each highly optimized to one of these two goals but provide little compromise between them. ROM is used for highly area optimized instruction memory, although this comes at a price of lengthy integration time due to it’s need to be correct before the chip is sent for fabrication. Flash is an alternative instruction memory that can significantly reduce the time to market by allowing embedded software to be upgraded after fabrication, meaning that software test and fabrication can be overlapped. Unfortunately Flash takes over a factor of 2 times the area of the equivalent ROM based storage. In this paper we present the Patchable Instruction ROM as an architecture for <b>instruction</b> <b>storage</b> that can provide {{the best of both worlds}} – reduced area and faster time to market. With area efficiency similar to a standard ROM and support for limited post fabrication software patching, Patchable Instruction ROM provides a new set of design points to consider when building embedded systems. For the programs we examine, we show that our hardware/software technique can achieve an area only 10 % larger than ROM with only an 11 % inflation in design time over a Flash based approach. 1...|$|R

The problem was addressed in the G-15 by what the Bendix literature calls [...] "minimum-access coding." [...] Each instruction carries with it {{the address of the}} next instruction to be executed, allowing the programmer to arrange instructions such that when one instruction completes, the next instruction is about to appear under the read head for its line. Data can be staggered in a similar manner. To aid this process, the coding sheets include a table containing numbers of all addresses; the programmer can cross off each address as it is used.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Children with an overactive {{neurogenic bladder}} need clean {{intermittent}} catheterisation and anticholinergics {{to protect their}} upper urinary tract. Oral oxybutynin is the pharmacological treatment of choice, but it is known to induce several systemic anticholinergic side effects. Intravesical instillation of oxybutynin has been proven {{to be an effective}} alternative by escaping the first pass metabolism and therefore causing less systemic side effects in adults. Evidence about the dosage of intravesical oxybutynin in children is still unavailable. Furthermore, the stability of oxybutynin stored at different conditions has to be investigated. Material and methods The dosage of intravesical oxybutynin was retrospectively evaluated in 29 children (aged 0 – 16 years) with detrusor overactivity using urodynamic examinations. The activity of oxybutynin, stored at - 18 ˚C, 4 ˚C and 20 ˚C, was investigated in vitro in bladder strips of the detrusor muscle of 33 male Wistar rats (weight 250 – 345 gram). After increasing concentrations of oxybutynin (1 * 10 - 7 – 1 * 10 - 4 M) were applied to the bladder strips, the contractile force was measured. Results	 The present study showed that the dosage of intravesical oxybutynin was mainly dependent on bodyweight and bladder compliance. The effect of intravesical oxybutynin could be predicted for boys and girls using the following factors: weight, bladder capacity, intravesical pressure and follow-up. A relationship between the oral dosage and the initial intravesical dosage seems to be present. The dose-response relation of oxybutynin in bladder strips of rats was significant (p< 0. 0001). No influence of storage conditions was seen in contractile response when using oxybutynin within 6 weeks. Oxybutynin stored in the refrigerator for 12 weeks showed an unexpectedly strong inhibiting effect compared to 2 or 6 weeks (p= 0. 01). Conclusions Primarily, intravesical oxybutynin in children is mainly a function of bodyweight and bladder compliance. This study provides a guide to start treatment and a formula to calculate further dosages. Secondarily, the <b>storage</b> <b>instructions</b> of the syringes containing oxybutynin can probably be less strict compared to the current opinion. These conclusions contribute to an improvement in convenience of the treatment. Overall, this study enhances the knowledge of the application of intravesical oxybutynin in children. ...|$|R
