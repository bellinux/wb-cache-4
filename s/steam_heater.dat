The first renovation was the addition of multiple new technologies for the time, which were supposed to make the dorm a more modern building. These renovations included {{the addition of a}} <b>steam</b> <b>heater,</b> electrical lights and modern bathrooms. These first set of renovations were mainly mechanical ones in order for the building {{to keep up with the}} changing times. The next renovation on the building took place in 1912. With this renovation the central hall of the building was removed and was later replaced by two-side halls, which virtually cut the hall into two sections. Both the corridors were named for professors at the school. The two professors who the two corridors are named for are R.B.C. Johnson and Charles Elliott. The next renovations came to the building in 1937. With these renovations the building took on all the same features and characteristics that it has today. To get ready to bring the building into the New Miami look many things were done. The interior of the building was completely redone. This caused the special layout of the space to become a much more unified building. On the exterior of the building all the bricks were sandblasted in order to make it fit in with the other buildings on Miami’s campus. Also a number of the original chimneys were removed.|$|E

Ursinus College bought the property to alleviate a campus housing shortage. The house was renamed [...] "Highland Hall" [...] and renovated to accommodate 26 to 28 male students, with quarters for a houseman and caretaker. A new 100 ft artesian well was drilled and fitted with a pump, additional bathing and toilet facilities were installed, and clothes closets were constructed in several rooms. A <b>steam</b> <b>heater</b> system was also installed. In 1925, the house {{became known as the}} Ursinus College Athletic Club and housed the male varsity players. In 1930, it became the private residence of the college's athletic director, Russell [...] "Jing" [...] Johnson (1894-1950), and his family. According to historical records, the Johnson family resided in the house from roughly 1931 to 1937. In 1933, Ursinus made several more renovations including the removal of the front porch and installation of a flagstone terrace. A pent roof was also installed on the front and east side of the building. By 1942, Ursinus was using the house again as a women's residence hall. In 1944, faced with declining enrollment due to World War II, Ursinus put the house up for sale and it was bought by Andrew and Myrtle Rihl. Prior to that, the college had sold much of the land in a bargain sale for $100 to the newly formed Collegeville-Trappe School District in 1938. On July 6, 1950, the Riehls sold the house to Henry L.

40|$|AbstractMembrane Technology and Research, Inc. has {{proposed}} a hybrid system combining amine scrubbing with membrane technology to reduce energy cost. Previous studies of CO 2 absorption mainly focused on coal-fired flue gas with 12 % CO 2. However, in the hybrid process, the CO 2 in the flue gas can be enriched to 20 %. Natural gas turbines will have flue gas with as little as 3 % CO 2 。 Based on the arrangement, the hybrid amine/membrane system provides a gas to the system that has double the CO 2 concentration of normal flue gas, reduces the volume of gas sent to the capture unit, or reduces the removal requirements for the capture unit. The objective of this work is to minimize the total energy use of stripping concentrated piperazine (PZ) at rich loading when treating flue gas from 3 to 20 % inlet CO 2. The base-case stripping configuration is the advanced flash stripper with warm rich bypass and cold rich exchanger bypass.. This configuration includes two split cross-exchangers in series, a convective <b>steam</b> <b>heater,</b> a smaller stripper column, a low residence time flash tank, and stripping at high temperature to produce CO 2 at 5 to 17 bar. Rich loading in 5 and 8 m PZ was varied from 0. 37 to 0. 43 mol CO 2 /mol N. For each rich loading, lean loading was optimized to minimize the total equivalent work. The “Independence” model for PZ in Aspen Plus® was used to simulate the stripping performance. Because 5 m PZ has a lower viscosity than 8 m PZ, it can achieve a reduced approach temperature in the cross exchanger. The total energy performance for 5 m PZ is practically the same as 8 m PZ, even though the capacity of 5 m PZ is lower. Significantly more energy is required to regenerate solvents with lower rich loading. As CO 2 rich loading increases, the equivalent work requirement decreases for the same loading difference between rich and lean. Stripping data for 24 cases, including heat duty, equivalent work, CO 2 output pressure, and optimal cold and warm rich bypass were used to build a correlation with CO 2 rich and lean loading. The Second Law efficiency based on the ratio of stripping minimum work and total ideal work was introduced {{to make the most}} of stripping work.
