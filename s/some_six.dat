5|$|At the {{direction}} of Starfleet, Enterprise makes a detour to a planet passing between two gas giants, in order to observe the gravitational forces and subsequent volcanic activity. Their new course takes the ship close to that of E.C.S. Horizon, the cargo vessel where Ensign Mayweather grew up. He then requests permission for a further detour to re-join his family on Horizon as his father is ill and he hasn't been able to visit him in four years.

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of <b>some</b> <b>six</b> thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian naval defences were weak. The Egyptian fleet had {{declined}} from its Umayyad-era peak and was mostly {{employed in the}} Nile {{rather than in the}} Mediterranean. Fortifications along the coastal marshes, which had been manned by volunteer garrisons, had been abandoned in the later 8th century. The Byzantines had exploited this in 811/12 and again in ca. 815 launching raids against the coasts of Egypt. The Byzantine fleet arrived at Damietta on 22 May 853. The city garrison were absent at a feast for the Day of Arafah organized by the governor Anbasah ibn Ishaq al-Dabbi in Fustat. Damietta's inhabitants fled the undefended city, which was plundered for two days and then torched by the Byzantines. The Byzantines carried off <b>some</b> <b>six</b> hundred Arab and Coptic women as well as large quantities of arms and other supplies intended for Crete. The fleet then sailed east and attacked the strong fortress of Ushtun. Upon taking it, they burned the many artillery and siege engines found there before returning home.|$|E
5|$|Invitations {{to enter}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a {{football}} tournament set up to promote industrial trade fairs, were extended to the city hosting the trade fair rather than to clubs. Some cities entered a select team including players {{from more than one}} club, but Aston Villa, the other major club based in the city of Birmingham, rejected the opportunity to field a combined team. Thus Birmingham City became the first English club side to play in European competition when they played their first match in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, the 1960 Fairs Cup final, in which they met Barcelona. The home leg, a goalless draw, was played on 29 March 1960 and the away leg, which Barcelona won 4–1, <b>some</b> <b>six</b> weeks later. In the semifinal of the 1961 Fairs Cup Birmingham beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club beat them in a competitive match in the San Siro until Arsenal did so in the Champions League over 40 years later.|$|E

5|$|Shaw {{was created}} Baronet, of Kilmarnock, in the County of Ayr by George III in 1809, and re-created in 1813 {{by a second}} patent to include a future {{interest}} for his nephew. As such, he was appointed a Member of Parliament for London until 1818, but thereafter sat as an alderman until he resigned in May 1843. In 1831 he was also appointed Chamberlain of London, and was almost ruined as he inadvertently invested £40,000, then a huge sum, of city funds in fake Exchequer bills. On discovering his error, he began to liquidate all his property to repay the sum, but was cleared by a commission of enquiry. Shaw resigned all his positions in 1843 due to long-term illness and died <b>some</b> <b>six</b> months later on 22 October. Shaw was unmarried, and normally his baronetcy would have become extinct on his death, {{but because of the}} second patent, the title passed to his nephew, John Shaw.|$|E
5|$|The first Solomon Islander {{delegation}} to the Olympics arrived <b>some</b> <b>six</b> years after the nation's independence for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, and was composed of three male athletes competing in two sports. The island nation continued to send delegations to the Olympics throughout its era of civil disorder; delegations from the Solomon Islands appeared at all seven Summer Olympic games prior to (and including) the Beijing games of 2008. The first women represented the Solomon Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The largest delegations from the Solomon Islands included four athletes and appeared in 1988 and 1996. Up to and including the Beijing games, {{there had not been}} a Solomon Islander who had won a medal at the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{began as}} a tropical wave—a westbound low-pressure area—first observed southeast of Cape Verde on 29August. Traversing the tropical Atlantic, the wave retained a minimum barometric pressure of about 1010mbar (hPa; 29.83inHg) and strengthened briefly the following day. By 1September, however, the wave had become rather weak and indiscernible; it would remain as such for much of its early existence until 6September, by which time it had moved past the Windward Islands. In this region the system became sufficiently organised to be classified as a tropical depression at 18:00UTC that same day near Grenada. <b>Some</b> <b>six</b> hours after its inception the depression strengthened to a tropical storm over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Owing {{to a lack of}} ship observations, data on the storm were scarce in that region. The first ship to identify the storm clearly was the tanker Geo H. Jones, which recorded strong winds in conjunction with rapidly decreasing barometric pressures late on 7 September. As the storm remained west-northwest bound across the Caribbean, more ships were able to record data on the cyclone.|$|E

5|$|The keels for Vittorio Veneto and Littorio {{were laid}} on the same day, 28 October 1934, at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico {{shipyard}} in Trieste and the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa, respectively. Vittorio Veneto was launched on 22 July 1937, with Littorio following exactly one month later on 22 August. While incomplete, Vittorio Veneto went to sea on 23 October 1939 to conduct machinery trials. She was delivered to the Italian Navy in Trieste, still incomplete, <b>some</b> <b>six</b> months later on 28 April 1940. She departed Trieste on 1 May for final fitting out at the dockyard in La Spezia. After completion on 15 May 1940, she went to Taranto to join the fleet. Littorio underwent {{the same pattern of}} machinery trials prior to completion; she was delivered to the fleet on 6 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|Uranie {{lost four}} killed, {{including}} Captain Tartu, and seven wounded, including three seriously, and the frigate arrived at Rochefort soon afterwards, where {{in honour of}} the captain's death, she was renamed Tartu. It was subsequently incorrectly reported in Britain that the ship's name was changed to Tortue (tortoise) to disguise its identity after being defeated by Thames. Thames was taken into French service as Tamise, and participated in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 the following year. The French lost both frigates in 1796. HMS Santa Margarita recaptured Tamise in an engagement near the Scilly Isles between British and French frigate squadrons at the Action of 8 June 1796. <b>Some</b> <b>six</b> months later, the ship of the line HMS Polyphemus captured Tartu on 30 December {{in the aftermath of}} the disastrous Expédition d'Irlande.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after <b>some</b> <b>six</b> weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. M.escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E
