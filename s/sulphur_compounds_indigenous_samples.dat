40|$|AbstractTulbaghia {{species are}} used in {{traditional}} medicine in southern Africa. They contain <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> which have anti-Candida activity. The <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> are unstable, so different extraction methods were investigated. Grinding the rhizome material in liquid nitrogen and extraction with ethanol yielded the best results. Eight Tulbaghia species were tested and found to contain {{the same pattern of}} <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> on the TLC plate, though in varying concentrations, except T. simmleri, for which <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> could not be detected. This means that more species can potentially be utilised for the drug Tulbaghiae rhizoma. A simple quantitative TLC dilution method was developed, which can be used to ascertain whether the rhizome material contains a sufficient level of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> The effect of storage was investigated. The content of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the rhizomes decreased fast upon storage, half of the main compound was lost four weeks after harvest. Possible adulterants for Tulbaghiae rhizoma are Allium sativum and Agapanthus campanulatus. It was not possible to detect adulteration with A. sativum, but a simple TLC test could detect adulteration with 10 % A. campanulatus material...|$|R

40|$|Ammonium salts {{were added}} to white grape musts, before {{alcoholic}} fermentation, in order to evaluate their influence on the heavy <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> and aliphatic higher alcohol composition of resulting wines. Six grape musts were used (Trajadura, Pedernã, Loureiro, Azal Branco, Avesso and Alvarinho). Ammonium supplementation of Trajadura and Pedernã grape musts, with the highest nitrogen level, did not influence the content of heavy <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> and aliphatic higher alcohols in wines; however, the addition of ammonium salts to grape musts with low initial nitrogen content, such as Loureiro, Azal Branco and Avesso, led to a higher production of 1 -propanol and a lower production of isoamyl alcohols and <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> e. g.

40|$|Increasing {{concern about}} air {{pollution}} {{has led many}} countries to adopt more stringent regulations, which impose an ultra-low concentration of sulphur in gasoline. These regulations place many challenges for the refining industry. Lower sulphur levels are being recommended for gasoline and diesel for environmental reasons. New methods and innovations are required to further reduce the sulphur level in liquid fuels. Separation process design to accomplish the removal of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> with hydrocarbons, particularly their activity coefficients at infinite dilution. However, the investigations concerning the systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> are very limited. This thesis deals with the VLE measurements of selected <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (1 -propanethiol, diethyl sulphide, and thiophene) with various hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 8) and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane (ETBE) under isobaric and isothermal conditions, using a circulation still and the infinite dilutions activity coefficients measurements of 1 -propanethiol, ethyl methyl sulphide, and thiophene in toluene, n-heptane, and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 90  kPa using comparative ebulliometer techniques. The gamma-phi approach {{was used in the}} calculation of VLE. The activity coefficients of the liquid phase (γ) were correlated with the Wilson model. The Wilson model gave a good correlation for all systems. The activity coefficients at infinite dilution (γ∞) were extrapolated from the VLE measurements with the Wilson model. The γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for the systems thiophene + toluene and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane obtained from the recirculation still measurements are compared with the γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> obtained from the comparative ebulliometer measurements. The agreement between the measurements is good. All the measured γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydrocarbons are less than two. 1 -Propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour, and thus the γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for these systems are one. The activity coefficients of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydrocarbons show the typical behaviour of positive deviations from Raoult's law, which become smaller with increasing temperature and with {{an increase in the number}} of C-atoms of the alkanes. The systems 1 -propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour. No azeotrope formation was observed for the systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and diethyl sulphide + 1 -hexene. The reaction between 1 -propanethiol and 1 -hexene was observed. The systems thiophene + n-hexane and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide + n-heptane and diethyl sulphide + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, show positive deviations from Raoult's law. These systems exhibit maximum pressure azeotropy. The systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and thiophene + 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide with n-hexane, 1 -hexene, cyclohexane, and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, show positive deviation and strong nonideality. No azeotropes formed in these systems. The original UNIFAC predictive model is adequate to describe the behaviour of sulphur in hydrocarbons, even though its application is limited to the availability of the functional group interaction parameters. COSMO-RS gives poor prediction for all the systems studied, and thus it is not currently a suitable model for predicting the behaviour of systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> These new consistent measurements can be used to improve and develop thermodynamic models in dilute systems, and thus the behaviour of organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the distillation of hydrocarbons can be simulated. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of nitrogen compounds in grape musts {{on the content}} of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> of wines was studied. Different vinifications were performed with the addition of methionine (20 mg l− 1) and/or cysteine (40 mg l− 1) to grape musts before alcoholic fermentation. Six grape musts, with different nitrogen composition, from cultivars of the ‘Vinhos Verdes’ Region, in Portugal, were used. Addition of methionine to grape musts enhanced the content of wines in 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester, 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid and some unidentified <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> Increase of cysteine concentration in musts led to the production of wines with high levels of hydrogen sulphide and cis- 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene- 3 -OL and also unidentified sulphur compounds; however, the content of 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid in the wines decreased considerately with the addition of cysteine to grape musts. This work showed that cultivars from the Vinho Verde Region show different <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> contents. Avesso wines, elaborated from grape musts with low amino acids level, presented the highest total <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> content. Wines from Azal branco and Alvarinho were characterised by high contents of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol and 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid, respectively. A high content of N-(3 -(methylthio) propyl) -acetamide and dimethylsulphone characterise the Loureiro wines. In contrast, Trajadura wines, produced from a must rich in amino acids, presented a low total <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> content; however, these wines were also characterised by high concentrations of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester and hydrogen sulphide...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> {{into the environment}} is undesirable because of their acidifying characteristics. The processing of sulphidic ores, oil refining and sulphuric acid production are major sources of SO 2 emissions. Hydrogen sulphide is emitted into the environment as dissolved sulphide in wastewater or as H 2 S in natural gas, biogas, syngas or refinery gases. Waste streams containing sulphate are generated by many industries, including mining, metallurgical, pulp and paper and petrochemical industries. Applying process technologies that rely on the biological sulphur cycle can prevent environmental pollution. In nature <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> may cycle {{through a series of}} oxidation states (- 2, 0, + 2, + 4, + 6). Bacteria {{of a wide range of}} genera gain metabolic energy from either oxidising or reducing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> Paques B. V. develops and constructs reactor systems to remove <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> from aqueous and gaseous streams by utilising naturally occurring bacteria from the sulphur cycle. Due to the presence of sulphide, heavy metal removal is also achieved with very high removal efficiencies. Ten years of extensive laboratory and pilot plant research has, to date, resulted in the construction of over 30 full-scale installations.

40|$|Onion (Afflum cepa L.) {{was able}} to use {{atmospheric}} H 2 S as sole sulphur source for growth. The foliarly absorbed H 2 S was rapidly metabolized into water-soluble, non-protein thiol compounds, including cysteine, and subsequently into other <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the shoots. In H 2 S-exposed plants, the accumulation of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the shoots was nearly linear with the concentration (0. 15 - 0. 6 mul l(- 1)) and duration of the exposure. Exposure of onion to H 2 S for up to 1 week did not affect the sulphur content of the roots. Secondary <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> formed a sink for the foliarly absorbed sulphide, and the sulphur accumulation upon H 2 S exposure could, for a great part, be ascribed to enhancement of the content of gamma-glutamyl peptides and/or alliins. Furthermore, there was a substantial increase in the sulphate content in the shoots upon H 2 S exposure. The accumulation of sulphate originated both from the pedosphere and from the oxidation of absorbed atmospheric sulphide, and/or from the degradation of accumulated secondary <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> From studies on the interaction between atmospheric and pedospheric sulphur nutrition it was evident that H 2 S exposure did not result in a down-regulation of the sulphate uptake by the roots...|$|R

The possible role of volatile <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in beer flavour has been investigated using simple analytical methods.

In general, Loureiro, Trajadura and Pedernã cultivars led to wines with low concentrations of sulphur compounds; however, Loureiro wines were characterised by significant amounts of dimethyl sulphone, whereas Trajadura wines possessed a high content of 3 -(methylthio) propyl acetate and 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol.

40|$|Sulphur {{determination}} is {{of priority}} in coal investigations {{due to its}} associated environmental pollution. There are generally various forms of sulphur in coal such as organic and inorganic forms both of which need to be characterized. However, it is the organic sulphur present in coal that is not well understood and studied. In this work, total and various forms of sulphur {{have been identified in}} raw coal samples from Camden, Majuba, Lethabo, Kriel, Duvha and Thuthuka power stations in South Africa. Organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (2 - methyl thiophene, 3 -methyl thiophene, 2 -ethyl thiophene and dibenzothiophene) were characterized from these coal samples {{in order to determine the}} quality of South African coal. Organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> were extracted from coal samples by means of ultrasonic bath. The extraction of organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> was first optimised by using various organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene and hexane followed by quantification using gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector. The extraction time was also optimized from 0 to 75 minutes while spiked standard concentrations were varied from 1700 to 17000 mg kg- 1 to control the process. Ultrasonic extracts were analyzed by GC equipped with SPB- 1 Sulphur column and flame ionisation detector. Microwave assisted extraction was used to extract various forms of sulphur in coal. During sequential extraction, sulphate and pyrite sulphur were extracted from coal samples using hydrochloric acid and nitric acid respectively. Total organic or total sulphur and selected metals in coal were extracted by means of a mixture of concentrated hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and boric acid.
