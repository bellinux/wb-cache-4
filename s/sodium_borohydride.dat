5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, {{it is not}} an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. <b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is {{a source}} of basic borate salts which can be corrosive, and {{hydrogen}} or diborane, which are both flammable. Spontaneous ignition can result from solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> in dimethylformamide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> reduces {{aldehydes}} and ketones to {{give the}} related alcohols. This reaction {{is used in the}} production of various antibiotics including chloramphenicol, dihydrostreptomycin, and thiophenicol. Various steroids and vitamin A are prepared using <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> in at least one step.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} as a solid state hydrogen storage candidate. Although practical temperatures and pressures for hydrogen storage have not been achieved, in 2012 a core–shell nanostructure of <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> was used successfully to store, release and reabsorb hydrogen under moderate conditions.|$|E
25|$|Camphor {{can also}} be reduced to isoborneol using <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is an odorless {{white to}} gray-white {{microcrystalline}} powder which often forms lumps. It can be purified by recrystallization from warm (50°C) diglyme. <b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is soluble in protic solvents {{such as water}} and lower alcohols; it will also react with these solvents to produce H2; however, these reactions are fairly slow. Complete decomposition in excess methanol can take nearly 90min at 20°C. It will decompose in neutral or acidic aqueous solutions but is stable at pH 14. These conditions can be exploited to allow <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> to react in a homogeneous manner, with reduced lifespan being traded against increased reactivity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} foxing in old books and documents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> {{is used as}} {{reducing}} agent in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Reduction to {{benzaldehyde}} and {{benzyl alcohol}} is possible using DIBAL-H, LiAlH4 or <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thiazoles are formyl synthons; {{conversion}} of R-thia to the R-CHO aldehyde takes place with, respectively, methyl iodide (N-methylation), organic reduction with <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride,</b> and hydrolysis with Mercury(II) chloride in water.|$|E
25|$|Aldehydes or ketones {{are reduced}} with <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> or lithium {{aluminium}} hydride (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction. Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation is the asymmetric reduction of β-keto-esters.|$|E
25|$|The formyl {{group can}} be readily reduced to a primary alcohol (−CH2OH). Typically this {{conversion}} is accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation either directly or by transfer hydrogenation. Stoichiometric reductions are also popular, as can be effected with <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b>|$|E
25|$|When heated with carbon, the oxide {{is reduced}} to {{antimony}} metal. With other reducing agents such as <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> or lithium aluminium hydride, the unstable and very toxic gas stibine is produced. When heated with potassium bitartrate, a complex salt potassium antimony tartrate, KSb(OH)2•C4H2O6 is formed.|$|E
25|$|Chloramines {{are often}} an {{unwanted}} side-product of oxidation reactions of organic compounds (with amino groups) with bleach. The reduction of chloramines back into amines {{can be carried}} out through a mild hydride donor. <b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> will reduce chloramines, but this reaction is greatly sped up with acid catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{reaction}} of (1) with phosgene gives the reactive the isatoic anhydride (2). Condensation {{of that with}} ortho-toluidine leads to the acylation product (3) formed with a simultaneous loss of carbon dioxide. This is then converted to the quinazolone (4) by heating with acetic anhydride. Reaction with <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> {{in the presence of}} aluminum chloride selectively reduces the double bond to yield the diuretic agent metolazone (5).|$|E
25|$|Significant {{problems}} with producing nanoparticles initially arise once these nanoparticles are generated in solution. Without {{the use of}} a stabilizing agent, nanoparticles tend to stick together once the stirring is stopped. In order to counteract this, a certain collidial stabilizer is generally added. These stabilizers bind to the nanoparticles in a way that prevents other particles from bonding with them. Some effective stabilizers found so far include citrate, cellulose, and <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b>|$|E
25|$|The acetyl {{group in}} 6.1 (Scheme 6) was removed to give primary alcohol 6.2. The Taxol ring (D) was added by an {{intramolecular}} nucleophilic substitution involving this hydroxyl group to give oxetane 6.3. After acetylation, phenyllithium {{was used to}} open the carbonate ester ring to give alcohol 6.5. Allylic oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate, sodium acetate, and celite gave ketone 6.6, which was subsequently reduced using <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> to give secondary alcohol 6.7. This was the last compound before {{the addition of the}} amide tail.|$|E
25|$|Proposed {{hydrides}} {{for use in}} {{a hydrogen}} economy include simple hydrides of magnesium or transition metals and complex metal hydrides, typically containing sodium, lithium, or calcium and aluminium or boron. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are lithium hydride, <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride,</b> lithium aluminium hydride and ammonia borane. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactivity}} of NaBH4 {{can be enhanced}} or augmented {{by a variety of}} compounds. Oxidation with iodine in tetrahydrofuran gives the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex, which can reduce carboxylic acids. Likewise, the NaBH4-MeOH system, formed by the addition of methanol to <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> in refluxing THF, reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols. Mixing water or an alcohol with the borohydride converts some of it into unstable hydride ester, which is more efficient at reduction, but the reductant will eventually decompose spontaneously to give hydrogen gas and borates. The same reaction can run also intramolecularly: an α-ketoester converts into a diol, since the alcohol produced will attack the borohydride to produce an ester of the borohydride, which then reduces the neighboring ester. The combination of NaBH4 with carboxylic acids results in the formation of acyloxyborohydride species. These can perform a variety of reductions not normally associated with borohydride chemistry, such as alcohols to hydrocarbons and nitriles to primary amines.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride {{is widely}} used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. It is {{more powerful than the}} related reagent <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> owing to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. Often as a solution in diethyl ether and followed by an acid workup, it will convert esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, aldehydes, and ketones into the corresponding alcohols (see: carbonyl reduction). Similarly, it converts amide, nitro, nitrile, imine, oxime, and azide compounds into the amines (see: amide reduction). It reduces quaternary ammonium cations into the corresponding tertiary amines. Reactivity can be tuned by replacing hydride groups by alkoxy groups. Due to its pyrophoric nature, instability, toxicity, low shelf life and handling problems associated with its reactivity, it has been replaced in the last decade, both at the small-industrial scale and for large-scale reductions by the more convenient related reagent sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, which exhibits similar reactivity but with higher safety, easier handling and better economics.|$|E
500|$|Cotton and Wilkinson {{demonstrated}} that the 18-valence electron rhodium(III) rhodocenium cation + can be reduced in aqueous solution to the monomeric form; {{they were unable to}} isolate the neutral product as not only can it dimerise, the rhodium(II) radical monomer can also spontaneously form the mixed-hapticity stable rhodium(I) species [...] The differences between rhodocene and this derivative are found in two areas: (1) One of the bound cyclopentadienyl ligands has formally gained a hydrogen atom to become cyclopentadiene, which remains bound to the metal centre but now as a 4-electron η4- donor. (2) The rhodium(II) metal centre has been reduced to rhodium(I). These two changes make the derivative an 18-valence electron species. Fischer and colleagues hypothesised that the formation of this rhodocene derivative might occur in separate protonation and reduction steps, but published no evidence to support this suggestion. (η4-Cyclopentadiene)(η5-cyclopentadienyl)rhodium(I), the resulting compound, is an unusual organometallic complex in that it has both a cyclopentadienyl anion and cyclopentadiene itself as ligands. It has been shown that this compound can also be prepared by <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> reduction of a rhodocenium solution in aqueous ethanol; the researchers who made this discovery characterised the product as biscyclopentadienylrhodium hydride.|$|E
500|$|Metallic sodium is used {{mainly for}} the {{production}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride,</b> sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once-common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. [...] Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma ("vapor") lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution, {{it can be used to}} reduce alkynes to trans-alkenes. Lasers emitting light at the sodium D line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land-based visible light telescopes.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{presence}} of metal catalysts, <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> releases hydrogen. Exploiting this reactivity, <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is used in prototypes of the direct borohydride fuel cell. The hydrogen is generated for a fuel cell by catalytic decomposition of the aqueous borohydride solution: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{reacted with}} <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride,</b> {{molybdenum}} {{is reduced to}} a lower valent oxide: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is {{prepared}} industrially following the original method of Schlesinger: sodium hydride is treated with trimethyl borate at 250–270°C: ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{laboratory}} methods {{start from}} boron trichloride with lithium aluminium hydride or from boron trifluoride ether solution with <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b> Both methods result {{in as much}} as 30% yield: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is {{the production of}} sodium dithionite from sulfur dioxide: Sodium dithionite {{is used as a}} bleaching agent for wood pulp and in the dyeing industry.|$|E
2500|$|Millions of {{kilograms}} {{are produced}} annually, far exceeding the production levels {{of any other}} hydride reducing agent. [...] <b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> can also be produced {{by the action of}} NaH on powdered borosilicate glass.|$|E
2500|$|Compounds of {{the type}} BRn(OR)3-n are called [...] borinic esters (n = 2), boronic esters (n = 1), and borates [...] (n = 0). [...] Boronic acids are used in Suzuki reaction. [...] Trimethyl borate, which is debatably not an {{organoboron}} compound, is an intermediate {{in the production of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Luche {{reduction}} of alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds {{has become a}} popular method in organic synthesis, where CeCl3·7H2O is {{used in conjunction with}} <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride.</b> [...] For example carvone gives only the allylic alcohol 1 and none of the saturated alcohol 2. [...] Without CeCl3, a mixture of 1 and 2 is formed.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride,</b> {{also known}} as sodium tetrahydridoborate and sodium tetrahydroborate, is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula NaBH4. This white solid, usually encountered as a powder, is a versatile reducing agent that finds wide application in chemistry, both in the laboratory and on a technical scale. It has been tested as pretreatment for pulping of wood, but is too costly to be commercialized. [...] The compound is soluble in alcohols and certain ethers but reacts with water {{in the absence of}} a base.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} double bonds in carvone capable of {{reduction}}; {{the product of}} reduction depends on the reagents and conditions used. [...] Catalytic hydrogenation of carvone (1) can give either carvomenthol (2) or carvomenthone (3). [...] Zinc and acetic acid reduce carvone to give dihydrocarvone (4). [...] MPV reduction using propan-2-ol and aluminium isopropoxide effects reduction of the carbonyl group only to provide carveol (5); a combination of <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> and CeCl3 (Luche reduction) is also effective. Hydrazine and potassium hydroxide give limonene (6) via a Wolff-Kishner reduction.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the many}} hydroborating {{reagents}} available, borane (BH3) is commercially available as THF solutions wherein it exists as the adduct BH3(THF). [...] Long term storage of BH3/THF requires stabilization {{by a small}} amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> and storage at 0°C. The concentration of BH3 usually cannot exceed 2M. The related borane dimethylsulfide complex BH3S(CH3)2 (BMS) is comparatively more convenient because it is more stable and it can be obtained in highly concentrated forms. [...] Less volatile sulfides have also been developed for odor control. These borane sulfide adducts are stable at room temperature and soluble in ethers and dichloromethane.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (<b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride)</b> followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
2500|$|Pyridine (1) {{is reduced}} with <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> in {{presence}} of benzyl chloroformate to the Cbz protected dihydropyridine 2. The asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction with acrolein 3 {{is carried out}} with the McMillan catalyst to the aldehyde 4 as the endo isomer which is oxidized to the carboxylic acid 5 with sodium chlorite, monopotassium phosphate and 2-methyl-2-butene. Addition of bromine gives halolactonization product 6 and after replacement of the Cbz protective group by a BOC protective group in 7 (hydrogenolysis {{in the presence of}} di-tert-butyl dicarbonate) a carbonyl group is introduced in intermediate 8 [...] by catalytic ruthenium(IV) oxide and sacrificial catalyst sodium periodate. Addition of ammonia cleaves the ester group to form amide 9 the alcohol group of which is mesylated to compound 10. [...] In the next step iodobenzene diacetate is added, converting the amide in a Hofmann rearrangement to the allyl carbamate 12 after capturing the intermediate isocyanate with allyl alcohol 11. On addition of sodium ethoxide in ethanol three reactions take place simultaneously: cleavage of the amide to form new an ethyl ester group, displacement of the mesyl group by newly formed BOC protected amine to an aziridine group and an elimination reaction forming the alkene group in 13 with liberation of HBr. In the final two steps the aziridine ring is opened by 3-pentanol 14 and boron trifluoride to aminoether 15 with the BOC group replaced by an acyl group and on removal of the other amine protecting group (Pd/C, Ph3P, and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid in ethanol) and addition of phosphoric acid oseltamivir 16 is obtained.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> is {{a source}} of basic borate salts which can be corrosive, and {{hydrogen}} or diborane, which are both flammable. Spontaneous ignition can result from solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>borohydride</b> in dimethylformamide.|$|E
