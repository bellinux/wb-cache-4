40|$|A {{method to}} {{quantify}} spectral {{effects on the}} electric parameters of multi-junction solar cells is presented. The method is based on measuring the short circuit current {{of at least two}} monitor cells. Ideally these monitor cells have the same spectral responses as the subcells in the investigated multi-junction solar cell. In contrast to the subcells, the current of the individual monitor cells can be measured separately. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the spectral impact on the current mismatch of the multi-junction solar cell. A <b>spectrometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>method</b> is then applied. The method has been tested experimentally with three concentrator modules using III-V triple-junction solar cells. These modules were measured outdoors for several months under variable solar spectral conditions. In parallel, the IV curves of the modules and the current of two component cells were measured. A spectral parameter Z was derived from the monitor cell current signals, which was correlated to the short circuit current and the fill factor of the modules. A linear correlation was found between Z and the normalized short circuit Current of the concentrator modules. Translation equations were derived from the linear correlation. These enable the calculation of a module's short circuit current under any spectral conditions. In particular, the short circuit currents of the modules were derived for direct normal irradiance of 850 W/m(2) and spectral conditions corresponding to the AM 1. 5 d low AOD spectrum. This is an important step towards comparing the performance of modules which show strong spectral sensitivity. Future rating methods can benefit from the presented simple method for quantifying spectral impacts oil multi-junction solar cells. Furthermore. the method can be of interest for tuning the spectrum of pulsed solar simulators...|$|E

40|$|Decision {{trees are}} one of the most {{powerful}} and commonly used supervised learning algorithms in the field of data mining. It is important that a decision tree performs accurately when employed on unseen data; therefore, <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> are used to measure the predictive performance of a decision tree classifier. However, the predictive accuracy of a decision tree is also dependant on the <b>evaluation</b> <b>method</b> chosen since training and testing sets of decision tree models are selected according to the <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods.</b> The aim of this thesis was to study and understand how using different <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> might have an impact on decision tree accuracies when they are applied to different decision tree algorithms.

40|$|As one {{of their}} “three {{measures}} for examining an evaluation method,” Hartson, et al. describe reliability as a measure whereby “results [are] consistent [...] . [and] [...] . independent of the individual performing the usability evaluation” (pp. 388 - 389). Muller, et al. define the following terms in their comparison of usability <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods,</b> {{which can be used}} to further qualify this notion of reliability: Raw yield—the number of unique classes of usability problems that are uncovered by an <b>evaluation</b> <b>method.</b> (Note that this is different than the total number of usability problems uncovered.) Refined yield—the proportion of severe problems that are uncovered by an <b>evaluation</b> <b>method</b> (pp. 185). Thus, if an <b>evaluation</b> <b>method</b> is to be considered reliable, it will consistently produce good results in terms of both raw and refined yield, regardless of who uses it.
