50|$|A <b>shock</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that detects and records mechanical shocks experienced by it. It {{is a common}} practice to attach shock indicators to expensive goods {{that are to be}} shipped. This way, the magnitude and the time of shocks are recorded to ensure that delicate and expensive instruments are not mishandled or exposed to inappropriate environmental conditions during shipping. The <b>shock</b> <b>indicator</b> provides a visual indication whether the shock threshold has been reached or exceeded, e.g. {{in the form of a}} broken spring or a digital display.|$|E

30|$|We have {{presented}} a new high-order numerical method for {{the solution of}} the Euler equations of general-relativistic hydrodynamics that we name ‘entropy-limited hydrodynamics’ (ELH). The scheme is of the flux-limiting type, where a high-order numerical flux is combined with a stable low-order method, namely the Lax-Friedrichs flux. The flux-limiting is activated and driven by a <b>shock</b> <b>indicator</b> based on a measure of the entropy generated by the solution. Such a special and general-relativistic method is inspired by the entropy-viscosity method proposed recently for {{the solution of the}} classical equations of hydrodynamics (Guermond et al. 2011), but it is also importantly different in that it does not require any change in the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics.|$|E

To alleviate these difficulties, this work proposes a higher-order, state-based artificial viscosity with an associated governing partial differential equation (PDE). In the governing PDE, a <b>shock</b> <b>indicator</b> acts as a forcing term while grid-based diffusion is added to smooth the resulting artificial viscosity.

This paper of the cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopic signatures of naturally shocked zircon crystals from the Vredefort Dome, South Africa contributes to the {{understanding of}} the formation of microdeformation in zircon under very high pressures. All investigated shocked samples shows an inverse relationship between the brightness of the backscattered electron (BSE) signal and the corresponding cathodoluminescence intensity of the zonation patterns. The CL spectra of samples are characterised by narrow emission lines and broad bands in the region of visible light and in the near-ultraviolet range.

However, when a piecewiseconstant artificial viscosity model is employed with an otherwise higher-order approximation, element-to-element variations in the artificial viscosity arising at the shock induce oscillations in state gradients and pollute the downstream flow. To alleviate these difficulties, this work proposes a new higher-order, state-based artificial viscosity with an associated governing PDE. In the governing PDE, the shock sensor acts as a forcing term, driving the artificial viscosity to a non-zero value where it is necessary. The decay rate of the higher-order solution modes and edge-based jumps are both shown to be reliable <b>shock</b> <b>indicators.</b> This new approach leads to a smooth, higher-order representation of the artificial viscosity, that evolves {{in time with the}} solution.

Optical and electron microscopic {{studies of the}} recovered samples show the effects of increasing shock pressures on this mineral. At pressures up to 287 kbar, the recovered specimens are still essentially crystalline, with only a trace amount of optically unresolvable glass present at 287 kbar. Samples recovered after shock-loading to pressures between 300 and 400 kbar are almost 100 % diaplectic glasses; that is formed by shock transformation presumably in the solid-state. Above about 400 kbar, glasses with refractive indices similar to thermally fused glass were produced. The general behavior of the index of refraction with shock pressures agrees closely with previous work, however, the absence of planar features is striking. At pressures less than 300 kbar, the most prominent physical feature is the pervasive irregular fracturing caused by the shock crushing, although some (001) and (010) cleavages are observed.

40|$|Artificial {{resistivity}} {{is included}} in Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics simulations to capture shocks and discontinuities in the magnetic field. Here we present a new method for adapting {{the strength of the}} applied resistivity so that shocks are captured but the dissipation of the magnetic field away from shocks is minimised. Our scheme utilises the gradient of the magnetic field as a <b>shock</b> <b>indicator,</b> setting α_B = h|gradB|/|B|, such that resistivity is switched on only where strong discontinuities are present. The advantage to this approach is that the resistivity parameter does not depend on the absolute field strength. The new switch is benchmarked on a series of shock tube tests demonstrating its ability to capture shocks correctly. It is compared against a previous switch proposed by Price & Monaghan (2005), showing that it leads to lower dissipation of the field, and in particular, that it succeeds at capturing shocks in the regime where the Alfvén speed is much less than the sound speed (i. e., when the magnetic field is very weak). It is also simpler. We also demonstrate that our recent constrained divergence cleaning algorithm has no difficulty with shock tube tests, in contrast to other implementations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a high order hybrid discontinuous Galerkin/finite volume scheme for solving the equations of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) {{and of the}} relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) on quadrilateral meshes. In this approach, for the spatial discretization, an arbitrary high order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element (DG) method is combined with a finite volume (FV) scheme in order to simulate complex flow problems involving strong shocks. Regarding the time discretization, a fourth order strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta method is used. In the proposed hybrid scheme, a <b>shock</b> <b>indicator</b> is computed {{at the beginning of}} each Runge-Kutta stage in order to flag those elements containing shock waves or discontinuities. Subsequently, the DG solution in these troubled elements and in the current time step is projected onto a subdomain composed of finite volume subcells. Right after, the DG operator is applied to those unflagged elements, which, in principle, are oscillation-free, meanwhile the troubled elements are evolved with a robust second/third order FV operator. With this approach we are able to numerically simulate very challenging problems in the context of MHD and SRHD in one, and two space dimensions and with very high order polynomials. We make convergence tests and show a comprehensive one-and two dimensional testbench for both equation systems, focusing in problems with strong shocks. The presented hybrid approach shows that numerical schemes of very high order of accuracy are able to simulate these complex flow problems in an efficient and robust manner...|$|E

40|$|Chromite in {{ordinary}} chondrites (OC) {{can be used}} as a <b>shock</b> <b>indicator.</b> A survey of 76 equilibrated H, L and LL chondrites shows that unshocked chromite grains occur in equant, subhedral and rounded morphologies surrounded by silicate or intergrown with metallic Fe-Ni and/or troilite. Some unmelted chromite grains are fractured or crushed during whole-rock brecciation. Others are transected by opaque veins; the veins form when impacts cause localized heating of metal-troilite intergrowths above the Fe-FeS eutectic (988 C), mobilization of metal-troilite melts, and penetration of the melt into fractures in chromite grains. Chromite-plagioclase assemblages occur in nearly every shock-stage S 3 -S 6 OC; the assemblages range in size from 20 - 300 microns and consist of 0. 2 - 20 -micron-size euhedral, subhedral, anhedral and rounded chromite grains surrounded by plagioclase or glass of plagioclase composition. Plagioclase has a low impedance to shock compression. Heat from shock-melted plagioclase caused adjacent chromite grains to melt; chromite grains crystallized from this melt. Those chromite grains in the assemblages that are completely surrounded by plagioclase are generally richer in Al 2 O 3, than unmelted, matrix chromite grains in the same meteorite. Chromite veinlets (typically 0. 5 - 2 microns thick and 10 - 300 microns long) occur typically in the vicinity of chromite-plagioclase assemblages. The veinlets formed from chromite-plagioclase melts that were injected into fractures in neighboring silicate grains; chromite crystallized in the fractures and the residual plagioclase-rich melt continued to flow, eventually pooling to form plagioclase-rich melt pockets. Chromite-rich chondrules (consisting mainly of olivine, plagioclase-normative mesostasis, and 5 - 15 vol. % chromite) occur in many shocked OC and OC regolith breccias but they are absent from primitive type- 3 OC. They may have formed by impact melting chromite, plagioclase and adjacent mafic silicates during higher-energy shock events. The melt was jetted from the impact site and formed droplets due to surface tension. Crystallization of these droplets may have commenced in flight, prior to landing on the parent-body surface. Chromite-plagioclase assemblages and chromite veinlets occur in 25 out of 25 shock-stage S 1 OC of petrologic type 5 and 6 that I examined. Although these rocks contain unstrained olivine with sharp optical extinction, most possess other shock indicators such as extensive silicate darkening, numerous occurrences of metallic Cu, polycrystalline troilite, and opaque veins. It seems likely that these rocks were shocked to levels at least as high as shock-stage S 3 and then annealed by heat generated during the shock event. During annealing, the olivine crystal lattices healed but other shock indicators survived. Published Ar-Ar age data for some SI OC indicate that many shock and annealing events occurred very early in the history of the parent asteroids. The common occurrence of shocked and annealed OC is consistent with collisions being a major mechanism responsible for metamorphosing OC...|$|E

Multiple thin slices were prepared from the precious particle by means of focused ion beam thinning, providing a unique three-dimensional access to its interior. The 40 [*]×[*] 50 μm sized olivine particle contains a spherical diopside inclusion and an intimate intergrowth of troilite and tetrataenite. The compositions of olivine (Fo 69 Fa 31) and diopside (En 48 Wo 42 Fs 10), as well as the high Ni content of the sulfide-metal alloy, indicate a LL ordinary chondrite origin in accord with previous classifications. Although no impact crater exists at the surface of RB-QD 04 - 0042, transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of various shock defects in constituent minerals. These defects are planar fractures and [001] screw dislocations in olivine, multiple { 101 } deformation twins in tetrataenite and basal (0001) stacking faults in troilite. These diagnostic <b>shock</b> <b>indicators</b> occur only in a small zone on one concave side of the dust particle characterized by a high fracture density. These observations can be explained by a collisional event that spalled off material from the particle's surface. Alternatively, the dust particle itself could be a spallation fragment of an impact into a larger regolith target. This suggests that Itokawa dust particles lacking visible microcraters on their surfaces might have still experienced shock metamorphism and were involved in collisional fragmentation that resulted in the formation of regolith.|$|R

In all objects, except {{perhaps for the}} highest metallicity ones, {{we find that the}} extinctions A(V) in the optical and NIR ranges are similar, implying that the NIR hydrogen emission lines in low-metallicity BCDs do not reveal more star formation than seen in the optical. We conclude that emission-line spectra of low-metallicity BCDs in the 0. 36 - 2. 40 mum wavelength range are emitted by a relatively transparent ionized gas. The H 2 emission line fluxes can be accounted for by fluorescence in most of the observed galaxies. We find a decrease of the H 2 2. 122 mum emission line relative to the Brgamma line with increasing ionization parameter. This indicates an efficient destruction of H 2 by the stellar UV radiation. The intensities of the [FeII] 1. 257 mum and 1. 644 mum emission lines in the spectra of all galaxies, but one, are consistent with the predictions of Cloudy stellar photoinization models. There is thus no need to invoke shock excitation for these lines, and they are not necessarily <b>shock</b> <b>indicators</b> in low-metallicity high-excitation BCDs.

40|$|Northwest Africa (NWA) 428 is an L chondrite {{that was}} {{successively}} thermally metamorphosed to petrologic type- 6, shocked to stage S 4 -S 5, brecciated, and annealed to approximately petrologic type- 4. Its thermal and shock history {{resembles that of}} the previously studied LL 6 chondrite, Miller Range (MIL) 99301, which formed on a different asteroid. The petrologic type- 6 classification of NWA 428 is based on its highly recrystallized texture, coarse metal (150 +/- 150 micron), troilite (100 +/- 170 micron), and plagioclase (20 - 60 micron) grains, and relatively homogeneous olivine (Fa(sub 24. 4 +/- 0. 6)), low-Ca pyroxene (FS(sub 2. 5 +/- 0 ~, 4), and plagioclase (Ab(sub 84. 2 +/- 0. 4) compositions. The petrographic criteria that indicate shock stage S 4 -S 5 include the presence of chromite veinlets, chromite-plagioclase assemblages, numerous occurrences of metallic Cu, irregular troilite grains within metallic Fe-Ni, polycrystalline troilite, duplex plessite, metal and troilite veins, large troilite nodules, and low-Ca clinopyroxene with polysynthetic twins. If the rock had been shocked before thermal metamorphism, low-Ca clinopyroxene produced by the shock event would have transformed into orthopyroxene. Post-shock brecciation is indicated {{by the presence of}} recrystallized clasts and highly shocked clasts that form sharp boundaries with the host. Post-shock annealing is indicated by the sharp optical extinction of the olivine grains; during annealing, the damaged olivine crystal lattices healed. If temperatures exceeded those approximating petrologic type- 4 (approximately 600 - 700 C) during annealing, the low-Ca clinopyroxene would have transformed into orthopyroxene. The other <b>shock</b> <b>indicators,</b> likewise, survived the mild annealing. An impact event is the most plausible source of post-metamorphic, post-shock annealing because any A 1 - 26 that may have been present when the asteroid accreted would have decayed away by the time NWA 428 was annealed. The similar inferred histories of NWA 428 (L 6) and MIL 99301 (LL 6) indicate that impact heating affected more than 1 ordinary chondrite parent body...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to shock effects in olivine, plagioclase, orthopyroxene and Ca-pyroxene, petrographic <b>shock</b> <b>indicators</b> in equilibrated ordinary chondrites (OC) include chromite veinlets, chromite-plagioclase assemblages, polycrystalline troilite, metallic Cu, irregularly shaped troilite grains within metallic Fe-Ni, rapidly solidified metal-sulfide intergrowths, martensite and {{various types of}} plessite, metal-sulfide veins, large metal and/or sulfide nodules, silicate melt veins, silicate darkening, low-Ca clinopyroxene, silicate melt pockets, and large regions of silicate melt. The presence {{of some of these}} indicators in every petrologic type- 4 to - 6 ordinary chondrite (OC) demonstrates that collisional events caused all equilibrated OC to reach shock stages S 3 -S 6. Those type- 4 to - 6 OC that are classified as shock-stage S 1 (on the basis of sharp optical extinction in olivine) underwent postshock annealing due to burial beneath materials heated by the impact event. Those type- 4 to - 6 OC that are classified S 2 (on the basis of undulose extinction and lack of planar fractures in olivine) were shocked to stage S 3 -S 6, annealed to stage S 1 and then shocked again to stage S 2. Some OC were probably shocked to stage 253 after annealing. It seems likely that many OC experienced multiple episodes of shock and annealing. Because 40 Ar- 39 Ar chronological data indicate that MIL 99301 (LL 6, Sl) was annealed approximately 4. 26 Ga ago, presumably as a consequence of a major impact, it seems reasonable to suggest that other equilibrated S 1 and S 2 OC (which contain relict shock features) were also annealed by impacts. Because some type- 6 S 1 OC (e. g., Guarena, Kernouve, Portales Valley, all of which contain relict shock features) were annealed 4. 44 - 4. 45 Ga ago (during a period when impacts were prevalent and most OC were thermally metamorphosed), it follows that impact-induced annealing could have contributed significantly to OC thermal metamorphism...|$|R
