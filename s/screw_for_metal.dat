50|$|A {{possible}} {{distinction is}} that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure {{to the opposite side}} of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping <b>screws</b> <b>for</b> various <b>metal</b> fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.|$|R

After the 2000  cycles of compressive tensile loadings, removal torque value (RTV) of abutment screw represented no statistical differences among three groups. Standard deviation was largest in the RTV of EP and smallest in that of CC. The results of microleakage of toluidine blue from implant–abutment connection indicated that microleakage generally increased as loading procedure progressed.|$|R

40|$|Most {{air duct}} system {{components}} are {{assembled in the}} field and are mechanically fastened by sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> (<b>for</b> sheet metal-to-sheet <b>metal)</b> or by drawbands (<b>for</b> flex duct-to-sheet <b>metal).</b> Air sealing is separate from this mechanical fastening and is usually achieved using tape or mastic products after mechanical fastening. Field observations have shown that mechanical fastening rarely meets code or manufacturers requirements and that sealing procedures are similarly inconsistent. To address these problems, Proctor Engineering Group (PEG) is developing a system of joining ducts (called PEGIT) that combines the mechanical fastening and sealing into a single self-contained procedure. The PEGIT system uses a shaped flexible seal between specially designed sheet metal duct fittings to both seal and fasten duct sections together. Figure 1 shows the inner duct fitting complete with rubber seal. This seal provides the air seal for the completed fitting and is shaped to allow the inner and outer fittings to slide together, and then to lock the fittings in place. The illustration in Figure 2 shows the approximate cross section of the rubber seal that shows how the seal has a lip that is angled backwards. This angled lip allows the joint to be pushed together by folding flat but then its long axis makes it stiff in the pulling apart direction. This study was undertaken to assist PEG in some of the design aspects of this system and to test the performance of the PEGIT system. This study was carried out in three phases. The initial phase evaluated the performance of a preliminary seal design for the PEGIT system. After the first phase, the seal was redesigned and this new seal was evaluated in the second phase of testing. The third phase performed more detailed testing of the second seal design to optimize the production tolerances of the sheet metal fittings. This report summarizes our findings from the first two phases and provides details about the third phase of testing...|$|R

40|$|Background: Polylactic acid polymer {{interference}} screws {{are commonly}} used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions, especially in proximal tibia fixation. However, several concerns have been raised, including the acid products during its degradation in vivo. In recent years, biodegradable magnesium (Mg) -based implants have become attractive because of their favourable mechanical properties, which are more {{similar to those of}} natural bone when compared with other degradable materials, such as polymers, apart from their alkaline nature during degradation. Methods: We developed a pure Mg interference <b>screw</b> <b>for</b> ACL reconstruction. In the present study, 24 fresh cadaver knees were used to compare the mechanical properties of pure Mg interference screws and polylactic acid polymer interference <b>screws</b> <b>for</b> ACL reconstruction via their application on the proximal tibia tested using specific robotics. Results: Results showed that the pure Mg interference screw group showed similar mechanical stability to the polylactic acid polymer interference screw group, implying comparable postoperative fixation effects. Conclusion: As there are no commercially available Mg-based interference <b>screws</b> <b>for</b> ACL reconstruction clinically and the in vivo degradation of pure Mg promotes bone formation, our cadaveric study supports its clinical tests for ACL reconstruction...|$|R
