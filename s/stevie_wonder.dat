5|$|Aker Stadion {{has been}} {{proposed}} used during the annual Moldejazz, Norway's largest jazz festival, but this has been rejected several times by the festival management.

5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as the sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of <b>Stevie</b> <b>Wonder</b> and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
