5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942.

All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E

5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they {{may also have been}} used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{athletic}} teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. Senior classes would sometimes select colors {{of their own}} choosing. In modern times, the uniforms {{have been based on}} <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of the four colors of the Maryland flag: red, white, black, and gold. The dominant colors have occasionally changed back and forth with changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert: the Calvert family arms (black and gold) quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E

5|$|Temple-building {{continued}} into the third centuryAD, but as the empire weakened, imperial donations to the temple cults dried up. Cult activities continued, relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities. In the following centuries, Christian emperors issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples. Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the Serapeum and other temples in Alexandria in AD 391 or 392. Through <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuriesAD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.|$|E
5|$|The first Giant Schnauzers {{emerged from}} Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and Württemberg in the 17th century.

The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} used {{in musical}} entertainment are either solely the human voice (2, 6) or solely instrumental (1, 3) or <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> {{of the two}} (4, 5, 7, 8). Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual (10), passing by (3), small (1, 2) or large (6, 7, 8, 9). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and overtone singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (7).|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|Iridium has two {{naturally}} occurring, stable isotopes, 191Ir and 193Ir, {{with natural}} abundances of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 34 radioisotopes {{have also been}} synthesized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 199. 192Ir, which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 73.827days, and finds application in brachytherapy and in industrial radiography, particularly for nondestructive testing of welds in steel in {{the oil and gas}} industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day—188Ir, 189Ir, and 190Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> of β+ decay, α decay, and (rare) proton emission, with the exceptions of 189Ir, which decays by electron capture. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by β− decay, although 192Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path.
