50|$|With {{the use of}} a kernel driver (specifically {{a filter}} driver), that {{intercepts}} calls to the filesystem functions, any activity is captured immediately as it occurs. This utilises the same type of technology that real time active virus checkers employ. At this level, logical file operations are captured like file open, write, delete, etc. The kernel driver transmits these commands to another process, generally over a network to a different machine, which will mimic the operations of the source machine. Like block-level storage replication, the file-level replication allows both synchronous and asynchronous modes. In <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode,</b> write operations on the source machine are held and not allowed to occur until the destination machine has acknowledged the successful replication. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> is less common with file replication products although a few solutions exist.|$|E

5000|$|Synchronization. The fourth {{important}} {{class of}} control goals corresponds to synchronization (more accurately, [...] "controlled synchronization" [...] as distinct from"autosynchronization" [...] or [...] "self-synchronization"). Generally speaking, synchronization {{is understood as}} concurrent change of the states {{of two or more}} systems or, perhaps, concurrent change of some quantities related to the systems, e.g., equalizing of oscillation frequencies. If the required relation is established only asymptotically, one speaks of [...] "asymptotic synchronization". If synchronization does not exist in the system without control the problem may be posed as finding the control function which ensures synchronization in the closed-loop system, i.e., synchronization may be a control goal. Synchronization problem differs from the model reference control problem in that some phase shifts between the processes are allowed that are either constant or tend to constant values. Besides, in a number of synchronization problems the links between the systems to be synchronized are bidirectional. In such cases the limit mode (<b>synchronous</b> <b>mode)</b> in the overall system is not known in advance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhile the {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) {{operation in the}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> rotor speed average value coincides with current frequency in the windings by definition.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} first {{investigate}} synchronous (SYN) versus asynchronous (ASY) {{mode of propulsion}} and, second, investigate the wheel camber effects on sprinting performance as well as temporal parameters. Seven wheelchair basketball players performed four maximal eight-second sprints on a wheelchair ergometer. They repeated the test according to two modes of propulsion (SYN and ASY) and two wheel cambers (9 ° and 15 °). The mean maximal velocity and push power output was greater in the <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> compared to the asynchronous mode for both camber angles. However, the fluctuation in the velocity profile is inferior for ASY versus SYN mode for both camber angles. Greater push time/cycle time (Pt/Ct) and arm frequency (AF) for <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> versus asynchronous mode and inversely, lesser Ct and rest time (Rt) values for the <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode,</b> for which greater velocity were observed. SYN mode leads to better performance than ASY mode in terms of maximal propulsion velocity. However, ASY propulsion allows greater continuity of the hand-rim force application, reducing fluctuations in the velocity profile. The camber angle {{had no effect on}} ASY and SYN mean maximal velocity and push power output. The study of wheelchair propulsion strategies is important for better understanding physiological and biomechanical impacts of wheelchair propulsion for individuals with disabilities. From a kinematical point of view, this study highlights <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> of propulsion to be more efficient, with regards to mean maximal velocity reaching during maximal sprinting exercises. Even if this study focuses on well-trained wheelchair athletes, results from this study could complement the knowledge on the physiological and biomechanical adaptations to wheelchair propulsion and therefore, might be interesting for wheelchair modifications for purposes of rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|The double-homodyne and the {{heterodyne}} detection schemes for phase shifts between two <b>synchronous</b> <b>modes</b> {{of the electromagnetic}} field are analyzed {{in the framework of}} quantum estimation theory. The probability operator-valued measures (POM's) of the detectors are evaluated and compared with the ideal one in the limit of strong local reference oscillator. The present operational approach leads to a reasonable definition of phase measurement, whose sensitivity is actually related to the output r. m. s. noise of the photodetector. We emphasize that the simple-homodyne scheme does not correspond to a proper phase-shift measurements as it is just a zero-point detector. The sensitivity of all detection schemes are optimized at fixed energy with respect to the input state of radiation. It is shown that the optimal sensitivity can be actually achieved using suited squeezed states...|$|R
40|$|While the {{specification}} {{languages of}} workflow management systems focus on process execution semantics, the successful development of workflows {{relies on a}} fuller conceptualisation of business processing including the treatment of time, document transfer, and workflow use and reuse.
