25|$|Anna Karoline {{served as}} a cargo vessel and the cargo changed {{depending}} on what owners she had, {{time of the year}} and where she was stationed. When Ole Vandsvik was one of the owners Anna Karoline started the new year with a voyage to Lofoten to buy fish. The fish was <b>salted</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the vessel and she returned in May to Kiran in Roan where the fish was dried. While the fish was drying the jekt was transporting timber from Namsen to Northern Norway. When the fish had dried the vessel was loaded with stockfish, and sailed to Bergen. The vessel was also used for transporting herring and as sleeping quarters during fishing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} Nergård AS goes {{way back to}} the end of the 1940s. It all began in 1947 with a fishing boat that was called Ovedia that was owned by Arvid and Olga Nergård. The boat was used to travel along the coast of Finnmark and Lofoten to buy fish that were gutted and <b>salted</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> before it was sold to people. They had the boat for many years and were very successful. This {{developed}} to their purchase of a factory in the start of 1972. The factory was sited at Lysnes in Senja that is in Nord of Norway. Here the company [...] "Arvid Nergård AS" [...] was started. After a while their son Ole-Arvid took over. He developed the company from being a factory in Lysnes to be a big group with many subsidiaries all around North-Norway.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} storage {{methods for}} sardine muscle: (1) in <b>salt</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the fishing vessel and in ice after off-loading, (2) in ice from capture, and (3) after storage {{at ambient temperature}} in ice from off-loading, were studied. Storage in salt drastically altered the muscle, which lost its gel-forming capacity. Storage in ice {{from the time of}} capture maintained the gel-forming capacity for a longer length of time than when the fish were stored in ice only after off-loading. The electrophoretic profiles of the myofibrillar proteins extracted from the muscle stored in salt were quite distinct from those for the proteins from muscle stored using the other two methods, but all underwent changes during the study period. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.

25|$|The French, Spanish and Portuguese {{fishermen}} {{tended to}} {{fish on the}} Grand Banks and other banks out to sea, where fish were always available. They <b>salted</b> their fish <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ship {{and it was not}} dried until brought to Europe. The English fishermen, however, concentrated on fishing inshore where the fish were only to be found at certain times of the year, during their migrations. These fishermen used small boats and returned to shore every day. They developed a system of light salting, washing and drying onshore which became very popular because the fish could remain edible for years. Many of their coastal sites gradually developed into settlements, notably St. John's, now the provincial capital.|$|R
60|$|Upon these {{frank and}} open {{declarations}} of friendship, we appointed {{the next day}} to dine all together; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provisions, with our punch-bowl and materials to fill it; and in particular I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer; things that neither the Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and which it may be supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the cooks roasted; and three of them were sent, covered up close, <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we did with their <b>salt</b> meat from <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The salt {{industry}} {{began in}} 1769 provided Anguilla with an export. This industry {{was based in}} the village known as [...] "Sandy Ground", which is situated on a stretch of sand between the large Road Salt Pond and Road Bay. Anguilla has roughly 270 acre of salt ponds, {{less than half of}} that of the Turks and Caicos. Although it lacked plantations and had smaller salt ponds, the salt industry benefited from close proximity to Demerrara, Trinidad, Barbados, Antigua and St. Kitts. Schooners returning to Canada from these colonies would make a last stop in Anguilla or St. Martin to purchase salt. These ships would jettison their ballast in Road Bay as the <b>salt</b> was loaded <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The granite rocks used as ballast accumulated at the northern end of Road Bay and formed a reef known locally as [...] "The Ballast".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jack, old fellow, what do {{you think}} of it?" [...] Godfrey said to the dog as it nestled up close to him. [...] "Here we are now, out in a regular storm. It is lucky we have plenty of sea-room, Jack. I reckon it is seventy or eighty miles across to the other side of the gulf, and I don't suppose she can drag those spars through the water much more than a mile an hour. So we have plenty of time before us. We must both put away as much time in sleep as we can. We have lost almost all our provisions, old boy, and our water, which was of still more consequence. It is very lucky I always made a rule of having the kettle filled and put <b>on</b> <b>board</b> here after each meal and of keeping a dozen pounds of meat here. I thought we might be obliged to cast the boat adrift suddenly. Well, if we have luck, we may find it again. We shall both drift in the same line, and there is no reason why she shouldn't live through it. The stock of {{firewood}} has gone down, and she has not got above a couple of hundred pounds' weight in her altogether. I am afraid she will take enough <b>salt</b> water <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to spoil our supply of fresh, but I think we are drifting pretty straight for the Kara River. I calculated that it lay dead to leeward of us when the wind went to the north-west." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vampiros {{may be made}} in a tall {{glass or}} an old {{fashioned}} glass. Bartenders may first [...] "rim" [...] the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher <b>Salt</b> <b>on</b> a chopping <b>board,</b> moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim. The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.|$|R
40|$|Growth {{of organic}} {{compounds}} from solution, in particular Rochelle salt and triglycine sulphate, was investigated. Ground-based experiments showed that gravity-driven convection currents {{in the growth}} solution influenced defect production in crystals, degraded ferroelectric quality, and indicated that an experiment done in a zero-gravity environment would be beneficial. A crystal of Rochelle <b>salt</b> was grown <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Skylab- 4. The quality of this crystal was compared to earth-grown crystals and its unusual features were studied. A typical defect produced in this convection-free environment was a long straight tube extending {{in the direction of}} the c crystal axis. These tubes were much longer and more regularly arranged than in similar earth-grown crystals. The crystal was actually several crystals with corresponding axes parallel to each other. Ferroelectric hysteresis experiments showed that some parts of the crystal had many defects, while other parts were of extremely good quality...|$|R

50|$|On 22 March 1812 the ship, {{under the}} command of Richard Siddons (or Siddins), left Sydney and arrived at Kangaroo Island, South Australia on 29 April 1812. There it took <b>on</b> <b>board</b> 1,650 seal skins and 33 tons of <b>salt.</b> <b>On</b> 21 May it left Kangaroo Island for Macquarie Island. At midnight on 10 June rocks were spotted. Tacking was not {{possible}} and so an anchor was dropped. The Campbell Macquarie struck the rocks at 1.30am and by 2am her stern post broke and water poured in. The pumps were unable to cope with the inflow and at daylight the crew began unloading the cargo, sails, and rigging. Much of it was saved, only to be destroyed weeks later in a storm. On 28 June the crew burnt the ship to salvage its ironwork.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that {{different}} financial environments would affect the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the various functions provided by bankers on board: monitoring, expertise and (or) certification. During the two years of research period, we plan to analyze empirically the relationships between bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s debt ratio and loan terms in order to clarify the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for global banks. First, since the firm』s debt ratio is an endogenous variable and would interact with bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> we will employ the simultaneous regression models to estimate the relations between the debt ratio and bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In addition, the estimation will be further divided into some regressions with different dependent variables, including the lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> non-lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> insurance companies <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> investment banks <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> other investors <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> to detail and compare their relations with the firm』s debt ratio. Finally, we also expect to explore the effects of the tenure of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s financial distress on the role of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> For the first year, the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s borrowing terms will be analyzed, and we plan to investigate how bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> influence the firm』s debt ratio in the second year of this research project. 許多研究指出不同的金融環境會影響銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的角色，本文將嘗試探討在全球國家中，銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種功能：監督、專業評估與（或）認證。在本計畫的兩年時間，我們預計實證分析全球的銀行進入企業董監事會與企業的負債比例以及銀行放款契約條件之間的關係，以釐清銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種可能角色。首先，由於銀行在企業董監事會與企業的負債比例為內生變數且彼此會相互影響，故在方法上將使用聯立迴歸模式（simultaneous regression models）同時考慮企業負債與銀行進入董監事會的關係。此外，本文除了考慮銀行進入企業董監事會之虛擬變數外，也將進一步探討董事銀行比例、非董事銀行比例、保險公司與投資銀行比例、其他投資者比例與企業負債比例之關係，以暸解上述董監事會成員之間的關係是否具有替代或互補關係。最後，本文也預計探討銀行進入企業董監事會的持續時間（tenure）及加入企業財務危機對銀行在董監事會所扮演的角色之影響，因為企業財務危機也可能會影響銀行加入企業董監事會的行為。本研究計畫預計在第一年首先進行銀行在企業董監事會與放款契約條件關係之研究，第二年則將進ㄧ步探討銀行在企業董監事會與企業資本結構之關係...|$|R
