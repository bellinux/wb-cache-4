5|$|Grandmaster (shortened as GM; {{sometimes}} International Grandmaster or IGM is used) {{is awarded}} to world-class chess masters.

There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} of Nero, {{senators}} were still primarily from Rome {{and other parts of}} Italy, with <b>some</b> <b>from</b> the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the most eastern province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By {{the time of}} the Severan dynasty (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (patria).|$|E

The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E

5|$|The Gododdin, {{known in}} Roman times as the Votadini, held territories {{in what is}} now {{southeast}} Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, <b>some</b> <b>from</b> as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.|$|E

5|$|Adventures of Mana is {{a remake}} of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was the first}} entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and <b>some</b> <b>from</b> Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake.|$|E
5|$|As well as St Augustine's, the abbots of {{a number}} of other monasteries in the diocese of Canterbury are known to have professed {{obedience}} to Theobald, as the documents recording the events survive. Not only abbots and priors from within Canterbury, but <b>some</b> <b>from</b> other dioceses swore to obey Theobald, although normally such oaths would have gone to their diocesan bishop instead. Most of these exceptions occurred because the monastic house claimed exemption from the oversight of their diocesan bishop, and had a tradition of making those oaths to Canterbury instead. Besides these events, Theobald also intervened in the elections of some abbots, although not always successfully. He attempted to secure the right of Gilbert Foliot to remain Abbot of Gloucester after Foliot's election as Bishop of Hereford, but a new abbot was elected by the monks of Gloucester. Theobald was more successful in securing the election of William, who had previously been a monk at Christ Church, to be Abbot of Evesham over the objections of some of the monks of Evesham.|$|E
