5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time).</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time),</b> and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E

5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.

It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics.

A radial basis {{function}} {{neural network}} (RBFNN) model is employed {{to predict the}} short-interval (within 15 -minute) traffic series, including flow, speed and occupancy, which are measured in different time intervals, time lags, dimensions of state <b>spaces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> of day. Aside from describing entirely the methodology of RBFNN, the paper also uses two deterministic functions to test prediction power of the model. A field study with flow, time-mean-speed <b>and</b> percent occupancy <b>time</b> series directly extracted from two dual-loop detectors on a freeway of Taiwan is conducted. The results reveal that the predictive accuracies for different short-interval traffic dynamics by RBFNN model are quite satisfactory. It is {{also found that the}} predictive accuracies can be affected by the means of representing traffic series in terms of various time intervals, time lags, dimensions of state <b>spaces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> of day.

They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is {{on the brink of}} dying from the imprint of an Angel in her eye. Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack in <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides {{the foundation for the}} current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E

In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
