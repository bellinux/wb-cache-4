25|$|Alan and Dale Klapmeier {{grew up in}} DeKalb, Illinois. Their parents {{bought a}} second home in the early 1970s on a small farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Aviation {{was a part of}} the {{brothers}}' lives from a very early age; Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that when he was a baby, the only way his mother could get him to <b>stop</b> <b>crying</b> at times was to bring him to an airport and park the car at the end of the runway so he could watch airplanes. The brothers constantly built model airplanes as infants and Dale was known to repeatedly pester their father into letting them build real ones. When Dale reached the age of 15, he learned to fly in a Cessna 140 before learning to drive a car. While still in high school, Alan joined the Civil Air Patrol at age 17 as a way of getting cheaper flying lessons. He would often go around visiting small airports to talk to pilots and even told his friends that he wanted to design aircraft, speaking about how he and his younger brother would one day compete with Cessna.|$|E
25|$|Tyrone Dobbs {{was also}} the centre of a {{domestic}} abuse storyline when he was introduced to police officer Kirsty Soames whilst on a night out. Tyrone and Kirsty immediately hit it off. Kirsty's temper began to show when she used to become jealous of Tyrone's friends, specifically his friendship with Fiz Stape. Kirsty fell pregnant and her temper soon turned violent as she lashed out at Tyrone on numerous occasions, attacking him with her fists and kitchen appliances. Tyrone hid his injuries from his concerned friends and refused to leave the house. Kirsty gave birth in the Rovers Return after a heated confrontation with Tina, yet Tyrone was absent due to him fixing Fiz's boiler. This made Kirsty secretly leave out Tyrone's name as their newborn daughter Ruby's father on the birth certificate. Kirsty's violent outbursts become more frequent and a terrified Tyrone finally confides in a horrified Fiz about Kirsty's domestic abuse, this leads to Tyrone and Fiz embarking on a secret affair after she confesses her love for him. Fiz and Tyrone conspire a plan together for Tyrone to wed Kirsty then report Kirsty to the police for her domestic abuse, resulting in Kirsty being sent to prison and Tyrone getting full custody of his daughter Ruby. Tyrone proposes to a delighted Kirsty, but Kirsty eventually discovers his affair with Fiz, and their plan. Kirsty eventually reveals Fiz and Tyrone's affair {{in front of everybody}} at her and Tyrone's wedding. After the wedding, Kirsty and Tyrone have a blazing row back at their house, resulting in Kirsty falling down the stairs after trying to attack Tyrone. The row is overheard by several neighbours and they think Tyrone has been assaulting Kirsty and call the police. Kirsty lies to the police and makes a false accusation that Tyrone has been beating her for months. This leads to Tyrone's arrest and he is bailed until his appending trial. Whilst on bail, Tyrone flees Weatherfield with Fiz, her daughter Hope and his daughter Ruby causing the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. Tyrone is caught and arrested. Kirsty lies again whilst giving evidence at Tyrone's trial by playing the victim to the jury. But whilst struggling being a single mum at home, Kirsty snaps at a screaming Ruby and starts screaming at her child to <b>stop</b> <b>crying.</b> Realising that she does not trust herself around her daughter, Kirsty interrupts Tyrone's trial and confesses to the judge that it was her who had been assaulting Tyrone and he was innocent. Tyrone gets released and Kirsty gets charged and is sentenced to three years in prison. Tyrone gets full custody of Ruby and starts his new life with his girlfriend Fiz.|$|E

You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation.

500|$|Despite her {{recollections}} of a pleasant early childhood, Hügel-Marshall was {{singled out for}} her skin colour. Growing up, she faced constant racism and was referred to by the local community as a Negermischling; Mischling was the term used by the Nazis to designate [...] "mixed" [...] children (with a Jewish and a non-Jewish parent). In 1952, when {{she was ready to}} start school, her mother was forced by social services to send her to the orphanage God's Little Cabin Children's Home. She lived there {{for the rest of her}} childhood, despite promises that it was only temporary, that she would only be there for six weeks. At the home, she endured mental and physical abuse from both adults and children. This included being shouted at to <b>stop</b> <b>crying</b> for her mother, being force-fed her own vomit, and undergoing an exorcism, during which she was blindfolded and forced to repeat such phrases as [...] "Satan, I cast you out" [...] and [...] "Lord Jesus, purify my black soul." [...] She was allowed to go home for summer vacations; she never told her family about her bad experiences at the children's home.|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as Charley [...] "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's {{character}} in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the [...] "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not <b>stop</b> <b>crying,</b> which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked {{him as a person}} and frequently complained during the production of Brando's [...] "predilection for leaving the set" [...] immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: [...] "We didn't {{get to know each other}} at all. He always flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he's just a hooker, and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with BBC News, Steiger said he probably would not have done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.|$|E

Vivien approaches a confused Nora who mistakes her for a nanny and demands she be called Mrs. Montgomery. Vivien complies and Nora confesses the baby took one breath before dying, thus keeping the baby's ghost in the house. Nora recognizes Vivien and insults her for having a baby that won't <b>stop</b> <b>crying</b> to which Vivien defends the baby. Vivien asks for permission to hold him, to which Nora angrily refuses and proclaims the baby as hers as arrangements were made with which Vivien regretfully complies. Vivien offers help in calming her still crying son to which Nora finally agrees. Vivien calms her child almost immediately, Nora confesses she does not have the constitution to be a caring mother and she wanted to hurt the baby and leaves the baby to Vivien to get a [...] "good rest". Finally free of anyone trying to claim her child, [...] Vivien asks Moira to join their family as the baby's godmother, which she happily accepts. Vivien names their baby Jeffrey. Together, as one happy family, they all celebrate Christmas by decorating a tree in the abandoned house with various ornaments found in the attic.

500|$|In [...] "Torn and Frayed", as his penance, Castiel {{has turned}} {{back on his}} [...] "angel radio" [...] and travels around helping people who have need of help or healing. He {{demonstrates}} this by healing a sick infant that won't <b>stop</b> <b>crying.</b> After getting a distress call from Samandriel, Naomi summons Castiel to rescue the angel. Castiel enlists Dean's help and repeatedly wonders where Sam is, unaware that Sam and Dean are currently not getting along. After getting the ingredients for a [...] "demon bomb", Castiel gets Sam as they will {{need all the help}} they can get to rescue Samandriel and yells at Sam and Dean for their behavior. At the warehouse, Castiel tells Sam and Dean what symbols to neutralize and where so he can enter and gives Sam his sword so he has a weapon against demons. After Sam and Dean clear the way, Castiel enters, but is weakened by the other sigils in the building. Samandriel's screams cause him to remember being tied down by Naomi who approaches his eye with a mysterious instrument and is unable to help Sam and Dean in breaking into the room where Samandriel is. After they get in, Castiel frees Samandriel while Sam and Dean deal with the demons guarding him and takes the other angel outside. There, Samandriel begs for Castiel not to return him to Heaven and tries to warn him that [...] "they" [...] are controlling him. Before Samandriel can explain, Naomi forces Castiel to kill him for being a [...] "traitor". Castiel is horrified by this, but Naomi reveals that Samandriel telling Crowley about the angel Word of God tablet puts all in angels in danger and Castiel is a hero. Under her orders, he claims to Sam and Dean that he was forced to kill Samandriel in self-defense and that he is taking him back to Heaven to put him to rest (in reality so Naomi can determine just how much he broke), but his weird behavior and the fact that his eye starts bleeding arouses Sam and Dean's suspicions that he is being controlled.|$|E
