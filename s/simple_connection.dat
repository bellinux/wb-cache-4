On the contrary, the results of calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the universe would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical).

40|$|The {{resistance}} {{of a building}} to fire {{is the ability of}} the structure to withstand a combination of gravity loads and the induced thermal loads without undergoing failure either during the heating or cooling phases of the fire. Many researchers internationally have investigated the performance of steel-frame buildings in fire. However, few of them have examined U. S. building construction practices. ^ This project focused on the thermal and structural behavior of <b>simple</b> (shear) <b>connections</b> used in steel-frame buildings through experimental and numerical investigations. These connections include shear-tab, single-angle, and double-angle connections, both all-bolted and all-welded. The experimental approach included the use of high-temperature ceramic fiber radiant heaters, vertical loading, and advanced thermal instrumentation. Isolate lap joints were heated to target temperatures and loaded to evaluate the isolated failure modes of <b>simple</b> <b>connections.</b> These failure modes included bolt shear and plate bearing. Large-scale composite beams with <b>simple</b> <b>connections</b> were subjected to a combination of heating and loading. These tests evaluated failure modes of <b>simple</b> <b>connections</b> {{as a part of a}} floor system subjected to fire loading conditions. While the composite beams were able to sustain the service level loads at elevated temperatures, the shear-tab connections fractured during the cooling phase of the test. Single-angle and double-angle connections did not fail, rather prying of the angles was observed after the cooling phase. ^ Sequentially-coupled thermal-structural 3 D finite element models were developed to evaluate both the thermal and structural response of composite beams with <b>simple</b> <b>connections.</b> This modeling approach accounted for temperature-dependent material properties and the force-slip behavior of the shear studs. In addition, these models included contact definitions between the connection elements to simulate the bolt bearing behavior on the connection. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the capacity of <b>simple</b> <b>connections</b> at elevated temperatures. Variations in connection geometry, fire resistance rating, concrete deck type, continuous reinforcement were considered. ^ The thermal and structural behavior of <b>simple</b> <b>connections</b> was evaluated as an isolated connection, as a part of a one-bay composite beam, three-bay composite beam, and as a part of a full ten-story office building. The results of the parametric study were evaluated at a full building scale. Compartment, full-story, and moving fires were simulated in a ten-story office building. The fire resistance rating of structural members varied to understand the most cost efficient and effective fire resistance rating to withstand design fires. The results were compared with simplified methodologies developed by previous researchers to provide a simple design method without having to perform extensive thermal and structural analyses. ...|$|R

40|$|In the UK, <b>simple</b> steel <b>connections,</b> {{including}} flexible end plates, fin {{plates and}} web cleats, {{are the most}} popular for steel structures. Experimental tests completed in Sheffield have shown that issues concerning tying resistance and ductility are problematic for <b>simple</b> steel <b>connections</b> at elevated temperatures, which could significantly affect the overall performance of steel structures due to a loss of structural integrity in a fire situation. Conducting experimental tests is an attractive and straight-forward research approach but is time-consuming and expensive in comparison with finite element modelling.

This paper presents a quasi-static analysis with cohesive elements to investigate the resistance and ductility (rotation capacity) of <b>simple</b> steel <b>connections</b> (flexible end plates) in fire conditions. In comparison with experimental test data, a good correlation with the finite element analysis is achieved and the method is suitable to study the tying resistance and ductility for <b>simple</b> steel <b>connections</b> with various dimensions at different temperatures. 1...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{connection}} are generally {{considered in the}} design of steel structures in practice. These are classified as completely rigid (fixed) and <b>simple</b> (pin) <b>connections.</b> In theory, completely rigid connections cannot undergo rotation and <b>simple</b> <b>connections</b> cannot transfer moment. Nevertheless, in reality, rigid connections have a relative flexibility which makes them to rotate and <b>simple</b> <b>connections</b> have some reserve capacity to transfer moments. However, in an effort {{to increase the amount of}} data on the rotational stiffness of top and seat angle available to researchers, this thesis presents the modeled and non linear analysis of different theoretical top and seat angle connections. The finite element modeling software, ABAQUS, is used to create moment-rotation curves for these theoretical connections such as top and seat angle connection with bracket and top and seat angle connection with gusset plate. To demonstrate finite element modeling’s ability to accurately predict the response of the theoretical connections, the results of several experiments performed on top and seat connections are reproduced in ABAQUS. The result of this study shows that initial stiffness of top and seat angle connection increased when attached bracket or gusset plate in connection zone. It is also found that this type of connection can be classified as rigid connection...|$|R

Thus, a <b>simple</b> <b>connection</b> with two patch cables at each end and a section of fixed cable in the middle has got three crossovers in total, resulting in a working connection.

Solid mats are lighter in weight than hollow rig mats but due to the simpler connection system provide the same or similar usable working surface area per mat once connected (10’ x 8’, 13.5’ x 6.5’). Typically this means that a significantly greater number of solid mats can be loaded onto a truck resulting {{in a number of}} key benefits including larger working surface area per truckload, reduced number of transport trips per project, reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per project, and reduced transport costs per project.A <b>simple</b> <b>connection</b> system, using standard connectors and tools, is used which means that mats can easily be installed and connected on undulating as well as flat surfaces, avoiding the need to prepare the ground surface in advance of installation.
