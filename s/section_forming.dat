25|$|At {{the time}} of Sino-Indian border conflict, the Communist Party of India was accused by the Indian {{government}} as being pro-PRC, {{and a large number}} of political leaders were jailed. Subsequently, CPI split with the leftist <b>section</b> <b>forming</b> the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 1964. CPI(M) held some contacts with the Communist Party of China in the initial period after the split, but did not fully embrace the political line of Mao Zedong.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with Madapolam fabric and doped {{in a similar manner}} to the fuselage. The wing was {{installed}} into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle <b>section</b> <b>forming</b> the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.|$|E
25|$|The Rhönbussard had its wing {{over the}} cockpit, {{limiting}} the pilot's view, {{but on the}} Rhönsperber it was lowered to mid fuselage. It is an entirely wood and fabric aircraft with a wing built around a single spar. Forward of the spar the wing is plywood covered around the leading edge, forming a torsion-resisting D-box. Aft of the spar, the covering is fabric. Each wing has two sections, a parallel-chord centre section and a double straight tapered outer panel, ending with semi-elliptical tips. The only dihedral, 5°, is on the centre <b>section,</b> <b>forming</b> the gull wing. Airbrakes are centrally placed on the upper centre section surface and fabric-covered ailerons fill the trailing edges of the outer panels.|$|E

Some of the Brisbane suburbs worst {{affected}} by the floods were St Lucia, West End, Rocklea and Graceville. The floods damaged some of Brisbane's icons. The Brisbane Riverwalk, a floating walkway over the Brisbane River linking the inner city neighbourhoods of Fortitude Valley and New Farm, broke up, with a <b>section</b> <b>forming</b> a [...] "floating missile" [...] that threatened the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges.

2500|$|The Colorado Plateau {{varies from}} the large stands of forests in the west, {{including}} the largest stand of ponderosa pine trees in the world, to the Mesas to the east. Although not called a desert, the Colorado Plateau is mostly made up of high desert. Within the Southwest U.S. region, the Colorado is bordered to the south by the Mogollon Rim and the Sonoran Desert, to the west by the Mojave Desert, and to the east by the Rocky Mountains and the Llano Estacado. The Plateau {{is characterized by a}} series of plateaus and mesas, interspersed with canyons. The most dramatic example is the Grand Canyon. But that is one of many dramatic vistas included within the Plateau, which includes spectacular lava formations, [...] "painted" [...] deserts, sand dunes, and badlands. One of the most distinctive features of the Plateau is its longevity, having come into existence at least 500 million years ago. The Plateau can be divided into six sections, three of which fall into the Southwest region. Beginning with the Navaho <b>section</b> <b>forming</b> the northern boundary of the Southwestern United States, which has shallower canyons than those in the Canyonlands section just to its north; the Navaho section is bordered to the south by the Grand Canyon section, which of course is dominated by the Grand Canyon; and the southeastern-most portion of the Plateau is the Datil section, consisting of valleys, mesas, and volcanic formations. Albuquerque is the most populous city within the portion contained in the Southwest region, but Sante Fe, New Mexico and Flagstaff, Arizona, are also significant population centers.|$|E
