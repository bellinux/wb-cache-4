5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E

5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
5|$|Letcher {{supported}} Adams' administration, {{but became}} anti-administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest. Consistent with {{his support of}} Clay, he promoted expansion of internal improvements, including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson. In 1833, Clay proposed a compromise in the <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> quell the Nullification Crisis; Letcher introduced Clay's compromise in the House.|$|E

5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above.
