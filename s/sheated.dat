50|$|The Thetford Center Covered Bridge {{is located}} a short way {{west of the}} village of Thetford Center, {{spanning}} the south-flowing Ompompanoosuc River, {{a tributary of the}} Connecticut River. The bridge has a span of 128.5 ft, and rests on dry laid stone abutments that have been capped in concrete and a central concrete pier. The bridge is covered by a metal roof and <b>sheated</b> in vertical board siding. The portal ends project beyond the deck by about 1 ft. The deck is now supported by steel I-beams, and the original bridge trusses support only the bridge superstructure. The bridge has a total width of 20.5 ft, with an 18 ft wide roadway (one lane). The bridge trusses are a variant of a multiple kingpost truss. Each truss has verticals and diagonals in that style, but is further augmented by a laminated arch, consisting of heavy planks pegged together.|$|E
50|$|The Hatheway House {{is located}} in the village center of Suffield, {{on the west side of}} South Main Street, south of its {{junction}} with Bridge Street. It is a sprawling multi-section wood frame structure, with a 2-1/2 story five-bay central block flanked on the north by a 2-1/2 story three-bay section and on the left by a 1-1/2 story ell. Each section is covered by gambrel roof and is <b>sheated</b> in wooden clapboards. The center block, built in 1762, has a large central chimney, and its interior is finished with high-quality Georgian woodwork. The southern ell is an older structure with simple finishes, and may date as far back as 1732. The northern addition was added in 1795. The main entrance is at the center of the main block, sheltered by a Doric portico designed by Asher Benjamin and added in 1795. Outbuildings on the property include a carriage house and barn, both 19th-century structures.|$|E

50|$|Tucker's {{presidency}} {{came to an}} end as {{a result}} of conflicts with William N. <b>Sheats,</b> who became Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1893. <b>Sheats</b> was a racist and white supremacist and opponent of miscegenation and black political participation who was the namesake of the notorious 1895 <b>Sheats</b> Law enforcing strict racial segregation in schools, later ruled unconstitutional by the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. But <b>Sheats</b> also supported black schools and was an admirer of Booker T. Washington's advocacy of agricultural and industrial education. Tucker, however, favored a liberal arts approach to education designed for public school teachers and, despite changing the name of the school to the State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students, did not sufficiently emphasize the agricultural and industrial approach favored by <b>Sheats.</b> Gradually, Tucker's authority was reduced, expenditures and personnel decisions were disputed and investigated, and finally, he was ousted and replaced by Nathan B. Young in 1901.|$|R

However, with the development in recent decades of our knowledgeof the genetic variation basis, and improvements in computer capabilities, it has been possible to know the degree ofdiversification between individual populations and groups of populations. In this research by application of multivariateanalysis it was posible to find the Mahalanobis 02 values that let to estimate the gene tic divergence into cultivars of acolombian collection of garlic. The results showed the formulation of three genetic groups, one of them is conformed by genotypes with bulbs almost always unprotected from their <b>sheated</b> tunics, the other groups are composed by coveredbulbs and are different with each other, not only in its bulbs size, but also height of plant, and illness reactions. The diversity colletion helps very much in the cultivarsimprovement. Cuantificar la similaridad genética entre grupos de poblaciones biológicas ha sido uno de los principales problemas de las ciencias naturales. Sin embargo, en lasúltimas decadas, con los grandes avances en el conocimiento de las bases genéticas de la variación y con el desarrollo de los computadores, se ha podido determinar la diversidad entre individuos de una población y entre grupos de poblaciones. En este estudio, mediante análisis multivariados,se hallaron los valores 02 de Mahalanobis que permitieron estimar la divergencia genética entre cultivares de una colección colombiana de ajo. Los resultados señalan la formación de 3 grupos genéticos, uno de los cuales está integrado por genotipos con bulbos casi siempre desprovistos de túnicas envolventes, los otros grupos son de bulbos cubiertos y difieren entre sí, principalmente en el tamañode los mismos, porte de la planta y reacción a enfermedades.
