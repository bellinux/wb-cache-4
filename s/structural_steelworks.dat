50|$|A Typenturm (German for {{standard}} tower) is a standardised telecommunications tower built of reinforced concrete the former German federal post office (now Deutsche Telekom AG). Different types of tower were developed and built at different locations, like the series FMT 1 to FMT 16. The individual series differ {{in each case}} {{in the number of}} antenna platforms {{and the size of the}} operating projectile. The types FMT 7 to 10 are without pulpit. The type towers were usually designed on the basis of economic and functional criteria and only secondarily for aesthetics. Compared with <b>structural</b> <b>steelworks,</b> the reinforced concrete construction way is easier in the establishment and maintenance. In Germany there are about 300 towers of this type. The establishment of these towers began in the mid-1960s, when the Federal Postal Administration developed its radio relay system clearly. In the planning of the type towers engineer Fritz Leonhardt and the architect Erwin Heinle were considerably involved. Examples of type towers are among other things: Köterberg (FMT 1), Ober-Olm (FMT 1/72), Hüfingen (FMT 1/73), Karlsruhe-Grünwettersbach (FMT 2), Waldenbuch (FMT 2/72), Hoherodskopf (FMT 2/73), Hemmoor (FMT 2/81), Hunau (FMT 3), Bielefeld (FMT 3/72), Gramschatzer Wald (FMT 5), Cleebronn (FMT 6), Seesen (FMT 7), Heidenheim an der Brenz (FMT 8), Saarlouis (FMT 8/73), Landau (FMT 9), Lahr/Schwarzwald (FMT 10), Fehmarn (FMT 11), sending refuge (FMT 12), Moers (FMT 13), Blauen (FMT 14), Schöppingen (FMT 15), Hamburg-Bergedorf (FMT 16) The communications towers in Münster, Kiel, Bremen and Cuxhaven were planned by an architect of the regional directorate Kiel and actually do not belong to this type of tower. They are therefore called Sondertürme, to which e.g. also the Rheinturm, the Heinrich-Hertz-Turm and the Fremersbergturm belong. In addition, the telecommunication tower Koblenz reminded strongly of the type towers FMT 11 to 13, is a special tower, since it is larger substantially more highly and the pulpit than with the type towers.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} a uniform design methodology for computer assisted experimental design for intumescent fire retardant coating (IFRC) formulations, exemplifies {{the benefits of}} using experimental design together with software to facilitate the formulation of an IFRC for <b>structural</b> <b>steelworks.</b> By applying a multivariate design for the screening experiments, many intumescent fire retardants were evaluated in comparatively few experiments. In this work, prior information {{has been used in}} the form of a model, based on historical experiments. A uniform design criterion is used to design a few additional experiments so that the resulting model can have an acceptable prediction power. A confirmatory experiment step is shown that a design which uses the uniform design methodology taking advantage of the experimental data collected from the DOE that using fewer trials gives a model with equivalent prediction capability. This can be critical where experiments are expensive to perform...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The coating {{thickness}} {{is an important}} variable that {{plays a role in}} product quality, process control and cost. Determination of the required working thicknesses for different service requirements is however a complicated task in the product finishing field. A previous study has shown that Nigeria is blessed with abundant bitumen resources for sustained exploitation as common, economical and effective coat-inhibitors of steelwork corrosion in her economy. This paper presents a testdetermination of the expected range of working thicknesses of coatings with proper bitumens from the resources. Bitumen samples were harvested at three different critical bitumen resource sites in the country for the tests. 30 specimens of the steel were properly prepared. Coatings of different thicknesses were produced on the specimens by dipping a different pair of them in each bitumen sample heated to each of five different temperatures in the range of 170 – 230 O C and removing and cooling them to 38 O C-room-temperature. The thickness of each produced coating was properly determined with a micrometer through dimensional change before and after coating. Analysis of the overall obtained data shows that the average working thicknesses of coatings with any bitumens of comparable quality to the as-harvested from the resources using temperatures in the range will decrease with increase in temperature from about 1. 46 to 0. 81 mm respectively, and thicknesses of coatings with the separate bitumens using the same bath temperature will have minimal variations.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} generation gap management resulting from personnel restructuring in foundries in Poland. <b>Structural</b> changes to <b>steelworks</b> led to {{a sharp decline in}} employment caused by decreased steelworks production. New hiring was limited as a part of employment rationalisation in the steelworks sector. Such personnel policy eventually led to a generation gap. Ratios between individual age groups of employees are imbalanced at steelworks: the numbers of young personnel are low and of those aged 50 + are high. This research forecasts changes in employment levels for the 2013 - 2019 period, aimed at closing the generation gap. The paper consists of three parts: (1) a descriptive analysis of labor market demographics in Poland’s steel industry; (2) proposed methodology for HR management model, and (3) econometric models forecasting labor demographics in Poland’s steel industry...|$|R
