40|$|After {{completing}} the rehabilitation {{process in a}} closed institution, the individual is released. Social reintegration {{is nothing more than}} just the process of overcoming the ensuing oppressive situation. The individual expects help and change in their existing situation, and when these are not the case there appears humiliation which transforms into trauma. The latter can change into polytrauma and then a person com mit s acts against their own will, harm ing themselves. Social reintegration is an individualized process whereby an individual has a chance to me et a specialist who can neutralize difficult states and situations. It is a matter of time whether or not the person in the specialist’s care will respond with their humiliation to integration rationaliza tion. The question is if an individual will settle for being socially marginal ized, underpriviliged and pauperized, or – by rejecting these states of identity - will turn them into socially accepted behaviour. Thus, what is meant here is per sonal traits which are essential for the role of reintegration process perform er – on the one hand as a protector, educator and helper, and on the other one – as an expert and advisor. When establishing normative law and an in stitutional system, what must be de veloped is such solutions which would allow probation officers to perform the above functions. Consequently, the prabation officer, counselor or <b>social</b> <b>therapist,</b> as reintegration experts with appropriate skills and techniques, are able to bring about a temporal and interpersonal change in an individual. A new image and lifestyle of the person undergoing therapy will be shaped through the strategy of destigmatisation and overcoming stress, i. e. getting out of an oppressive situation. This is a methodical, targeted and organized process, which has specific phases: successful institutional rehabilitation followed by rehabilitation in the open system. Its aim is to prepare an in dividual to change their former image and lifestyle through developing rel evant competencies, knowledge, selfassessment and motivation. Given the above, there should be developed individual rehabilitation programmes, Le. offers of change. The word “offer” im plies that one person proposes changes, and the other participates in the process by jointly determining aims and tasks which can result in the programme implementation. In order for an offer to bring about a real change in an individual’s behaviour, there must be provided proper means and tools necessary to accomplish direct and indirect services of a formative and therapist nature. This can be don e by means of original rehabilitation offers. What is necessary {{on the part of the}} community, however, is a network of institutionalized specialist services as a response to honesty, diligence and usefulness, i. e. axiological paradigm of social identity which is really put into operation...|$|E

There is a difference!” Newman commented as well on charges that he “held in contempt” ethical guidelines of professional associations such as the APA: “We don’t look to the APA, CPA or any other institution for ethical standards, he replied. “We're critical (not contemptuous) of them for being hypocritical and think that depending on them for an ethical standard is ethically unsound.” ...|$|R
