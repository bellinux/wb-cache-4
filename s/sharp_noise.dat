It rivals in brilliancy, {{if it does not}} even very much surpass, the light from the discharge of voltaic electricity; but it endures for an instant only, and is attended by a <b>sharp</b> <b>noise</b> like that of a small explosion. Still no difficulty can arise in recognising it to be the same spark as that from the voltaic battery, especially under certain circumstances. The eye cannot distinguish the difference between a voltaic and a common electricity spark, if they be taken between amalgamated surfaces of metal, at intervals only, and through the same distance of air.|$|E

50|$|Thornback {{had passed}} her target once at 300 yd and came {{about for a}} second pass when the forward torpedo room {{reported}} <b>sharp</b> <b>noises</b> forward. Further amplification showed that the noise was caused by enemy machine gun bullets striking the submarine's hull. Resuming the attack, Thornback swung back into action, with visibility only 300 yd and lessening. Her 40 millimeter fire continued to maul the Japanese vessel, shooting away one of her masts and leaving her limping shoreward at only 3 kn. After securing from battle stations, Thornback passed through an oil slick and noted a mast from the heavily hit patrol craft.|$|R

50|$|Corner reflectors {{can also}} occur accidentally. Tower blocks with {{balconies}} are often accidental corner reflectors for sound and return a distinctive echo to an observer making a <b>sharp</b> <b>noise,</b> {{such as a}} hand clap, nearby. Similarly, in radar interpretation, an object that has multiple reflections from smooth surfaces produces a radar return of greater magnitude than might be expected from the physical size of the object. This effect was put to use on the ADM-20 Quail, a small missile which had the same radar cross section as a B-52.|$|E
5000|$|A unitless measurement, {{characterizing the}} {{mechanical}} damping of the driver, that is, the {{losses in the}} suspension (surround and spider.) It varies roughly between 0.5 and 10, with a typical value around 3. High Qms indicates lower mechanical losses, and low Qms indicates higher losses. The main effect of Qms is on the impedance of the driver, with high Qms drivers displaying a higher impedance peak. One predictor for low Qms is a metallic voice coil former. These act as eddy-current brakes and increase damping, reducing Qms. They must be designed with an electrical break in the cylinder (so no conducting loop). Some speaker manufacturers have placed shorted turns {{at the top and}} bottom of the voice coil to prevent it leaving the gap, but the <b>sharp</b> <b>noise</b> created by this device when the driver is overdriven is alarming and was perceived as a problem by owners. High Qms drivers are often built with nonconductive formers made from paper or various plastics.|$|E

60|$|In {{the dusk}} of that evening Jude {{walked away from}} his old aunt's as if to go home. But {{as soon as he}} reached the open down he struck out upon it till he came to a large round pond.

50|$|Canines often fear, {{and exhibit}} stress {{responses}} to, loud noises. Noise-related anxieties in dogs may {{be triggered by}} fireworks, thunderstorms, gunshots, and even loud or <b>sharp</b> bird <b>noises.</b> Associated stimuli may also come to trigger the symptoms of the phobia or anxiety, such as a change in barometric pressure being associated with a thunderstorm, thus causing an anticipatory anxiety.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} also freely {{available}} online at: [URL] paper {{presents the results}} of the theoretical calculations of sound radiation from tunnel portals by air shock waves generated by high-speed trains travelling in underground tunnels. This phenomenon, also known as 'tunnel boom', is associated with very loud and <b>sharp</b> <b>noise,</b> similar to that of cannon shots. This noise may be very disturbing for local residents and wildlife. A simple analytical model has been developed to calculate the generated sound. The model takes into account the ground effect outside the tunnel and uses Rayleigh integral to calculate the sound pressure. The model can predict the acoustic frequency spectra and the waveforms generated at arbitrary distances and directions outside the exit tunnel portal. Numerical results have been produced for several selected tunnels in the UK located along the planned high speed railway route HS 2 and identified as being capable of generating tunnel boom. Potential implications of these results are discussed, as well as possible mitigation measures...|$|E
40|$|The {{consonant}} {{perception of}} 15 subjects with {{mild to moderate}} sensorineural hearing loss was evaluated using linear amplification and {{two different types of}} compression amplification. A specially modified hearing aid was used which allowed for variation of the amplifier input/output function in three steps, such that the compression ratio could be set to 1 (linear), 1. 3 or 1. 8. The Nonsense Syllable Test (NST) was recorded through the aid in quiet and in two different noise conditions (four-talker babble and a background noise with sharp intermittent sounds), and replayed to the listeners through headphones. No differences in consonant perception were found between the different types of amplification in the quiet condition. In the babble condition, consonant perception was significantly better with linear amplification than with either form of compression. In the <b>sharp</b> <b>noise</b> condition, {{there was no difference in}} performance between linear amplification and compression amplification with the ratio of 1. 8. Consonant perception was adversely affected, however, by the compression amplification with the ratio of 1. 3 in this condition. Overall NST results and results for particular classes of consonants are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model of neural group interactions, which are {{projections}} from one neural network (network B) of McCulloch-Pitts neurons connected via a Hebbian rule, to another network (network A) of the same structure. We first consider the {{case in which the}} projecting network B is in a pattern different from the initial attracting state of network A. A critical projecting strength lambda c is found such that for lambda below this value there exists a noise threshold sigma lambda corresponding to each lambda. For the case where lambda less than lambda c and the noise level sigma less than sigma lambda, there are two possible retrievals, with different probabilities: the initial attracting state of network A and the projecting pattern. If lambda less than lambda c and sigma greater than sigma lambda, stable states of network A disappear. In the case lambda greater than lambda c, network A is pulled out of its initial basin of attraction and into that of the projecting pattern. This analysis provides a model for distraction. Second-order interactions reduce the distraction. When the projecting network B is in the same pattern as the initial attracting state of network A, the projection acts as an external reinforcement, which enables network A to retrieve in highly noisy conditions. <b>Sharp</b> <b>noise</b> thresholds for nonzero retrievals are shown to be eliminated by the projection. Higher-order connectivity improves the retrieval ability of the network. The second case serves as {{a model of}} concentration. We discuss the model of distraction and concentration (i) in connection with common experience of expectation of recognition and (ii) in connection with recent T-maze experiments on infant rats; finally, we suggest a refined version of the Bruner-Potter experiment to test our prediction of the disappearance of hysteresis...|$|E

5000|$|Members of {{the group}} Scholars for 9/11 Truth have {{collected}} eyewitness accounts of flashes and loud explosions immediately before the fall. Eyewitnesses have repeatedly reported of explosions happening before {{the collapse of the}} WTC towers, and the organization [...] "International Center for 9/11 Studies" [...] has published videos obtained from NIST, together with indications about when such explosions could be heard. There are many types of loud <b>sharp</b> <b>noises</b> that are not caused by explosives, and seismographic records of the collapse do not show evidence of explosions. Jones and others have argued that horizontal puffs of smoke seen during the collapse of the towers would indicate that the towers had been brought down by controlled explosions. NIST attributes these puffs to air pressure, created by the decreasing volume of the falling building above, traveling down elevator shafts and exiting from the open elevator shaft doors on lower levels).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} three recent anomalous results {{associated with}} irreversibility in type-II superconductivity: (1) The magnetic {{properties of the}} predicted superconductors LiBeH 3 and Li 2 BeH 4, (2) the paramagnetic transition near T = Tc in Nb, and (3) a noise transition in a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ thin film near the vortex-solid transition. The investigation of Li 2 BeH 4 and LiBeH 3 was prompted by theoretical predictions of room-temperature superconductivity for Li 2 BeH 4 and LiBeH 3 and a recent report that Li 2 BeH 4 showed magnetic irreversibilities {{similar to those of}} type-II superconductors. A modified experimental method is introduced in order to avoid artifacts due to background signals. The resulting data is suggestive of a superparamagnetic impurity from one of the reagents used in the synthesis and after subtracting this contribution, the temperature-dependent susceptibilities of Li 2 BeH 4 and LiBeH 3 are estimated. However, no magnetic irreversibility suggestive of superconductivity is observed. The anomalous paramagnetic transition in Nb is intriguing because Nb does not share the d-wave order parameter symmetry often invoked to explain the phenomenon in other superconductors. A modified experimental method was developed in order to avoid instrumental artifacts known to produce a similar apparently paramagnetic response, but the results of this method indicate that the paramagnetic response is a physical property of the sample. Finally, a very <b>sharp</b> <b>noise</b> transition in a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ thin film was found to be distinct from previously reported features in the voltage noise commonly associated with vortex fluctuations near the irreversibility line. In each of these three cases the examination of experimental techniques {{is an integral part of}} the investigation of novel vortex behavior near the onset of irreversibility. ...|$|E
