40|$|Most {{scholars}} and development experts assume that <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> {{developing countries are}} isolated, although some posit that {{they are part of}} a global scientific community. This paper seeks to determine the size of professional networks for <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> LDCs as well as the distribution of their ties across organizational contexts and locations. Professional contact networks of <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> Africa and Asia were determined in personal interviews with 293 researchers in universities, government laboratories, and non-governmental organisations. Contrary to expectations, researchers in the least developed countries do not have the smallest networks. Results indicate that (1) international and domestic networks are inversely related, (2) education abroad increases contact with the developed world for <b>scientists</b> <b>in</b> state institutes and NGOs but not for academics, and (3) there are reduced returns to education for researchers in th...|$|R

5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and <b>scientist</b> <b>in</b> Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E

Whilst at Lucrecia's {{research}} lab, Vincent is ambushed by Rosso the Crimson, who steals the Protomateria but is prevented from killing Vincent by the arrival of Yuffie. As they return to the WRO headquarters, they find that Deepground has launched an assault on the base. However, Deepground member Shelke the Transparent has been captured by the WRO, and reveals that she is synaptically interconnected to Lucrecia's memories, thus allowing the WRO to complete Lucrecia's research on Omega. Shelke's sister, Shalua Rui, a high ranking <b>scientist</b> <b>in</b> the WRO, soon discovers that Omega is a WEAPON, which activates when the Planet senses that it is in mortal danger (like the WEAPONs it activated in the original Final Fantasy VII). Omega's function is to absorb the Lifestream from the Planet and then move to another planet, leaving the inhabitants behind to die. Deepground plans to slaughter a huge number of people at once so as to 'trick' the planet into activating Omega prematurely.|$|E
