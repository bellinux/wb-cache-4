Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups.

Soon after, Maxine's site is merged with a larger company that uses Susan's image to advertise the website on billboards across the country.

25|$|In {{order to}} put a {{priority}} on their schoolwork, ClariS have not released photos of themselves {{to the public and}} employ illustrators to draw their likenesses. When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pastel pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, and the sun is used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly wavy hair and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with straight hair with bangs. To further preserve their anonymity, Clara and Alice have not told anyone they know (aside from their families) that they debuted as music artists. Both admit that they are otaku, and have taken an interest in anime and anime music. Clara says that <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> otaku interests a secret from others at school, and Alice has called herself a Disney otaku.|$|E
25|$|In Tekken 7, Nina now {{wears an}} off-white long strapless wedding gown {{and the length}} of the right skirt of her wedding gown was long up to her leg and also has shreds at the edge of her skirt and the front of her skirt is covered in dirt and burns and its {{interior}} is dirty white. It also has a white single frill design on her waist to keep it attached within her gown.

25|$|In {{the first}} book, after seeing Harry fly masterfully {{his very first}} time on a broom, she {{recommends}} him to fill the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and sends him a broom, even though first-year students are normally prohibited from playing the sport or owning brooms. Despite {{the fact that she}} can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her dropping her usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration classroom to practice for tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. She promises Harry she would do everything in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an auror, and <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> promise. Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a range of emotions, which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.|$|E

As Hannah, <b>she</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> fans unaware {{that she is}} really a normal kid, and as Miley, <b>she</b> must <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> friends unaware that she is really Hannah Montana. In interviews, Miley Cyrus spoke of the implausibility {{of being able to}} keep a secret such as Miley and her family do in the show in a world of intense media scrutiny. The show however, remains workable primarily based on suspension of disbelief.|$|R

500|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse is a [...] "most terribly tidy little mouse always {{sweeping}} and dusting {{the soft}} sandy floors" [...] in the [...] "yards and yards" [...] of passages and storerooms, nut-cellars, and seed-cellars in her [...] "funny house" [...] amongst {{the roots of}} a hedge. She has a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, a larder, and a bedroom where <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> dust-pan and brush next to her little box bed. She tries to keep her house tidy, but insect intruders leave dirty footprints on the floors {{and all sorts of}} messes about the place.|$|E
500|$|... "The Roof" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by contemporary}} music critics for its choice of vocal work, instrumentation and lyrics. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song {{as well as}} Carey's choice of vocals, writing [...] "Carey is still a vocal grandstander capable of turning all into a six-syllable word. Yet {{for most of the}} album <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> notorious octave-climbing chops at bay. Showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into the downy-soft beats of 'The Roof'." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant wrote [...] "Little more than yearning, kissing, and remembering happens during the course of 'The Roof,' a rough-enough R revision of Mobb Deep's 'The Shook Ones.' But lyrically Mariah the writer is vivid, sometimes shockingly clever (rhyming 'liberated' with 'Moet' is a stroke of genius)." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakdown" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} local critics. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song, writing [...] "for {{most of the}} album <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> notorious octave-climbing chops at bay. Showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into downy-soft beats. In 'Breakdown', she demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant called [...] "Breakdown" [...] "the song of Carey's career," [...] noting its [...] "lyrical strokes [...] as broad and obvious as they are naked. Mariah the chanter flawlessly adapts to their singsong style, largely boxing her multi-octave range into a sly, hypnotic melody so that when she really wails at the end, you really feel it. As with 'The Roof', Carey lunges toward musical maturity by embracing, not shunning hip-hop. This is the height of her elegance and maybe hip-hop-soul's, too." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{three main}} playable {{characters}} of Final Fantasy X-2 are Yuna, Rikku and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as [...] "YRP" [...] ("YuRiPa" [...] {{in the original}} Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from Final Fantasy X, and, though their personalities are {{much the same as}} before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Final Fantasy Xs world as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in Final Fantasy X-2, to accommodate the game's intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Her personality is far more cynical and emotionally distant than that of her teammates, and <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> past a secret from them for much of the game.|$|E
500|$|As Elizabeth aged {{her image}} {{gradually}} changed. She was portrayed as Belphoebe or Astraea, {{and after the}} Armada, as Gloriana, the eternally youthful Faerie Queene of Edmund Spenser's poem. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by smallpox in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss {{to such an extent}} that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, reported an audience with the queen, during which he noticed, [...] "her teeth are very yellow and unequal... and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." [...] Yet he added, [...] "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal." [...] Sir Walter Raleigh called her [...] "a lady whom time had surprised". However, the more Elizabeth's beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it.|$|E

Svarocisa grows up to become a very learned scholar of the Vedas and learns to speak the languages of all creatures from one of his three wives. He later marries a goddess and fathers Svarocisa Manu, one of the progenitors of mankind. (See Progeny) ...|$|E

Having lost her mother and being unaware how advanced her cancer was, Zosia feels unequipped {{to deal with his}} prognosis and does not support him enough. Arthur's condition deteriorates and Zosia begins to unravel and it effects her work. The actress explained that Zosia is left fearing Arthur's illness will trigger a bipolar episode. She worries that if she fully acknowledges her best friend's condition then [...] "she'll spiral out of control." [...] Ostlere said that his character's death would create an interesting story for Zosia.|$|E
2500|$|Anna is sexy, sultry and curvy, wearing stylish outfits in matches. Before the fight, {{we see her}} flirting and teasing the enemy, {{and then}} to ridicule meeting ended with a coarse laugh and provocative moves; for her {{attitude}} and way of clothing {{can be considered as}} a [...] flapper [...] as well as a [...] femme fatale [...] character. Usually, she's shown wearing a modified silk qipao/cheongsam with floral pantyhose along with matching gloves and shoes, often high heels, and <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> hair well-coiffed and cut to the neckline. She is also seen a few times wearing a zebra printed jumpsuit with a matching zebra printed hat, a necklace, black gloves, and black heels. She is often among the few characters who are given a third outfit option, as opposed to the standard two. In Death by Degrees, Anna is wearing a more Nina-style high-tech combat outfit and has a different haircut. Her look was revamped once more for Tekken Tag Tournament 2. She is 18 in the first Tekken, 20 in Tekken 2, and 41 in Tekken 6; although she is in her 40s, cryosleep effects preserved her physical abilities of her 20s.|$|E
2500|$|In any event, no {{surviving}} portraits dated between 1596 and Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1603 show the aging queen as she truly was. [...] Faithful {{resemblance to the}} original is only {{to be found in}} contemporaries’ accounts as in the report written in 1597 by André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, after an audience with the sixty-five year-old queen, during which he noticed, [...] "her teeth are very yellow and unequal [...] and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." [...] Yet he added, [...] "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be <b>she</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>her</b> dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal." [...] All subsequent images rely on a face pattern devised by Nicholas Hilliard sometime in the 1590s called by art historians the [...] "Mask of Youth", portraying Elizabeth as ever-young. [...] Some 16 miniatures by Hilliard and his studio are known based on this face pattern, with different combinations of costume and jewels likely painted from life, and it was also adopted by (or enforced on) other artists associated with the Court.|$|E
