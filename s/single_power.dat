5|$|Turan-Shah {{drove out}} the Hamdanid rulers of Sana'a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With {{the conquest of}} Yemen, the Ayyubids {{developed}} a coastal fleet, al-asakir al-bahriyya, which they used to guard the sea coasts under their control and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) under a <b>single</b> <b>power.</b> However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen.|$|E
25|$|All set-ups {{mentioned}} {{can work}} either on a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> plant {{or a combination}} of power plants (in which case it is called a hybrid power system).|$|E
25|$|Shinkansen uses a 25kV AC {{overhead}} power supply (20 kV AC on Mini-shinkansen lines), {{to overcome the}} limitations of the 1,500 V direct current used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under <b>single</b> <b>power</b> cars. The power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60Hz.|$|E
50|$|The French word Autorail {{describes}} a <b>single</b> <b>powered</b> railcar {{capable of carrying}} passengers. While the concept faded for a while, it has been introduced with a new range of vehicles for both standard and metre gauge lines.|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} railcars had a <b>single</b> <b>powered</b> axle (1A-A1 wheel arrangement). Those built in 1930 used a 12V generator, but all {{subsequent}} ones used 24V, after Sentetsu opted to standardise with the L3-type 24V, 900W axle-mounted generator.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{drawings}} of the Anonymous of the Hussite Wars shows a boat {{with a pair of}} paddle-wheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks (see above). The concept was much improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> source by one connecting-rod, an idea also taken up by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio.|$|E
25|$|Foreigners were cordially welcomed at {{the court}} of Narai (1657–1688), a ruler with a {{cosmopolitan}} outlook who was nonetheless wary of outside influence. Important commercial ties were forged with Japan. Dutch and English trading companies were allowed to establish factories, and Thai diplomatic missions were sent to Paris and The Hague. By maintaining all these ties, the Thai court skilfully played off the Dutch against the English and the French, avoiding the excessive influence of a <b>single</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hydro-Québec {{immediately}} mobilized all crews, including retirees, {{and asked}} for the assistance of utility crews from Eastern Canada and the northeastern US. The Canadian Army was also involved in the restoration of power. More than 10,000 workers had to rebuild {{a significant portion of}} the network one pylon at a time. At the height of the crisis, on January 9, 1998, the island of Montreal was fed by a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> line. The situation was so dire the Quebec government temporarily resorted to rolling blackouts in downtown Montreal in order to maintain the city's drinking water supply.|$|E

50|$|In the Whyte notation, a 6-2-0 is a {{railroad}} steam locomotive {{that has an}} unpowered three-axle leading truck followed by a <b>single</b> <b>powered</b> driving axle. This wheel arrangement {{is associated with the}} Crampton locomotive type, and in the USA the single class were sometimes referred to as Cramptons.|$|R
25|$|The TBM 900 model {{features}} several ergonomic improvements within the cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation. A new <b>single</b> <b>power</b> lever integrates the power, propeller and condition lever controls. Various switches and controls, such as some formerly present upon the overhead panel, have been eliminated. The electrical system {{is powered by}} a single main generator, which is supplemented by a belt-driven alternator. On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic landing field elevation inputs to the pressurization controller.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> piston {{arranged}} {{within the}} same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a <b>single</b> <b>power.</b> The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E

500|$|The {{replacement}} of Greece by the Roman empire as {{the administrator of}} the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the East {{and the elimination of}} the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of the south. According to Milo Kearney (2003) [...] "The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the Gulf of Aden. In response, the Romans destroyed Aden and favored the Western Abyssinian coast of the Red Sea." [...] Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a <b>single</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
500|$|The 735kV {{power line}} {{is said to}} lessen the {{environmental}} impact of power lines, as one <b>single</b> <b>power</b> line operating at this voltage carries the same amount of electric power as four 315kV power lines, which would require a right-of-way wider than the [...] width required for a single 735kV line. Each 735kV line is capable of transmitting 2,000MW of electric power at a distance of over [...] and the entire 735kV grid can carry 25,000MW of power. Power transmission losses over the 735kV grid range from 4.5 to 8%, varying due to temperature and operating situations. The Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec named the 735kV power line system as the technological innovation of the 20th century for Quebec.|$|E
500|$|Hovering {{over all}} of these was the {{possibility}} that the-then five dreadnoughts of the South American dreadnought race could be put up for sale. Two, from Brazil, were already completed, and a third was under construction in Britain. Another two, for Argentina, were being built in the United States. Naval historian Paul G. Halpern wrote of this situation that [...] "the sudden acquisition by a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> of all or even some of these ships might {{have been enough to}} tip a delicate balance of power such as that which prevailed in the Mediterranean." [...] Both the Greeks and Ottomans were reportedly interested in the Argentine ships, and Venizelos attempted to buy one of the s then being built in the United States for the Argentine Navy as an alternative to redesigning Salamis, in the process delaying her completion.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, a hegemon's superior position is considered the logical consequence of superior geography, technological innovation, ideology, superior resources, and other factors.|$|R

500|$|The band {{worked by}} setting up all the {{instruments}} with only a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> amplifier. McFall {{has pointed out that}} distorted and heavily compressed mics were used to capture some of the room's ambience [...] "to add a bit of grit" [...] to the instrumental tracks; the recordings were often processed further using distressors, special types of compressor noted for their distinctively aggressive sound. The production staff tried other unconventional effects once the basic tracks were recorded. The band sometimes performed while Tong's kit was re-amped and played sections live while a brick was placed on the sustain pedal of a piano to capture the vibrations during the performances. During the six weeks at Grouse Lodge, Bloc Party tried multiple versions of songs and, at times, attempted playing live alongside recorded versions of the same track.|$|E
500|$|The {{world of}} Mass Effect 2 is a galaxy map that the player can explore {{to find and}} {{complete}} quests. Most quests consist of combat missions, but some involve the player interacting with local characters during visits to settlements. As the player progresses throughout the game, different locations and new squad members become available. Experience points are gained by completing quests. Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the player [...] "levels up" [...] and is awarded Squad Points {{that can be used}} to develop powers for both Shepard and the members of the squad. Powers provide enhanced combat capabilities, with each power having four ranks that can be unlocked. Each rank costs the same number of Squad Points as its rank. For example, unlocking the first rank of a power requires one point, but unlocking all four ranks of a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> requires a total of ten points. Upon raising a power to its fourth rank, the player must evolve the power into one of two given forms.|$|E
500|$|The storm's worst impacts were {{concentrated}} in the coastal Bangladeshi districts of Bagerhat, Barguna, Bhola, Jessore, Khulna, Patuakhali and Satkhira, {{as well as the}} Sundarbans. A 2m (6.6ft) storm surge inflicted significant damage along the Bangladeshi coast and forced the temporary closure of the Port of Mongla, where nine were killed. Off the coast, waves generated by the tropical cyclone reached 4.5m (15ft). Twenty vessels and barges and hundreds of small fishing boats sank {{as a result of the}} rough seas and storm surge generated by the storm. [...] Another 37vessels carrying ₤2million (US$3.7million) of goods ran aground. Approximately 200km (120mi) offshore, the Singaporean freighter Pumori capsized due to the cyclone, killing 19. Initially reported as a much lower figure, 5,708fatalities occurred as a result of the tropical cyclone. Despite the high death toll, the Bangladeshi government stated that human casualties were minimized by efficient early warning systems. However, other deaths were blamed on poor communication systems, which did not effectively relay information to residents in more rural areas. Many of the deaths were caused by the collapse of dwellings or by electrocution due to the collapse of high tension power poles, and most of the deaths occurred in Khulna District. Nine people were killed in Khulna after a <b>single</b> <b>power</b> pole collapsed onto a house. A hundred corpses were discovered on the island of Dublar Char alone. In Satkhira, 100people were killed due to flying debris kicked up by the storm's fierce winds. In addition to the fatalities, nearly three million people were left homeless.|$|E
