25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E
60|$|She rose suddenly, {{squarely}} confronting him, desperate now, {{driven to}} play the only card upon which <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> count.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{everything}} was upset {{and there was}} no peace and quietness anywhere now, she said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just as well be at Monte Carlo as anywhere else. And she went.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{acknowledged}} his greeting while <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> rapidly. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> just as {{well see}} him and have that inevitable interview done with.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet?"--said his wife, {{encouraging}} him to proceed. If {{she could}} only learn the real truth, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> perhaps yet save him, with assistance from their friends.|$|R
60|$|Maggie felt a {{great relief}} in {{adjourning}} the decision. She was free now {{to enjoy the}} minutes of companionship; <b>she</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> linger a little; {{the next time they}} met she should have to pain Philip by telling him her determination.|$|R
60|$|When Miss Hacket {{turned back}} to her with the {{acceptance}} of the invitation, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> wait just to help Miss Hacket to put in the corn and the sop. Meantime Miss Constance talked to Dolores.|$|E
60|$|Near by--so near, in fact, that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> almost {{reach out}} {{her arm and}} touch it--was Sugar-Loaf Mountain, round and high and big. And {{a little to the}} south was Backbone Mountain, and still farther along a peak called Crystal Mountain.|$|E
6000|$|Clementina was {{so happy}} that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> trust him for once, and she said, [...] "Oh, yes, Mr. Mahtin! Who do you suppose sent them?" [...] she entreated him so sweetly {{that it would have}} {{softened}} any heart but the heart of a tease.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Leave that to me, Ruby. May I {{bring him}} if I can?' Then Ruby {{in a very}} low whisper told Mrs Hurtle, that if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> proper <b>she</b> <b>might</b> bring John Crumb back again. 'And there shall be no more nonsense?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Brinsmade," [...] she cried, [...] "mother is dying. You {{have done}} so much for us, sir,--couldn't you come to her for a little while? <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see you once more, she would die happy." [...] The voice was choked by a sob.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> {{indeed that}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> perhaps borrow money, but there again her paralyzing honesty made her recoil from the {{prospect}} of uncertain repayment. And besides, from whom could she borrow?...|$|R
60|$|So Alice {{picked him}} up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away: but, before she {{put him on the}} table, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.|$|E
60|$|My {{mother did}} not suffer her {{authority}} to pass from her without a shadow of protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing certain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approbation, my mother suddenly began to cry, and said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been consulted.|$|E
60|$|Caroline abstained {{from looking}} at the book herself, partly because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> only alarm herself the more without confuting Bobus, and partly because {{she knew that the}} old law which forbade Janet to meddle with the medical books, would be {{considered}} as abrogated if she touched them herself.|$|E
60|$|Miss Thorne sighed {{but said}} nothing further. She left the toxophilites to their bows and arrows and {{returned}} towards the house. But as she passed by {{the entrance to the}} small park, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> at any rate encourage the yeomen by her presence, as she could not induce her more fashionable guests to mix with them in their manly amusements. Accordingly she once more betook herself to the quintain post.|$|R
60|$|She {{was just}} as {{determined}} when the morrow came, and went early, that nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be ashamed of {{the appearance of the}} penitence, so justly and truly hers. Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{of things}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> buy, and the jolly feeling of putting them about and making fine effects with them. One thing she told Daphne, she had clearly {{resolved}} upon; the house should be always full and brimming over with beautiful flowers. [...] "I've always wished {{mother would have}} more flowers--and not keep them so long when she has them...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary, I do {{hope you}} love Mr. Graham {{with all your}} heart and all your strength." [...] She {{would have thought it}} wicked to say more; but so far <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> go, {{considering}} the sacred tie which was to exist between her pupil and the gentleman in question.|$|E
60|$|Ida hesitated. If Clare {{were not}} the girl <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> by {{appealing}} to her compassion, supply her with a reason for giving Dick up, but if this happened, {{it would be to}} his advantage in the end. Still she did not think she was mistaken and she must take the risk.|$|E
6000|$|... "She hasn't {{a friend}} in the world," [...] Jos went on, not undexterously, [...] "and she said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> trust in you. She's so miserable, Emmy. She has been almost mad with grief. Her story quite {{affected}} me--'pon my word and honour, it did--never was such a cruel persecution borne so angelically, I may say. Her family has been most cruel to her." ...|$|E
60|$|Corny now {{went up on}} {{the upper}} deck, because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see {{alligators}} farther ahead if she got up higher. In five minutes, she had her hat taken off by a branch of a tree, which swept upon her, as she was leaning over the rail. She called to the pilot to stop the boat and go back for her hat, but the captain, who {{was up in the}} pilot-house, stuck out his head and said he reckoned she'd have to wait until they came back. The hat would hang there for a day or two. Corny made no answer to this, but disappeared into the saloon.|$|R
60|$|The wide heavens {{about her}} seemed to promise a greater freedom from doubt and questioning. Baynes had {{urged her to}} tell him that she loved him. A dozen times <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{honestly}} give him the answer that he demanded. Korak fast was becoming but a memory. That he was dead she had come to believe, since otherwise he would have sought her out. She did not know that he had even better reason to believe her dead, and that it was because of that belief he had made no effort to find her after his raid upon the village of Kovudoo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you are young, and weak, and foolish. Because it {{is right}} that they who are frail, and timid, and spiritless, should be made subject {{to those who are}} strong and able to hold {{dominion}} and to exact obedience." [...] Linda did not at all like being told that <b>she</b> was spiritless. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be able to show spirit enough {{were it not for the}} duty that she owed to her aunt. And as for obedience, though she were willing to obey her aunt, she felt that her aunt had no right to transfer her privilege in that respect to another. But she said nothing, and her aunt went on with her proposition.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy much {{wished to}} be with them; and after a long {{brooding}} over her ill-temper, it began to wear out, not to be conquered, but to depart of itself; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well learn her lesson and have done with it; so by way {{of getting rid of}} the task, not of profiting by the warning it conveyed, she hurried through the two verses ending with--"Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!" ...|$|E
60|$|If Miss Gardner {{had been}} alone, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have got on better; but the quieter elder sister hardly {{put in a}} word, so unceasing was {{the talk of the}} younger; whose {{patronage}} became oppressive, when she began on Mrs. Martindale herself; told her she was lazy, taking too much care, and growing nervous: and even declared she should come some day, take her by storm, and carry her out for a drive in the park.|$|E
60|$|There {{was indeed}} a pang as she thought of Gilbert; but she {{believed}} that Genevieve's heart had never been really touched, and was still fresh and open. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> make Mr. Kendal and Sophy equally magnanimous. Perhaps by that time Sophy would be too happy to have leisure to be hurt, and she had little fear but that Mr. Kendal's good sense would conquer his jealousy for his son, though it might cost him something.|$|E
60|$|But, though Mrs. Davis {{prepared}} {{herself for}} conversation, {{she did not}} immediately commence it. Having something special to say, <b>she</b> probably <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> improve her opportunity of saying it by allowing Charley to begin. She got up and pottered about the room, went to a cupboard, and wiped a couple of glasses, and then out into the bar and arranged the jugs and pots. This done, {{she returned to the}} little room, and again sat herself down in her chair.|$|R
60|$|At first <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> {{would not}} answer the letter at all. What was it to her? Let them fight their own lovers' battles out after their own childish fashion. If the man meant at last to be honest, {{there could be no}} doubt, Mrs Hurtle thought, that the girl would go to him. It would require no {{interference}} of hers. But after a while <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well see this English chit who had superseded herself in the affections of the Englishman she had condescended to love. And if it were the case that all revenge was to be abandoned, that no punishment was to be exacted in return for all the injury that had been done, why should she not say a kind word so as to smooth away the existing difficulties? Wild cat as she was, kindness was more congenial to her nature than cruelty. So she wrote to Hetta making an appointment.|$|R
60|$|It {{probably}} {{never occurred to}} Georgey that Mr Brehgert would under any circumstances be anxious to go back from his engagement. She so fully recognised her own value as a Christian lady of high birth and position giving herself to a commercial Jew, that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that under any circumstances Mr Brehgert would be only too anxious to stick to his bargain. Nor had she any idea that there was anything in her letter which could probably offend him. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> at any rate make good her claim {{to the house in}} London; and that as there were other difficulties on his side, he would yield to her on this point. But as yet she hardly knew Mr Brehgert. He did not lose a day in sending to her a second letter. He took her letter with him to his office in the city, and there he answered it without a moment's delay.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} attain {{a visit to}} Wrapworth till the Sunday. The {{carriage}} went in state to the parish church in the morning, and the music and preaching furnished subjects for persiflage at luncheon, to her great discomfort, and the horror of Owen; and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> venture to Wrapworth in the afternoon. She had a longing for Owen's church, 'for auld lang syne'--no more. Even his bark church in the backwoods could not have rivalled Hiltonbury and the brass.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the Sacramento Pet who {{did all the}} dancin'; Polly only LENT the goat. Ye see, the Pet kinder took a shine to Billy arter he bowled Starbottle over thet day at the hotel, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{teach him}} tricks. So she DID, doing all her teachin' and stage-rehearsin' up there at the pass, so's to be outer sight, and keep this thing dark. She bribed Polly to lend her the goat and keep her secret, and Polly never let on a word to anybody but me." ...|$|E
60|$|Lancaster {{came out}} and dropped fifteen cents into Olive's hand. He could not help {{regarding}} with interest the occupants of the carriage, and Mrs. Easterfield looked hard at him. Suddenly Olive turned in her seat; {{she looked at the}} house, she looked at the garden, she looked at the little piazza {{by the side of the}} tollhouse. Yes, it was really the same place. For an instant <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been mistaken, but there was her window with the Virginia creeper under the sill where she had trained it herself. Then she made a motion to her companion, who immediately drove on.|$|E
60|$|It would rejoice {{her heart}} to {{transfer}} this money to Miss Barbara; but {{how in the world}} could she do it? <b>She</b> first <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> offer to buy something that was in the Thorpedyke house, but she knew this idea was absurd. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of mentioning, in an off-hand way, that she would like to put some money out at interest, and thus, perhaps, induce Miss Barbara to propose a business transaction. But this would not do. Even Miss Barbara would suspect some concealed motive. Idea after idea came to her, but she could think of no satisfactory plan of getting that money into Miss Barbara's possession.|$|R
60|$|We had a {{long walk}} before us the next day, and it was our desire, therefore, to get up early, even so early as six o'clock, if that could be managed without {{disturbing}} the whole household. We put it to our hostess whether <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> this could be done. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it could. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> not be about herself at that time; it was her morning for going into the town, some eight miles off, and she rarely got back much before seven; but, possibly, her husband {{or one of the}} boys would be returning home to lunch about that hour. Anyhow, somebody should be sent back to wake us and get our breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|She never omitted her walks after that, {{and always}} {{paused a moment}} as the path turned away to the Memorial. It was not that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> meet him there,--there rather than elsewhere,--but there is present to us often an idea that when some object has passed from us that we have desired then it may be seen again. Day after day, and week after week, {{she did not see}} him. During this time there came letters from Ayala, saying that their return to England was {{postponed}} till the first week in February,--that she would certainly see Lucy in February,--that {{she was not going to}} be hurried through London in half-an-hour because her aunt wished it; and that she would do as she pleased as to visiting her sister. Then there was a word or two about Tom,--"Oh, Tom--that idiot Tom!" [...] And another word or two about Augusta. [...] "Augusta is worse than ever. We have not spoken to each other for the last day or two." [...] This came but a day or two before the intended return of the Tringles.|$|R
