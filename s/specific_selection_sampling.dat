40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{implementation}} of the Environmental Noise Directive 2002 / 49 /EC a study on noise measurement uncertainty was performed. Averaging over different samples of noise measurements, there might be assumptions over the distribution and independency of the samples. In {{the context of}} environmental noise, this might be the case of a series of measurements of a constant noise source like an industrial plant or a fluctuating noise source like road traffic. Using a series of 15 minutes LAeq samples, the average of these values is usually considered as the expected mean, however, the error caused by the <b>specific</b> <b>selection</b> of the <b>samples</b> is not usually evaluated. Statistically speaking, before establishing an average value, at least the distribution of the samples and the effect of adding-up several uncertainties should be evaluated. This article focuses on the mathematical formulas which could be used and discusses the differences in assessing the expected mean for normally distributed values, or for log-normally distributed, and finally suggests an approach to properly adding-up all uncertainties related to a long-term environmental noise measurement campaign.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the change in mandibular position during a two-phase orthodontic treatment of skeletal Class II malocclusion. Thirty consecutively treated Chinese male adolescents who had undergone two-phase treatment with Herbst appliance and fixed appliance and fulfilled the <b>specific</b> <b>selection</b> criteria were <b>sampled.</b> Cephalograms taken at T 0 (before treatment), T 1 (at the end of functional appliance treatment), and T 2 (at the end of fixed appliance treatment) were analyzed. The change in sagittal positioning of the mandible was 6. 8 ± 3. 44 [*]mm in phase I (T 0 -T 1), 0. 4 ± 2. 79 [*]mm in phase II (T 1 -T 2), and 7. 2 ± 4. 61 [*]mm in total. The mandible came forward in 100 % of the patients at T 1. In phase II, it came forward in one-third (positive group) remained unchanged in one-third (stable group) and went backward in one-third (negative group) of the patients. At T 2, it came forward twice as much in the positive group compared to the negative group. Mandibular length was significantly increased in 100 % of the patients in both phases. In conclusion, during the treatment with functional appliance, the mandibular prognathism increases in all patients, whereas during the treatment with fixed appliance there is no significant change in mandibular prognathism...|$|R

40|$|Starting with {{an outline}} {{of the way in}} which Swiss Stock Exchange Law treats «the group», this paper {{analyzes}} the announcement effects of major shareholdings in the Swiss stock market as reported by the SIX Swiss Exchange database in the time period from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. This includes a total of 3, 617 announcements. By applying <b>specific</b> <b>selection</b> criteria, a <b>sample</b> of 218 announcements was collected for use in the empirical analysis, covering 61 individual investors and 32 groups of investors acting in concert. We test the hypothesis that the disclosure notifications of major shareholders have a significant impact on equity pricing for the validity of its proposition. In particular, we test whether information related to groups acting in concert is priced differently from information related to individual investors. We analyze the (cumulative) abnormal returns occurring around official announcements to investigate these issues. Our empirical results reveal that the announcement effects of group-related disclosures are statistically and economically significant; the significance of the results strongly increases after January 2009, when the SIX Swiss Exchange launched a new electronic publication platform, thereby enabling a more immediate release of information. In the preceding sample period, the price effects are scattered over the days prior to the announcement date, which makes it difficult to identify the effects. With the introduction of the new publication platform, the pre-announcement effects virtually disappear. Also, the difference between the stock price reactions between announcements related to single individuals and to groups is striking in the post- 2009 sample. We, furthermore, find rather heterogeneous price patterns within both the «purchase» and the «sale» announcement categories. For example, the price effects of the «sale» sample are largely dominated by the valuation effects caused by the breakup (dissolutions) of controlling groups...|$|R

30|$|Our {{results show}} that FIB {{preparation}} of small particles {{can be used to}} specifically cross-section selected surface regions of interest. The composition of the olivine and the generally very Ni-rich metal assemblages indicate an LL-type origin also for particle RA-QD 02 - 0115. Unlike the effects seen in particle RB-QD 04 - 0042, we found no compelling microstructural evidence for recent shock mechanical modifications via small-scale impacts. Radiation damage by energetic ions of the solar wind occurs on one side of particle RA-QD 02 - 0115 and can be observed in olivine, troilite, and weakly in merrillite. Cl-bearing apatite and metal have not sustained detectable damage. The unusual polycrystalline nature of the olivine rim, containing nanometer-sized domains tilted by a few degrees, may be explained by annealing effects at asteroidal surface temperatures larger than expected and observed at the current orbital parameters of Itokawa. We acknowledge {{that it would be a}} rather long shot to ascribe the apparently unusual surface state of RA-QD 02 - 0115 to be connected to a dynamical evolution of its parent asteroid, in particular, because we would expect more particles in the Hayabusa collection to show signs of annealing. After all, RA-QD 02 - 0115 may show the normal, early stages of radiation damage, which we just do not know well enough. However, RA-QD 02 - 0115 may have resided at an unusually hot and statistically rare location and there might be other particles that may show more pronounced effects of thermal annealing. The possibility of a former orbit closer to the Sun appears not to be too unrealistic and the thermal consequences of such a scenario appear worthwhile to be investigated in more detail, in particular with respect to the retention of implanted noble gases by correlating space weathering effects with gas contents of the same grains. Contrary to the moon, space weathering on near-Earth asteroids may be strongly linked to the dynamical evolution of their orbits. <b>Specific</b> <b>selection</b> of future <b>sampling</b> sites may provide clues of the orbital and thermal histories of these asteroids and their surfaces.|$|R
