50|$|An {{unconditional}} <b>surrender</b> is a <b>surrender</b> {{in which}} no guarantees are given to the <b>surrendering</b> party. In modern times, unconditional <b>surrenders</b> most often include guarantees provided by international law. Announcing that only unconditional <b>surrender</b> is acceptable puts psychological pressure on a weaker adversary, but may also prolong hostilities. Perhaps the most notable unconditional <b>surrender</b> was by the Axis powers in World War II.|$|R

By 20 September, when the JNA launched a campaign against the ZNG throughout Croatia, more than 60 JNA facilities in Croatiaincluding 15 barracks and 11 storage depotshad <b>surrendered</b> or were captured. The JNA barracks in Našice <b>surrendered</b> on 21 September. The JNA Varaždin Corps <b>surrendered</b> the next day, providing the ZNG with a major caché of weapons.

50|$|Like {{traditional}} annuities, indexed annuities have <b>surrender</b> charges. These charges {{vary from}} 20% down to 1% and policies can have <b>surrender</b> charge periods ranging from 1 - 16 years. 10-13 {{years is the}} most common length of a <b>surrender</b> charge period on indexed annuities.

5|$|Platt's advance into Eritrea was checked {{during the}} seven-week Battle of Keren (February–April 1941), during which No.237 Squadron {{observed}} Italian positions and {{took part in}} bombing raids. After the Italians retreated and <b>surrendered,</b> the Rhodesian squadron moved forward to Asmara on 6 April, whence it embarked on bombing sorties on the port of Massawa. The same day, the Italian garrison in the Abyssinian capital Addis Ababa <b>surrendered</b> to the 11th (East Africa) Division, including many Rhodesians. The forces of Platt and Cunningham converged and surrounded {{the remainder of the}} Italian forces, commanded by the Italian viceroy the Duke of Aosta, at the mountain stronghold of Amba Alagi. The viceroy <b>surrendered</b> on 18 May 1941, effectively ending the war in East Africa. No.237 Squadron and the Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery thereupon moved up to Egypt to join the war in the Western Desert. Some Italian garrisons continued to fight—the last <b>surrendered</b> only following the Battle of Gondar in November 1941. Until this time the partly Rhodesian-commanded Nigeria and Gold Coast Regiments remained in Abyssinia, patrolling and rounding up scattered Italian units. Around 250 officers and 1,000 other ranks from Southern Rhodesia remained in Kenya until mid-1943.|$|E

50|$|<b>Surrender,</b> in {{military}} terms, is the relinquishment {{of control over}} territory, combatants, fortifications, ships or armament to another power. A <b>surrender</b> may be accomplished peacefully, without fighting, {{or it may be}} the result of defeat in battle. A sovereign state may <b>surrender</b> following defeat in a war, usually by signing a peace treaty or capitulation agreement. A battlefield <b>surrender,</b> either by individuals or when ordered by officers, normally results in those <b>surrendering</b> becoming prisoners of war.|$|R

40|$|A tontine {{provides}} a mortality driven, age-increasing payout structure through the pooling of mortality. Because a tontine does not entail any guarantees, the payout {{structure of a}} tontine {{is determined by the}} pooling of individual characteristics of tontinists. Therefore, the <b>surrender</b> decision of single tontinists directly affects the remaining members' payouts. Nevertheless, the opportunity to <b>surrender</b> is crucial to the success of a tontine from a regulatory as well as a policyholder perspective. Therefore, this paper derives the fair <b>surrender</b> value of a tontine, first on the basis of expected values, and then incorporates the increasing payout volatility to determine an equitable <b>surrender</b> value. Results show that the <b>surrender</b> decision requires a discount on the fair <b>surrender</b> value as security for the remaining members. The discount intensifies in decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion. However, tontinists are less willing to <b>surrender</b> for decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion, creating a natural protection against tontine runs stemming from short-term liquidity shocks. Furthermore we argue that a <b>surrender</b> decision based on private information requires a discount on the fair <b>surrender</b> value as well...|$|R

Helgoland and her sisters were stricken from the German navy on 5November 1919. Helgoland was formally handed over to the United Kingdom on 5August 1920. She was scrapped at Morecambe; work began on 3March 1921. Helgolands coat of arms is currently preserved in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E

50|$|The {{value of}} the {{investment}} is often subject to a <b>surrender</b> charge in determining the cash value.

Any cancellation after that time frame are not subject to a <b>surrender</b> charge. Typically <b>surrender</b> charges decrease on an annual schedule until they disappear altogether.|$|R

50|$|A {{white flag}} or {{handkerchief}} is often taken or {{intended as a}} signal {{of a desire to}} <b>surrender,</b> but in international law, it simply represents a desire for a parley {{that may or may not}} result in a formal <b>surrender.</b> Normally, a <b>surrender</b> will involve the handing over of weapons; the commanding officer of a <b>surrendering</b> force symbolically offers his sword to the victorious commander. Individual combatants can indicate a <b>surrender</b> by discarding weapons and raising their hands empty and open above their heads; a <b>surrendering</b> tank commander should point the tank's turret away from opposing combatants. Flags and ensigns are hauled down or furled, and ships' colors are struck.|$|R
