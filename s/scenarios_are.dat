5|$|In Rewrite Harvest festa!, {{there are}} six {{separate}} scenarios, one for each heroine. The player is initially given the choice to play the scenarios for Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia from a character selection screen. Once these three <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> completed, the routes for Sizuru and Akane become available, and after those two are completed, Kagari's scenario is made available. After the completion of Kagari's scenario, a dungeon exploration role-playing minigame called Rewrite Quest becomes available.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
30|$|The general <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> used to {{test the}} {{robustness}} of the developments in the micro-futures (‘The maritime economic functions in the four general scenarios’). The general <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> presented during the expert meeting and the stakeholder meetings that were organised in the project. Their use during these meetings was not evaluated explicitly. The authors’ tentative conclusion is that, for policy makers, the incorporation of uncertainty (as represented by the general <b>scenarios)</b> <b>is</b> more difficult than the incorporation of ambition (as represented by the micro-futures). As a consequence, the impact of the general <b>scenarios</b> <b>is</b> not as visible as that of the micro-futures.|$|R

5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS). The player {{takes the}} role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth, or the invading Orcs. In the single player campaign mode the player works {{through a series of}} missions, the objective of which varies, but usually involves building a small town, harvesting resources, building an army and then leading it to victory. In multiplayer games, the objective is always to destroy the enemy players' forces. Some <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Both sides have melee units and ranged units, and also spellcasters.|$|E
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> available {{in what is}} called the School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
25|$|After Jughead's detonation, two <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> shown: one {{in which}} Oceanic 815 never crashes, and {{one in which}} the {{timeline}} hasn't been altered at all.|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} downscaling methodology {{was implemented}} to generate daily time series of temperature and rainfall for point locations within a catchment, {{based on the}} output from general circulation models. The rainfall <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> constructed by a two-stage process. First, for a single station, a conditional first-order Markov chain was used to generate wet and dry day successions. Then, the multisite <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> constructed by sampling from a benchmark file containing a daily time series of multiple-site observations, classified by season, circulation weather type, and whether the day is wet or dry at the reference station. The temperature <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> constructed using deterministic transfer functions initialized by free atmosphere variables. The relationship between the temperature and rainfall <b>scenarios</b> <b>is</b> established in two ways. First, sea level pressure fields define the circulation weather types underpinning the rainfall <b>scenarios</b> and <b>are</b> used to construct predictor variables in the temperature scenarios. Second, separate temperature transfer functions are developed for wet and dry days. The methods were evaluated in two Mediterranean catchments. The rainfall <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> always too dry, despite the application of Monte Carlo techniques {{in an attempt to}} overcome the problem. The temperature <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> generally too cool. The <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> used to explore the occurrence of extreme events, and the changes predicted in response to climate change, taking the example of temperature. The nonlinear relationship between changes in the mean and changes at the extremes was clearly demonstrated. 1...|$|R
30|$|Temperature {{is a key}} {{parameter}} influencing clock skews. Therefore, we analyse {{our proposal}} for indoor and outdoor scenarios.

25|$|Behat is {{intended}} to aid communication between developers, clients and other stakeholders during a software development process. It allows the clear documentation of testable examples of the software's intended behaviour. Behat test <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> written with Gherkin, a business-readable domain-specific language following defined patterns.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{it should}} be {{examined}} to what extent a wider harmonisation of the format in chapters 1 to 16 and of exposure <b>scenarios</b> <b>is</b> possible. (An exchange format for exposure <b>scenarios</b> <b>is</b> already being developed). Furthermore, translations of standardised contents are necessary.|$|R
30|$|The two {{dimensions}} {{used to build}} these <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> technological supply (measured through the Delphi study output) and technological demand (measured through the patterns of network use).

25|$|Plausible <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> easy to construct. Morton, {{measuring}} by seed, {{picks up}} a threateningly large black skull, fills it lightly and gives it a few desultory shakes. Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum with his thumb. It is easily done, without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{acquisition}} goal, which contains among others the systems and services requirements and descriptions, scenarios can be formed for the deliveries of the information services to be acquired. Multiple scenarios may be built, which will then be evaluated and used {{in the design of the}} acquisition strategy. The <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> built with the priorities and interdependence of the deliverables in mind.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{breakdown}} {{route is}} that the field strength becomes large enough to pull electrons in the dielectric from their atoms thus causing conduction. Other <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> possible, such as impurities in the dielectric, and, if the dielectric is of a crystalline nature, imperfections in the crystal structure can result in an avalanche breakdown as seen in semi-conductor devices. Breakdown voltage is also affected by pressure, humidity and temperature.|$|E

25|$|These beyond-regular-insurance {{costs for}} {{worst-case}} <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> {{not unique to}} nuclear power, as hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the Banqiao Dam disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large dam failures in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.|$|E

The definition of these steps exist within method annotations of a class that extends the BehatContext.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} {{contained within the}} Acquisition Goal is used to produce the acquisition plan. The acquisition plan is the master plan of the entire acquisition. In this plan delivery <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> determined and the situation and risks evaluated. And upon {{the basis of the}} scenario’s, situation and risks, a strategy is formed to manage the acquisition, its situation and risks. Furthermore, the acquisition plan will hold the main decision points, in which decisions are made about the deliverables within the acquisition and the acquisition organization (similar to a project organization) is formed.|$|E
30|$|Selected {{components}} of a <b>scenario</b> <b>are</b> thus referenced using comparable competencies, {{based on the same}} domain ontologies and competency model.

30|$|In {{a report}} looking at {{scenarios}} for the Swedish energy {{system in the}} mid-term (2035) and longer term (2050), four explorative <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> developed with varied given importance to climate, environmental and resource preservation or energy security for the industry [37]. For each <b>scenario,</b> an assessment <b>was</b> made against the national environmental goals [70, 71]. The impact of different <b>scenarios</b> <b>was</b> expressed in risk for an increasing negative impact or opportunity for an increasing positive impact on a goal. The results were presented in text form. In the same study, the <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> also roughly assessed against the EU 2030 climate goals, various national goals addressing climate issues and the Paris Climate agreement [72], considering how far or close the different <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> to these goals. Finally the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [73] were mentioned and for each <b>scenario,</b> one SDG <b>was</b> singled out as being particularly facilitated by the specific drivers behind each scenario.|$|R

The total estimated tuition cost for a Michigan resident who is living off campus is roughly $17,384. Living on campus brings the cost to about $22,000. If the same <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> applied to non-Michigan residents (out of state), the tuition significantly increases. For a non-resident student living on campus, the cost is approximately $33,000.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scenarios</b> <b>are</b> used {{in order}} to {{estimate}} climate changes effects on crop development and yield.

For example, many models are running simulations based on doubled carbon dioxide projections, temperatures raise ranging from 1°C up to 5°C, and with rainfall levels an increase or decrease of 20%. Other parameters may include humidity, wind, and solar activity. Scenarios of crop models are testing farm-level adaptation, such as sowing date shift, climate adapted species (vernalisation need, heat and cold resistance), irrigation and fertilizer adaptation, resistance to disease. Most developed models are about wheat, maize, rice and soybean.|$|E
