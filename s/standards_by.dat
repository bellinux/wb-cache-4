5|$|Jazz {{standards}} are musical compositions that are widely known, performed and recorded by jazz artists {{as part of}} the genre's musical repertoire. This list includes compositions written in the 1930s that are considered <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> at least one major fake book publication or reference work. Some of the tunes listed were already well known <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> the 1940s, while others were popularized later. Where appropriate, the years when the most influential recordings of a song were made are indicated in the list.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{had been}} served for 30 {{years by the}} Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total {{capacity}} of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope {{to be a team}} selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{inherited}} a vast fortune and a prosperous economy {{from his father}} Henry VII, who had been frugal and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to £1,250,000 (£375million by today's <b>standards).</b> <b>By</b> comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.|$|E

5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> which life should be lived.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> either not making contact with the people they were {{publishing}} derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union had 26 major ports, {{eleven of}} them inland ports. There were 70 ports in total. None of the ports could be {{considered}} major by world <b>standards.</b> <b>By</b> the 1980s the majority of Soviet ports were lagging behind the First World technologically. There were also {{a high number of}} surplus workers, many of whom would become redundant if the USSR would introduce new, more advanced, technology. Also, in the northeast territories of the USSR most ports were closed down due to cold climate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of {{structural}} engineering and technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building <b>Standards)</b> <b>by</b> Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E

5|$|It is most {{convenient}} {{to compare the}} various local weight <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5g) around the typical value of 30g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25g to 31g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31g and the Habsburg ounce of 35g. The latter {{is the product of}} an 18th-century weight reform.|$|E
5|$|The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an {{international}} financial institution that offers investment, advisory, and asset-management services to encourage private-sector development in developing countries. The IFC {{is a member of}} the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. It was established in 1956, as the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, to advance economic development by investing in for-profit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development. The IFC's stated aim is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and achieve better living <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> mobilizing financial resources for private enterprise, promoting accessible and competitive markets, supporting businesses and other private-sector entities, and creating jobs and delivering necessary services to those who are poverty stricken or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E

5|$|A belt route around Salt Lake City {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1955, with the Utah Highway Department (the predecessor to the present-day Utah Department of Transportation) holding hearings concerning construction beginning in early 1958. The southeast quadrant {{of the route}} was originally placed from a junction at proposed I-15 in Murray northeasterly through Murray and Holladay, eventually reaching the east bench at 3900 South. From there, it would have run north toward the mouth of Parley's Canyon at proposed I-80 (at the time US-40). Almost immediately, this plan was met with opposition among local residents in the area. The proposed route would have bisected the primarily residential Holladay suburb, {{as well as the}} southern portion of Murray. After more than two years of hearings and widespread opposition from residents, the Highway Department released their proposed routing in June 1960, which placed the southeast quadrant where it runs today. While quelling criticism from some, others remained in opposition, saying the route was still too intrusive along residential areas. The western quadrant was also admonished for being placed to close to other major arterials. In November 1963, a small, two-lane portion of the northwest quadrant of the belt route opened from Redwood Road (SR-68) in Davis County west and south to 2100 North, north of the Salt Lake City International Airport. This portion of road was extended east to I-15 in North Salt Lake and upgraded to freeway <b>standards</b> <b>by</b> 1969.|$|E
