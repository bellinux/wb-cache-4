The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she <b>sings</b> the chorus. Normani shares the chorus, as she <b>sings</b> on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively lays down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>singing</b> synthesis system, VocaLis-tener, that automatically estimates parameters for <b>singing</b> synthesis from a user’s <b>singing</b> voice {{with the help}} of song lyrics. Although there is a method to estimate <b>singing</b> syn-thesis parameters of pitch (F 0) and dynamics (power) from a <b>singing</b> voice, it does not adapt to different <b>singing</b> synthe-sis conditions (e. g., different <b>singing</b> synthesis systems and their singer databases) or <b>singing</b> skill/style modifications. To deal with different conditions, VocaListener repeatedly updates <b>singing</b> synthesis parameters so that the synthe-sized <b>singing</b> can more closely mimic the user’s <b>singing.</b> Moreover, VocaListener has functions to help modify the user’s <b>singing</b> by correcting off-pitch phrases or changing vibrato. In an experimental evaluation under two different <b>singing</b> synthesis conditions, our system achieved synthe-sized <b>singing</b> that closely mimicked the user’s <b>singing.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus <b>sings</b> of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again <b>sings</b> in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne <b>sings</b> her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
