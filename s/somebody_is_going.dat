500|$|A {{recurring}} {{source of}} lyrical subject matter in Let the Blind Lead is Cox's best friend, Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, whom {{the album is}} dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering if <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes to go to sleep and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frazier won the MVP {{award for}} his 34-18 victory in the East-West Shrine Game, nationally {{televised}} on ESPN on January 13, 1996. West Coach Terry Donahue {{said there was no}} doubt that Frazier's performance had improved his standing in regards to the NFL draft. [...] "I think he came here with all kinds of doubts...this game really helped him and <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to invest in him. I am really high on him. [...] When I did the Fiesta Bowl, I said the guy was the most dangerous player in college football and I mean it more now. This guy's dangerous. He's great." [...] Frazier completed 11 of 20 passes for 163 yards, rushed six times for 33 yards, scored on a five-yard run, and threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Jordan with 5:57 left in the contest.|$|E
2500|$|Following the release, doubts were {{expressed}} whether Megrahi was as ill as claimed by MacAskill {{in his statement}} to the Scottish Parliament. The guidance on compassionate release of a terminally ill prisoner under Scottish law specifies that death must be likely to occur [...] "soon"; there is no fixed time limit but a life expectancy of three months is suggested as [...] "appropriate". The Labour MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife and a Minister in the previous Labour administration, Dr. Richard Simpson, accused the Scottish justice minister of failing to conduct sufficient checks before deciding to release Megrahi. Dr. Simpson, {{a former member of}} the British Association of Urological Surgeons' prostate cancer working group who specialised in prostate disease research, expressed doubt that Megrahi would die within the next three months and claimed that he could live for eight months, going on to say that, [...] "Kenny MacAskill released him apparently on the advice of just one doctor whose status is not clear and who is not named." [...] He added that a second specialist opinion in palliative care should have been sought before the release. A source close to the justice secretary called Simpson's comments [...] "tasteless" [...] and added: [...] "I really don't think we should be speculating on the day <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to die." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I rode in to Seeping Springs yesterday," [...] said Hare, eying the foreman. [...] "There {{was a new}} pond, fenced in. Our cattle couldn't drink. There {{were a lot of}} trimmed logs. <b>Somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to build}} a cabin. I burned the corrals and logs--and I trailed fresh tracks from Seeping Springs to this ranch." ...|$|R
2500|$|McDavid was {{selected}} first overall by the Erie Otters at the Priority Selection. As the first overall selection, McDavid {{was awarded the}} Jack Ferguson Award. Throughout his inaugural season, McDavid would play on a line with Connor Brown. Starting in his second game of the season, McDavid recorded a point in 15 consecutive games, and was named the OHL Rookie of the Month for both October and November. During {{a game against the}} Owen Sound Attack on March 9, 2013, McDavid recorded two assists, giving him 37 for the season and setting a new team record for assists by a rookie. He also tied Tim Connolly for most points by a first-year player, with 62. In the team's final game of the season, March 16 against the Guelph Storm, McDavid recorded four assists, giving him 66 total points during the season and passing Connolly for the most points by an Otters rookie. McDavid finished the season with the most assists by an OHL rookie with 41 and second in scoring for first-year players, with 66 points. In recognition of his play, McDavid was awarded the Emms Family Award as the top rookie in the OHL, was a finalist for CHL Rookie of the Year, and was named to the OHL First All-Rookie Team. Dallas Stars's general manager Jim Nill said of McDavid, [...] "Well, he's a franchise player. <b>Somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to draft him and he's going to be the cornerstone of the franchise for 15 years, for 20 years. Those players only come along so often." ...|$|E

2500|$|And, I {{know the}} sense of {{helplessness}} that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself, because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon.

6000|$|... "Talk about hard food," [...] {{interrupted}} the other, [...] "I guess I {{know all about}} that. Many's the time I've breakfasted off a little cold porridge that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to throw away from a back-door, or that I've gone round to a livery stable and begged a little bran mash that they intended for the pigs.

There's the Bishop of Broomsgrove;--he's always sauntering about the place, looking as though he'd be so much obliged if {{somebody}} would give him something to do. He's always smiling, and so gracious,--just as if he didn't feel above half sure that he had any right to be where he is, and he thought that perhaps <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to kick him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{would walk}} up and down fences and sell the fence posts. I would sell {{mailboxes}} and trees as we rode by. Sometimes my daddy would threaten me wit a beating to get me to stop 'that bunch of noise' I was making. But I wouldn’t stop. I’d just get out of earshot and keep going. Sometimes when I’d get into bed at night, I’d put my head under the cover and hum a chant. Nothing in my life, before or since, captivated me any more than an auctioneer’s chant. I knew one day <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to hire me to sell produce for them." ...|$|R

5000|$|Dontre D. Hamilton (d. April 30, 2014), of Milwaukee, was 31 {{years old}} at the time of his death. Hamilton had a history of mental illness. In 2013, he had made a suicide attempt by {{stabbing}} both sides of his neck and had been hospitalized. According to Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, Hamilton had a prior history of arrests in Milwaukee which were [...] "directly connected to mental health issues." [...] Hamilton's family stated that Hamilton had been treated for schizophrenia but was not violent. In the days before his death, Hamilton told his family that he was [...] "tired and hungry, and that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to kill him." ...|$|R
5000|$|McBride {{commented on}} the song to CMT Insider {{when she was on}} set filming the song's music video. [...] "I just heard it, and {{immediately}} I thought, 'What a beautiful love song.' I mean, doesn't everybody wish that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to sing this about them? And the song is a little bit different for me. It's a little bit vulnerable ... basically saying, 'I can't believe I have you, and everybody else thinks you're amazing, but you're all mine.' I love the fact that it's a little bit different. It's something that songs have said forever -- 'I love you' -- but it's said in a little bit different way, and I thought that was really cool." ...|$|R
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder, later-disbarred American {{attorney}} Jack Thompson, who has campaigned against violence in video games, {{claimed that he}} had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them {{that the nature of}} the game could inspire copycat killings; [...] "I wrote warning them that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is not an isolated incident. These types of games are basically murder simulators. There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis". Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £50 million in a wrongful death claim.|$|R
6000|$|The roof gardens put {{on so many}} extra waiters {{that you}} could hope to get your gin fizz now--as soon as {{all the other people}} got theirs. The {{hospitals}} were putting in extra cots for bystanders. For when little, woolly dogs loll their tongues out and say [...] "woof, woof!" [...] at the fleas that bite 'em, and nervous old black bombazine ladies screech [...] "Mad dog!" [...] and policemen begin to shoot, <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to get hurt. The man from Pompton, N.J., who always wears an overcoat in July, had turned up in a Broadway hotel drinking hot Scotches and enjoying his annual ray from the calcium. Philanthropists were petitioning the Legislature to pass a bill requiring builders to make tenement fire-escapes more commodious, so that families might die all together of the heat instead of one or two at a time. So many men were telling you about the number of baths they took each day that you wondered how they got along after the real lessee of the apartment came back to town and thanked 'em for taking such good care of it. The young man who called loudly for cold beef and beer in the restaurant, protesting that roast pullet and Burgundy was really too heavy for such weather, blushed when he met your eye, for you had heard him all winter calling, in modest tones, for the same ascetic viands. Soup, pocketbooks, shirt waists, actors and baseball excuses grew thinner. Yes, it was summertime.|$|E
60|$|As {{the dogs}} of shy neighbourhoods usually betray a slinking {{consciousness}} {{of being in}} poor circumstances--for the most part manifested in an aspect of anxiety, an awkwardness in their play, and a misgiving that <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to harness them to something, {{to pick up a}} living--so the cats of shy neighbourhoods exhibit a strong tendency to relapse into barbarism. Not only are they made selfishly ferocious by ruminating on the surplus population around them, and on the densely crowded state of all the avenues to cat's meat; not only is there a moral and politico- economical haggardness in them, traceable to these reflections; but they evince a physical deterioration. Their linen is not clean, and is wretchedly got up; their black turns rusty, like old mourning; they wear very indifferent fur; and take to the shabbiest cotton velvet, instead of silk velvet. I am on terms of recognition with several small streets of cats, about the Obelisk in Saint George's Fields, and also in the vicinity of Clerkenwell- green, and also in the back settlements of Drury-lane. In appearance, they are very like the women among whom they live. They seem to turn out of their unwholesome beds into the street, without any preparation. They leave their young families to stagger about the gutters, unassisted, while they frouzily quarrel and swear and scratch and spit, at street corners. In particular, I remark that when they are about to increase their families (an event of frequent recurrence) the resemblance is strongly expressed in a certain dusty dowdiness, down-at-heel self-neglect, and general giving up of things. I cannot honestly report that I have ever seen a feline matron of this class washing her face when in an interesting condition.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{before the}} Bill became law, {{questions}} arose about proposals to exclude Ulster from the Act. At the Bill's third reading on 21 May several members {{asked about a}} proposal to exclude the whole of Ulster for six years; it seemed remarkable, as the proposal was being made as a new amending Bill in the House of Lords, where the government had less support. Liberal and Irish government supporters were instantly critical of any effort to water down the existing Bill. Lord Hugh Cecil, a Conservative MP, was also mystified, saying:"Let them bring in their amending Bill under the Standing Orders before next Tuesday. It is perfectly manifest that <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be tricked. There is no genuine honest reason for making a secret of this kind. My hope {{is that it is}} the Nationalist party {{who are going to be}} tricked. It may be them, or it may be us, but that <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be tricked is perfectly plain.." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had nearly}} done breakfast, when {{the sound of}} a carriage, (almost the first they had heard since {{entering}} Lyme) drew half the party to the window.

5000|$|Many had {{predicted}} that the duo was destined for success beyond the typical folk music circles. Jim Olsen, president of Carters record label, Signature Sounds, said, [...] "I always believed it would only take one cover by a major star to unveil his work {{to the rest of}} the world; and I was convinced that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. <b>Somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to open the door for them; and the thing about Daves music is that once people heard it, they became lifelong fans." [...] Fellow folksinger and journalist Matt Watroba wrote, [...] "It would make sense at this point, to say that Dave Carter was on the verge of something big. The truth, however, is that Dave was something big already. He moved the people lucky enough to know him or his music in a way that has launched an outpouring of tributes, memories and love." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the Los Angeles Convention Kennedy, now the nominee, asked Cox {{to move to}} Washington to have an {{expanded}} role, hiring speechwriters and coordinating academic talent. Cox accepted, and then Kennedy point blank asked Cox if {{he thought he could}} get along with Ted Sorensen and explained [...] "Sorensen's fear that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to elbow his way in between him and Kennedy." [...] Cox assumed he could. Cox had been unaware that Sorensen had already been at work, back in February, trying to compartmentalize and minimize Cox's group's efforts. Sorenen told Joseph Loftus of the Times that the Cambridge group was [...] "something 'much more talked about than fact.'" [...] Cox would soon discover, however, that Sorensen always [...] "was terribly worried about being cut out" [...] and protected Kennedy from independent advice including Cox's.|$|R

5000|$|In April 2012, Marvel debuted the six-issue tie-in series AVX: VS {{which focused}} solely on fight scenes. Each issue {{featured}} two stories by two creative teams. Marvel's executive editor Tom Brevoort described AVX: VS as [...] "the fight book". Brevoort said, [...] "It's the least essential read of AvX {{and yet it}} will probably be the best-selling. From the first page, <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to punch somebody else and by the last page, somebody else is punching somebody else in the face".|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{decided that}} the next time I got myself {{involved}} in a movie that had a huge amount of attention already that I would use Twitter. As a way of connecting with fans, principally. And also as a way of clearing up misunderstandings so that people know. You know, they may hear that an actor is cast or hear <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be in it, but until I say it's so, that's the confirmation". —Bryan Singer explaining the Twitter presence of the film.|$|E
5000|$|The opening pre-credits {{sequence}} was {{the first}} to be shot, and was filmed on a closed-off portion of the carpool ramp of the Los Angeles highway, connecting the 105 freeway to the 110, leading to Downtown Los Angeles. It was filmed in a span of two days, and required over 100 dancers. For this particular scene, Chazelle wanted to give a sense of how vast the city is. The scene was originally planned for a stretch of ground-level highway, until Chazelle decided to shoot it in the 105-110 interchange, which arcs 100 ft in the air. Production designer David Wasco said, [...] "I thought <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to fall off and get killed." [...] Not every portion of the highway was blocked. Chazelle compared the scene to the yellow brick road leading to the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz (1939).|$|R

6000|$|Early {{next morning}} {{there was an}} exodus {{from the village of}} the better element among the visitors. [...] "No fun hangin' round hyar," [...] one of them {{expressed}} it, and as good-naturedly as they had come they rode away. Six or seven of the desperado class remained behind, bent on mischief; and they were reinforced by more arrivals from Stonebridge. They avoided the camp by the spring, and when Shefford and Lake attempted to go to them they gave them a wide berth. This caused Joe to assert that they were up to some dirty work. All morning they lounged around under the cedars, keeping out of sight, and evidently the reinforcement from Stonebridge had brought liquor. When they gathered together at their camp, half drunk, all noisy, some wanting to swagger off into the village and others trying to hold them back, Joe Lake said, grimly, that <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get shot. Indeed, Shefford saw that there was every likelihood of bloodshed.|$|R
