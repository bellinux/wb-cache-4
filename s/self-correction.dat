25|$|According to Christina Romer, {{the money}} supply growth caused by huge {{international}} gold inflows was a crucial source of {{the recovery of the}} United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of <b>self-correction.</b> The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe. In their book, A Monetary History of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors, and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System. Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery. Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors, particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system, and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective.|$|E

Four major types of <b>self-corrections</b> were distinguished: morphological, syntactic, semantic and lexical.

40|$|Background and Objectives. A tight {{link between}} {{linguistic}} functions and activation of motor areas {{has been consistently}} reported, indicating that the 2 systems share functional neural resources. Few efforts {{have been made to}} explore whether this knowledge could aid the rehabilitation of aphasia. Methods. The authors assessed whether preactivation of the leg motor cortex during standing, compared with sitting, can facilitate language production in patients with chronic aphasia. In a cross-over within-subject design, the authors assessed performance on a picture naming task and controlled for effects on processing speed and simple verbal reaction time. Results. They found that standing compared with sitting had a beneficial effect on the number of semantic <b>self-corrections</b> that resulted in correct naming. In the absence of effects on motor or general processing speed, this points to a specific effect on lexical retrieval and selection. This was further corroborated by an error pattern analysis. Successful semantic <b>self-corrections</b> during standing were only found when there was already partial activation of the target semantic network—that is, when <b>self-corrections</b> were preceded by an incorrect but seman-tically associated naming response. Discussion. These findings show that preactivation of the motor system, which extends beyond the intrinsic link between manual gestures and language, can facilitate lexical access in chronic aphasia and may open new directions in aphasia rehabilitation...|$|R
2500|$|Apraxia {{of speech}} (AOS) is a neurogenic {{communication}} disorder affecting the motor programming system for speech production. Individuals with AOS demonstrate difficulty in speech production, specifically with sequencing and forming sounds. The Levelt model describes the speech production {{process in the}} following three consecutive stages: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation. According to the Levelt model, apraxia of speech would fall into the articulation region. The individual does not suffer from a language deficiency, but has difficulty {{in the production of}} language in an audible manner. Notably, this difficulty is limited to vocal speech, and does not affect sign-language production. The individual knows exactly what they want to say, but there is a disruption in {{the part of the brain}} that sends the signal to the muscle for the specific movement. [...] Individuals with acquired AOS demonstrate hallmark characteristics of articulation and prosody (rhythm, stress or intonation) errors. Coexisting characteristics may include groping and effortful speech production with <b>self-correction,</b> difficulty initiating speech, abnormal stress, intonation and rhythm errors, and inconsistency with articulation.|$|E
2500|$|Rousseau first proposed, in {{his second}} Discourse, that reason and {{political}} life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind. He asked what really {{can be said about}} what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, [...] "best suits his constitution"? Rousseau saw [...] "two principles prior to reason" [...] in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves. These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, [...] "Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational <b>self-correction,</b> most notably the political legislation of the Contrat Social and the moral education in [...] All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of metacognitive skills training (MST) and behavioural practice on error self-regulation during a naturalistic task after traumatic brain injury (TBI). A single-case study design was used and three participants (two males, one female) aged 26 - 43 years with severe TBI were included in the study. In the first study, after a four-session baseline of behavioural practice, two participants received eight MST sessions followed by four maintenance sessions. In the second study, a third participant received 16 sessions of behavioural practice to assess the extent to which error self-regulation improves through long-term task practice and therapist corrections. Participants prepared two different meals with a novel meal introduced later to examine skills generalisation. Behavioural outcomes included error frequency, checking and <b>self-corrections.</b> Data analysis involved a combination of visual analysis and two standard deviation (2 -SD) band analysis. In the MST study, the two participants demonstrated a 38 % and 76 % reduction in error frequency (p. 05), a significant decrease in checks (p. 05), and a significant increase in <b>self-corrections</b> (p. 05) relative to baseline. In the behavioural practice study, the participant demonstrated reduced errors (25 %), although this was not statistically significant, and a significant increase in checks (p. 05), but <b>self-corrections</b> did not significantly change (p. 05). This exploratory research suggests that, firstly, by targeting error self-regulation MST can potentially promote independence on complex everyday tasks; and secondly, although behavioural practice alone may facilitate some functional gains, it fails to promote more independent self-regulatory behaviours...|$|R

In the first previewing condition, the teacher discussed the target text with the children before {{they were required to}} read it orally. The same procedure was used in the other previewing condition but with the provision that an unrelated text was previewed. Oral reading errors decreased and <b>self-corrections</b> increased when the children previewed the target text with their teacher before reading it orally. No changes were observed as a result of implementing the other two procedures, previewing an unrelated text and no- previewing. The results, which were consistent across all four children, showed that reading proficiency can be increased by manipulating antecedent stimulus events prior to oral reading...|$|R

There was a decency of air that commanded more respect than it was then usual to yield to the nameless, a quietness of demeanor that denoted reflection and the habit of self-study and <b>self-correction,</b> together with a deference to others that was well adapted to gain friends. In the midst of the noisy, clamorous merriment of all around him, his restrained and rebuked manner had won upon the favor of the more privileged, who had unavoidably noticed the difference, and had prepared the way to a more frank communication between the party of the noble, and one who, if not their equal in the usual points of worldly distinction, was greatly superior to those among whom he had been accidentally cast by the chances of his journey. Not so with Maso; he, apparently, had little in common with the unobtruding and silent being that sat so near his path, in the short turns he was making to and fro across the pile of freight. The mariner was thirty, while the head of the unknown traveller was already beginning to be sprinkled with gray. The walk, attitudes, and gestures, of the former, were also those of a man confident of himself, a little addicted to be indifferent to others, and far more disposed to lead than to follow. These are qualities that it may be thought his present situation was scarcely suited to discover, but they had been made sufficiently apparent, by the cool, calculating looks he threw, from time to time, at the manoeuvres commanded by Baptiste, the expressive sneer with which he criticised his decisions, and a few biting remarks which had escaped him {{in the course of the}} day, and which had conveyed any thing but compliments to the nautical skill of the patron and his fresh-water followers. Still there were signs of better stuff in this suspicious-looking person than are usually seen about men, whose attire, pursuits and situation, are so indicative of the world's pressing hard upon their principles, as happened to be the fact with this poor and unknown seaman. Though ill clad, and wearing about him the general tokens of a vagrant life, and that loose connexion with society that is usually taken as sufficient evidence of one's demerits, his countenance occasionally denoted thought, and, during the day, his eye had frequently wandered towards the group of his more intelligent fellow-passengers, as if he found subjects of greater interest in their discourse, than in the rude pleasantries and practical jokes of those nearer his person.|$|E

40|$|Natural, {{spontaneous}} dialogue proceeds incrementally on a word-by-word basis; and {{it contains}} many sorts of disfluency such as mid-utterance/sentence hesitations, interruptions, and <b>self-corrections.</b> But training data for {{machine learning approaches}} to dialogue processing is often either cleaned-up or wholly synthetic {{in order to avoid}} such phenomena. The question then arises of how well systems trained on such clean data generalise to real spontaneous dialogue, or indeed whether they are trainable at all on naturally occurring dialogue data.

For the clinician {{it is interesting to}} be able to predict these physiological proceedings from an early point of development to evaluate treatment need for a patient, possible <b>self-corrections</b> and interference of treatment with ongoing physiological maturation. AIM OF THIS STUDY: To describe longitudinal changes in {{molar relation}} from the early mixed to the permanent dentition as a result of normal development and to study associations between the change in molar relation and different dental parameters with special focus on the space conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental casts of fifty orthodontically untreated children were evaluated longitudinally at the age 7, 11 and 13 years. A space analysis for each quadrant was performed and the molar relationship was registered at each stage. To evaluate the effect of space conditions and possible molar migration on the existing molar relationship the upper and lower molars were mentally transferred to a position in the dental arch, which is neutralizing the existing surplus or lack of space in each quadrant. The relation of the lower molar to the upper one in the new position is called “corrected occlusion”. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The mean molar occlusion has a tendency for developing a less distal relation during establishment of the permanent dentition. <b>Self-corrections</b> do occur, but not in a frequency warranting reduced importance of early initiating of orthodontic screening and treatment. When the cases were grouped according to variable «corrected occlusion», a rather good agreement between the early mixed and permanent dentition was demonstrated; indicating a certain stability of the molar relation after isolating the effect of the space conditions...|$|R
