5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow <b>skull</b> that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (<b>skull</b> openings) in its <b>skull,</b> two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned <b>skull</b> fragments with gunshot damage. These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the <b>skull</b> fragment, which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the <b>skull</b> was actually that of a woman and {{the examination of the}} sutures where the <b>skull</b> plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>skull,</b> {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part of the <b>skull)</b> and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of the <b>skull,</b> join) are straight and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline of the <b>skull</b> in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of the <b>skull</b> and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1909 that an Apatosaurus <b>skull</b> was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would {{become known as the}} Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The <b>skull</b> was found a short {{distance}} from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species Apatosaurus louisae, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The <b>skull</b> was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the <b>skull</b> of Diplodocus. Another smaller skeleton of A.louisae was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The <b>skull</b> was accepted as belonging to the Apatosaurus specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated <b>skull</b> and neck were found to confirm the association of the <b>skull</b> and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a Camarasaurus <b>skull</b> on the mount.|$|E
5|$|No Apatosaurus <b>skull</b> was {{mentioned}} in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. They found that {{though he never}} published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that Apatosaurus had a Diplodocus-like <b>skull.</b> According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to Diplodocus might instead be those of Apatosaurus. They reassigned multiple skulls to Apatosaurus based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, {{it was noted that}} Apatosaurus might have possessed a Camarasaurus-like <b>skull,</b> based on a disarticulated Camarasaurus-like tooth found at the precise site where an Apatosaurus specimen was found years before. On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true <b>skull</b> of Apatosaurus was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry <b>skull</b> that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to Brachiosaurus. In 2011 the first specimen of Apatosaurus where a <b>skull</b> was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, CMCVP7180, was found to differ in both <b>skull</b> and neck features from A.louisae, but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with A.ajax. Another well-preserved <b>skull</b> is Brigham Young University specimen 17096, a well-preserved <b>skull</b> and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} the <b>skull</b> bones, in {{the form}} of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the <b>skull</b> roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from the <b>skull.</b> Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the <b>skull.</b> These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of the <b>skull</b> roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E
5|$|Results of craniological {{analysis}} of 111 tiger <b>skulls</b> from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger <b>skulls</b> differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger <b>skulls,</b> whereas Bali tiger <b>skulls</b> {{are similar in}} size to Javan tiger <b>skulls.</b> The authors proposed to classify Sumatran and Javan tiger as distinct species, P. sumatrae and P. sondaica with Bali tiger as subspecies P. sondaica balica.|$|R

5|$|The holotype of S. angustirostris is a <b>skull</b> and postcrania, so the cranium of {{the species}} is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 {{publication}} with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the <b>skull</b> to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally {{from the back of}} the <b>skull</b> roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the nasal bone. The premaxilla bones make up almost 50% of the entire <b>skull</b> length, and both sides are filled with small holes. Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the <b>skull.</b> They make up the entire length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused.|$|E
5|$|The <b>skull</b> of Apatosaurus was {{confused}} {{with that of}} Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus until 1909, when the holotype of A. louisae was found, and a complete <b>skull</b> just a few meters away {{from the front of}} the neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of Apatosaurus with a Camarasaurus <b>skull</b> cast. Until 1970, Apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative <b>skull</b> casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to Diplodocus were more likely from Apatosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>skull</b> of the bowfin {{is made of}} {{two layers}} of <b>skull,</b> the dermatocranium and the chondrocranium. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The bowfin <b>skull</b> {{is made up of}} 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of 3 bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the vomer. The teeth are on two bones, the premaxillae and the maxillae. Another three bones make up the lower jaw the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the <b>skull</b> is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra scapular, the post temporal, and the opercular. The {{entirety}} of the <b>skull</b> is attached to the girdle through another set of bones.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{external}} opening of the tear duct (naso-lachrymal canal) of <b>skulls</b> of American colored males and white males indicate larger apertures among the former at corresponding ages. Duct length is somewhat shorter among colored males. In both racial samples the older <b>skulls</b> have slightly larger apertures than those under 40. A sample of white female <b>skulls</b> corroborates this, and manifests smaller average size than the white male <b>skulls</b> at ages below 50 whereas older <b>skulls</b> reveal no sex difference. The race difference in aperture size among male <b>skulls</b> is highly significant statistically and may reflect ecological adaptation...|$|R
5|$|When {{originally}} {{described by}} Brown, Prosaurolophus maximus was known from a <b>skull</b> and jaw. Half of the <b>skull</b> was badly weathered {{at the time}} of examination, and the level of the parietal was distortedly crushed upwards to the side. The different bones of the <b>skull</b> could be easily defined, {{with the exception of the}} parietals and nasal bones. Brown found that the <b>skull</b> of the already described genus Saurolophus is very similar overall to, but also smaller than the <b>skull</b> of P. maximus. A unique feature of a shortened frontal in lambeosaurines is also found in Prosaurolophus, and the other horned hadrosaurines Brachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Saurolophus. Although they lack a shorter frontal, the genera Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus share with saurolophins an elongated dentary.|$|E
5|$|While {{most other}} museums were using cast or sculpted Camarasaurus skulls on Apatosaurus mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a <b>skull</b> {{based on the}} lower jaw of a Camarasaurus, with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 {{illustration}} of the <b>skull.</b> The <b>skull</b> also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has shown}} that while in early life there is little {{difference}} {{between male and female}} <b>skulls,</b> in adulthood male <b>skulls</b> tend to be larger and more robust than female <b>skulls,</b> which are lighter and smaller, with a cranial capacity about 10 percent less than that of the male.

5|$|A {{total of}} 52 urns were {{excavated}} from {{the ruins of}} Jilotepeque Viejo; 8 of these were destroyed by the 1976 earthquake leaving 44 available for study. Twelve of these were {{in the collection of}} the Musée de l'Homme in Paris for approximately thirty years; These urns, together with all other artefacts from Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo), were repatriated to Guatemala in 1998. Each urn contained the cremated remains of a single adult. All of these appeared to be mature or elderly adults; the remains of young adults were notably absent, indicating that elite warriors were buried in some other manner. The urns themselves represented a variety of highland ceramic types. Analysis of bone fragments in the cremated remains indicates that the entire body was burnt without any special treatment for the <b>skull,</b> although the offering of a <b>skull</b> was excavated from Pyramid C1. Surviving <b>skull</b> fragments indicated the practice of artificial <b>skull</b> deformation among the elite inhabitants of the city. The remains of animal bones were found mixed among a significant portion of the contents of the urns; where identifiable these included deer bones and those of a number of bird species, particularly parrots and birds of prey.|$|E

5|$|An elephant's <b>skull</b> is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the <b>skull</b> is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The <b>skull</b> contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} <b>skull</b> while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the <b>skull</b> a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The <b>skull</b> shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} <b>skull</b> had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the <b>skull,</b> striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the <b>skull,</b> a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the <b>skull</b> and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the <b>skull</b> and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s <b>skull</b> indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E
