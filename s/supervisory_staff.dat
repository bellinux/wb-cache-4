25|$|Chapman J. Root, {{president}} of the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, turned the project over to members of his <b>supervisory</b> <b>staff,</b> including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and Earl R. Dean, bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design {{on one of the}} soda's two ingredients, the coca leaf or the kola nut, but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped cocoa pod in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of the CSM, eight {{categories}} of CARICOM nationals have been eligible for free movement throughout the CSME without the need for work permits. They are: University Graduates, Media Workers, Artistes, Musicians, Sportspersons, Managers, Technical and <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Staff</b> attached to a company and Self-Employed Persons/Service Providers. In addition the spouses and immediate dependent family members of these nationals will also be exempt from work permit requirements. At the July 2006 CARICOM Summit, it was agreed to allow for free movement of two more categories of skilled persons; tertiary-trained Teachers and Nurses. It was also agreed that higglers, artisans, domestic workers and hospitality workers are {{to be added to the}} categories of labour allowed free movement at a later date, pending the agreement of an appropriate certification. This envisioned extension for the latter categories of workers such as artisans was achieved in October 2007 with the launch of the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ). In 2009 Antigua and Barbuda was granted a five-year exemption to the extension of free movement to domestic workers, and in 2015 it was seeking the continuation of this exemption for a further 5 years.|$|E

2500|$|Increasingly, such {{public safety}} {{dispatch}} locations are becoming community {{owned and operated}} resources. [...] As such, {{they tend to be}} co-located with other emergency service resources, as in a headquarters-type complex. [...] Such environments must strike a 'balance' between the high-tech requirements of the work, including large numbers of computers, telephone lines, and radios, and the psychological needs of the human beings operating them. [...] The environment is frequently both high-performance and high-stress, and every measure must be taken to ensure as little [...] stress in the environment as possible. [...] Such issues are often the subject of careful design and also ergonomics. [...] Environmental colour choices, the reduction of ambient noise (and therefore stress) and the physical design of the seating and consoles used by the EMD are all intended to reduce stress levels. [...] <b>Supervisory</b> <b>staff</b> also typically monitor staff carefully, particularly in high-performance environments, ensuring that rest and meal breaks are taken, and occasionally providing a 'time out' after a particularly difficult call. [...] Despite all of these measures, occupational stress is a significant factor for many EMDs, and the 'burnout' rate for those in these positions tends to be higher than other occupations.|$|E

A member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, he ran as an NILP candidate for Ards Council around 1956 in opposition to the Ulster Unionist Party. He considered football a great unifier across community divides. Despite this, some accused him of being uncharitable as in 1973 when he attempted to cancel a friendly game between the then World Champions, Brazil, and an all-Ireland select team. The game went ahead, although under the banner of southern club Shamrock Rovers F.C. rather than the original [...] "Ireland XI", resulting in the permanent exclusion of Northern Ireland's captain, Derek Dougan from the team.

40|$|This article charts the {{evolution}} of clerical worker organization in the quayside offices of the Port of Liverpool. Although considerable academic research has been undertaken into Registered Dock Worker (RDW) trade unionism in the British dock industry, little emphasis {{has been placed on}} the dynamics of clerical staff organization despite these workers constituting a significant proportion of the dock labour force. What follows explores the growth of the Association of Clerical, Technical and <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Staffs</b> (ACTSS) 6 / 567 Branch in its developmental stage between 1964 and 1972 and the organizational difficulties it was initially faced with. The confrontational stance gradually adopted by the Branch and its stewards is placed {{in the context of the}} threat of redundancy and erosion of manning levels arising from the extensive rationalization and modernization of the British and local dock industry more broadly. Furthermore, their relationship with management and RDW colleagues is central to a proper analysis of the complexities of labour relations at the Port of Liverpool during this period. The attitudes and activism of clerical workers at the port is compared and contrasted with established theories of white-collar unionism throughout the article...|$|R
