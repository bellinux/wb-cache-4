40|$|An {{investigation}} on vibration and acoustic noise on brushless motors for {{fan or blower}} applications is presented, particularly concentrating on the vibration due to electromagnetic origin within the brushless electronically commutated <b>motors.</b> The flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> is introduced as a relatively new class of reluctance machine, which retains the benefits of switched reluctance machines, but with simpler and cheaper power electronic converters. The novel work of this thesis is the introduction of two 8 / 4 flux <b>switching</b> <b>motors</b> with permanent magnets of internal rotor and external rotor configuration respectively, which are presented as alternatives for the brushless DC motor, and called the permanent magnet flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor.</b> The two new permanent magnet flux <b>switching</b> <b>motors</b> were able to show potential in reducing power consumption, reducing vibration and noise, and reducing {{the cost of the}} power electronic drive when compared with an existing commercial 3 -phase brushless DC and induction motor. Investigation on the vibration and noise of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> was also done by performing experiments, mechanical finite element analysis and algebraic frequency equation analysis. Algebraic frequency equations were implemented into the electromagnetic design environment, stressing the need and potential in having algebraic frequency equations to predict the mechanical resonant frequency of any shape of the electrical machine stator lamination in the electromagnetic design environment...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of acoustic noise in electronically controlled {{variable speed drives}} is presented. The causes of vibration and acoustic noise in <b>switched</b> reluctance <b>motors</b> are discussed and it is shown that brushless d. c. motors can produce resonant vibration and acoustic noise by similar mechanisms. The flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> is introduced. This new class of reluctance motor is an advance on the established <b>switched</b> reluctance <b>motor,</b> retaining many of its benefits, but with a simpler and cheaper power electronic converter. The phase windings and method of flux control are different and tests are performed to quantify {{the effect on the}} acoustic noise produced. Measurements of acoustic noise are made on one flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> and one 2 -phase <b>switched</b> reluctance <b>motor,</b> made from the same laminations and mechanical components. It is shown that the flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> produced 2 dB less acoustic noise under the same conditions. Finite element analysis is used to calculate the radical force profiles of the two motors during normal rotation, and further {{analysis of}} this data provides evidence to support the experimental results. The experimental results go on to show how the acoustic noise from a second flux switching drive was found to be comparable to that of a split phase induction motor...|$|R

50|$|A <b>switch</b> <b>motor</b> (also {{known as}} a switch machine, point motor or point machine) is an electric, {{hydraulic}} or pneumatic mechanism that aligns the points {{with one of the}} possible routes. The motor is usually controlled remotely by the Dispatcher (Signaller in the U.K.). The <b>switch</b> <b>motor</b> also includes electrical contacts to detect that the switch has completely set and locked. If the switch fails to do this, the governing signal is kept at red (stop). There is also usually some kind of manual handle for operating the switch in emergencies, such as power failures.|$|E
50|$|A points lever, ground throw, or switchstand is a lever and {{accompanying}} linkages {{that are used}} to align the points of a switch manually.

They are often used in a place of a <b>switch</b> <b>motor</b> on infrequently used switches. In some places, the lever may be some distance from the points, as part of a lever frame or ground frame. To prevent the tampering of switches by outside means, these switches are locked up when not in use.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{switching}} of the bacterial flagellar motor regulates cell motility in bacterial chemotaxis. It {{has been}} reported under physiological conditions that the switching bias of the flagellar motor undergoes large temporal fluctuations, which reflects noise propagating in the chemotactic signaling network. On the other hand, nongenetic heterogeneity is also observed in flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switching,</b> as {{a large group of}} <b>switching</b> <b>motors</b> show different <b>switching</b> bias and frequency under the same physiological condition. In this work, we present simultaneous measurement of groups of Escherichia coli flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>switching</b> and compare them to long time recording of single <b>switching</b> <b>motors.</b> Consistent with previous studies, we observed temporal fluctuations in switching bias in long time recording experiments. However, the variability in switching bias at the populational level showed much higher volatility than its temporal fluctuation. These results suggested stable individuality in E. Â coli <b>motor</b> <b>switching.</b> We speculate that uneven expression of key regulatory proteins with amplification by the ultrasensitive response of the motor can account for the observed populational heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Voluntary {{control has}} been {{extensively}} studied {{in the context of}} eye and hand movements made in isolation, yet {{little is known about the}} nature of control during eye-hand coordination. We probed this with a redirect task. Here subjects had to make reaching/pointing movements accompanied by coordinated eye movements but had to change their plans when the target occasionally changed its position during some trials. Using a race model framework, we found that separate effector-specific mechanisms may be recruited to control eye and hand movements when executed in isolation but when the same effectors are coordinated a unitary mechanism to control coordinated eye-hand movements is employed. Specifically, we found that performance curves were distinct for the eye and hand when these movements were executed in isolation but were comparable when they were executed together. Second, the time to <b>switch</b> <b>motor</b> plans, called the target step reaction time, was different in the eye-alone and hand-alone conditions but was similar in the coordinated condition under assumption of a ballistic stage of similar to 40 ms, on average. Interestingly, the existence of this ballistic stage could predict the extent of eye-hand dissociations seen in individual subjects. Finally, when subjects were explicitly instructed to control specifically a single effector (eye or hand), redirecting one effector had a strong effect on the performance of the other effector. Taken together, these results suggest that a common control signal and a ballistic stage are recruited when coordinated eye-hand movement plans require alteration...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaWarren N. WhiteThis thesis {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} the power loss from power panelboards {{by means of}} power loss models. The model {{is intended to be}} used by HVAC engineers to help estimate building heat loss. While McDonald & Hickok (1985) did not report power losses for power panelboards, Rubin (1979) did. These publications present the power losses of electrical devices at rated loads in tables. In this thesis, the models for electrical devices are created and used, instead of tables, to estimate power losses. The use of curve fit models presents a convenience in calculation of power losses. Breaker, fusible switch, and motor starter power losses presented by McDonald & Hickok (1985) and Rubin (1979) were updated using manufacturer published data, technical papers, industrial standards, and test samples. Test, manufacturer, and analytical model data are collected and power loss curve fit models are created for breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures. The panelboard power loss is calculated as the sum of partial power losses of the component electrical equipment, i. e. breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures used in power panelboards. A power loss model for main breaker and fusible switch power panelboards are created based on the sum of breaker, fusible <b>switch,</b> <b>motor</b> starter, and bus bars with enclosure power loss models. The main breaker and fusible switch power panelboard power loss models are used in a heat loss example. It is shown that power panelboard power losses can be significantly overestimated when calculated with one of the methods currently used (Rubin, 1979). This can result in erroneous sizing of HVAC equipment...|$|E

40|$|To {{solve the}} torque ripple problem of <b>switched</b> {{reluctance}} <b>motor</b> under the traditional control method, a direct torque control method for <b>switched</b> reluctance <b>motor</b> is proposed.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into improving a {{design of the}} flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> for use in an automotive application is presented. This concentrates on developing computer simulation tools to model the motor performance effectively and hence enable {{the development of an}} alternative design. The flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> is introduced as a relatively new type of brushless drive {{with a high level of}} robustness and low cost power electronics. These properties in particular make the flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> well suited to the automotive industry, where reliability and cost are paramount. This thesis details research carried out to develop a new circuit simulation of the motor and its power electronics using the program PSpice. The model developed here is then used as a tool to investigate the performance of the motor. This is used in conjunction with static finite element analysis performed in the program Opera and later on with time stepping finite element analysis also in Opera. These simulation tools are tailored to model the flux <b>switching</b> <b>motor</b> accurately and aid with the improvement, in terms of torque production, of the design. The models are used to produce a new motor design making use of 12 rotor teeth instead of the 4 teeth originally presented. This design shows promise in early static simulations with the potential for higher power due to a higher operating frequency, although high iron loss indicates this may be outweighed. However, time stepping simulation shows that torque production is actually lower than the original 4 tooth design due to lower flux in the smaller rotor teeth.
