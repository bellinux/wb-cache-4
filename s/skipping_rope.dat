Then during the first chorus, the group performs a hand-action dance, that was also used during their live performances. The second half of the video, set {{in the small town of}} Rathdrum, County Wicklow. showed the group interacting with young girls in various activities, such as running around the streets dancing, <b>skipping</b> <b>rope,</b> playing hopscotch, cat's cradle and pat-a-cake, hula hooping, Geri horseback riding, and participating in competitions of various kinds. The locals are depicted as working-class people who attend the local fair or have a drink in the pub. At the end of the video, the group performs at a stage in the local hall in front of an audience of young and old people. The audience applauds after the song is finished. Geri can be seen sticking her tongue out and the video ends.|$|E

25|$|At first, Mary is as {{rude and}} sour as ever. She dislikes her new home, {{the people living}} in it, and most of all, the bleak moor on which it sits. However, a good-natured maid named Martha Sowerby tells Mary about the late Mrs Craven, who would spend hours in a private walled garden growing roses. Mrs Craven died after an {{accident}} in the garden, and the devastated Mr. Craven locked the garden and buried the key. Mary becomes interested in finding the secret garden herself, and her ill manners begin to soften as a result. Soon she comes to enjoy the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendly robin redbreast. Her health and attitude improve, and she grows stronger as she explores the moor and plays with a <b>skipping</b> <b>rope</b> that Mrs Sowerby buys for her. Mary wonders about both the secret garden and the mysterious cries that echo through the house at night.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{simplified}} analytic model for predicting motion of long space tethers. The perturbation model developed here addresses <b>skip</b> <b>rope</b> motion, where {{each end of the}} tether is held in place and the middle of the tether swings with a motion similar to that of a child's <b>skip</b> <b>rope.</b> If the motion of the tether midpoint is elliptical rather than circular, precession of the ellipse complicates the procedures required to damp this motion. The simplified analytic model developed in this paper parametrically predicts the precession of elliptical <b>skip</b> <b>rope</b> motion. Furthermore, the model shows that elliptic <b>skip</b> <b>rope</b> motion will circularize when damping is present in the longitudinal direction. Compared with high-fidelity simulation results, this simplified model provides excellent predictions of these phenomena...|$|R

25|$|A <b>skipping</b> <b>rope</b> (British English) or {{jump rope}} (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more {{participants}} jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E
500|$|To bring {{authenticity}} to the film's {{portrayal of}} spelling bees, George Hornedo, who competed in spelling bees in real life, {{was hired to}} play contestant Roman and be [...] "an unofficial technical consultant."

He was not a good student, with contemporary sources suggesting he [...] "had water on the brain" [...] and describing him as [...] "stolid and stupid". Hopley attributed Cancellor's failure to learn to stubbornness. [...] On 18 April 1860 he asked the boy's father for permission to use [...] "severe corporal punishment" [...] to obtain compliance, with permission being granted two days later. Hopley did not possess the cane traditionally used to administer corporal punishment to students, so instead he used a <b>skipping</b> <b>rope</b> and a walking stick.|$|E

6000|$|This ingenious {{theory is}} too much for Mr. Myers's powers of belief: 'The very first effect of Miss Morris's ponderings was a heavy thump, {{followed}} by a deep sob and moan, and a cry of, [...] "Oh, do forgive me," [...] all disturbing poor Mrs. G. who had the ill luck to find herself in a bedroom about which Miss Morris was possibly thinking. [...] . Surely the peace of us all rests on a very uncertain tenure.' Meanwhile Mr. Myers prefers to regard the whole trouble as more probably caused by the 'dreams of the dead' woman who hanged herself with a <b>skipping</b> <b>rope,</b> than by the reflections of Miss Morris. In any case the society seem to have occupied the house, and, with their usual bad luck, were influenced neither by the ponderings of Miss Morris, nor by the fredaines of the lady of the <b>skipping</b> <b>rope.</b> {149} It may be worth noticing that the raps, knocks, lights, and so forth of haunted houses, the 'spontaneous' disturbances, have been punctually produced at savage, classical, and modern seances. If these, from the days of the witch of Endor to our own, and from the polar regions to Australia, have all been impostures, at least they all imitate the 'spontaneous' phenomena reported to occur in haunted houses. The lights are essential in the seances described by Porphyry, Eusebius, Iamblichus: they were also familiar to the covenanting saints. The raps are known to Australian black fellows. The phantasms of animals, as at the Wesleys' house, may be beasts who play a part in the dead man's dream, or they may be incidental hallucinations, begotten of rats, and handed on by Miss Morris or any one else.|$|E

60|$|On {{this matter}} of lights {146} Mr. Podmore enters into {{argument}} with Mr. Frederick Myers. Mr. Myers, on the whole, {{believes that the}} phenomena of haunted houses are caused by influences of some sort from {{the minds of the}} dead. Mr. Podmore, if we understand him holds that some living person has had some empty hallucination, in a house, and that this is 'telepathically' handed on, perhaps to the next tenant, who may know nothing about either the person or the vision. Thus, a Miss Morris, much vexed by ghostly experiences, left a certain house in December, 1886. Nearly a year later, in November, 1887, a Mrs. G. came in. Mrs. G. did not know Miss Morris, nor had she heard of the disturbances. However sobs, and moans, and heavy thumps, and noises of weighty objects thrown about, and white faces, presently drove Mrs. G. to seek police protection. This only roused the ghost's ambition, and he 'came' as a man with freckles, also he walked about, shook beds, and exhibited lights. A figure in black, with a white face, now displayed itself: barristers and clergymen investigated, but to no purpose. They saw figures, heard crashes, and the divine did a little Anglican exorcism. The only story about the house showed that a woman had hanged herself with a <b>skipping</b> <b>rope</b> in the 'top back bedroom,' in 1879. Here are plenty of phenomena, apparitions male and female. But Miss Morris, in addition to hearing noises, only saw a pale woman in black.|$|E
