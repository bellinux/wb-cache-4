2500|$|The third {{generation}} ("Chevys") were produced with the [...] and [...] engines with specially tuned carburetors for sporting models. The [...] "Chevy" [...] metal emblem for the {{third generation}} had the same font as the [...] "Nova" [...] emblem of 1968–1974 American Novas, and was, {{for the first few}} years, in the rearmost section of both rear fenders. Later, it was moved to the rearmost section of both front fenders, {{as it was in the}} American cars from 1969. <b>Sidemarker</b> lights were not mandatory and changed much during the production run, from being deleted, to leaving a small chrome plate, to the same light as in the American cars. Rear deck emblems just said [...] "CHEVROLET" [...] in chrome letters, obviating the typical [...] "Model by Chevrolet" [...] used in the American cars at the time. The hood emblem was similar to the 1969 American Novas, the bow tie, in blue or just chrome.|$|E
50|$|The unique {{exterior}} of the Lamborghini Egoista is meant to resemble a bull ready to charge if looked at from the side. The lighting resembles that of a modern airplane, with <b>sidemarkers</b> and indicators on the sides and top of the car as well as front and rear. The bodywork consists of active aerodynamic panels that raise and lower for optimum downforce and stability. The body and wheels are made of antiradar material to even more identify with fighter jets.|$|R

5000|$|In April 1988, Chrysler started {{offering}} {{some models}} on the European market. One {{of them was}} the [...] "Chrysler GTS", a rebadged version of the Dodge Lancer ES. Due to European vehicle regulations, the exterior appearance was slightly different. The rear turn signals were amber rather than red, the front <b>sidemarkers</b> and the centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL) were blanked off, small round repeaters were installed into the front fenders and the sideview mirrors were of spring-hinged rather than rigid design. The engine options included the naturally aspirated 2.2 L Four, and a turbocharged version of the same engine. From 1989 on, the 2.5 L Four became available with or without a turbocharger. The 2.2 engine was dropped, except for the Turbo II version that was standard equipment on the Chrysler GTS Shelby, the European sibling of the Dodge Lancer Shelby. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard, with a three-speed automatic transmission as an extra cost option. The GTS Shelby came only with the manual transmission.|$|R
2500|$|For 1970, the Valiant {{was carried}} over with detail changes, {{including}} a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969's metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while {{the remainder of the}} grille was set back from the front plane. The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster coupe. For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new [...] version of the Slant-6. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better driveability, improved soundproofing and decreased emissions, the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implementing new devices such as an EGR valve and an activated charcoal evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries, so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount <b>sidemarker</b> lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous flush-mount items.|$|E

50|$|Lamps and reflectors: Front, side, {{and rear}} turn signals; brake lights, {{front and rear}} {{position}} lights, hazard warning lights, rear reflectors, low and high beam headlamps are all required. <b>Sidemarker</b> reflectors and lights and fog and driving lamps are permitted. All devices must function correctly and emit or reflect the required colours of light.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{unavailability}} {{of certain}} car models, demand for grey market vehicles {{arose in the}} late 1970s. Importing them into the US involved modifying or adding certain equipment, such as headlamps, <b>sidemarker</b> lights, bumpers, and a catalytic converter {{as required by the}} relevant regulations. The NHTSA and EPA would review the paperwork and then approve possession of the vehicle. It was also possible for these agencies to reject the application and order the automobile destroyed or re-exported The grey market provided an alternative method for Americans to acquire desirable vehicles, and still obtain certification. Tens of thousands of cars were imported this way each year during the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|The Duster was {{not changed}} {{significantly}} for 1972. New surface-mount <b>sidemarker</b> lights replaced the previous flush-mount items, the taillamps became larger, one-piece units. The power {{rating of the}} 340 V8 was reduced from [...] to [...] {{due in part to}} a reduction in compression ratio from 10.2:1 to 8.5:1, as well as changing the intake valves from 2.02 in to 1.88 in. All horsepower rating numbers, even on unchanged engines, decreased for 1972 due to a new rating protocol. Chrysler's electronic ignition became standard on the 340 models in 1972. Also, there was a 1 year only air cleaner that had a vacuum operated door at the bottom to allow for additional air flow when the throttle is depressed.|$|E
5000|$|The North American 500 is marketed in Pop, Lounge, Sport and Turbo trim {{levels with}} market-specific {{modifications}} including increased body strength; revised suspension; changes for reduced noise, vibration and harshness; BiHalogen projector headlamps and amber front and red rear <b>sidemarker</b> lights and reflectors on each wheel arch edge {{to comply with}} FMVSS 108; new four-wheel anti-lock disc brake system with new front calipers; larger [...] fuel tank; upgraded heating and cooling system; revised front seats with an armrest and seat cushion; easy entry system designed into the driver's seats; revised steering wheel controls and revised steering; a Bose branded audio system {{as well as a}} more rounded center grille and a plastic lip that wraps onto the bottom of the spoiler. FCA offers the North American 500 with either a 6-speed automatic transmission with a driver-selectable mode as well as a 5-speed manual.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{generation}} ("Chevys") were produced with the 230 CID L and 250 CID L engines with specially tuned carburetors for sporting models.

5000|$|Changes for 1972 {{included}} a revised grille without the central divider of the 1970 and 1971 items, new surface-mounted <b>sidemarker</b> lights {{rather than the}} previous flush-mount units, a new instrument cluster featuring a large rectangular speedometer and several small round gauges; the AM/FM radio option returned. The Demon had new fender-mounted metal [...] "Demon" [...] badges without the small devil character on the 1971 decals. The [...] "Demon" [...] decal on {{the rear of the}} car was replaced by Dodge and Dart emblems on the lower right edge of the deck lid. Some Demons with the side and rear panel tape stripes retained the tape devil character. A new optional single hood scoop replaced 1971's dual scoops, and was coupled with a hood paint blackout that had been standard on the 1971 high-trim/high-value Demon Sizzler model. Cars equipped with the optional rally wheels now came with newly restyled center caps finished in a light argent (silver) paint. Demon production was substantially less than Duster's; this is reflected in higher collector car values for the Demon, especially V8 models.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} information about average annual {{use of the}} following automotive lighting equipment by U. S. drivers: low- and high-beam headlamps, turn signals, back-up, license plate, parking, <b>sidemarker,</b> stop, and tail lamps. The data were collected {{as part of a}} naturalistic field study of crash warning systems. Eighty-seven randomly selected drivers from southeastern Michigan were provided with instrumented research vehicles (11 identical 2003 Nissan Altimas) for periods averaging 26 days and instructed to drive the research vehicle in place of their personal vehicle. The results are presented for each lamp type in terms of the average annual hours of use and minutes used per 100 km driven. These findings are discussed in relation to the rated life of various bulbs and the median life of vehicles in the U. S...|$|E
