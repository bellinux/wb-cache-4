40|$|BACKGROUND: Antipsychotics are {{effective}} {{drugs that are}} prescribed frequently for {{a large group of}} patients. However, they also have many side-effects which can lead ultimately to serious somatic complications. These complications fall into various categories: metabolic, cardiovascular, neurobiological, haematological, gastro-intestinal and urogenital. AIM: To make an inventory of the side-effects and advise on ways of monitoring and preventing them. method The multidisciplinary working group on somatic complications arising from the use of antipsychotics (Werkgroep Somatische Complicaties) has collected literature on the subject and has discussed it at a number of consensus meetings. results The most frequent somatic complications are described on the basis of specific risk profiles and advice is given on how to identify these complications and on how to treat them when necessary. It is essential to monitor, systematically and regularly, somatic complications arising from the use of antipsychotics; furthermore, polypharmacy should be avoided. The person ultimately responsible for this is the doctor who has prescribed the antipsychotics. In addition, it is important to draw patients' attention to the general rules for a healthy lifestyle: no smoking, a balanced diet and adequate exercise. CONCLUSION: It is very important that somatic complications should be monitored carefully and accurately. So far, the Netherlands has no official guidelines on ways to identify and treat <b>somatic</b> <b>complication...</b>|$|E

Aim {{of this study was to}} determine the psycho social condition of addicts in 2004. Materials and methods : This was a descriptive study done on 747 addicts living in Sari township using questionnaire comprising questions on social-individual features, with standard test of SCL- 90 -R. The data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical tests and SPSS software. Results : It was found that 14. 8 % of the cases under study were workless, 40. 42 % labour and farmer. Also 89. 4 % were suspect of mental disorder. The most common mental pathology based on the 9 cateorgories in the cases under study were as follow: Anxiety, depression, paranoid, obbsessive compulsive, <b>somatic</b> <b>complication,</b> phobia, aggression psychosis. Significant difference on mental health between unmarried, divorced and married was observed. Same result was obtained between the above groups in all aspects, except phobia (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Addiction is present in all age groups and all socioeconomic classess. Suspect mental disorder in the addicts is high. Therefore it is suggested that more psychiatric consideration be paid to the addicts who are prone to mental disorders. Also the mentally disorders be under more primary preventive care...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients {{with severe}} mental illness (SMI) {{experience}} a 13 -to 30 -year reduction in life expectancy {{compared with the}} general population. The majority of these deaths {{can be attributed to}} somatic health problems. The risk on somatic health problems is partly increased due to a reduced ability to request care {{and the fact that the}} current health care organisation is unable to fulfil the needs of these patients. Our previous work shows that a health check intervention can bypass the inability to request help of patients with SMI by detecting somatic health problems that were not detected previously [1]. The aim of this research project is to develop a policy recommendation on how to improve physical health based on consensus by the major stakeholders: patients, family carers, general practitioners, and mental health care staff. Methods: We used a three round Delphi method. The first round consisted of an inventory of potential policy recommendations, in two consecutive rounds consensus was sought on a selection of recommendations. Results: The policy recommendations described improvement in collaboration among health care professionals; the need to educate involved professionals regarding the specific medical risks associated with patients with SMI; and defining the differences between GPs and mental health care professionals regarding their responsibilities to provide adequate care for the physical health of SMI patients. Examples of consensus based policy recommendations on colloboration are: The GP is the professional with overview and direction of the complete (general and specialist) treatment of patients. The professional (MHP or GP) who diagnoses a new <b>somatic</b> <b>complication</b> should notify the other professional (MHP or GP) providing them with relevant medical information. -o The results from cardiovascular risk screening need to be known by the GP and MHP. The performer of the screening should inform the other party in writing. For the policy on new physical symptoms, MHP should always consult the GP. Consultation with the GP is necessary before referral to a medical specialist by MHP. Changes in medication should always be reported in writing between MHP and GP. The psychiatrist can delegate the performance of the necessary screening required for some medications used in the treatment of psychiatric disease to the GP, if the patient agrees. Direct personal contact between MHP and GP is an important prerequisite for improving cooperation. Sharing of direct (cell) phone numbers can contribute in facilitating direct contact. Discussion: Currently there are multiple barriers to optimal health care which can be overcome by implementing the suggested policy recommendations. Part of these recommendations can be implemented directly in current health care...|$|E

Karolinska institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, S- 141 86 Huddinge,Sweden. Hip {{fracture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common somatic inpatient diagnoses, and its incidencewill increase even further in the years to come. Since most subjects sustaining thiskind of injury are old and living alone, the incapacitation due to the fracture conveysserious social implications. These patients also often suffer from concurrent medicaland psychiatric disorders. Therefore, rehabilitation after hip fracture is a challengingtask and should have a broad scope. We studied 256 consecutive patients admitted to a special hip fracture unit (HFU),focusing on continuity and daily assessment of the patients' function. The goal wasthat most patients with an independent living situation were to retum directly homefrom the emergency hospital. Also, the patients were expected to manage their ownactivities of daily life (ADL) already from the beginning. The caregivers' primaryrole was to encourage the patients to use their own resources. To achieve this, theHFU was densely staffed. Furthemmore, the nurses also made home visits during andafter the patients' stay at the hospital. The continuos monitoring of progress withKatz' ADL index and the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire was not only helpfulin the daily work, it also allowed an accurate prediction of the patients' socialprognosis. 92 % of the patients who before the injury were relatively independent(Katz 2 B) and who had no evidence of cognitive impaimment (SPMSQ > 8) at admission,and no concurrent disease/injury, were residing in their homes one year after thefracture. Fracture type and patient's age added no further predictive power. Thiseasy-to-use predictor instrument thus allows early social prognosis which is veryhelpful when setting individualized rehabilitation goals. Roughly half of the patients were cognitively impaired at admission, but only 13 % of those lucid at admission detenorated mentally in the postoperative phase,and most of them had completely regained their mental status at discharge. Even 51 %of those mentally impaired upon admission achieved lucidity during their stay atthe HFU. Mental status had a strong impact on <b>somatic</b> <b>complication</b> rate. In the presentstudy, the incidence of postoperative cognitive impaimment was fairly low comparedwith that reported in previous studies, probably because of the enhanced personalcommitment of the caregivers. In this respect we believe that the feed-back fromhome visits and from the continuous assessment was pivotal. Due to the program thenurses were able to follow the patient's progress, in sharp contrast to the usualhip fracture after care policy, where the nurses only see the patients for a fewdays, and the surgeon's only encounter is often in the opcration theater. 85 % of the HFU patients were able to return directly home after a mean inpatientstay of 16 days. Halfway through the project, January 1992, a prospective paymentsystem was implemented in Stockholm. For economic reasons hip fracture rehabilitationcould no more be conducted in the emergency hospital and the HFU was closed down. The number of bed-days in the orthopaedic department decreased dramatically, buta further analysis showed that the total number of bed-days after hip fracture remainedunchangcd the patients had simply been transferred to other departments. The averagefour-months health care consumption, including the initial stay, which had decreasedfrom 39 to 28 days, retumed to its former level immediately after the economic reform. The entire health and elderly care cost for a hip fracture patient during thefirst postoperative year was approximately SEK 170, 000. The cost was strongly correlatedto prefracture health status and need for care, and to whethcr a second operationof the hip was required or not. We believe that an early and active rehabilitation is a cost-efficient enterprise,from an economic as well as a humanitarian viewpoint. Apart from personal dedicationand commitment in the nursing staff, continuity and feed-back appear to be decisive. And a continuous assessment and follow-up are corner stones.

40|$|Abstract Background Anorexia nervosa is {{a severe}} {{psychosomatic}} disease with <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> {{in the long-term}} course and a high mortality rate. Somatic comorbidities independent of anorexia nervosa have rarely been studied, but pose a challenge to clinical practitioners. We investigated somatic comorbidities in an inpatient cohort and compared somatically ill anorexic patients and patients without a somatic comorbidity. In order to evaluate the impact of somatic comorbidity for the long-term course of anorexia nervosa, we monitored survival in a long-term follow-up. Method One hundred and sixty-nine female inpatients with anorexia nervosa were treated at the Charité University Medical Centre, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, between 1979 and 2011. We conducted retrospective analyses using patient's medical and psychological records. Information on survival and mortality were required through the local registration office and was available for one hundred patients. The mean follow-up interval for this subgroup was m = 20. 9 years (sd = 4. 7, min = 13. 3, max = 31. 6, range = 18. 3). We conducted survival analysis using cox regression and included somatic comorbidity in a multivariate model. Results N = 41 patients (24. 3 %) showed a somatic comorbidity, n = 13 patients (7. 7 %) showed somatic comorbidities related to anorexia nervosa and n = 26 patients (15. 4 %) showed somatic comorbidities independent of anorexia nervosa, n = 2 patients showed <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> related to other psychiatric disorders. Patients with a somatic comorbidity were significantly older (m = 29. 5, sd = 10. 3 vs m = 25. 0, sd = 8. 7; p =. 006), showed a later anorexia nervosa onset (m = 24. 8, sd = 9. 9 vs. m = 18. 6, sd = 5. 1; p Conclusion Somatic comorbidity {{seems to be an}} important factor for anorexia nervosa outcome and should be included in multivariate analyses on the long-term course of anorexia nervosa as an independent variable. Further investigations are needed in order to understand in which way anorexia nervosa and a somatic disease can interact. </p...|$|R

Possible relationships between episodic memory and 1) brain microstructure assessed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 2) brain volumes assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were investigated in uncomplicated, detoxified alcoholics. Diffusion and morphometric analyses were performed in 24 alcohol dependent men without neurological or <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> and in 24 healthy men.

Materials and Methods The present study with an analytical cross-sectional design was conducted on 3 - 72 month old children in Sarbisheh city. This study was done on 422 children under supervision of Sarbisheh health center. Case (children with FTT) and control groups (children without FTT) were matched for age and sex. For data analyzing, the Chi -square, t- test and logistic regression were used by SPSS v. 22. Results From characteristics of the household; maternal education level, maternal occupation and mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI had a significant relation with FTT in children. From characteristics of the child; birth weight had a significant relation with FTT in children. From economic characteristics of households; housing and addiction of the mother had a significant relation with FTT in children.

This is a frequently diagnosed disorder characterised by disturbed sleep causing psychic or <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> and daytime sleepiness. A study was undertaken to evaluate whether people with long term occupational exposure to organic solvents have a higher {{prevalence of}} sleep apnoea than the general population. Patients exposed to solvents (66 men) were invited to participate in a screening for sleep apnoea. A static charge sensitive bed was used for the monitoring of respiration movements and pulse oximetry during one night. A classical sleep apnoea was diagnosed if periodic respiration movement exceeded 45 % of estimated sleep time and the oxygen desaturation index exceeded 6. The prevalence of sleep apnoea among the men exposed to solvents was compared with the prevalence in the general population (1. 4 %). The prevalence among the participating exposed men was 19. 7 % which gave a conservative relative risk estimate of 14. 1 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 7. 5 - 24. 2).

Adult patients with PKU were demonstrated not to differ from healthy controls in terms of their course of life (CoL) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, adults with galactosaemia had a lower HRQoL with significant lower scores on the domains of cognitive and social function. This study investigated the CoL and the social demographical outcomes in these young adults with galactosaemia, and compared them with the general population and with PKU patients. A total of 15 (88 %) adult patients with classical galactosaemia participated in this study. Classical galactosaemia patients had a delayed social and psychosexual development compared to their peers from the general population and to PKU patients. Also, they were significantly less frequently married or living together and significantly less frequently employed than the general population. Our study shows a stark contrast between patients with galactosaemia and patients with PKU, although both are diagnosed in the neonatal period and need life-long dietary restrictions.

40|$|Background: Traumatic stress {{may arise}} from various {{incidents}} often leading to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is estimated at 1 % – 2 % in Western Europe, 6 % – 9 % in North America and at just over 10 % in countries exposed to long-term violence. In South Africa, the lifetime prevalence for PTSD {{in the general population}} is estimated at 2. 3 %. Aim: To examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptomatology and related psychological functioning in a community sample of adolescents. Setting: Low-socioeconomic communities in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: Home interviews with adolescents and their maternal caregivers were used to collect the data using standardised instruments. Adolescents completed the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children; Children’s Depression Inventory; Children’s Somatization Inventory; and Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale. The Child Behaviour Checklist was completed by the caregivers. The sample comprised Grade 7 (n = 256) and Grade 10 (n = 68) learners. Sixty-five percent of the sample was female, and ages ranged from 9 to 18 (M = 13. 11, s. d. = 1. 54). Results: Almost 6 % of the sample endorsed PTSD and an additional 4 % of the participants had clinically significant traumatic stress symptomatology. There was a significant, large, positive correlation between posttraumatic stress and anxiety, and medium positive correlations between posttraumatic stress and depression and somatic symptoms. Conclusion: Posttraumatic stress symptomatology can be debilitating, often co-occurring with symptoms of depression, anxiety and <b>somatic</b> <b>complications.</b> This may lead to long-term academic, social and emotional consequences in this vulnerable group...|$|R
40|$|Therapy of {{physical}} disease {{is an important}} part of the overall medical treatment of Severe Mentally Ill patients (SMI). Somatic disease in SMI may follow a different pattern. General medical guidelines for disease management must be reconsidered for SMI, concludes Evert Jan Mookhoek. He has identified the gaps in the knowledge on the occurrence of <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> in (SMI) and has filled out some of the open spaces for dyspepsia, diabetes mellitus and skin diseases. He found a lack of knowledge regarding the epidemiology and disease burden of a number of important somatic disease groups in SMI. More than 50 % of the SMI have ample dyspeptic complaints. In 80 % this concerns reflux-like complaints. Over 1 / 3 of the SMI use medication for dyspepsia on a daily base. An association was found by Mookhoek between dyspepsia and the use of clozapine, laxatives and smoking. We found a drug-drug interaction between clozapine and omeprazole. Diabetes is present in 15 % of the SMI and a latent diabetes in another 14 %. There is a direct relation between diabetes and overweight and an indirect association with psychiatric medication. 69 % Of the SMI have skin complaints and 77 % have skin disorders. In 37 % of the patients skin disorders were present which were not mentioned in the interview. Patients with diabetes have skin infections 10 times more often. Decubitus ulcers were related to addiction. Dermatitis was associated with depression. The length of hospital stay had no influence on the occurrence of skin problems. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) {{and mental illness}} are interlinked health problems; mental illness may pose a risk for contracting HIV and HIV-positive individuals are at higher risk of mental illness. However, in countries with high HIV prevalence, {{the main focus of}} HIV-related health programmes is usually on prevention and treatment of <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> of HIV, and mental illness is not given high priority. We examined HIV prevalence, uptake of HIV services, and HIV-related risk behaviour among people attending a mental health clinic in rural Malawi. METHODOLOGY: Semi-structured interviews were performed with patients capable to consent (94 %), and with those accompanied by a capable caregiver who consented. HIV counselling and testing was offered to participants. FINDINGS: Among 174 participants, we collected 162 HIV test results (91 %). HIV prevalence was 14. 8 %. Women were three times as likely to be HIV-positive compared to men. Two-thirds of participants reported having been tested for HIV prior to this study. The uptake of HIV-services among HIV-positive patients was low: 35 % did not use recommended prophylactic therapy and 44 % of patients not receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) had never been assessed for ART eligibility. The reported rate of sexual activity was 61 %, and 9 % of sexually active participants had multiple partners. Inconsistent condom use with stable (89 %) and occasional (79 %) sexual partners, and absence of knowledge of the HIV status of those partners (53 %, 63 %) indicate high levels of sexual risk behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-prevalence among persons attending the clinic, particularly men, was lower than among the general population in a population survey. The rate of HIV testing was high, but there was low uptake of preventive measures and ART. This illustrates that HIV-positive individuals with mental illness or epilepsy constitute a vulnerable population. HIV programmes should include those with neuropsychiatric illness...|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to study the processes of morphogenesis in the damaged tissues of spinal cord and to evaluate the development of secondary changes due to prolonged compression. Methods : A comparative morphological study of macro- and micro- preparations of 10 corpses. Causes of death were: an ascending edema of a spinal cord - 4, a brain injury - 1, a heavy polytrauma - 2, <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> (a thromboembolic disease, a pneumonia) - 3. Results of surgical treatment of 3 groups of patients in the acuity and early postoperative periods were analyzed. A comparative analysis of 180 observations of surgical treatment of patients with spinal cord and cauda equina trauma in the first 3 days, from 3 to 7 days and 7 days to 3 weeks was conducted. Analysis was performed on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale. Correlation between morphological and statistical data is performed. Results : On the basis of the morphological analysis, progression of secondary changes of a spinal cord during prolonged compression was determined, which become irreversible on the 7 th- 8 th day. Secondary trauma is less frank after conducting an early decompression. Based on the dynamics analysis of the operations timing and the ASIA scale neurological data dynamics it was established that the effectiveness of surgical treatment in the first two groups (first 6 days) correspond to 70 %, and in the third one (between 7 and 21 days) - 10 %. Conclusions : Primary spinal cord injury, after prolonged compression, is accompanied by progressive secondary changes and as a result, irreversible changes in the structure and function of the spinal cord. Morphological study helps to explain the results of the statistical analysis and to determine the most effective surgery timing as a whole. Early intervention may prevent the spread of secondary damage</p...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{structure}} in dementia {{is influenced by}} various factors, including the underlying cause and severity of dementia, the presence of <b>somatic</b> <b>complications,</b> the level of {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) and the patientﾕs age. The characteristics of sleep structure and the sleep-wake rhythm in elderly dementia patients, eleven bedridden patients and nine semi-dependents assessed by clinical dementia rating (CDR) were studied by comparing their night sleep polygraphs and records of day and night activity levels with those of normal elderly group. To examine the effect of social interactions on nocturnal sleep, activity levels were recorded for the twelve bedridden patients over a period of four consecutive days. 　In dementia groups (N＝ 20), the percentages of stage I sleep was significantly higher (P＜ 0. 01) and the percentages of stage II sleep, slow wave sleep and sleep efficiency index were significantly lower (P＜ 0. 01) than that in normal healthy elderly groups (N＝ 10). In the bedridden groups (N＝ 11), the percentages of stage II sleep and REM sleep were significantly lower (P＜ 0. 01) and the percentages of stage Isleep was significantly higher (P＜ 0. 01) than that in semi-dependent groups (N＝ 9). Furthermore, DA (the daytime activity) and %DA (ratio of daytime activity to nighttime activity) decreased significantly in the dementia groups than normal healthy elderly groups and only a few cases in dementia groups showed a clear circadian rhythm of activity/rest. 　Also, the sleep rate during nighttime for the bedridden patients (N＝ 12) increased following social interactions. In particular, the sleep rate of patients who had a sleep rate of less than 40 % for a standard night increased significantly after social and interactive exercises (P＜ 0. 01). 　The observed changes in sleep structure and loss of circadian rhythm of activity/rest recognized in elderly dementia suggest the possibility of the dysfunction of a biological rhythm caused by functional and physiological changes in the brain. Moreover, manipulation of social and interactive exercises is a useful therapeutic method for the improvement of sleep disorder in bedridden patients deficient in social synchronizers who sleep poorly at night...|$|R
40|$|For {{patients}} {{suffering from}} organic disorders, denial {{is one of}} the available coping styles to face the stress of the disease. In case of coronary disease or of cancer, denial diminishes the risk of anxiety disorders and of depression, at least at short term. On condition that it does not prevent fast access to care, it also seems to be beneficial for the short term somatic evolution of the coronary patients. However, at long term, the coronary patients who deny are less compliant to medical recommendations, and their somatic prognosis worsens. Denial may also damage the compliance of cancer patients, and for instance extend the delay in medical presentation for care. Most of research works in psycho-oncology have failed to confirm results of studies pleading for a favourable effect of denial on the somatic evolution of cancer patients. The effects of the stress on the cardiovascular system are well known, and its deleterious somatic impact in case of coronary disease is well established. These scientific data are in agreement with the fact that coping mechanisms as denial, which allows the subject to avoid the confrontation with the stress, may protect him against <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> of the latter, at least at short term. On the contrary, there is no consensus about a possible favouring role of the stress on the cancer progression. So, the contradictory results concerning the effects of denial on the cancer evolution are in accordance with the current knowledge {{about the impact of the}} stress: just as we can not clearly support this one, we must be very careful when hypothesizing that some coping styles can be beneficial for the somatic outcome of the cancer patients. So, the coronary psychosomatic model, which among others attempts to explain the harmful effects of the stress and the protecting effects of denial, cannot be applied in oncology as it is. A psychosomatic model which is relevant in a particular field of the health can not be blindly transposed in other fields, and we must display a critical thinking to denounce the abusive generalizations sometimes at stake in psychosomatic medicine.

40|$|In {{animal studies}} an {{association}} between alcohol intake and central serotonergic function has been demonstrated. There are also evidence for altered serotonergic neurotransmission in subgroups of alcohol-dependent subjects. The aim of the thesis {{was to investigate the}} effect of SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) on alcohol intake, in relation to biological markers for alcoholism, in men with long-term high alcohol consumption but without social, psychiatric or <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> due to their alcohol intake. The subjects were approximately 50 years old, had a history of daily alcohol consumption of about 100 g since 10 years. Despite that 70 % fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence only 30 % had earlier experiences from health care or voluntary organizations due to their alcohol problem. They had few social, medical or other complications related to their alcohol intake. They may therefore represent a group of patients not well known in traditional treatment programs. Compared to a norm group they had lower levels of mental well-being but no anxious or depressive symptoms as assessed by rating scales. The lower moods were most marked in the group of subjects who discontinued the study. Reduction in alcohol consumption of about 60 % did not affect moods. Treatment with an SSRI did not increase moods although a trend was observed. On the other hand, participating in the study program increased mood levels to that of a norm group. The subjects were found to have signs of impaired central serotonergic neurotransmission as assessed by the fenfluramine challenge test, but platelet monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity was of the same magnitude as in a reference group. The presence of the dopamine receptor D 2 (DRD 2) A 1 allele was about 20 %, as could be expected from the prevalence in the general population. Subjects with the DRD 2 A 1 allele had lower platelet MAO-B activity than those with the DRD 2 A 2 /A 2 alleles. The present studies suggest that treatment with an SSRI during a period of alcohol consumption can reduce alcohol intake by about 20 % compared to placebo for at least 2 weeks. This finding is more of a theoretical interest than of clinical usefulness. Predictors for an alcohol-reducing effect of SSRIs may be a mean daily pure alcohol consumption between 60 and 100 g, presence of the DRD 2 A 2 /A 2 alleles and high prolactin response to fenfluramine...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{there is a lack of}} research on ADHD in older adults, and until recently only a few case reports existed. Method: A systematic search was conducted in the databases Medline/PubMed and PsycINFO in order to identify studies regarding ADHD in adults ≥ 50  years. Results: ADHD persists into older ages in many patients, but the prevalence of patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis at age ≥ 50  years is still unknown. It is reason to believe that the prevalence is falling gradually with age, and that the ADHD symptom level is significantly lower in the age group 70 – 80  years than the group 50 – 60  years. There is a lack of controlled studies of ADHD medication in adults ≥ 50  years, but this review suggests that many patients aged ≥ 50  years experience beneficial effects of pharmacological treatment. The problem with side effects and <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> may rise to a level that makes pharmacotherapy for ADHD difficult after the age of 65  years. Physical assessment prior to initiation of ADHD medication in adults ≥ 50  years should include a thorough clinical examination, and medication should be titrated with low doses initially and with a slow increase. In motivated patients, different psychological therapies alone or in addition to pharmacotherapy should be considered. Conclusion: It is essential when treating older adult patients with ADHD to provide good support based on knowledge and understanding of how ADHD symptoms have affected health, quality of life, and function through the life span. Individualized therapy for each elderly patient should be recommended to balance risk–benefit ratio when pharmacotherapy is considered to be a possible treatment.

40|$|During {{the period}} from 1984 to 1994 great changes {{occurred}} in the situation for drug addicts In Stockholm. The HIV-infection among intravenous drug addicts was detected in 1984 and a general HIV-screening started in 1985. In order {{to prevent the spread}} of the HIV-infection among drug addicts the medical and social drug treatment services were enlarged. A new methadone maintenance programme was started in Stockholm in 1987. There were approximately 4, 500 IDUs in Stockholm 1992 and about 50 % of them were opiate users. The rest mainly used amphetamine. The purpose of the thesis was to evaluate all drug-related deaths that occurred in the Stockholm area during a ten-year period, 1985 - 1994, in relation to main drug of abuse, HIV-infection and methadone treatment. The material comprises 830 drug-related deaths and 21 suicides among HIV-infected persons, examined at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Stockholm 1985 - 1994, 74 HIV-infected addicts who had died in hospital during the same period and 547 HIV-infected persons who were registered in the County of Stockholm between 1984 and 1994. Two cohorts were followed up: 101 compulsory treated drug addicts, 1986 - 93, and 1640 hospitalised drug users, 1985 - 92. Both the number of deaths among drug addicts in general and among HIV-infected drug addicts increased during the period. There were different causes and manners of death in relation to main drug of abuse. The majority of the heroin-related deaths were in connection with intravenous injection and there were few deaths from external violence. Amphetamine-related deaths were often due to accidents, homicides, suicides and somatic disease caused by long-standing drug abuse. Many of the cannabis-related deaths were due to traffic accidents, homicides and impulsive and violent suicides. There were few suicides among HIV-infected persons. Among the infected drug addicts there was no relation between suicide and the duration of infection. No addicts with an AIDS-diagnosis died from suicide. The majority of the HIV-infected heroin users died from injection after a short infection time and most amphetamine users died from <b>somatic</b> <b>complications</b> after a relatively long time of infection. The results from the two cohort studies show a lower mortality among those in the methadone programme from violent causes and poisoning among both HIV-seronegative and infected heroin users including those with a very long-standing and intensive drug abuse who had undergone coercive treatment. Most deaths in the methadone programme were due to HIV-related disease. A forensically based register of drug-related deaths in Stockholm 1985 - 94 has been established and it is concluded that this register gives a more comprehensive picture of drug-related deaths than the official cause-of-death register...|$|R
