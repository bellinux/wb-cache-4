40|$|Experimental design {{testing was}} {{conducted}} to identify critical parameters of an aqueous spray process intended for cleaning solid rocket motor metal components (steel and aluminum). A two-level, six-parameter, fractional factorial matrix was constructed and conducted for two cleaners, Brulin 815 GD and Diversey Jettacin. The matrix parameters included cleaner temperature and concentration, wash density, wash pressure, rinse pressure, and dishwasher type. Other spray parameters: nozzle stand-off, rinse water temperature, wash and rinse time, dry conditions, and type of rinse water (deionized) were held constant. Matrix response testing utilized discriminating bond specimens (fracture energy and tensile adhesion strength) which represent critical production bond lines. Overall, Jettacin <b>spray</b> <b>cleaning</b> was insensitive to the range of conditions tested for all parameters and exhibited bond strengths significantly above the TCA test baseline for all bond lines tested.

40|$|Two {{cleaning}} processes, one aqueous and one nonaqueous, {{were investigated}} as potential replacements for the vapor degreasing process using 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane (TCA) for hybrid microcircuit assemblies. The aqueous process {{was based upon}} saponification chemistry. A 10 % solution of either Kester 5768 or Armakleen 2001, heated to 140 F, was sprayed on the hybrid at 450 psig and a flow rate of 5 gpm through a specially designed nozzle which created microdroplets. The nonaqueous process was based upon dissolution chemistry and used d-limonene as the solvent in an immersion and spray process. The d-limonene solvent was followed by an isopropyl alcohol spray rinse to remove the excess d-limonene. The aqueous microdroplet process {{was found to be}} successful only for solder reflow profiles that did not exceed 210 C. Furthermore, removal of component marking was a problem and the spray pressure had to be reduced to 130 psig to eliminate damage to capacitor end caps.

This study evaluated four hospital cleaning methods: 'mop and vacuum', 'spray clean' and 'wet scrub' for floors, and one steam cleaning method for curtains. A standardised microbiological screening method was used to sample the environment before and after cleaning in order to quantify total viable counts as well as identify specific organisms. The results showed that all floor cleaning methods reduced the overall microbial load, although high counts and bacterial pathogens occasionally persisted despite cleaning. <b>Spray</b> <b>cleaning</b> gave marginally better results than traditional mopping and vacuuming.

This study aims to experimentally and numerically investigate water-droplet impacts with velocities of up to 50 m/s and their subsequent flow fields, especially the gas flow field in the strictly limited area {{in the vicinity of the}} contact line. First, we experimentally evaluated the velocity of the splash and numerically calculated the gas velocities. Comparison of these velocities supported our assumption that the maximum gas velocity may be on approximately the same order as the velocity of the splash.

Moreover, we determined that the gas pressure was of the order of 1. 0 MPa by numerical analysis.

Various studies therefore investigated the impact of energy-related and topography-related surface properties on the contamination tendency and the cleanability of material probes. These tests were carried out with stainless steel as reference as well as 46 surface modifications taken from the area of polymer coatings, nanocomposite coatings and physical/chemical vapour depositions (PVD/CVD) on the basis or whey protein and starch contamination. The findings showed that starch deposits on modified surface specimens were reduced by up to 76 % (Fluorinated ethylene propylene, FEP) in contrast to stainless steel.

RECENT FINDINGS: A large international general population study showed {{an increased risk of}} new-onset asthma associated with cleaning work, with professional use of cleaning products and with domestic use of <b>cleaning</b> <b>sprays.</b> Three surveillance studies confirm the recognition of occupational asthma cases among cleaners and among others who use cleaning products at work.
