5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes <b>Stellite</b> Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes <b>Stellite</b> company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|Elwood Haynes (October 14, 1857– April 13, 1925) was an American inventor, metallurgist, {{automotive}} pioneer, entrepreneur and industrialist. He {{invented the}} metal alloys <b>stellite</b> and {{martensitic stainless steel}} and designed {{one of the earliest}} automobiles made in the United States. He is recognized for having created the earliest American design that was feasible for mass production and, with the Apperson brothers, he formed the first company in the United States to produce automobiles profitably. He made many advances in the automotive industry.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Haynes <b>Stellite</b> {{moved to}} {{producing}} tableware, jewelry, and pocket knives. The {{employees of the}} company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to sell the company to Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much $4million on the sale. After a series of owners, the company is now called Haynes International and is again independent.|$|E

30|$|Different {{types of}} wood milling tools {{are used in}} industry: solid tools [made of alloy tool steel (SP), high-alloyed tool steel (HL) or {{high-speed}} tool steel (HS)] and built-on hard alloy blades or different high wear resistance coatings. Shank of built-on tool is made of high carbon or alloy tool steel, while cutting edge is produced of <b>stellites</b> (ST) or plates of tungsten carbide (HW). The cutting edge of more advanced tools is made of polycrystalline (PKD) or monocrystalline (MKD) diamonds. Solid cutting tools are generally used for natural wood milling, planning and profiling contain chromium (Cr) as the main alloying element. Chemical composition of tool steel plays {{an essential role in}} both tool performance and final quality of wood product.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis project {{deals with}} the {{semi-automatic}} extraction of information on satellite images. Some Geographic information systems (GIS) are dedicated {{to the issue of}} data production. The graphical user interface of these GIS is essentially passive, and only provides basic CAD tools for intelligence information mapping such as geometric and semantic capture of spatial objects and semantics improvement of geographic objects. As well as CAD software, they improve the operator productivity in certain limits that of ergonomics. Thus, by combining some generic image processing algorithms, we have implemented a component of semi-automatic extraction of features on satellite images. We gave a priority on the interaction between a user and the component. The user will be only focused on theinterpretation of the images and the component will perform the repetitive task for him. The addressed features were suburban roads, hydrographic area boundaries and shorelines. This system based on powerful tools such as the Orfeo Toolbox (core of the) and Qt (for the GUI) has been tested on images from different <b>stellites</b> and the results are quite satisfactory. This opens perspectives to improve and optimize this system in the aim to integrate it into a GIS solution...|$|R
5|$|Haynes {{continued}} his research into ways to produce corrosion resistant metals. While working on alloys {{for use in}} spark plugs, he created a metal he named <b>stellite.</b> Realizing {{the value of his}} discovery, he patented his first version in 1907. The metal was very resistant to corrosion and had immediate application in tool making and numerous other implementations. He continued to experiment with it until 1910 when he published his findings in a paper to the International Congress of Applied Chemistry and the American Institute of Metals, where he held memberships. His final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on June 20.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the <b>stellite</b> alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
25|$|Many interwar {{developments}} were to aircraft engines, which {{benefited from}} the vast improvements being made for the growing car industry. Although not strictly an 'aerospace' innovation, the use of refractory alloys like <b>Stellite</b> and Brightray for the hard-facing of exhaust valves offered huge gains in the reliability of aircraft engines. This itself encouraged long-range commercial flights, as the new engines were reliable enough to be considered safe for long flights across oceans or mountain ranges.|$|E
40|$|Semi-solid {{processing}} (SSP) of alloys {{has been}} used commercially since the early eighties for the manufacture of components in the automobile and aerospace industries. The thrust of the early development has been in aluminium and copper alloys. The nature of the process makes it an ideal candidate for the manufacture of components in alloys which are either difficult or virtually impossible to forge by conventional means. Alloys such as tool steels, <b>stellites</b> and superalloys, offer the possibility of lucrative niche for commercial exploitation. The work described in this paper {{is the result of}} three years of development in the semi-solid processing of high melting point alloys. The development of the appropriate microstructures for thixoforming M 2 tool steel (both through Spray Formed and Recrystallisation and Partial Melting (RAP) routes) is examined and discussed. The thixoforming of M 2 tool steel in non-metallic dies is described in some detail, together with the way process parameters appear to affect the structure and properties of the final product. The resulting microstructures are closely examined and presented with values of mechanical properties in the as forged and heat treated conditions...|$|R

40|$|A erosão por cavitação deteriora componentes em serviço, tais como partes metálicas de bombas de água, válvulas e, em especial, pás de turbinas hidráulicas, sendo nesse último caso responsável por elevados prejuízos ligados tanto aos custos da manutenção direta, como sobretudo às perdas por interrupção na geração de energia elétrica. Dentre os materiais aplicados no reparo por soldagem de danos por cavitação incluem-se aços inoxidáveis tradicionais tipo AISI 308 e 309, aços inoxidáveis ao Co e ligas à base de Co (<b>stellites),</b> caracterizando-se essas últimas pela maior sensibilidade a trincas, dificuldade de esmerilhamento e pelo mais alto custo. Nesse contexto este trabalho buscou formular, depositar e analisar o desempenho de aços inoxidáveis austeníticos CrMnSiN, soldados pelo processo PTA. A resistência à erosão por cavitação foi avaliada segundo a norma ASTM G 32 - 92. A microestrutura foi caracterizada por microscopia ótica e microscopia eletrônica de varredura e a formação de martensitas &# 945;' e &# 949;, induzida pela cavitação, foi avaliada por difração de raios-X. A integridade da superfície dos depósitos foi controlada por END, além disso a dureza e a facilidade de acabamaneto por esmerilhamento serviram como critérios para avaliar os revestimentos soldados. Verificou-se que os revestimentos aplicados por PTA eram livres de trincas de solidificação, com baixa porosidade, boa molhabilidade e adequado acabamento superficial. A melhor liga inoxidável austenítica elaborada (0, 03 %C; 0, 35 % N; 13, 2 %Cr; 11, 8 % Mn; 2, 8 %Si; bal %Fe) mostrou uma resistência à erosão por cavitação próxima aquela das principais ligas comerciais. Cavitation erosion deteriorates {{components}} like metallic {{parts of}} water pumps, valves and blades of hydraulic turbines, {{in this last}} case being responsible for high economical losses, associated to direct maintenance costs, but above all due to the interruption of the electric power generation. Among the materials usually applied in the welding repair of cavitation erosion are included the common stainless steels AISI 308 and 309, special Co-alloyed stainless steels and Co-base alloys (<b>stellites),</b> whereby these have as handicap a higher susceptibility to cracking, the difficult in finishing by grinding and the higher cost. In this context this work had the purpose to design, develop and evaluate CrMnSiN austenitic stainless steels, as deposited by the PTA process. The cavitation erosion resistance was evaluated using the vibratory ultrasonic test according ASTM G 32 - 92. The microstructure was analyzed by means of optical and scanning electronical microscopy {{and the nature of}} phases present in the coatings - the cavitation induced formation of martensites &# 945;' and &# 949; - was estimated by x-rays diffraction. Besides that the surface quality as examined by NDT, the hardness and the feasibility of finishing by grinding, where all evaluation criteria of the welded deposits. It was verified that the coatings applied by PTA were free from solidification cracks, had low porosity, good wetability and adequate surface finishment. The best austenitic stainless steel developed (0, 03 %C; 0, 35 % N; 13, 2 %Cr; 11, 8 % Mn; 2, 8 %Si; bal %Fe) showed a cavitation erosion resistance quite near the most resistant commercial alloys...|$|R

He is credited as being one of those primarily responsible for the rapid growth of the natural gas industry in Indiana, a boom that made northern Indiana one of the leading industrial regions of the United States.

500|$|Seeing <b>stellite</b> as a {{far more}} {{valuable}} metal, he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded the Haynes <b>Stellite</b> Company in Kokomo to produce the metal in September 1912. Many of his initial requests for the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the best for surgical tools. Because his company could not produce enough of the metal to satisfy demand, Haynes issued licenses to several companies in the United States, Canada, and Europe to produce the alloy and pay him royalties. Haynes strictly controlled production, and did not permit the other licensees to sell <b>stellite</b> in its raw form, but to only sell it as specific finished products. In that way, he remained the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal. As World War I broke out, his company received large government contracts {{for use of the}} material. <b>Stellite</b> was found to have excellent applications in airplanes, and because it was non-corrosive and could protect its contents indefinitely, it proved to be the best metal available for ammunition casing. In 1916 alone, the company registered $1.3million in sales. The rapid growth of the business made Haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year. Despite his large income, he refused to provide his employees a year-end bonus, causing a significant stir in the factory. When a foreman demanded to know the reason that their wages were not raised, he told him, [...] "It doesn't pay to give the working man too much moneyit makes him too independent." [...] His statement was widely repeated and, although he claimed to have made it in jest, it alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor problems.|$|E

30|$|Great {{demand of}} today’s wood {{industry}} {{has resulted in}} intense development of the cutting tools, which unfortunately do not always have characteristics allowing a complete exploitation of the machinery. It is evident that the main problems in wood industry arise from differences in {{physical and chemical properties}} between wood and metal [8, 9]. Good machinability of wood allows high cutting and feed speed, herewith natural wood contains some water, which makes tooling very corrosive. Natural defects of wood cause blunting of tool edges, so extremely hard brittle materials are not suitable in this case. Hardened steels, high-speed tool steels, <b>stellites,</b> tungsten carbide and polycrystalline diamond tools have been used recently in wood transformation. The most common of them are alloyed tool steels and high-speed tool steels, because of their sufficient wear performance and relatively low cost, herewith sintered carbides, polycrystalline diamond tools, different anti-wear multilayer coatings have been used recently [10]. The dominant wear of wood cutting tool is abrasion; however, erosion of tool material and blunting of its edges, which limits possibilities of tool application, can be observed. It was stated in the majority of works that final quality of wood products depends on correct choice of cutting tool type, cutting conditions and tool performance; selection of appropriate tool material for a certain application is directly influenced by the characteristics of material to be machined [11, 12]. As one of the major properties of final wood products, surface roughness greatly depends on the anatomic characteristics of wood, direction of wood grain and cutting tool characteristics [13, 14].|$|R

2500|$|From about 1921, Oswald Short {{had been}} {{thinking}} about the construction of seaplane floats and flying boat hulls made from metal, specifically duralumin, rather than the traditional wood. [...] The latter always suffered from water retention and did not last well in the tropics. [...] He assembled a team, including C. P. T. Liscomb who had extensive experience with that alloy to look into the hydrodynamics and corrosion characteristics of such hulls, and by 1924 was looking out for an opportunity to apply their results. [...] It came with an Australian order for an aircraft suitable for fishing trips around Botany Bay, which Short proposed should be a small flying boat. [...] It was named the <b>Stellite</b> and was the first aircraft to have a Short's [...] design index number, S.1. [...] When it was built and registered as G-EBKA the Air Ministry [...] objected to the name on the reasonable grounds that the Short <b>Stellite</b> might well be confused with the Short Satellite, built at much the same time; it was therefore renamed the Short S.1 Cockle. [...] It was the smallest flying boat ever built at that time. A contemporary source claimed it to be [...] "the first light seaplane to be built [...] and possibly in the world" [...] and the first British all-metal flying boat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stellite</b> alloys display {{outstanding}} hardness and toughness, and {{are also}} usually very resistant to corrosion. <b>Stellite</b> alloys are so hard {{that they are very}} difficult to machine, and anything made from them is, as a result, very expensive. Typically, a <b>Stellite</b> part is precisely cast so that only minimal machining is necessary. <b>Stellite</b> is more often machined by grinding, rather than by cutting. The alloys also tend to have extremely high melting points due to the cobalt and chromium content.|$|E

50|$|Typical {{applications}} include saw teeth, hardfacing, and acid-resistant machine parts. <b>Stellite</b> {{was a major}} {{improvement in}} the production of poppet valves and valve seats for the valves, particularly exhaust valves, of internal combustion engines. By reducing their erosion from hot gases, the interval between maintenance and re-grinding of their seats was dramatically lengthened. The first third of the M2HB machine gun and M60 machine gun barrels (starting from the chamber) are lined with <b>Stellite.</b> The locking lugs and shoulders of Voere Titan II rifles were also made of <b>Stellite.</b> In the early 1980s, experiments were done in the United Kingdom to make artificial hip joints and other bone replacements out of precision-cast <b>Stellite</b> alloys. It is also widely used for making the cast structure of dental prostheses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stellite</b> is {{a family}} of {{completely}} non-magnetic and corrosion-resistant cobalt alloys of various compositions that have been optimised for different uses. Information {{is available from the}} Deloro Wear Solutions GmbH, outlining the composition of a number of <b>Stellite</b> alloys and their intended applications. The alloy currently most suited for cutting tools, for example, is <b>Stellite</b> 100, because this alloy is quite hard, maintains a good cutting edge even at high temperature, and resists hardening and annealing. Other alloys are formulated to maximize combinations of wear resistance, corrosion resistance, or ability to withstand extreme temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>Stellite</b> {{remains the}} {{material}} of choice for certain internal parts in industrial process valves (valve seat hardfacing), its use has been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts of <b>Stellite</b> would be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor. There the cobalt would be activated by the neutron flux in the reactor and become cobalt-60, a radioisotope with a five year half life that releases very energetic gamma rays. While not a hazard to the general public, about a third to a half of nuclear worker exposures could {{be traced to the}} use of <b>Stellite</b> and to trace amounts of cobalt in stainless steels. Replacements for <b>Stellite</b> have been developed by the industry, such as the Electric Power Research Institute's [...] "NOREM", that provide acceptable performance without cobalt. Since the United States nuclear power industry has begun to replace the <b>Stellite</b> valve seat hardfacing in the late 1970s and to tighten specifications of cobalt in stainless steels, worker exposures due to cobalt-60 have dropped significantly.|$|E
