2500|$|The ARV Super2 is a {{side-by-side}} configuration two-seater with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>wing</b> {{for improved}} visibility. [...] The wing is swept forward 5° to maintain correct {{centre of gravity}} balance. The wing area is a small , giving a wing loading of 11.9lb/ft² (58.1kg/m²). [...] The forward sweep may also promote a spanwise airflow inwards towards the root, thereby reducing {{the likelihood of a}} wingtip stall. [...] The ARV's tapered fibreglass wingtips help to reduce drag from wingtip vortices.|$|E
2500|$|The IAR-35 is an all-metal, single seat, short span glider {{developed}} for aerobatic flight.

[...] The wing terminated with small streamlined bodies known as salmons and was rigged with 4° of dihedral. Its inset hinged ailerons were each divided into two sections and small area airbrakes were mounted inboard. [...] A braking parachute was deployed when landing.|$|E
2500|$|The Hurricane was {{a wooden}} framed, fabric covered <b>shoulder</b> <b>wing</b> monoplane. [...] The wing was a two spar {{cantilever}} structure, [...] {{made possible by}} the adoption of one of the novel thick Göttingen airfoil sections. [...] It was tapered, but almost entirely on the trailing edge and with clipped wingtips. [...] Seen in plan, the wing of the Hurricane looked much a late 20th-century light aircraft. The competition rules required that aircraft could access suitable fields via a farm gate, and many met this condition with folding wings. [...] The Hurricane's designer, Samuel Childs chose instead to make its wings easily detachable after removing eight bolts per side.|$|E

[...] Their first design was a modified Holland H.2, an aircraft which VIH had derived from the Carley C.12. [...] All were small, single-seat, <b>shoulder</b> <b>wing</b> monoplanes powered by a single three-cylinder Anzani producing about 22kW (30hp). The Pander D had the much more streamlined, rounded fuselage, quadrant shaped fin and faired headrest that VIH had used with the H.2; compared with the C.12, the Pander's wings were more tapered, had rounded tips and lacked the large cutouts in the trailing edge roots. [...] The trailing edges of the elevators were unswept, not forward swept as on the C.12.|$|E
2500|$|The Nemere's {{progression}} from the Karakán was {{most evident in}} the wing and its mounting. The modified pedestal mounting to the fuselage had gone and instead the Nemere had a <b>shoulder</b> <b>wing</b> mounted on a [...] span centre section built {{as part of the}} fuselage. The wing was a cantilever structure, without the earlier lift struts, continuously tapered in plan from root to tip with no externally distinct centre section and with 2° of dihedral. There was continuous taper in wing section also; Rotter returned to Göttingen airfoils using Gö 646 with a thickness to chord of 19% at the root, varying through Gö 535 to a thinner, less cambered, tip. [...] Like the Karakán, the Nemere had a plywood covered D-box ahead of the main spar but, with the external struts absent, plywood covered more of the inner wing back to a diagonal internal drag strut. The wings were fabric covered aft. Broad chord ailerons occupied the outer 60% of the wings, which ended in elliptical tips.|$|E

2500|$|The Orao II is a cantilever, <b>shoulder</b> <b>wing</b> {{monoplane}} chiefly {{built of}} wood with plywood and fabric covering {{but with a}} slightly forward swept light alloy spar. [...] It is a gull wing, with dihedral only on the inboard section where the leading edge {{is parallel to the}} spar and the trailing edge tapers towards it. [...] Over most of the wing the profile is Göttingen 549R, a revision of the much used Göttingen 549 airfoil, the R indicating a reflexed, camber reduced trailing edge. Outboard the leading edge also tapers towards the spar, giving it sweepback, ending in semi-elliptical tips. [...] The composite construction of the wing around the spar was completely new to sailplane construction; wooden extensions of the spar were bonded to it; wing ribs were riveted to the spa via metal brackets. According to Simons the wing and control surfaces were entirely plywood covered but Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1952-53 says that ply was only used ahead of the spar, with fabric covering aft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high performance Standard Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span <b>shoulder</b> <b>wing</b> monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and sweepback at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, closed cell, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the upper wing surface only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best glide angle of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E
