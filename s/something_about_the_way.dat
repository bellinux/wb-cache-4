500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but {{kept coming back to}} Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E

40|$|This path-breaking book explores how {{solidarity}} towards vulnerable {{others is}} performed in our media environment. It argues that stories where famine is described through our {{own experience of}} dieting or or where solidarity with Africa translates into wearing a cool armband tell us about {{much more than the}} cause that they attempt to communicate. They tell us <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which we imagine the world outside ourselves. By showing historical change in Amnesty International and Oxfam appeals, in the Live Aid and Live 8 concerts, in the advocacy of Audrey Hepburn and Angelina Jolie as well as in earthquake news on the BBC, this far-reaching book shows how solidarity has today come to be not about conviction but choice, not vision but lifestyle, not others but ourselves – turning us into the ironic spectators of other people’s suffering...|$|R

40|$|I {{appreciate}} {{this opportunity to}} discuss aspects of quantitative easing with some former central bank colleagues on this panel. Today’s topic is monetary policy in a low interest rate environment. For the Federal Reserve, which will be my main focus, that means quantitative easing because the federal funds rate has already been effectively brought to zero. My presentation today will have three parts. First, I will discuss the channels through which quantitative easing works, because that sets up a basis to evaluate the policy. Second, in what may sound ironic, I will explain why quantitative easing is hard to quantify. That will say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> central banks operate and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current state of economics and finance. Last, I shall discuss {{the risks associated with}} quantitative easing. This will highlight the importance of having an exit strategy. In that regard, this discussion should not be viewed as relevant exclusively to the Federal Reserve. Any central bank confident in its ability to exit might be more willing to enter a period of very low interest rates. Q. E., Q. E. D...|$|R

40|$|Patient {{education}} has, in {{the last}} decade or so, received increased attention. It is generally acknowledged that people with specific medical conditions, and particularly those with chronic diseases, benefit by being more knowledgeable about their bodies, their treatments and their possible lifestyles. The challenge of providing an educational service for patients is a complex matter and no one group of specialists can expect to have the necessary experience and expertise to meet it fully. If patients are to be well educated they need to have accurate and relevant medical information presented to them in ways which are appropriate and understandable. The providers need to take account of how people acquire knowledge and understanding and they need to know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which patients process information and apply it to develop the skills, beliefs and attitudes which will equip them for their day-to-day lives. It was in response to an acknowledgement of these principles that an evaluation of patient-literature materials on arthritis was conducted by bringing together expertise from the disciplines of health psychology, communication, education and medicine. This account of the multidisciplinary study includes the background rationale, a summary of research methods and findings, the implications for future good practice in patient education and a discussion of the approach adopted...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{processes}} involved in the deployment of technical expertise through {{a case study of}} a strategic change programme for a UK bank. It shows how the project emerged in response to past failures in IT decision-making, with {{the creation of a new}} Management Services Department combining technical and change management specialists. It explores the relationship between these competing groups, and how they shifted over the life-cycle of the project. A detailed examination is undertaken of the forms of expertise cited by these diverse groups and the networks of organisational contacts involved in carrying out their work. The case reveals some distinctive patterns in terms of the nature and range of skills and networks deployed. These reflect a variety of strategies for the deployment and management of technical expertise. The case study also tells us <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which groups of IT staff secure their position within the organisational structure (and the internal and external labour market).
