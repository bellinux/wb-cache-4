It is but a natural reflection. Another one flowing also from the phraseology of bills of lading (a bill of lading is a <b>shipping</b> <b>document</b> limiting in certain of its clauses the liability of the carrier) is that the [...] "King's Enemies" [...] of {{a more or less}} overt sort are not altogether sorry that this fatal mishap should strike the prestige of the greatest Merchant Service of the world. I believe that not a thousand miles from these shores certain public prints have betrayed in gothic letters their satisfaction--to speak plainly--by rather ill-natured comments.|$|E

The relationships arising from issuance and handling with the <b>shipping</b> <b>documents</b> may be quite complicated and the purpose of this thesis is to present these issues that have not been explored deeply in the Czech Republic yet. The original reason that led me into choice of this topic is my personal interest in international trade, ships and securities. The <b>shipping</b> <b>documents</b> enable smooth operation of the international transport and the international transport facilitates the international trade as such. At present, almost all goods at the market are being shipped via ocean during their way to the final customer. The entire movement of goods via ocean is being conducted under <b>shipping</b> <b>documents</b> and the significance of the <b>shipping</b> <b>documents</b> is therefore considerable. As a result of speed and volume sprout of the transport during last two decades, as well as growing popularity of door-to-door multimodal transport and computerization of all data and documents in general, the transport documents are undergoing [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{shipping}} list, packing list, waybill, {{packing slip}} (also {{known as a}} bill of parcel, unpacking note, packaging slip, (delivery) docket, delivery list, manifest or customer receipt), is a <b>shipping</b> <b>document</b> that accompanies delivery packages, usually inside an attached shipping pouch or inside the package itself. It commonly includes an itemized detail of the package contents and does not include customer pricing.

30|$|The entire {{contents}} of the vial were completely emptied into 1300  mL of water with 100  mg of either DTPA or EDTA added to prevent binding of 90 Y chloride to {{the walls of the}} phantom. Activity was drawn from this solution to fill the six spheres (diameters 37, 28, 22, 17, 13, and 10  mm). Once all spheres were filled, the remaining solution was emptied into the background compartment of the NEMA IQ phantom, and the remaining volume of the background compartment was filled with water. This resulted in an approximately 8 : 1 sphere-to-background activity concentration ratio. The center lung insert for the phantom was a solid structure made of polyethylene material. The total recorded activity in the phantom was the total activity listed on the <b>shipping</b> <b>document</b> minus any residual activity in the vial and syringe.|$|E
40|$|For an {{international}} seller {{to be able}} to obtain clean shipping documents is a matter of considerable importance to him. Absent fraud on his part, a cif seller can demand payment of the price against tender of such documents, leaving any dispute about the goods themselves to be resolved later. If he is a beneficiary under a documentary credit, he can use clean shipping documents to obtain payment under a documentary credit, whatever disputes there may be on the underlying transaction. The position may be different where {{one or more of the}} shipping documents is so defective that it can be described as a nullity. Even if it is not a nullity, it may perhaps be rejected if it can be described as non-genuine. If so, the international seller/beneficiary may be deprived of his assurance of payment, even in the absence of any fraud or other moral culpability on his part. Though the Court of Appeal has considered the application of a nullity concept to documentary credits, it has not provided a definitive solution. The courts have been silent on whether a nullity concept should apply to international sale contracts, and on whether non-genuine documents can be rejected, under such contracts.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 22). Buying houses act as intermediary between the foreign buyer and local apparel manufacturer. Buying houses hunt buyers, approach them, send sample of apparel, negotiate price, receives confirmed order after buyer is satisfied with price and quality. Then the buying house contacts local suppliers for production of apparel strictly as per buyer’s specification in exchange of buying house commission. At the centre of all activities of a buying house is the merchandiser. He {{is in charge of}} marketing, sample developing, costing, production planning. Ensuring quality of the finished product is entirely his responsibility. For this reason he has to closely monitor production process. To do all these in strict timeline he needs to be the ultimate master of multi-tasking and must possess advanced communication and negotiation skill. In the early days when the concept of buying house was still at infancy merchandisers used to look for prospective buyers in business directories. But with the advancement of technology the online marketplace is in cyberspace. Merchandisers go through large specialised Business-to-Business (B 2 B) web portals to find buyers. Samples and catalogues are sent to them via email. Interested buyers contact back and a big chain of activities is initiated. Buyers then send specifications of the order. The merchandiser develops the sample and sends it back to buyer for approval. If everything is correct then the buyer start price negotiation. To win order in the highly competitive market the merchandiser has to do costing of the product with pin-point accuracy. If the two parties can reach at an agreement then the Buyer opens export LC favouring the buying house in its country. Once the export LC is opened the buying house contacts interested capable local RMG factories willing to execute the order – at the fixed rate and at the scheduled delivery date. Then the buying house transfers the LC to the manufacturing unit. But the merchandiser needs to look a close eye on the supplier’s factory to ensure quality. Once the production is completed the finished goods are packed and sent to Chittagong port for shipping. The merchandiser keeps track of the shipped goods and send <b>shipping</b> <b>document</b> to the bank for payment collection. The RMG factory receives payment from the buyer and buying house gets commission at a predetermined rate. To become a successful merchandiser a person needs to be a highly skilled marketing person. He needs to concentrate on multiple issues at hand, with the ultimate goal of keeping the buyer satisfied so that possibility of repeat business is increased manifold. He needs to be punctual and must keep commitment. Advanced communication skill is his tool of business. He needs {{to be in touch with}} the stakeholders all the time. Readymade Garments Sector is biggest contributor of export from Bangladesh. To achieve this achievement buying houses have great influence. Buying houses have removed the burden of dealing with foreign buyers from RMG factories, thus enabling them to concentrate on their core activity, i. e, producing quality apparel product. Buying houses have created employment opportunity for educated youth and shown the path to prosperity to numerous educated entrepreneurs. Buying houses has embraced latest trends in technology and communication media to reach buyers in remote countries. But still there is opportunity for better use of Information Technology for data mining to find out useful business insight. If scientific market research can be added to already existing capabilities of the buying house then value addition in this sector can be increased many times. Fatema-Tuz-ZahraM.

It was up to the shipping company to positively prove this, and in the circumstances looking to the register was not reasonable.
