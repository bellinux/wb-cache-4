25|$|Geometric unsharpness {{is caused}} by the X-ray {{generator}} not creating X-rays from a single point but rather from an area, as can be measured as the focal <b>spot</b> <b>size.</b> Geometric unsharpness increases proportionally to the focal <b>spot</b> <b>size,</b> as well as the estimated radiographic magnification factor (ERMF).|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate <b>spot</b> <b>size</b> at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a red one.|$|E

The effects of the ambient pressure and laser focal <b>spot</b> <b>sizes</b> on the target momentum are measured. The {{results show that the}} target momentum strongly relates to the ambient pressure and target property. The highest target momentum about 2. 28 g center dot cm/s is obtained on lead targets under 1 atmospheric pressure. With the increase of the focal <b>spot</b> <b>sizes,</b> the specific impulse decreases. The highest specific impulse in vacuum is about 950 s on copper targets...|$|R

25|$|When {{displaying}} fast one-shot events, {{the electron}} beam must deflect very quickly, with few electrons impinging on the screen, {{leading to a}} faint or invisible image on the display. Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a micro-channel plate just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of secondary emission, this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and <b>spot</b> <b>size</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small <b>spot</b> <b>size</b> even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
25|$|SEM is not {{a camera}} and the {{detector}} is not continuously image-forming like a CCD array or film. Unlike in an optical system, the resolution is not limited by the diffraction limit, fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends {{on the size of}} the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The <b>spot</b> <b>size</b> and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with transmission electron microscope (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1nbsp&nm and 20nbsp&nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (<30 kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4nbsp&nm using a secondary electron detector.|$|E
50|$|Some X-ray {{examinations}} (such as, e.g., {{non-destructive testing}} and 3-D microtomography) need very high-resolution images and therefore require X-ray tubes that can generate very small focal <b>spot</b> <b>sizes,</b> typically below 50 µm in diameter. These tubes are called microfocus X-ray tubes.|$|R
40|$|Gaussian beams {{generated}} within astigmatic resonators {{are themselves}} astigmatic, having wavefront curvatures and <b>spot</b> <b>sizes</b> {{that are different}} when measured in two orthogonal directions. Expressions are derived for the confocal parameters, <b>spot</b> <b>sizes,</b> waist positions, and stability conditions of beams formed within spherical mirror resonators that contain one or more inclined plates (or Brewster-ended laser rods). An expression is also derived for the resonant frequencies of the TEM(mn) mode in such a resonator. It is shown that the frequency degeneracy between modes of the same m + n is lifted and the frequency splittings are calculated. The astigmatism produced by prisms used for dispersion is also considered and precautions are described for avoiding serious astigmatism in resonators containing such prisms...|$|R
50|$|Beam spots with {{diameter}} down {{to about}} two micrometres {{can be obtained by}} collimating the beam with pinhole apertures or with a drawn capillary. Sub-micrometre beam <b>spot</b> <b>sizes</b> have been achieved by focusing the beam using various combinations of electrostatic or magnetic lenses. Both methods are used at present.|$|R
25|$|A {{calculation}} of the MPE for ocular exposure {{takes into account the}} various ways light can act upon the eye. For example, deep-ultraviolet light causes accumulating damage, even at very low powers. Infrared light with a wavelength longer than about 1400nm is absorbed by the transparent parts of the eye before it reaches the retina, which means that the MPE for these wavelengths is higher than for visible light. In addition to the wavelength and exposure time, the MPE takes into account the spatial distribution of the light (from a laser or otherwise). Collimated laser beams of visible and near-infrared light are especially dangerous at relatively low powers because the lens focuses the light onto a tiny spot on the retina. Light sources with a smaller degree of spatial coherence than a well-collimated laser beam, such as high-power LEDs, lead to a distribution of the light over a larger area on the retina. For such sources, the MPE is higher than for collimated laser beams. In the MPE calculation, the worst-case scenario is assumed, in which the eye lens focuses the light into the smallest possible <b>spot</b> <b>size</b> on the retina for the particular wavelength and the pupil is fully open. Although the MPE is specified as power or energy per unit surface, {{it is based on the}} power or energy that can pass through a fully open pupil (0.39cm2) for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This is relevant for laser beams that have a cross-section smaller than 0.39cm2. The IEC-60825-1 and ANSIZ136.1 standards include methods of calculating MPEs.|$|E

In view of the small <b>spot</b> <b>sizes</b> and the high beam energies, {{it is important that the}} numerical codes include a careful treatment of the chromatic magnet properties and an accurate modelling of synchrotron radiation.

2500|$|Because the {{divergence}} is {{inversely proportional}} to the <b>spot</b> <b>size,</b> for a given wavelength λ, a Gaussian beam that is focused to a small spot diverges rapidly as it propagates away from the focus. Conversely, to minimize the divergence of a laser beam in the far field (and increase its peak intensity at large distances) it must have a large crossection (w0) at the waist (and thus a large diameter where it is launched, since w(z) is never less than w0 [...] ). This relationship between beam width and divergence is a fundamental characteristic of diffraction, and of the Fourier transform which describes Fraunhofer diffraction. A beam with any specified amplitude profile also obeys this inverse relationship, but the fundamental Gaussian mode is a special case where the product of beam size at focus and far-field divergence is smaller than for any other case.|$|E
2500|$|Gaussian {{beams of}} any beam waist w0 satisfy this wave equation; {{this is most}} easily {{verified}} by expressing the wave at z {{in terms of the}} complex beam parameter q(z) as defined above. There are many other solutions. As solutions to a linear system, any combination of solutions (using addition or multiplication by a constant) is also a solution. The fundamental Gaussian happens to be the one [...] that minimizes the product of minimum <b>spot</b> <b>size</b> and far-field divergence, as noted above. In seeking paraxial solutions, and in particular ones that would describe laser radiation that is not in the fundamental Gaussian mode, we will look for families of solutions with gradually increasing products of their divergences and minimum spot sizes. Two important orthogonal decompositions of this sort are the Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, corresponding to rectangular and circular symmetry respectively, as detailed in the next section. With both of these, the fundamental Gaussian beam we have been considering is the lowest order mode.|$|E
2500|$|Single-wavelength {{ellipsometry}} {{employs a}} monochromatic light source. This {{is usually a}} laser in the visible spectral region, for instance, a HeNe laser [...] with a wavelength of 632.8nm. Therefore, single-wavelength ellipsometry is also called laser ellipsometry. The advantage of laser ellipsometry is that laser beams can be focused on a small <b>spot</b> <b>size.</b> Furthermore, lasers have a higher power than broad band light sources. Therefore, laser ellipsometry {{can be used for}} imaging (see below). However, the experimental output is restricted to one set of [...] and [...] values per measurement. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources, which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. By that the complex refractive index or the dielectric function tensor in the corresponding spectral region can be obtained, which gives access to a large number of fundamental physical properties. Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) can probe lattice vibrational (phonon) and free charge carrier (plasmon) properties. Spectroscopic ellipsometry in the near infrared, visible up to ultraviolet spectral region studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties, for instance, band-to-band transitions or excitons.|$|E
