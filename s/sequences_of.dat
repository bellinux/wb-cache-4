5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> genes and the amino-acid <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{emission}} spectrum and absorption spectrum of a quantum emitter {{when it is}} driven by various pulse sequences. We consider the Uhrig <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_x pulses, the periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_xπ_y pulses and the periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_z pulses (phase kicks). We find that, similar to the periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_x pulses, the Uhrig <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_x pulses has emission and absorption that are, with small variations, analogous {{to those of the}} resonance fluorescence spectrum. In addition, while the periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_z pulses produces a spectrum that is dependent on the detuning between the emitter and the pulse carrier frequency, the Uhrig <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> nonequidistant π_x pulses and the periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_xπ_y pulses have spectra with little dependence on the detuning as long as it stays moderate along with the number of pulses. This implies that they can also, similar to previously studied periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_x pulses, be used to tune the emission or absorption of quantum emitters to specific frequencies, to mitigate inhomogeneous broadening and to enhance the production of indistinguishable photons from emitters the solid state...|$|R
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of the DNA <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> the internal transcribed spacer (IT) region of S.thailandica showed that the species {{was part of the}} Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. The similarity between S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between large subunit ribosomal DNA <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> the two—a value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae. Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignment also {{refers to}} the process of aligning such a sequence set. Because three or more <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> biologically relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time-consuming to align by hand, computational algorithms are used to produce and analyze the alignments. MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than pairwise alignment because they are more computationally complex. Most multiple sequence alignment programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal alignment between more than a few <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive.|$|E
