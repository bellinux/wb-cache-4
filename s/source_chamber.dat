A 3 mm diameter commercially available skimmer (Beam Dynamics, model 2) is positioned between the <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> and the Stark decelerator. A unique feature of our apparatus is that this skimmer is mounted on a movable gate valve [34], such that the <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> can be vented {{without the need for}} breaking the vacuum in the remainder of the apparatus.

40|$|An {{adjustable}} pump for microfluidics employing {{principles of}} osmoregulation analogous {{to those of}} phloem loading in plant leaves has been constructed and tested. Volume flow arises in a hollow fibre with vapour-permeable hydrophobic membrane. The fibre is connected to a <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> filled with salt crystals and saturated salt solution. The <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> takes up water through a relatively small membrane area and delivers saturated salt solution to {{one end of the}} capillary flow path within the hollow fibre. A stationary osmotic gradient is sustained in the hollow fibre lumen by constant input of saturated salt solution and radial osmotic water absorption. The strong temperature dependence of isothermal membrane distillation enables adjustment of the flow rate up to 20 nL/s. The pump provides pulse-free flow of any liquid with constant rate for at least 26 days without recharging the <b>source</b> <b>chamber.</b> Backpressures up to 1 bar decrease the flow rate by less than 4 %. The volume delivered at a constant rate is more than 40 times larger than the volume of the <b>source</b> <b>chamber.</b> Osmoregulatory pumps of the described type may be useful for microinfusion, microdialysis and analytical microsystems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} {{ion transport}} system that interfaces external ion sources with a commercial dual-cell Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) system {{so as to}} retain maximum experimental flexibility has been constructed. Electrostatic lenses were used for ion transfer with potentials less than 200 V to preclude discharges. Spectra were recorded by thermal ionization and by electrospray ionization. Other high pressure ionization methods can be easily added to the external ion <b>source</b> <b>chamber,</b> making this a general solution for ion transport into an FTMS system. The efficiency of ion transfer {{was measured to be}} approximately 30 %. A pressure ratio of 105 between the external ion <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> and the second cell has been demonstrated.

Porosity, or a small hole, can be progressively created in the wall on a year time scale, which cancause a water leak from the cooling system into the plasma chamber vacuum.

First, {{the results of a}} simple model assuming that electrons are fullymagnetized and strictly following magnetic field lines are presented.

40|$|Managers and {{engineers}} {{are trying to}} lead Varian Semiconductor Equipment to a flow line shipment program, the intent being to eliminate the clean room area and ship all {{of the components of}} the ion implanter directly from the flow line to the customer, without the currently necessary step of a final assembly prior to shipment. The purpose of the thesis is to identify a solution for one of the several mechanical concerns that the company is facing to achieve its goal; in particular this work examines the correct alignment of the <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> inside the terminal module. In the flow line shipment context, the correct alignment of subassembly components becomes a critical aspect and needs to be checked before a shipment, since assembly errors or out of specification components from suppliers may lead to long delays and reworks. This last aspect cannot be ignored, since if adjustments and modifications can easily be accomplished in the flow line without conspicuous waste of time, the same cannot be said in the field, thousands miles away from the factory. Specifically, the contribution of the project is to achieve the right orientation of the <b>source</b> <b>chamber</b> in relation to the position of the feet of the terminal module, by designing a mechanical fixture. The tool has been conceived to be used directly in the terminal module flow line, in order to allow technicians to quickly perform a correct alignment and easily point out any possible misalignment due to bad components or assembly errors. The main components of the fixture will be the jig that checks the position of the insulators and a laser bracket in which two lasers will shoot a target to align the <b>source</b> <b>chamber.</b> by Simone Guerra.
