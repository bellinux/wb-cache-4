5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} locations {{featured in the}} Kanon story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works.

5|$|After the {{decision}} was taken to cancel all the stories previously commissioned for Season 23, new stories were sought for the shortened 14 episode series.

5|$|Although not {{strictly}} a missing serial, {{production of the}} 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician's strike partway through recording.
