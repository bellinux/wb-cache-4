50|$|A <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> {{is usually}} {{undertaken}} by human resources or personnel staff, or by a third-party recruiter. The {{aim of the}} <b>screening</b> <b>interview,</b> which can occur by telephone or in person, is to check a candidate's technical relevance against the job and whether they meet minimum qualification requirements so that interviewers can determine if a candidate has the basic skills to perform the work. Candidates will be asked questions oriented around their experience and training, though {{there may be some}} questions designed to reveal other issues such as deceptiveness. However, their main interest is gathering resumes and initial impressions before making decisions on whether they will move to the next step. This phase can also be aided by software tools for assessment of programming proficiency.|$|E

The present study aims to examine the convergent {{validity of}} the Brazilian version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children/Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) by comparison with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a parental screening measure for child/adolescent emotional/behavior problems. Methods: An experienced child psychiatrist blind to CBCL results applied the K-SADS-PL to a consecutive sample of 78 children (6 - 14 years) referred to a public child mental health outpatient clinic (response rate = 75 %).

5000|$|Employment. Interviews in an {{employment}} context are typically called job interviews which describe a formal consultation {{for the purpose}} of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position. Interviews are seen as a useful tool in assessing qualifications. A specific type of job interview is a case interview in which the applicant is presented with a question or task or challenge, and asked to resolve the situation. Sometimes to prepare for job interviews, candidates are treated to a mock interview as a training exercise to prepare the respondent to handle questions in the subsequent 'real' interview. Sometimes the interviews happen in several waves, with the first interview sometimes being called a <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> which is a shorter length interview, followed by more in-depth interviews later on, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video phoning technology has enabled applicants to interview for jobs despite being in different cities or countries than the interviewer.|$|E
5000|$|Competition {{to receive}} a summer offer from a firm is intense, and {{credentials}} (a student's GPA and class rank, law review or moot court membership, publications, etc.) play a decisive role in determining who is selected. Most offers are received after a three-step interview process. First, during the early fall of their 2L (second year), students at each law school first submit their resumes to a central paper file or online database (such as CRIS or LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell), from which interviewers selected candidates they wish to interview, based almost entirely on their 1L GPA and class rank. Second, selected students are notified, usually via email, and then schedule a <b>screening</b> <b>interview,</b> either at the law school or at a local hotel; this interview is usually conducted {{by one or more}} attorneys from that firm and is part of most schools' On Campus Interview ("OCI") program, in which firms send recruiters to schools across the country. Finally, students selected from the screening interviews are invited for a final [...] "callback" [...] interview, commonly held at the firm's offices. If the selected student attends school in a place far from the city in which the firm is located, {{it is not unusual for}} the firm to fly the student in and pay for accommodations while he is in town. After the callback, a selected candidate will receive a phone call (usually within 48 hours) informing him that he has been extended an offer. After the summer, early into their 3L (third) years, the vast majority of summer associates receive formal offers to join the firm after graduating school and sitting for the bar exam. Thus, the career path of many law students (at least initially) may be determined long before they ever begin to practice.|$|E

30|$|We {{contacted}} each potential participant by email, briefly {{explained the}} purpose of our study, {{and asked if they}} were available for a short (<[*] 10  min) meeting to conduct a <b>screening</b> <b>interview.</b> We sent a maximum of four follow-up emails to schedule this interview. We scheduled phone calls or virtual meetings to conduct the screening interviews with all potential participants who responded to our emails. The full <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> protocol is in the Supplemental materials of Auerbach et al. (2018). We used screening interviews to ask instructors how long they had been using active-learning strategies and what active learning looked like in their classroom. We did not define active learning in these interviews and aimed to recruit instructors who described some instruction in which they stopped lecturing and students worked. Hereafter, we refer to these participants as “active-learning instructors.” We also confirmed that potential participants currently taught biology courses with 50 or more students. Out of 341 potential participants emailed, 141 responded and participated in a <b>screening</b> <b>interview,</b> and we invited 109 to complete the survey. Eighty-one faculty completed the survey, representing 74 % of those invited following a <b>screening</b> <b>interview.</b> We later omitted four due to inconsistencies between survey and interview responses or incomplete survey responses.|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{violence}} is frequent. But {{up to now}} there is no screening instrument available in German which would allow a simple assessment. In this article a short <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> is published that allows the identification of women who became victims of domestic violence. Such a <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> has not been published in German speaking countries until now. A <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> originally developed in English speaking countries called "Partner Violence Screen" (PVS) was translated, modified and validated in a population of female patients of a crisis intervention ward. The original version of the PVS consisted of 3 items which have been extended by two items, so that the modified version of the PVS is composed of 5 items now. In a validation study this instrument was compared to a much more detailed, 30 item self rating scale "Index of Spouse Abuse" (ISA). In addition to the validation of the PVS a life-time version of the PVS was developed which refers to the entire life period since the 18 th birthday. The original version of the PVS showed a sensitivity of 0. 79 and a specificity of 0. 70. In the modified version "Screening Partner Violence" the sensitivity was 0. 80 and the specificity 0. 78. This screening instrument, which was translated and further developed by the authors, proved to be helpful for identifying domestic violence. With this instrument a <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> is available {{for the first time in}} German speaking countries that can be accomplished with women in different institutions without losing much time...|$|E
40|$|From an {{attraction}} point of view, initial contacts between organizational representatives and applicants are potentially quite important, since first impressions of an organization’s employees {{can lead to}} the formation of opinions that are not easy to displace afterward (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Until now, research on the effects of initial contacts has focused primarily on applicant reactions to the <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> in general, and the campus interview in particular (Barber, 1998). More specifically, a large number of studies have focused on applicants ’ reactions to recruiter behaviors and personality during the <b>screening</b> <b>interview.</b> Recruiter warmth is consistently found to be associated with applicant attraction, with applicants more attracted when the recruiter is perceived as being warm (e. g., Turban & Dougherty, 1992). Also reported in the recruitment literature is the positive relationship between applicant attraction and the amount of information provided by the recruiter during the interview (Maurer, Howe, & Lee, 1992). A third recruiter characteristic that has received considerable attention is recruiter competence. Research indicates that applicants are generally more attracted to the organization when the recruiter is perceived as being competent (Liden & Parsons, 1986). Presumably because the <b>screening</b> <b>interview</b> {{is one of the most}} frequent means of establishing interpersonal contac...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test a {{questionnaire}} for screening people with anxiety/depression for their suitability for certain forms of computer‐guided self‐help. A total of 196 referrals completed the screening questionnaire. Three clinicians each independently judged the referrals' broad problem type and suitability.
