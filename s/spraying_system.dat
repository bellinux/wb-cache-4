The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides.

Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal.

The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce wood {{products}} use automated <b>spray</b> <b>systems,</b> {{allowing them to}} paint materials {{at a very high}} rate with a minimum of personnel. Automated <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> usually incorporate a paint-saving system which recovers paint not applied to the products. Commonly, linear <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> are for products which are lying flat on a conveyor belt and then fed into a linear <b>spray</b> <b>system,</b> where automated <b>spray</b> guns are stationed above. When the material is directly below the guns, the guns begin to paint the material. Materials consist of lineal parts usually less than 12 in wide, such as window frames, wood moulding, baseboard, casing, trim stock and any other material that is simple in design. These machines are commonly used to apply stain, sealer, and lacquer. They can apply water- or solvent-based coatings. In recent years ultraviolet-cured coatings have become commonplace in profile finishing, and there are machines particularly suited to this type of coating.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{had used}} a cam-linkage {{mechanism}} to construct a simulated spot <b>spraying</b> <b>system.</b> The nozzles of sprayer mounted on couplers of the mechanism were driven by a servo-motor and the sprayings were controlled by PC. Using cam-linkage mechanism, at any position of coupler curve that is near straight line the nozzle can spray while the traditional sprayer only can apply at fewer certain positions. Therefore, fewer nozzles are used and more spots can be applied in our approach. The software-matlab-had been {{used to analyze the}} camlinkage mechanism. The relation between the rotation of cam and the position of linkage had been studied. The software-LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) -had been applied on writing the control program for the simulated spot <b>spraying</b> <b>system.</b> In this study, water instead of chemical had been applied in the experiments. The camlinkage was oscillating while measurement cups mounted on belt conveyer was moving that was to simulate a <b>spraying</b> <b>system</b> applying chemical on the field.

Dust was injected into a sump cavity at the face. Airborne respirable dust concentration was mea-sured behind the brattice with a personal sampler and cyclone, and particle size distribution was mea-sured with a cascade impactor. When used alone, the top-spray system captured about 55 pct of the respirable dust in the face area and the bottom-spray system captured 60 pct; the capture efficiency of each system is decreased when they are used simultaneously. From a mass-concentration viewpoint, each <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> preferentially captures larger dust particles...|$|R
