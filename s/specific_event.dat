5|$|Following the World Championships, Bolt ran 9.85 {{seconds for}} the 100m {{to win in}} Zagreb before setting the year's best time of 9.76 seconds at the Memorial Van Damme. This run was overshadowed by Jamaican rival Blake's {{unexpected}} run of 19.26 seconds in the 200m at the same meeting, which brought him within seven hundredths of Bolt's world record. Although Bolt failed to win the Diamond Race in a <b>specific</b> <b>event,</b> he was not beaten on the 2011 IAAF Diamond League circuit, taking three wins {{in each of his}} specialities that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Queer Eye episodes {{use the same}} basic format. The episode begins with the Fab Five in an SUV (usually in New York City, where the series was based) discussing their heterosexual subject. The Five review details of the subject's personal life and note problems in their various areas of expertise. The Five usually have a <b>specific</b> <b>event</b> for which they plan to prepare the subject. These included everything from throwing a backyard barbecue for friends to preparing {{to ask for a}} salary increase to proposing marriage.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this <b>specific</b> <b>event</b> to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.|$|E

5|$|Some of Chopin's {{well-known}} pieces {{have acquired}} descriptive titles, {{such as the}} Revolutionary Étude (Op.10,No.12), and the Minute Waltz (Op.64,No.1). However, {{with the exception of}} his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no <b>specific</b> <b>event</b> or death is known to have inspired it.|$|E

25|$|Problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) is {{a principle}} {{based on the}} educational philosophy of the French educationalist Célestin Freinet in the 1920s, and is used in many subject areas including medicine.

It refers to a whole process, and not merely to a <b>specific</b> <b>event</b> (the PBL tutorial).|$|E
25|$|Spot-fixing {{attempts}} to defraud bookmakers by a player taking a pre-arranged action {{to fix the}} result of that <b>specific</b> <b>event.</b> Spot-fixing differs from match fixing, in which the final result of a match is fixed; or point shaving, in which corrupt players (or officials) attempt to limit the margin of victory of the favoured team. Spot-fixing is more difficult to detect than match fixing or point shaving, and by its nature can be perpetrated by a lone fraudulent player without needing any other players or officials to co-operate. The growth of internet gambling and increased variety of betting options (e.g. spread betting, first-scorer betting) resulted in the emergence of spot-fixing, particularly through {{the first decade of the}} 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Historical ecology is a {{research}} program {{that focuses on the}} interactions between humans and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries. In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields. Rather than concentrating on one <b>specific</b> <b>event,</b> historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to and shape the environment, continuously contributing to landscape transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{introduced}} as a post-release add-on for SQL Server 2000, Notification Services was bundled {{as part of}} the Microsoft SQL Server platform for the first and only time with SQL Server 2005. SQL Server Notification Services is a mechanism for generating data-driven notifications, which are sent to Notification Services subscribers. A subscriber registers for a <b>specific</b> <b>event</b> or transaction (which is registered on the database server as a trigger); when the event occurs, Notification Services can use one of three methods {{to send a message to}} the subscriber informing about the occurrence of the event. These methods include SMTP, SOAP, or by writing to a file in the filesystem. Notification Services was discontinued by Microsoft with the release of SQL Server 2008 in August 2008, and is no longer an officially supported component of the SQL Server database platform.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the <b>specific</b> <b>event.</b> Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E

500|$|At {{the base}} of the Rove Formation, between the Rove and the {{underlying}} Gunflint Iron Formation, there is a lateral layer of shocked quartz and feldspar grains found within accretionary lapilli, accreted grain clusters and spherule masses. These pieces of debris indicate that the layer contains hypervelocity impact ejecta. Zircon geochronologic data shows that this layer formed 1878 to 1836 million years ago; the Sudbury Impact event occurred [...] Because of the closeness in dating and the nearness of the crater, the Sudbury Impact event is the likely source for the ejecta; these are the oldest ejecta linked to a <b>specific</b> <b>event</b> on Earth.

As part of the Suicide Race, horses and riders run down Suicide Hilla 62-degree slope that runs for [...] to the Okanogan River. Horses must pass a veterinarian examination to ensure they are physically healthy, and a swim test to ensure they can cross the river, to demonstrate their ability to run the race and navigate the river. Several animal rights groups, including Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), In Defense of Animals and Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), have expressed concerns about the horses' welfare and have opposed the <b>specific</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bowlby later {{stated that}} he had {{concluded}} that, contrary to the focus of psychoanalysts on the internal fantasy world of the child, the important area to study was how a child was actually treated by his parents in real life {{and in particular the}} interaction between them. He chose the actual removal of children from the home at this particular time because it was a <b>specific</b> <b>event,</b> the effects of which could be studied, and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child's development and because it was preventable. In addition, views that he had already expressed about the importance of a child's real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by [...] "sheer incredulity" [...] by colleagues before World War II. This led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of the effects on a child of early experiences. Bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of the view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to the advancement of science in this area.|$|E
