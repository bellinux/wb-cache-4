5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> stand upright in it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} match, England needed to beat Wales by 57 points to {{overtake}} France, while Wales {{were trying to}} avoid the wooden spoon. Wales led 15–0 after 15 minutes and 18–15 at half-time, and though England managed to draw level in the second half, James Hook then kicked two penalties and a drop goal, to give Wales the victory by 27–18. This result confirmed France's position as champions and handed the wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> Scotland, both on points difference.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1952, Massey {{was sworn}} in as {{governor}} general of Canada in a ceremony in the Senate chamber, where he was presented with the Canadian Forces Decoration (subsequently given to all governors general upon taking office). However, Massey's first months as the viceroy were muted, due to the ongoing 16-week period of official mourning. It was not until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, that Massey was called upon to take charge of any national celebration. For the occasion, he revived the use of the state carriage when he rode in it, with an accompanying guard of Royal Canadian Mounted Police, from the royal and viceroyal residence of Rideau Hall to Parliament Hill, where he introduced to the gathered crowd the Queen's coronation speech, broadcast around the world via radio. He also gave a silver <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> each child born on that day.|$|E

500|$|The [...] long Coronation Spoon, {{which dates}} from the late 12thcentury, is silver-gilt and set with four pearls. A ridge divides the bowl in half, {{creating}} grooves into which the Archbishop of Canterbury dips two fingers and anoints the monarch, confirming him or her as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. It is the oldest surviving piece of regalia, first recorded in the Royal Collection in 1349 as [...] "a spoon of ancient form", and was probably made for HenryII or RichardI. In 1649, Oliver Cromwell sold the <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> Clement Kynnersley, Yeoman of the Removing Wardrobe, who returned it to CharlesII upon {{the restoration of the}} monarchy.|$|E
500|$|There {{are clear}} gender {{divisions}} among the Betsimisaraka. When traveling by {{foot in a}} mixed gender group, it is forbidden for women to walk before men. [...] Women are traditionally the ones to act as porters, carrying light items {{on the head and}} heavy items on the back; if a woman is present, it is considered ridiculous for a man to carry something. [...] When eating, men use a single <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> fill their plates from the communal bowl and to eat the food on their plates, whereas women are required to use two separate spoons to fill their plates and to eat. Men are generally responsible for tilling the rice fields, obtaining food, gathering firewood and building the family home and furniture, and they engage in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women's tasks include growing crops, weeding the rice fields and harvesting and processing the rice, fetching water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving.|$|E
500|$|Each team then {{participates in}} a {{physical}} stunt that involves teams using common household items {{to answer questions about}} biblical characters. For example, in the game [...] "Stick a Fork In It," [...] the teams must answer the question by using a <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> catapult a fork into one of several glasses labeled with different possible answers. Where teams compete individually, each team is given 60 seconds; occasional games where teams compete at the same time are either untimed (with the first team to complete the game winning) or played in 90 seconds. In all cases, the team that wins the stunt receives 200 points; in case of a tie, each of the teams involved in the tie receives the points. The next round, entitled [...] "Kirk's Righteous Remix," [...] features Grammy Award-winner Kirk Franklin and a choir singing songs relating to various books of the Bible. Each team is then given one question based on an announced subject worth 300 points; no penalty is assessed for an incorrect answer.|$|E

500|$|... "Window of Opportunity" [...] was {{the second}} Stargate SG-1 script by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, and their first episode to air. The writing duo's first script, [...] "Scorched Earth", would air three episodes later. Choosing [...] "Ad Infinitum" [...] as the episode's working title, Mallozzi and Mullie {{originally}} pitched [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] as a darker story from the finished episode. SG-1 would encounter a world whose scientists work feverishly on preventing an imminent apocalypse, but after being {{unable to find a}} solution in time, they initiate a time loop that would trap the SG-1 team. Executive producer Brad Wright however noted the similarities to the [...] episode [...] "Cause and Effect", and writer Robert C. Cooper suggested a lighter direction similar to the feature film Groundhog Day, which O'Neill would briefly reference in the episode. To simplify continuity in the shooting process, Brad Wright encouraged chaos-theory-type fluctuations in the story as early as in the episode's concept meeting. Director Peter DeLuise asked the prop department to glue the Froot Loops to O'Neill's breakfast <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> have the same loops in the same spots in each take.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} {{the social}} reforms {{presented by the}} Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli in November 1902, Sonnino introduced a reform bill to alleviate poverty in southern Italy. The bill provided for a reduction of the land tax in Sicily, Calabria and Sardinia, the facilitation of agricultural credit, the re-establishment {{of the system of}} perpetual lease for small holdings (emphyteusis) dissemination and enhancement of agrarian contracts in order to combine the interests of farmers with those of the land-owners.

'The {{construction}} of his painting {{turns on the}} orchestration of these geometrical volumes, which shift their position, develop, interweave following the movements in space of the painter himself. Already we can see, {{as a consequence of}} this movement introduced into an art which, we were told, had no relation to movement, a plurality of perspective points. These architectural combinations of cubes supported the image as it appears to the senses, that of a woman whose torso is naked, holding in her left hand a cup while with the other hand she lifts a <b>spoon</b> <b>to</b> her lips. It can be easily understood that Metzinger is trying to master chance, he insists that each of the parts of his work must enter into a logical relationship with all the others. Each should, precisely, justify the other, the composition should be an organism as rigorous as possible and anything that looks accidental should be eliminated, or at least kept under control. None of that prevented either the expression of his temperament or the exercise of his imagination.' (Albert Gleizes) ...|$|E
