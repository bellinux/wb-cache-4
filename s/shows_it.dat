5|$|Rozrolimupab is a {{polyclonal}} antibody. Broken {{down into}} rozro-lim-u-pab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a human polyclonal antibody acting on the immune system. The suffix -pab <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> is a polyclonal antibody.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E

The agents are shown a video from the game, featuring the female character who killed the player. Mulder takes the printout of the character and <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> to a detective, as he believes she is the killer.|$|E

5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which agrees with several other recent analyses. If a stem-based definition is used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore basal abelisaurids. However, as they are more basal than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based definition is adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, {{so it was not}} included in Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> to be an abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, it covered the {{entertainment}} industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque <b>shows.</b> <b>It</b> also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom was {{the first}} concert {{residency}} by American singer Lady Gaga. Performed at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, the residency began on March 28 and concluded on April 7, 2014, after completing seven <b>shows.</b> <b>It</b> was the final event hosted by the venue after {{it was announced that}} it was being closed down and being replaced with a 42-story skyscraper. Gaga revealed that Roseland was the only venue in New York City that she had never played, although she had visited there previously to watch shows. A poster announcing the event was released, showing an old image of Gaga taken before the time she became successful as a recording artist.|$|E

6000|$|... 70. I {{must begin}} a little {{apparently}} wide of the mark, {{and ask you}} to reflect {{if there is any}} way in which we waste money more in England than in building fine tombs? Our respect for the dead, when they are just dead, is something wonderful, and the way we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> more wonderful still. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black feathers and black horses; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black dresses and bright heraldries; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with costly obelisks and sculptures of sorrow, which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with frightful gratings and vaults, and lids of dismal stone, {{in the midst of the}} quiet grass; and last, and not least, we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> by permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or credible, in the epitaph. This feeling is common to the poor as well as the rich; and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin themselves, to testify their respect for some member of it in his coffin, whom they never much cared for when he was out of it; and how often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death, in order that she may be respectably buried.|$|R

5|$|Live & Kicking is a BBC Saturday morning children's {{magazine}} programme, {{running from}} 1993 to 2001. The fourth in {{a succession of}} Saturday morning <b>shows,</b> <b>it</b> was the replacement for Going Live!, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and the show eventually {{came to an end}} in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> may have been written after his death. This {{is probably the most}} famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} {{in hopes that}} it would result in higher ratings for the lead out <b>shows.</b> <b>It</b> would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E

The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church <b>shows</b> <b>it</b> among trees.|$|E
