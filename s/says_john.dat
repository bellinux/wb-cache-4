2500|$|Historically in the West, the {{technique}} {{is known to have}} been used in the Spanish Inquisition. The suffocation of bound prisoners with water has been favored because, unlike most other torture techniques, it produces no marks on the body. CIA officers who have subjected themselves to {{the technique}} have lasted an average of 14seconds before capitulating. According to at least one former CIA official, information retrieved from the waterboarding may not be reliable because a person under such duress may admit to anything, as harsh interrogation techniques lead to false confessions. [...] "The person believes they are being killed, and as such, it really amounts to a mock execution, which is illegal under international law", <b>says</b> <b>John</b> Sifton of Human Rights Watch. It is [...] "bad interrogation. I mean you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough", said former CIA officer Bob Baer. There was considerable dissension within the Bush administration over the use of these techniques; both military investigators and the FBI opposed them.|$|E
2500|$|With the King's recovery, York {{was either}} {{dismissed}} or resigned {{from his office}} of protector, and, with his Neville allies, withdrew from London to their lands in the north. The government meanwhile summoned a Great Council to meet in Leicester on 22 May 1455, at which, the Yorkists believed, they would be attainted, or worse. The Yorkists gathered their forces and marched south. The King, with a small force, was likewise marching north to Leicester. The King was {{made aware of the}} Yorkists' approach in the early morning of 22May, and Buckingham urged that the royal army push on to St Albans. This, it has been suggested, was because he assumed correctly that York would want to parley before any confrontation, just as he had in 1452. The decision to head for the town and not make a stand straight away may have been a tactical error, however. The two parties met, then, at St Albans, with the King lodged in the town and York, with the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, encamped outside. Negotiations commenced on 22 May with York demanding Somerset be released into his custody. Possibly because of this, the King replaced Somerset as Lord High Constable with Buckingham the same day, and in that capacity Buckingham acted as the King's personal negotiator, receiving and responding to the Yorkists' messengers before the battle and playing for time. Buckingham received at least three embassies, but the King refused to give in to the main Yorkist demand – that Somerset was surrendered to them. Buckingham may have hoped that the repeated negotiations would deplete the Yorkists' energy for a battle, and likewise hold off long enough for reinforcements to arrive. To which end, <b>says</b> <b>John</b> Gillingham, Buckingham made an [...] "insidiously tempting suggestion" [...] that the Yorkists mull over the King's responses in Hatfield or Barnet overnight.|$|E

2500|$|Some early Christians {{sought out}} and welcomed martyrdom.

Ibid., pp. 146, 138.}} According to Droge and Tabor, [...] "in 185 the proconsul of Asia, Arrius Antoninus, was approached by a group of Christians demanding to be executed. The proconsul obliged some of them and then sent the rest away, saying that if they wanted to kill themselves there was plenty of rope available or cliffs they could jump off." [...] Such seeking after death is found in Tertullian's Scorpiace and in the letters of Saint Ignatius of Antioch but was not the only view of martyrdom in the early Christian church. The 2nd century text Martyrdom of Polycarp relates the story of Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who did not desire death, but died a martyr, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire miraculously failed to touch him. The Martyrdom of Polycarp advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarp’s death as its prized example. The example of the Phrygian Quintus, who actively sought out martyrdom, is repudiated.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the most}} part, Howell's {{adaptation}} is taken word-for-word from the First Folio, with only some relatively minor differences. For example, the adaptation opens differently to the play, with Henry VI singing a lament for his father. Another {{difference is that}} Fastolf's escape from Rouen is seen rather than merely mentioned. Also worth noting is that Act 5, Scene 1 and Act 5, Scene 2 are reversed so that Act 4, Scene 7 and Act 5, Scene 2 now form one continuous piece. Additionally, numerous lines were cut from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include; in Act 1, Scene 1, absent are Bedford's references to children crying and England becoming a marsh since Henry V died: [...] "Posterity await for wretched years/When, at their mothers' moistened eyes, babes shall suck,/Our isle be made a marish of salt tears,/And none but women left to wail the dead." [...] (ll.48–51). In Act 1, Scene 2, Alençon's praise of the resoluteness of the English army is absent: [...] "Froissart, a countryman of ours, records/England all Olivers and Rolands bred/During the time Edward the Third did reign./More truly now may this be verified,/For none by Samsons and Goliases/It sendeth forth to skirmish." [...] (ll.29–34). In Act 1, Scene 3, some of the dialogue between Gloucester and Winchester outside the Tower is absent (ll.36–43), whilst in Act 1, Scene 5, so too is Talbot's complaint about the French wanting to ransom him for a prisoner of less worth: [...] "But with a baser man-of-arms by far,/Once in contempt they would have bartered me—/Which I, disdaining, scorned, and crav'd death/Rather than I would be so vile-esteemed" [...] (ll.8–11). In Act 1, Scene 7, some of Charles' praise of Joan is absent: [...] "A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear/Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was./In memory of her, when she is dead,/Her ashes, in an urn more precious/Than the rich-jewelled coffer of Darius,/Transported shall be at high festivals/Before the kings and queens of France" [...] (ll.21–27). In Act 3, Scene 1, some of Warwick’s attack on Winchester is absent: [...] "You see what mischief – and what murder too –/Hath been enacted through your enmity" [...] (ll.27–28). In Act 4, Scene 6, some of the dialogue between Talbot and John has been removed (ll.6–25). The most interesting omissions come in Act 4, Scene 7. In this scene, twelve of Joan's sixteen lines have been cut; the entire seven line speech where she <b>says</b> <b>John</b> Talbot refused to fight her {{because she is a}} woman (ll.37–43); the first three lines of her five line mockery of Lucy's listing of Talbot's titles, [...] "Here's a silly, stately style indeed./The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath,/Writes not so tedious a style as this" [...] (ll.72–75); and the first two lines of her four line speech where she mocks Lucy, [...] "I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,/He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit" [...] (ll.86–88). These omissions reduce Joan's role in this scene to a virtual spectator, and coupled with this, Brenda Blethyn portrays the character as if deeply troubled by something (presumably the loss of contact with her 'fiends').|$|E
