50|$|Having shipyards {{that have}} been {{operational}} {{for a long time}} could lead to serious pollution to the environment as years pass by. There have been many different studies that have shown that welding, sandblasting, paint, and maintenance are some of the many factors that contribute pollution to the environment. It is common for a ship to have a hull made of steel, but this process must go through many layers of anti-fouling or anti-corrosion paint to ensure that the metal doesn't corrode and prevent organisms from attaching to the surface. The painting process is inevitable but will it be at nearly every shipyard there is, and two of the most common ways to paint a ship is by airtight spraying and thermal spraying. Many studies have shown that painting is what generates almost half dangerous waste at a shipyard due to using high-pressure equipment to wash or remove any unwanted material that is on it like rust. Which will eventually make its way to the water and creates water pollution to the environment. Once these have compromised the surface of the hull the ship must go to the shipyard for maintenance. In a study in 2011 samples of sediments were collected from two sites in coastal marine area of Yongho Bay, one from the shipyard yard and the other 500m away. These results had analyzed that both samples contained metals that included Al, Fe, Li, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sn, and Pb. In addition, it had been confirmed that the concentration was higher in the first sample that was by the shipyard then the <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> 500m away and was due to paint fragments applied to the steel ship hulls.|$|E

Tyrimo uždaviniai: 1. Išanalizuoti pieno supirkimo taisykles. 2. Atlikti mėginio ėmimo auditą supirkimo įmonėse: stebėti pieno supirkėjų darbą (pieno mėginio ėmimą, lydraščių pildymą, konteinerių plombavimą ir kt.). 3. Atlikti mėginio ėmimo procedūros pažeidimų analizę. Apibendrinant galima pasakyti, kad imant mėginius nesilaikoma pieno supirkimo taisyklių, jos grubiai pažeidžiamos. Taip pat nesilaikoma Reglamento 853 / 2004 nuostatų dėl higienos sąlygų punktuose. Išvados: 1. Pieno supirkimo taisyklės beveik kiekvienais metais tobulinamos įtraukiant naujų punktų, keičiamos naujomis nuostatomis, tačiau apsilankius supirkimo punktuose nustatyta, kad šių taisyklių nesilaiko 54 proc. supirkėjų. Todėl būtina griežčiau kontroliuoti, arba taisyklės turi būti pakoreguotos, pritaikytos realiam darbui, kad jomis praktiškai būtų galima vadovautis. 2. Atliekant auditą, stebint, kaip įvairiems kodams imami mėginiai, pagrindiniai pažeidimai būtų: - Pienas pernelyg trumpai maišomas (tai ypač svarbu pirmam kodui). - Netiriami pirminiai kokybės rodikliai (kvapas ir išvaizda iš visų priimtų mėginių). - Netinkamai laikomi konservantai (blogėja jų kokybė), tai pat konservuoti mėginiai netinkamai laikomi, nededami į šaldytuvus. - Nardinančioji maišyklė nardinama labai greitai, netolygiai, neteisingai maišoma, todėl paimamas nereprezentatyvus mėginys su mažesniu riebalų kiekiu. - Pieno mėginių ėmimo priemonės po panaudojimo nedezinfekuojamos. - Nesilaikoma higienos punktuose. 3. Atliekant mėginio ėmimo procedūros pažeidimų analizę galima teigti, kad pieno perdirbėjai neaprūpina pieno punktų reikiamomis priemonėmis, nepakeičia senų atgyvenusių priemonių naujais moderniais, nepaisoma pagrindinių pieno supirkimo taisyklių nuostatų, supirkėjams trūksta kvalifikacijos, jie nėra tinkamai supažindinti su supirkimo taisyklėmis ir higienos reglamento nuostatomis. The aim {{of study}} – To analyze milk {{purchase}} process (according to milk purchase rules), and summarize {{information about the}} most commonly made violations {{during the process of}} the milk <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> and sending to a laboratory. Tasks of work: 1. To analyze the raw milk purchase regulations. 2. Carry out the audit of milk <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> process in appropriate plants: to monitor milk collectors work process (milk sampling, filling in leading documents, sealing of containers, etc.). 3. To analyze milk <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> process violations. Research took place in 16 odd milk collection stations across Lithuania. Milk collection stations in main companies, like UAB “Žemaitijos pienas”, “Pieno Upes” “Pieno Zvaigzdes” were chosen for the research. To follow the milk analysis were chosen 16 stations, that were taken for the thorough research (it was watched 130 of the sampling). To ensure confidentiality, the milk collecting stations were coded A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P milk collecting stations were monitored by code: - Audit of <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> code 1; - Audit of <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> code 2; - Audit of <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> code 3; - Audit of <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> code 4 Milk sampling audit was carried out in accordance with Lithuanian Republic legislation act 853 / 2004. During the audit we were also monitoring hygiene conditions in accordance with Regulation 853 / 2004. Special audit dedicated questionnaire was used as research method, also during the audit following points were monitored: testing of the primary milk quality indicators, the color of milk, milk smell, consistency of milk, milk temperature, taste, acidity, purity, density, sampling means cleanliness, <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> devices disinfection, milk mixing length (time wise), the milk sample movement during the <b>sample</b> <b>taking,</b> immersion mixer plunge, milk preservation time, conditions of preservatives storing, milk samples placing to the containers, storage of preserved samples, dispatch period of samples, accompanying paperwork filling in and sealing of containers. Conclusions: 1. Milk purchasing rules are been changed almost every year, improving them, including new regulations and rules, replacing elements already out of date, but after a visit to purchase stations, it was found that 54 percent. purchasers do not comply with the rules. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly control, or rules should be adjusted, adapted to the actual work, that they can be practically followed. 2. During audit, whilst monitoring <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> in accordance with different codes, the main violations noticed would be: - The period milk is been stirred too short (this is particularly important for the first code). - Primary milk quality indicators are not been investigated (53 % of the odor, color, 28 %, 38 % acidity, purity 76 % of total samples taken). - Preservatives as well as preserved milk samples are been stored incorrectly, not been placed to refrigerators (which negatively affects their quality). - Immersion mixer is been plunged too quickly, irregularly, mixing incorrectly, therefore the taken sample does not represent lower fat content milk sample the way it should. -Milk sampling tools are not being disinfected after use. - Failure to comply with hygiene requirements at stations. 3. Analyzing violations of milk <b>sample</b> <b>taking</b> procedure, one came to conclusion that the milk manufacturers are not providing milk purchase stations with necessary equipment, do not replace the old/ outdated equipment to up to standard/ modern one, basic milk purchase rules are being constantly ignored, milk collectors are mostly lacking required qualifications, they are not properly made aware of milk purchase the rules and Hygiene Regulations. Recommendations: 1. Milk processors often audit their existing buying items, to familiarize them with the changing elements, frequent milk collectors training. 2. State Food and Veterinary Authority should more closely examine and issue a qualification certificate. State Food and Veterinary Authority should be more active in audit points. 3. Dairy producers themselves should be more interested in buying dairy rules as to prevent arbitrary action by purchasers of milk...|$|E
