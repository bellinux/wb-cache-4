25|$|The CAB {{primarily}} {{attributed the}} crash {{to the failure}} of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach,</b> but he did so much closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish two-way communication to obtain a landing clearance. If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach</b> {{as if he had been}} properly cleared to land. Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the wind}} was calm, Cali's {{controllers}} asked the pilots whether they wanted to fly a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach</b> to runway 19 rather than coming around to runway 01. The pilots agreed, hoping to make up some time. The pilots then erroneously cleared the approach waypoints from their navigation computer. When the controller asked the pilots to check back in over Tulu√°, north of Cali, {{it was no longer}} programmed into the computer, and so they had to pull out their maps to find it. In the meantime, they extended the aircraft's speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} pilot scan {{behavior}} of both advanced cockpit and advanced manuevers was assessed. A series of straight-in and curved landing approaches were {{performed in the}} Terminal Configured Vehicle (TCV) simulator. Two comparisons of pilot scan behavior were made: (1) pilot scan behavior for <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> compared with scan behavior previously obtained in a conventionally equipped simulator, and (2) pilot scan behavior for <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> compared with scan behavior for curved approaches. The results indicate very similar scanning patterns during the <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> in the conventional and advanced cockpits. However, for the curved approaches pilot attention shifted to the electronic horizontal situation display (moving map), and a new eye scan path appeared between the map and the airspeed indicator. The very high dwell percentage and dwell times on the electronic displays in the TCV simulator during the final portions of the approaches suggest that the electronic attitude direction indicator was well designed for these landing approaches...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{benefits}} of TLS {{is the ability to}} provide precision ILS guidance where terrain is sloping or uneven, reflections can create an uneven glide path for ILS causing unwanted needle deflections. Additionally, since the ILS signals are pointed in one direction by the positioning of the arrays, ILS only supports <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches.</b> TLS supports approach over rough terrain and provides the ability to offset the approach center-line.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{standard}} airport landing pattern, {{which is usually}} used under visual meteorological conditions (VMC), aircraft turn from base leg to final within one-half to two miles of the airport. For instrument approaches, as well as approaches into a controlled airfield under visual flight rules (VFR), often a [...] "straight-in" [...] final approach is used, where all the other legs are dispensed with. <b>Straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> are discouraged at non-towered airports in the US.|$|R

50|$|Alternatives to the {{overhead}} join are to directly join the circuit by entering at a suitable corner, or a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach.</b> If available, ATC will {{negotiate with the}} pilot {{which is the most}} appropriate method according to the current traffic situation.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a piloted {{simulation}} experiment to evaluate the effect of integrating flight path angle information into a typical transport electronic attitude director indicator display format for flight director instrument landing system approaches are presented.

40|$|The {{results of}} a flight {{evaluation}} of two electronic display formats for the approach to landing under instrument conditions are presented. The evaluation was conducted for a base-line electronic display format and for the same format with runway symbology and track information added. The evaluation was conducted during 3 deg, manual <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> with and without initial localizer offsets.

40|$|The {{results of}} a piloted-simulation {{evaluation}} {{of the benefits of}} adding runway symbology and track information to a baseline electronic-attitude-director-indicator (EADI) format for the approach-to-landing task were presented. The evaluation was conducted for the baseline format and for the baseline format with the added symbology during 3 deg <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> with calm, cross-wind, and turbulence conditions. Flight-path performance data and pilot subjective comments were examined with regard to the pilot's tracking performance and mental workload for both display formats. The results show that the addition of a perspective runway image and relative track information to a basic situation-information EADI format improve the tracking performance both laterally and vertically during an approach-to-landing task and that the mental workload required to assess the approach situation was thus reduced as a result of integration of information...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort is to determine IFR approach path and touchdown dispersions for manual and automatic XV- 15 tilt rotor landings, and to develop missed approach criteria. Only helicopter mode XV- 15 operation is considered. The analysis and design sections develop the automatic and flight director guidance equations for decelerating curved and <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> into a typical VTOL landing site equipped with an MLS navigation aid. These system designs satisfy all known pilot-centered, guidance and control requirements for this flying task. Performance data, obtained from nonstationary covariance propagation dispersion analysis for the system, are used to develop the approach monitoring criteria. The autoland and flight director guidance equations are programmed for the VSTOLAND 1819 B digital computer. The system design dispersion data developed through analysis and the 1819 B digital computer program are verified and refined using the fixed-base, man-in-the-loop XV- 15 VSTOLAND simulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{display that}} takes {{advantage}} of the threedimensional positioning data available from differential GPS has been flight tested on a general aviation aircraft. This glass-cockpit instrument provides a natural, "out the window" view of the world, making the horizon, runway, and desired flight path visible to the pilot in instrument flight conditions. The flight path is depicted as a series of symbols through which the pilot flies the airplane. Altitude, heading, and airspeed are presented along with lateral and vertical glidepath deviations. Particular Presented at ION GPS- 95, Palm Springs, California, USA, September 12 - 15, 1995. attention was given to demonstrating a system satisfying the budget, power, and form-factor constraints of light aircraft. Simulator tests and flight trials on a Piper Dakota aircraft showed that the tunnel display allows the pilot to hand fly <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> with equivalent or better flight technical error than with a typical Instrument Landing System [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|On October 22, 1975, an Aeroflot Yak-40 (CCCP-87458) crashed near Novgorod Airport. Visibility {{was poor}} at Novgorod due to fog, {{but this was}} not {{forecast}} to the crew. A <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach</b> was attempted, but the aircraft went off course after passing the outer marker. The descent continued until the landing gear and wing struck a building and later crashed into an apartment building and a car, killing all six on board and five on the ground.|$|E
50|$|It is {{very common}} for a circle-to-land {{maneuver}} to be executed during a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach</b> to a different runway, e.g., an ILS approach to one runway, followed by a low-altitude transition, ending in a landing on another (not necessarily parallel) runway. This way, approach procedures to one runway {{can be used to}} land on any runway at the airport, as the other runways might lack instrument procedures or their approaches cannot be used for other reasons (traffic considerations, navigation aids being out of service, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|On February 27, 1974, a Soviet Antonov An-24LR [...] "Toros" [...] (CCCP-47195) ice {{reconnaissance}} aircraft landed at Gambell Airport, Alaska. The plane, carrying three crew members and twelve scientists, {{was en route}} to Anadyr. Due to strong winds, the pilot decided to divert to Provideniya, which was fogged in. The aircraft was low on fuel, so the crew chose to divert to Gambell, located 62 miles southeast of Provideniya.

40|$|Head-Worn Displays or so-called, near-to-eye {{displays}} have potentially significant {{advantages in}} terms of cost, overcoming cockpit space constraints, and for the display of spatially-integrated information. However, many technical issues need to be overcome before these technologies can be successfully introduced into commercial aircraft cockpits. The results of three activities are reported. First, the near-to-eye display design, technological, and human factors issues are described and a literature review is presented. Second, {{the results of a}} fixed-base piloted simulation, investigating the impact of near to eye displays on both operational and visual performance is reported. <b>Straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> were flown in simulated visual and instrument conditions while using either a biocular or a monocular display placed on either the dominant or non-dominant eye. The pilot's flight performance, visual acuity, and ability to detect unsafe conditions on the runway were tested.

50|$|The flight {{took off}} for Buenos Aires at 9:11 local time. The flight was uneventful until final approach. At 10:42, the flight was cleared to land at Runway 13 of Aeroparque Jorge Newbery. Visibility was reducing, and {{eventually}} the pilots {{lost sight of the}} runway and aborted the landing. The flight then conducted a go-around and started its second approach. When approaching the NDB, the flight was cleared to hold at 600 metres due to a cumulonimbus cloud ahead. They were then cleared for a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach</b> to Runway 31. Shortly after, the crew lost control of the plane and it crashed into a river. All 26 passengers and five crew were killed in the disaster.|$|E
50|$|The tower {{controllers}} on duty {{that day}} at National testified that the P-38 had taken off on Runway 3, turned left north of The Pentagon, circled over Arlington, then returned, requesting permission to land due to engine trouble. The controller cleared the aircraft to join the left traffic pattern, but instead it flew south of the airport and entered a long <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach</b> {{at the same time}} Flight 537 was turning onto a shorter final. The controller then called Flight 537 ordering it to turn left; it began the turn, but by then the P-38, being considerably faster than a DC-4 on final, overtook the aircraft 1/2 mile southwest of the threshold of Runway 3.|$|E
50|$|With the {{addition}} of GPS-based navigation, <b>straight-in</b> RNAV (GPS) <b>approaches</b> were added for runways 3 and 21. These approaches have slightly lower minima than the VOR-A. Aircraft in categories C and above are still NA. For details, check current approach charts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a flight evaluation of two electronic display formats for the approach-to-landing under instrument conditions. The evaluation was conducted for a baseline electronic display format and for the same format with runway symbology and track information added; its evaluation was conducted during 3 -deg manual <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches</b> with and without initial localizer offsets. Flight-path tracking performance data and pilot subjective comments were examined with regard to pilot's ability to capture and maintain the localizer and glide slope using both display fomats. The results of the flight tests agree with earlier simulation results and show that {{the addition of a}} perspective runway symbol with an extended centerline and relative track information to a baseline electronic display format improved both lateral and vertical flight-path tracking. Pilot comments indicated that the mental workload required to assess the approach situation was reduced as a result of integrating the perspective runway with extended centerline along with relative track information into the vertical situation display. The limited flight-test results also show that the flight-path performance with the integrated situation display format meets Category II Flight-Director performance criteria...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of Black Friday, Tunner instituted {{a number of new}} rules; {{instrument}} flight rules (IFR) would be in effect at all times, regardless of actual visibility, and each sortie would have only one chance to land in Berlin, returning to its air base if it missed its approach, where it was slotted back into the flow. Stacking was completely eliminated, and with <b>straight-in</b> <b>approaches,</b> the planners found that in the time it once took to unstack and land nine aircraft, 30 could be landed bringing in 300 tons. Accident rates and delays dropped immediately. Another decision was made when it was realised that it took just as long to unload a 3.5-ton C-47 as a 10-ton C-54. One of the reasons for this was the sloping cargo floor of the [...] "taildragger" [...] C-47s, which made truck loading difficult. The tricycle geared C-54's cargo deck was level, so that a truck could back up to it and offload cargo quickly. Tunner decided, as he had done during the Hump operation, to replace all C-47s in the airlift with C-54s or larger aircraft, which went into full effect after 28 September 1948.|$|R
50|$|Incident {{data shows}} that the {{greatest}} potential for a wake vortex incident occurs when a light aircraft is turning from base to final behind a heavy aircraft flying a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach.</b> Light aircraft pilots must use extreme caution and intercept their final approach path above or well behind the heavier aircraft's path. When a visual approach following a preceding aircraft is issued and accepted, the pilot is required to establish a safe landing interval behind the aircraft he was instructed to follow. The pilot is responsible for wake turbulence separation. Pilots must not decrease the separation that existed when the visual approach was issued unless they can remain on or above the flight path of the preceding aircraft. Having a higher approach path and touching down further along the runway than the previous aircraft will help avoid wake turbulence.|$|E
50|$|Some {{approach}} procedures do {{not permit}} straight-in approaches unless the pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a procedure turn (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or final approach segment. When conducting any type of approach, if the aircraft is not lined up for a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach,</b> then a course reversal might be necessary. The idea of a course reversal is to allow sufficiently large changes in the course flown (in order to line the aircraft up with the final approach course), without taking too much space horizontally and while remaining {{within the confines of}} protected airspace. This is accomplished in one of three ways: a procedure turn, a holding pattern, or a teardrop course reversal.|$|E
5000|$|The West Kootenay Regional Airport, (Castlegar Airport) [...] {{is a small}} {{regional}} airport located [...] south southeast of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada. It is {{owned and operated by}} the City of Castlegar, and has a 15317 sq ft passenger terminal. Due to the mountainous terrain impinging on both runway approaches, there is no possibility of a <b>straight-in</b> <b>approach.</b> The airport is therefore certified for day operations only, and the glideslope on approach is set to a steep 5.0¬∞ rather than the standard 3.0¬∞. The instrument approaches to Castlegar are considered among the most challenging of any in use at a commercial airport in North America. As of 2011, the Dash-8s serving the airport required minimums of 3400 foot cloud ceilings and three miles visibility (Air Canada Jazz adds 100 feet and one mile to these minimums).|$|E
