2500|$|Once activated, osteoclasts move {{to areas}} of microfracture {{in the bone}} by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called Howship's lacunae, formed from the {{digestion}} of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. <b>Sealing</b> <b>zones</b> are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis. [...] Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted {{in the prevention of}} osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. These enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin K is of most importance.|$|E
40|$|Bone {{digestion}} {{occurs when}} osteoclasts adhere onto bone surfaces and polarize to form acidic, hydrolase-rich resorption lacunae. For this process, they condense their actin-rich podosomes in tight belts to establish <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> which segregate their basal membranes from those facing resorption lacunae. This polarization process remains poorly understood. Here, we combined quantitative proteomics and gene silencing to identify new substrates of the Src tyrosine kinase, a key regulator of osteoclast function. We now report that a {{depletion of the}} ARF GTPase-activating protein GIT 2, which localizes to <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> upon Src phosphorylation, {{or a lack of}} GTP hydrolysis on ARF 6 impairs sealing zone formation and polarized membrane traffic. Surprisingly, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors α and β PIX, which usually coordinate ARF and Rho signaling, were found to be dispensable. We conclude that the Src-dependent localization of GIT 2 is essential for down-regulating ARF 6 activity at <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> and thus for maintaining osteoclast polarity...|$|E

40|$|Osteoclasts resorb bone {{through the}} {{formation}} of a unique attachment structure called the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone.</b> In this study, a role for thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 6 (TRIP 6) in <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> formation and osteoclast activity was examined. TRIP 6 was shown to reside in the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> through its association with tropomyosin 4, an actin-binding protein that regulates sealing dimensions and bone resorptive capacity. Suppression of TRIP 6 in mature osteoclasts by RNA interference altered <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> dimensions and inhibited bone resorption, whereas overexpression of TRIP 6 increased the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> perimeter and enhanced bone resorption. Treatment of osteoclasts with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which phosphorylates TRIP 6 at tyrosine 55 through a c-Src-dependent mechanism, caused increased association of TRIP 6 with the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone,</b> as did overexpression of a TRIP 6 cDNA bearing a phosphomimetic mutation at tyrosine 55. Further, LPA treatment caused increases in osteoclast fusion, <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> perimeter, and bone resorptive capacity. In contrast, overexpression of TRIP 6 containing a nonphosphorylatable amino acid residue at position 55 severely diminished <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> formation and bone resorption and suppressed the effects of LPA on the cytoskeleton. LPA effects were mediated through its receptor isoform LPA(2), as indicated by treatments with receptor-specific agonists and antagonists. Thus, these studies suggest that TRIP 6 is a critical downstream regulator of c-Src signaling and that its phosphorylation is permissive for its presence in the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> where it plays a positive role in osteoclast bone resorptive capacity...|$|R

40|$|Osteoclasts use actin-rich {{attachment}} {{structures in}} place of focal adhesions for adherence to bone and non-bone substrates. On glass, osteoclasts generate podosomes, foot-like processes containing a core of F-actin and regulatory proteins that undergo high turnover. To facilitate bone resorption, osteoclasts generate an actin-rich sealing zone composed of densely packed podosome-like units. Patterning of both podosomes and <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> is dependent upon an intact microtubule system. A role for unconventional myosin X (Myo 10), which can bind actin, microtubules, and integrins, was examined in osteoclasts. Immunolocalization showed Myo 10 {{to be associated with}} the outer edges of immature podosome rings and <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> suggesting a possible role in podosome and sealing zone positioning. Further, complexes containing both Myo 10 and β-tubulin were readily precipitated from osteoclasts lysates. RNAi-mediated suppression of Myo 10 led to decreased cell and sealing zone perimeter, along with decreased motility and resorptive capacity. Further, siRNA-treated cells could not properly position podosomes following microtubule disruption. Osteoclasts overexpressing dominant negative Myo 10 microtubule binding domains (MyTH 4) showed a similar phenotype. Conversely, overexpression of full-length Myo 10 led to increased formation of podosome belts along with larger <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> and enhanced bone resorptive capacity. These studies suggest that Myo 10 plays a role in osteoclast attachment and podosome positioning by direct linkage of actin to the microtubule network...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{resorption}} in vertebrates {{relies on}} the ability of osteoclasts to assemble F-actin-rich podosomes that condense into podosomal belts, forming <b>sealing</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Sealing</b> <b>zones</b> segregate bone-facing ruffled membranes from other membrane domains, and disassemble when osteoclasts migrate to new areas. How podosome/sealing zone dynamics is regulated remains unknown. We illustrate the essential role of the membrane scaffolding F-BAR-Proline-Serine-Threonine Phosphatase Interacting Proteins (PSTPIP) 1 and 2 in this process. Whereas PSTPIP 2 regulates podosome assembly, PSTPIP 1 regulates their disassembly. PSTPIP 1 recruits, through its F-BAR domain, the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN 6) that de-phosphophorylates the phosphatidylinositol 5 -phosphatases SHIP 1 / 2 bound to the SH 3 domain of PSTPIP 1. Depletion of any component of this complex prevents sealing zone disassembly and increases osteoclast activity. Thus, our results illustrate the importance of BAR domain proteins in podosome structure and dynamics, and identify a new PSTPIP 1 /PTPN 6 /SHIP 1 / 2 -dependent negative feedback mechanism that counterbalances Src and PI(3, 4, 5) P 3 signalling to control osteoclast cell polarity and activity during bone resorption...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} dynamic {{changes in}} aortoiliac dimensions using dynamic electrocardiographically (ECG) -gated computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and to investigate any potential impact on preoperative endograft sizing {{in relation to}} observer variability. METHODS: Dynamic ECG-gated CTA was performed in 18 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Postprocessing resulted in 11 datasets per patient: 1 static CTA and 10 dynamic CTA series. Vessel diameter, length, and angulation were measured for all phases of the cardiac cycle. The differences between diastolic and systolic aneurysm dimensions were analyzed for significance using paired t tests. To assess intraobserver variability, 20 randomly selected datasets were analyzed twice. Intraobserver repeatability coefficients (RC) were calculated using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Mean aortic diameter at the proximal neck was 21. 4 +/- 3. 0 mm at diastole and 23. 2 +/- 2. 9 mm at systole, a mean increase of 1. 8 +/- 0. 4 mm (8. 5 %, p< 0. 01). The RC for the aortic diameter {{at the level of}} the proximal aneurysm neck was 1. 9 mm (8. 9 %). At the distal <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> the mean increase in diameter was 1. 7 +/- 0. 3 mm (14. 1 %, p< 0. 01) for the right and 1. 8 +/- 0. 5 mm (14. 2 %, p< 0. 01) for the left common iliac artery (CIA). At both distal <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> the mean increase in CIA diameter exceeded the RC (10. 0 % for the right CIA and 12. 6 % for the left CIA). CONCLUSION: The observed changes in aneurysm dimension during the cardiac cycle are small and in the range of intraobserver variability, so dynamic changes in proximal aneurysm neck diameter and aneurysm length likely have little impact on preoperative endograft selection. However, changes in diameter at the distal <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> may be relevant to sizing, so distal oversizing of up to 20 % should be considered to prevent distal type I endoleak...|$|E

40|$|Bone {{degradation}} by osteoclasts {{depends on}} {{the formation of a}} <b>sealing</b> <b>zone,</b> composed of an interlinked network of podosomes, which delimits the degradation lacuna into which osteoclasts secrete acid and proteolytic enzymes. For resorption to occur, the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> must be coherent and stable for extended periods of time. Using titanium roughness gradients ranging from 1 to 4. 5 µm Ra as substrates for osteoclast adhesion, we show that microtopographic obstacles of a length scale well beyond the range of the ‘footprint’ of an individual podosome can slow down sealing-zone expansion. A clear inverse correlation was found between ring stability, structural integrity and sealing-zone translocation rate. Direct live-cell microscopy indicated that the expansion of the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> is locally arrested by steep, three-dimensional ‘ridge-like barriers’, running parallel to its perimeter. It was, however, also evident that the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> can bypass such obstacles, if pulled by neighbouring regions, extending through flanking, obstacle-free areas. We propose that sealing-zone dynamics, while being locally regulated by surface roughness, are globally integrated via the associated actin cytoskeleton. The effect of substrate roughness on osteoclast behaviour is significant in relation to osteoclast function under physiological and pathological conditions, and may constitute an important consideration in the design of advanced bone replacements...|$|R

40|$|Endovascular success depends heavily upon {{anatomical}} suitability for secure graft placement. Common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms frequently extend {{close to}} the iliac bifurcation, requiring distal fixation in the external iliac artery (EIA), in turn excluding the internal iliac artery (IIA). The preservation of circulation {{to at least one}} IIA artery is highly recommended. We report an endovascular technique for complete preservation of the hypogastric arteries of an aorto-iliac aneurysm extending into the iliac bifurcation and hypogastric artery. A left CIA aneurysm involving the iliac bifurcation was excluded with a covered Fluency stent-graft (Bard Inc., New Jersey, USA) deployed from the EIA into the IIA followed by the internal deployment of a Luminex uncovered stent (Bard Inc.) extended into one branch of the hypograstric artery. IVUS evaluation was essential in determining precise aneurysm and sealing zone measurements. Complete preservation of hypogastric circulation was achieved. The placement of the uncovered stent effectively extended the <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> without covering either of the hypogastric distal branches and concurrently corrected the Fluency stent kinking due to severe arterial tortuosity. In CIA aneurysms involving the IIA, an uncovered stent can extend the <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> whilst maintaining complete preservation of pelvic circulation and offers support to the covered stent-graft.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the natural history}} of dilated common iliac arteries (CIA) exposed to pulsatile blood flow after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the suitability of ectatic iliac arteries as <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> using flared iliac limbs. Methods: Follow-up computed tomograms of 102 CIAs in 60 EVAR patients were investigated. Diameter changes in CIAs # 16 mm (group 1) were compared with changes in vessels where a dilated segment. 16 mm in diameter continued to be exposed to pulsatile blood flow (group 2). Within group 2, cases in which the stent terminated proximal to the dilated artery segment (2 a) were compared with those that had been treated with a flared limb (2 b). Results: The mean CIA diameter increased by 1. 061. 0 mm in group 1 (p, 0. 001 versus immediately after EVAR) and by 1. 561. 7 mm in group 2 (p, 0. 001 versus immediately after EVAR) within an average follow-up of 43. 6618. 0 months. Diameter increase was more pronounced in dilated CIAs (p 50. 048), and it was not significantly different between groups 2 a and 2 b (p 50. 188). No late distal type I endoleak or stent-graft migration associated with CIA ectasia was observed. Conclusion: Dilatation of the CIA is significant after EVAR, and it is more pronounced in ectatic iliac arteries.

40|$|Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated {{cells of}} the monocyte-macrophage lineage that {{generate}} specialized substrate adhesion complexes to facilitate their function as bone-degrading cells. The patterning and function of these actin-based complexes, podosomes and <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> are regulated by the small GTPase Rho. Myosin IXB (Myo 9 b) is a unique actin-based motor protein that contains a RhoGAP domain, which, like other RhoGAPs, is inhibitory to Rho signaling. In this study, Myo 9 b is shown to be expressed in osteoclasts and act as a critical regulator of podosome patterning and osteoclast function. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of Myo 9 b results in increased activity of Rho but not Rac in osteoclasts. Knockdown in osteoclasts on glass results in altered podosome patterning and decreased motility, and this effect is reversed by addition of a Rho inhibitor. SiRNA-mediated suppression of Myo 9 b expression in osteoclasts on bone results in a dramatic loss of resorptive capacity even though <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> appear normal. This loss of resorption is also reversible with addition of a Rho inhibitor. Cells with diminished Myo 9 b levels display mislocalization and suppressed activation of Src, a tyrosine kinase with critical effects on osteoclast actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and function.

40|$|Bone {{homeostasis}} {{is maintained}} by osteoblasts (bone formation) and osteoclasts (bone resorption). While {{there have been}} numerous studies investigating mesenchymal stem cells and their potential to differentiate into osteoblasts as well as their interaction with different bone substitute materials, there is only limited knowledge concerning in vitro generated osteoclasts. Due to the increasing development of degradable bone-grafting materials and the need of sophisticated in vitro test methods, it is essential to gain deeper insight into the process of osteoclastogenesis and the resorption functionality of human osteoclasts. Therefore, we focused on the comparison of osteoclastogenesis and resorption activity on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and bovine extracellular bone matrices (BMs). Cortical bone slices were used as two-dimensional (2 D) substrates, whereas a thermally treated cancellous bone matrix was used for three-dimensional (3 D) experiments. We isolated primary human monocytes and induced osteoclastogenesis by medium supplementation. Subsequently, the expression of the vitronectin receptor (V 3) and cathepsin K as well as the characteristic actin formation on TCPS and the two BMs were examined. The cell area of human osteoclasts was analyzed on TCPS and on BMs, whereas significantly larger osteoclasts could be detected on BMs. Additionally, we compared the diameter of the <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> with the measured diameter of the resorption pits on the BMs and revealed similar diameters of the <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> and the resorption pits. We conclude that using TCPS as culture substrate does not affect the expression of osteoclast-specific markers.

40|$|Osteoclasts, {{as well as}} preosteoclasts, show {{different}} adhesion {{features in}} relationship to the substrate on which cells are grown, i. e. the formation of either podosomes belt or <b>sealing</b> <b>zones.</b> Podosomes belt forms on non bone substrates, i. e. when cells interact with glass coverslips or culture plates, whereas <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> form when cells grow on bone-like substrates. Podosomes belt corresponds to numerous F-actin columns arranged at the cell periphery, whereas the sealing zone could be defined as a unique large band of actin [1]. In the study of bone resorption mechanisms, the employ of bone slices is not perfectly suitable to investigate actin rearrangement due to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction, since it doesn't allow to obtain high quality preparations to be examined both by light and electronmicroscopy (TEM and SEM). In particular, TEM preparation requires demineralization which could influence the chemical properties of either bone slices or bone-like composites. Moreover, the use of bone slices as scaffold, although extensive, doesn't allow ultrastructural details that are necessary in the study of mineral resorption by monocytes or preosteoclasts [2, 3].

An adequate proximal seal and fixation prevents complications such as endoleakage and stentgraft migration. Stentgrafts are most commonly sized on static computed tomographic (CT) images. However, {{as a result of}} cardiac contraction and aortic compliance the aorta exhibits pulsatile shape changes throughout the cardiac cycle. With the high speed acquisition of the current CT scanners, the sealing and fixation zones of the aorta are scanned within a fraction of the cardiac cycle. Images might be obtained in systole, diastole or anywhere in between. With ECG-synchronized imaging we visualized the aortic shape changes in the thoracic and abdominal aorta. We used ECG-synchronized CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan protocols, which, respectively, resulted in 8 and 16 images throughout the cardiac cycle. Subsequent image post-processing techniques allowed for quantification of the aortic distention and the asymmetry therein. In some patients with aortic aneurysms, diameter changes were over 10 % at relevant endograft <b>sealing</b> <b>zones.</b> In these patients endograft oversizing of 10 % might not be sufficient. Aortic distention at the endograft <b>sealing</b> <b>zones</b> might be a predictor for proximal neck problems and compromised endograft durability. After endografting of the thoracic aorta the pulsatile aortic distention was preserved and this may have serious consequences for endograft durability. We observed an asymmetric distention of the aorta. Endograft design should be able to adapt to and withstand this continuous and pulsatile asymmetric distention. The aorta of young healthy volunteers also exhibited an asymmetric pulsatile distention, with pronounced radius changes ranging from 14 % to 41 %. In general, the orientation of distention was anterior-posterior. There might be a relation between the direction of distention and development and localization of vascular pathology. A valuable non-invasive tool for future research into aortic distention, development and localization of vascular pathology is provided. In addition, we validated the concept of a new and fast method to measure post-operative aortic aneurysm volume on CTA data. Using this method we showed that volumetry is more sensitive for detecting aneurysm sac growth or shrinkage than diameter alone. Volume measurements should have a place in the follow-up after endovascular aneurysm repair...|$|E
40|$|Macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) is {{critical}} for osteoclast (OC) differentiation and is reported to enhance mature OC survival and motility. However, {{its role in the}} regulation of bone resorption, the main function of OCs, has not been well characterised. To address this we analysed short-term cultures of fully differentiated OCs derived from human colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophages (CFU-GM). When cultured on dentine, OC survival was enhanced by M-CSF but more effectively by receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL). Resorption was entirely dependent on the presence of RANKL. Co-treatment with M-CSF augmented RANKL-induced resorption in a concentration-dependent manner with a (200 – 300 %) stimulation at 25 ng/mL, an effect observed within 4 – 6 h. M-CSF co-treatment also increased number of resorption pits and F-actin <b>sealing</b> <b>zones,</b> but not the number of OCs or pit size, indicating stimulation of the proportion of OCs activated. M-CSF facilitated RANKL-induced activation of c-fos and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 phosphorylation, but not NFkB nor nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic- 1 (NFATc 1). The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor PD 98059 partially blocked augmentation of resorption by M-CSF. Our results reveal a previously unidentified role of M-CS...|$|E
40|$|Endoleaks {{combined}} with increasing sac size following endovascular aneurysm repair require reintervention to prevent secondary aneurysm rupture. For standard infrarenal stent grafts, {{there are multiple}} treatment strategies available. However, {{in the presence of}} a fenestrated or branched stent graft, options are limited. We describe a novel challenging approach to treat a persistent type Ia endoleak by placing a second fenestrated stent graft into the pre-existing one, thus, realigning the graft and extending the proximal <b>sealing</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} and theoretical {{results indicate that}} the keys to successful radial lip seals are the surface characteristics of the shaft and the microasperity pattern that develops due to wear on the elastomer. In this study, the lip seal was tested against five different patterns of shaft surface: plain stainless steel, triangular cavities oriented towards air, triangular cavities oriented towards oil, triangular cavities leading and triangular cavities lagging. Using Zygo optical profilometer and scanning electron microscope, a thorough surface characterization of the micro-asperities and micro-cavities is done on the lip seal elastomer. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the surface parameters of the final shaft surface and elastomer. Although both the surface characteristics of the shaft and the micro-asperities that develop on the elastomer <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> are responsible for a successful operation of the lip seal, the deterministic triangular micro-cavity patterns created on the shaft surface dominated the pumping direction with a large variability in the pumping rate. This variability is due to the elastomer wear in. This study also finds a significant correlation between the axial position of minimum roughness on the <b>sealing</b> <b>zone</b> of the elastomer and the pumpin...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 67 -year-old patient with an anatomically complex {{aneurysm}} of the aortic arch treated by fenestrated thoracic endovascular aortic repair with subclavian-carotid extrathoracic bypass. We used the Najuta thoracic stent graft, which was approved for use in January 2013 in Japan and successfully excluded the aneurysm. Our case shows that the Najuta stent graft procedure is a feasible treatment if open repair is unsuitable for cases of aortic arch aneurysm with a challenging compromised <b>seal</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|R
