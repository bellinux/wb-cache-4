25|$|The SI unit of area is {{the square}} metre, which is {{considered}} an <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of energy, the joule, {{is named}} after James Joule. He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop the {{absolute}} scale of temperature, which {{came to be called}} the Kelvin scale. Joule also made observations of magnetostriction, and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule's first law.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{electric}} potential is the volt (in honor of Alessandro Volta), {{which is why}} a difference in electric potential between two points is known as voltage. Older units are rarely used today. [...] Variants of the centimeter gram second system of units included {{a number of different}} units for electric potential, including the abvolt and the statvolt.|$|E
50|$|The SI {{includes}} {{two classes of}} units which are defined and agreed internationally. The first of these classes includes the seven SI base units for length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity and amount of substance. The second class consists of the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b> These <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> are {{defined in terms of}} the seven base units. All other quantities (e.g. work, force, power) are expressed in terms of <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> for the {{electric}} field are volts per meter, newtons per coulomb, or tesla meters per second.|$|R
50|$|The {{only way}} to express a nonstandard order of {{magnitude}} as an SI unit is to combine two prefixed <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> whose component base units cancel out; for example, units of 105 seconds could be expressed as kilojoules per centiwatt (kJ/cW) or hectocoulombs per milliampere (hC/mA). Such misuse of <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> can create a cognitive dissonance; to do so requires the invocation of units {{not directly related to}} the quantity being measured (coulombs and amperes, for example, quantify electricity, making it awkward to combine the two in a way that creates a unit of time with no electrical component).|$|R
2500|$|Electric {{charge is}} the {{physical}} property of matter that causes it {{to experience a}} force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There {{are two types of}} electric charges: positive and negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively). Like charges repel and unlike attract. An absence of net charge is referred to as [...] An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. The symbol Q often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.|$|E
5000|$|Metre {{per second}} squared, the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|Where ohm (...) is the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{electrical}} resistance.|$|E
50|$|The pascal can be {{expressed}} using <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units,</b> or alternatively solely SI base units, as:where N is the newton, m is the metre, kg is the kilogram, and s is the second.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> {{these are}} {{measured}} in lux (lx) or lumens per square metre (cd·sr·m−2). In the CGS system, {{the unit of}} illuminance is the phot, which is equal to [...] The foot-candle is a non-metric unit of illuminance that is used in photography.|$|R
5000|$|There are 7 SI base units. These are a {{coherent}} set of units defined to measure 7 basic physical properties: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela. The 7 SI base units {{are used to}} define all other SI units, which are known as <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sievert—The sievert (symbol: Sv) is the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of dose equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|... 3,600 m/h ≡ 1 m·s&minus;1, the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of speed, metre {{per second}} ...|$|E
50|$|The SI unit of area is {{the square}} metre, which is {{considered}} an <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The International System of Units (SI) {{specifies}} a set {{of seven}} base units from which all other SI units of measurement are <b>derived.</b> These <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> are either dimensionless, or can be expressed {{as a product of}} {{one or more of the}} base units, possibly scaled by an appropriate power of exponentiation.|$|R
50|$|There {{are further}} <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> related to {{catalytic}} activity, see the above reference for details.|$|R
5000|$|A careful {{distinction}} {{needs to}} be made between abstract quantities and measurable quantities. The multiplication and division rules of quantity calculus are applied to SI base units (which are measurable quantities) to define <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units,</b> including dimensionless <b>derived</b> <b>units,</b> such as the radian (rad) and steradian (sr) which are useful for clarity, although they are both algebraically equal to 1. Thus there is some disagreement about whether it is meaningful to multiply or divide units. Emerson suggests that if the units of a quantity are algebraically simplified, they then are no longer units of that quantity. Johansson proposes that there are logical flaws in the application of quantity calculus, and that the so-called dimensionless quantities should be understood as [...] "unitless quantities".|$|R
5000|$|The bar {{is defined}} using the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit,</b> pascal: [...] ≡ 100,000 Pa ≡ 100,000 N/m2.|$|E
50|$|Its <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> is {{the henry}} (the {{same as the}} unit of inductance, {{although}} the two concepts are distinct).|$|E
50|$|The logo of the Technische Hochschule is the Ω as a {{reference}} to Ohm the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> for electric resistance named after Georg Simon Ohm.|$|E
5000|$|The rad is a {{deprecated}} unit of absorbed radiation dose, {{defined as}} 1 rad = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg. It was originally defined in CGS units in 1953 as the dose causing 100 ergs {{of energy to}} be absorbed by one gram of matter. It {{has been replaced by}} the gray (Gy) in <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> but is still used in the United States, though [...] "strongly discouraged" [...] in the chapter 5.2 of style guide for U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology authors. A related unit, the roentgen, is used to quantify the radiation exposure. The F-factor can be used to convert between rads and roentgens.|$|R
5|$|The <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> in the <b>SI</b> {{are formed}} by powers, {{products}} or quotients {{of the base}} units and are unlimited in number. <b>Derived</b> <b>units</b> are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that {{is derived from the}} base quantities of time and length, so in <b>SI</b> the <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.|$|R
50|$|These {{changes will}} {{have the effect of}} redefining the SI base units, though the {{definitions}} of the <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> will remain the same.|$|R
5000|$|Many derived units do {{not have}} special names. For example, the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of area is the square metre (m2) and the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of density is the {{kilogram}} per cubic metre (kg/m3 or kg m−3). However, 22 derived units are recognized by the SI with special names, which are written in lowercase. However, the symbols for units named after persons, are always written with an uppercase initial letter. For example, the symbol for the hertz is [...] "Hz"; but the symbol for the metre is [...] "m".|$|E
50|$|The farad (symbol: F) is the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{electrical}} capacitance, {{the ability of}} a body to store an electrical charge. It is named after the English physicist Michael Faraday.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> is {{widespread}} for many applications. Residential electric power plans use kilowatt hours, The luminous flux emitted by an lamp is specified in lumens rather than candlepower.|$|E
25|$|Below the {{two most}} used moment {{equations}} are presented (in <b>SI</b> <b>units).</b> <b>Deriving</b> the moment equations from the Vlasov equation requires no assumptions about the distribution function.|$|R
5|$|These {{changes will}} {{have the effect of}} redefining the SI base units, though the {{definitions}} of the <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> in terms of the base units will remain the same.|$|R
5000|$|The candela {{per square}} metre (cd/m2) is the <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of luminance. The unit {{is based on}} the candela, the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity, and the square metre, the SI unit of area.|$|R
50|$|The siemens (symbol: S) is the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{electric}} conductance and admittance, {{also known as}} the mho (ohm spelled backwards, symbol is ℧); it is the reciprocal of resistance in ohms (Ω).|$|E
50|$|Metre squared {{per second}} or square {{meter per second}} is the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{kinematic}} viscosity and of specific relative angular momentum. The unit is written in symbols as m2/s or m2·s−1 or m2s−1.|$|E
50|$|The newton (symbol: N) is the International System of Units (<b>SI)</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of force. It {{is named}} after Isaac Newton in {{recognition}} of his work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's second law of motion.|$|E
50|$|Shear modulus' <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> is the pascal (Pa), {{although}} it is usually expressed in gigapascals (GPa) or in thousands of {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). Its dimensional form is M1L−1T−2, replacing force by mass times acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|The newton second (also newton-second, symbol Ns or N·s) is the <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of impulse. It is {{dimensionally}} {{equivalent to}} the momentum unit kilogram metre per second (kg·m/s). One newton second corresponds to a one-newton force applied for one second.|$|R
50|$|The metre {{per second}} squared is {{the unit of}} {{acceleration}} in the International System of <b>Units</b> (<b>SI).</b> As a <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> it is composed from the SI base units of length, the metre, and time, the second. Its symbol is written in several forms as m/s2, m·s−2 or m s−2, or less commonly, as m/s/s.|$|R
