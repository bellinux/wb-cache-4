40|$|The {{performance}} of Syrah grapevine under protected cultivation with different plastic films was evaluated during 2012 and 2013 seasons in South of Minas Gerais State. Agronomical and physiological measurements were done on {{eight years old}} grapevines, grafted onto &# 8216; 1103 Paulsen&# 8217; rootstock cultivated under uncovered conditions, covered with transparent and with diffuse plastic films. Both plastic covers induced the highest shoot growth rate and specific leaf area. The diffuse plastic induced greater differences on leaf area, pruning weight and leaf chlorophyll content as compared to uncovered vines. Grapevines under diffuse plastic also had the lowest rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration. Leaf <b>starch,</b> <b>glucose</b> and fructose <b>contents</b> were not affected by treatment, but leaf sucrose was reduced by transparent plastic. The leaf and stem water potential were higher under diffuse plastic. In 2013, grapevines under diffuse plastic showed the highest yields mainly due to decreased rot incidence and increased cluster weight. Furthermore, berries under diffuse plastic showed the highest anthocyanins concentration. The use of diffuse plastic induces more agronomical benefits to produce Syrah grape under protected cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Net {{ecosystem}} exchange (NEE), leaf {{gas exchange}} and biochemical traits were investigated in an irrigated maize crop grown under Mediterranean conditions. Sub-optimal irrigation water supply determined a drought stress {{during the early}} vegetative growth stage (45 – 49 days after swing) that decreased NEE. Drought, in the late vegetative stage, also caused a reduction of leaf gas exchange. In the latter period, proline, glycine and serine, as well as sucrose leaf contents increased, while <b>starch,</b> proteins and <b>glucose</b> <b>contents</b> decreased. In the early reproductive stage, the crop experienced a longer dry spell that induced a reduction in canopy {{as well as in}} leaf gas exchanges, while protein and free amino acid contents decreased with respect to the late vegetative stage. Both ecophysiological and biochemical data demonstrate a good capacity of cultivar Pioneer PR 32 D 99 to endure the environmental stress, related to Mediterranean summer drought, leading to an elevated dry matter yield at harvest. Photosynthetic apparatus appeared fairly resistant to soil water shortage due likely to the increased leaf content of organic solutes, such as amino acids and soluble sugars...|$|R
40|$|Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch {{concentrations}} were determined in leaves and inflorescences of protea cutflower cultivars soon after harvest {{and at the}} onset of leaf blackening while standing in water. At the onset of leaf blackening sugars and starch were lower in both inflorescences and leaves. Proportionately, sugars and starch decreased more in leaves than in inflorescences. Flower-bearing shoots of 'Sylvia' were pulsed individually with 5 % glucose solution until each shoot had taken up 10 mL solution. Water served for control treatment. Flowers were then stored for 21 days at 1 °C. After pulsing and after cold storage groups of flowering shoots were separated into inflorescence, leaf and stem components and <b>glucose</b> and <b>starch</b> <b>content</b> determined. <b>Glucose</b> <b>content,</b> determined upon completion of pulsing treatments, was significantly greater in all shoot components of shoots pulsed glucose compared with nonpulsed control shoots. <b>Glucose</b> <b>content</b> of leaves was significantly greater after storage for shoots pulsed than control shoots. Starch content of leaves determined upon completion of pulsing treatments was significantly greater in shoots pulsed with glucose than that of controls. There was a significant decrease in starch content for all tissue types during 21 days of storage. Pulsing flower stems of seven protea cultivars before 3 weeks cold storage significantly reduced the incidence of leaf blackening when assessed both on day 1, and again on day 7 after 3 weeks of cold storage.

40|$|The {{effect of}} low {{phosphate}} supply (low P) was determined on the diurnal {{changes in the}} rate of carbon export, and on the <b>contents</b> of <b>starch,</b> sucrose, <b>glucose,</b> and fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate (F 2, 6 BP) in leaves. Low-P effects on the activities of a number of enzymes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism were also measured. Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L. cv. F 58 - 554 H 1) were cultured hydroponically in growth chambers and the low-P treatment induced nutritionally. Low-P treatment decreased carbon export from the leaf much more than it decreased photosynthesis. At growth chamber photon flux density, low P decreased carbon export by 34 % in light; in darkness, export rates fell but more so in the control so that the average rate in darkness was higher in low-P leaves. Low P increased <b>starch,</b> sucrose, and <b>glucose</b> <b>contents</b> per leaf area, and decreased F 2, 6 BP. The total extractable activities of enzymes involved in starch and sucrose synthesis were increased markedly by low P, e. g. adenosine 5 -diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase, cytoplasmic fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, uridine 5 -diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase, and sucrose-phosphate synthase. The activities of some enzymes involved in starch and sucrose breakdown were also increased by low P. We propose that plants adapt to low-P environments by increasing the total activities of several phosphatases and by increasing the concentrations of phosphate-free carbon compounds at the expense of sugar phosphates, thereby conserving Pi. The partitioning of carbon among the various carbon pools in low-P adapted leaves appears to be determined in part by the relative capacities of the enzymes for starch and sucrose metabolism.
