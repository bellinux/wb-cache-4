5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E

In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners.

5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} {{did not have a}} right to occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying <b>social</b> <b>insurance,</b> so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.|$|E

This change, as part of the social protection of people, will positively influence the development of the medical insurance system.

40|$|Interest in the {{economic}} effects of Chinese trade unions has been growing recently. However, to date {{the limited number of}} studies in the literature only provide mixed results and suffer from some major conceptual and empirical limitations. In particular, the wage effect of Chinese unions is found significant in some studies, but insignificant in others. Yet, the available studies suggest significant and positive relationships between unionization and some types of mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> (though the types of <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> vary across the studies). Certainly, these findings shall be taken with caution due to the significant limitations of the data and analyses. But if the significant union effects are credible, we will have to face a puzzle: how does a non-representative union in an authoritarian country improve workers' welfare? This paper attempts to resolve this puzzle and give a better answer to the crucial and difficult question [...] what do unions do in China? Firstly, based on existing qualitative studies and the authors' multiple years of field research on grassroots union organizing and bargaining in China, this paper proposes a new theoretical explanation on the role of Chinese enterprise level trade unions and develop a set of hypotheses on union effects on wages, mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> and other legal labor rights, and non-mandatory fringe benefits. More specifically, we extend the traditional "transmission belt" role of Chinese trade unions in the command economy to the new market environment and propose a "triple intermediary" (an intermediary between the Party-State and workers, between management and workers, and between the Party-state and management) framework to study the effects of Chinese enterprise unions on workers. The hypotheses derived from this "triple intermediary" role of enterprise level unions are: H 1 : Chinese trade unions do not have a monopoly wage effect. H 2 : Chinese trade unions are associated with better compliances with mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> and other legal labor rights. H 3 : The union effects on mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> and other legal labor rights are contingent, varying for different types of social insurances/legal labor rights and different types of workers, and across different types of enterprises and regions. H 4 : Chinese trade unions are associated with more non-mandatory fringe benefits. H 5 : The union effects on non-mandatory fringe benefits are contingent, varying for (different types of fringe benefits) and different types of workers, and across different types of enterprises. H 6 : Unions with a stronger intermediary role between management and workers are associated with better compliance with mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> and other legal labor rights, as well as more non-mandatory fringe benefits. (H 7 : Unions with a stronger intermediary role between the Party-State and management are associated with better compliance with mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurances</b> and other legal labor rights, as well as more non-mandatory fringe benefits). Secondly, this paper tests these hypotheses (hypotheses in () are not tested by this study) by carefully analyzing two large datasets: one at the enterprise level and the other at the individual level. These analyses, by addressing some of the major limitations of the existing quantitative studies, provide more rigorous empirical results on the effects of Chinese enterprise trade unions on workers. Finally, our hypotheses are supported by the analytical results. We draw implications for the reform of Chinese trade unions and suggest the directions of future research...|$|R
