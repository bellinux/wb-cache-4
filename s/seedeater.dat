5000|$|A rare <b>seedeater</b> {{very similar}} to this species breeds in the Entre Ríos {{province}} of Argentina, and a few individuals {{have been found in}} Corrientes province and in southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, and southeastern Uruguay. [...] It has been listed as a separate species, Sporophila zelichi (Narosky 1977), the Entre Ríos, white-collared, Zelich's, or Narosky's <b>seedeater.</b> Differences are that it has a wide white collar {{all the way around the}} neck; the back is chestnut, not grey; and the rufous of the belly is darker than the marsh seedeater's. However, its status has been controversial since its discovery; some have suggested that it is a color morph of the marsh <b>seedeater</b> or the chestnut <b>seedeater,</b> or a hybrid between the two. The few recorded songs are the same as those of the marsh <b>seedeater.</b> Accordingly, the American Ornithologists' Union's South American Classification Committee voted in 2008 to remove S. zelichi from their list, with two voters favoring the suggestion that it is a morph of the marsh <b>seedeater.</b> [...] Following them, it is considered to belong to the marsh <b>seedeater</b> here.|$|E

40|$|The genus Sporophila (Cabanis, 1844) unites about 30 {{species of}} small <b>seedeaters</b> that {{predominantly}} inhabit open or semi-open {{areas in the}} Neotropical region. The taxonomy of this group is based on morphological studies from collected male specimens. The dynamic spatial and temporal variation in the male plumage and {{lack of knowledge of}} their vocalizations make it difficult to properly diagnose some species even today, so these two aspects account for the existing taxonomic dilemmas involving Sporophila. During a four-year field study, we investigated the natural history of a breeding population of Sporophila melanogaster (Pelzeln, 1870). This is an endemic species in Brazil, which reproduces in the high-altitude grasslands of the Atlantic Forest biome. We found four male specimens with clearly diagnosable plumage, distinct from the typical form of the species. Here we describe this previously unreported plumage form. Based on the evaluation of habitat use, vocalization, and reproductive behavior, we tested two hypotheses regarding its taxonomic status. We concluded that this is another case of an intra-specific color morph within the <b>seedeaters</b> of the "capuchinos" group...|$|R
