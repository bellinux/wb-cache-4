40|$|In part project 1 it transpired that oleyl {{sarcosinate}} {{stands out}} among the fatty amide carboxylic acids as a surfactant with excellent surface-active properties. A technical process was developed which involves transesterification of biodiesel by means of <b>sodium</b> <b>sarcosinate.</b> However, according to a rough cost estimate it is only at very large plant capacities that the process begins to become economically more efficient than the current state-of-the-art process, the Schotten-Baumann reaction with oleyl chloride. Moreover, the commercialisation of the developed manufacturing process may be frustrated by a patent that was filed by the Procter and Gamble company while the present project was still running. For these reasons the present studies on fatty amide carbonic acids were discontinued. Fatty amides with centrally located hydrophilic groups {{can be obtained by}} a reaction between epoxidised biodiesel or other epoxidised oils with any of various amines or amino acids. The product is a new type of surfactant including ones with excellent surface-active properties. Unfortunately the best-performing products are only ''moderately'' degradable and have a relatively high ecotoxicity. Biodiesel (rape oil methyl ester) can be epoxidised in a two-phase system with hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. Triglycerides can be epoxidised analogously. After separation of the aqueous phase the epoxidised biodiesel is ready for surfactant synthesis without the need for further purification. In part project 2 a method was successfully elaborated for synthesising oleic acid alkanolamine directly from the triglyceride and alkanolamine without using solvents. Various ethoxilated rape oil ethanolamides have very good colloidochemical and application-relevant properties, comparable with those of the best nonionic standard surfactants based on ethoxilated oxo alcohols.

Es wurde ein technisches Verfahren ausgearbeitet, welches eine Umesterungsreaktion von Biodiesel mit Sarkosin-Natrium beinhaltet. Mittenstaendig hydrophil funktionalisierte Fettsaeureamide lassen sich durch Umsetzung von epoxidiertem Biodiesel bzw. anderen epoxidierten Oelen mit verschiedenen hydrophilen Aminen bzw. Aminosaeuren herstellen. Es handelt sich um neuartige Tenside mit zum Teil herausragenden grenzflaechenaktiven Eigenschaften. Allerdings sind die besten Produkte nur 'maessig' biologisch abbaubar oder weisen eine relativ hohe Oekotoxizitaet auf. Die Epoxidierung des Biodiesels (Rapsoelmethylester) gelingt mit Wasserstoffperoxid und Ameisensaeure im Zweiphasensystem. Analog lassen sich auch die Triglyceride epoxidieren. Nach Abtrennung der waessrigen Phasen kann der epoxidierte Biodiesel ohne weitere Aufreinigung fuer die Tensidsynthese verwendet werden.

Outer membrane protein P 6, with a molecular mass of 16 kDa (determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]-PAGE) was purified by both native PAGE and SDS-PAGE from three strains of nontypeable H. influenzae and one strain of type b H. influenzae. The same conditions were required for purification from each strain. The suitability of proteins isolated by these methods was assessed by studying the immune response of rats immunized with P 6 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant into the Peyer's patches. P 6 purified by either native PAGE or SDS-PAGE {{did not differ significantly}} from P 6 purified by gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography in the ability to enhance pulmonary clearance of live bacteria. This study also investigated the effects of SDS on P 2 immunological responses in vivo and the effects of the reagents Zwittergent and <b>sodium</b> lauryl <b>sarcosinate</b> on outer membrane protein lymphocyte-proliferative responses in vitro. It was found that the presence of SDS in the immunization emulsion enhanced the antigen-specific cell- mediated response but suppressed the antigen-specific antibody responses.

The sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretograms of C. jejuni and C. coli were dominated by a major polypeptide band. In the reference strain C. jejuni VC 74, this polypeptide had an apparent molecular weight of 45, 000, was heat modifiable, and was shown to be transmembrane {{by virtue of its}} peptidoglycan association and surface exposure.

The LPS of C. jejuni and C. coli was of low molecular weight, suggesting that serotypic differences due to LPS were based on different carbohydrate compositions of core LPS. In contrast, the LPS of C. fetus CIP 5396 exhibited O antigen polysaccharide chains of intermediate chain length. Fragments of outer membranes released during growth of C. jejuni VC 74 displayed a polypeptide profile which differed from that of sarcosinate-extracted outer membranes.

When electrophoresis was performed at room temperature {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO 4), most of the recoverable agent was found {{at the top of the}} gel, consistent with previous studies indicating aggregation of the agent upon exposure to elevated temperatures. In addition, less than 5 % of the agent applied to the gel was found after electrophoresis, even though the study was performed with a low concentration of NaDodSO 4 (0. 1 %). Further studies on the inactivation of the agent by NaDodSO 4 suggest that this may be, in part, a function of the NaDodSO 4 : protein ratio in the sample. In contrast, <b>sodium</b> N-lauroyl <b>sarcosinate</b> (Sarkosyl) did not inactivate the agent in concentrations as high as 5 % (wt/vol). Virtually all of the infectivity could be recovered after electrophoresis of the agent into 0. 6 % agarose gels at 4 degrees C in the presence of 0. 2 % Sarkosyl. Digestion of the preparations with micrococcal nuclease and proteinase K prior to Sarkosyl electrophoresis caused a substantial portion of the agent to migrate ahead of DNA fragments of 1 x 10 (6) daltons. The behavior of the scrapie agent in electrophoretic gels is consistent with earlier studies showing that the monomeric form of the agent has a sedimentation coefficient of less than or equal to 40 S.

In sodium deoxycholate (DOC), the enzyme activity was slightly activated {{in the presence of}} 0. 2 % DOC but not activated in 1. 0 % DOC. The enzyme activity was also activated by pretreating the cells with SC, DOC or MC 10. On the contrary, the enzyme activity of the cell envelope prepared from the cells was strongly inhibited by these detergents. The enzyme activity of the cells cultured in detergent medium containing SC, DOC or MC 10 was higher than that of the normal cells. The enzyme activity was the highest in the cells cultured at 20 ℃, followed by the cells cultured at 30 ℃ and then at 40 ℃ in order of decreasing activity. However, the activation of the enzyme by SC or MC 10 was higher in the cells cultured at high temperature than those cultured at low temperature. On the other hand, the enzyme activity of the cells cultured at 20 ℃ was inhibited by DOC but was activated in case of the cells cultured at 40 ℃. The enzyme activity was inhibited by cross-linking the outer membrane with dimethylsuberimidate; besides, the enzyme activity of the cells cross-linked was markedly inhibited by detergents. These results suggest that these detergents do not directly act on the enzyme of the cells, but rather on the outer membrane-peptidoglycan layer and the permeability of the layer would alter {{as a result of the}} action. The variation of enzyme activity, in vivo, may be dependent on the permeability of the altered layer to the substrates. 1. 大腸菌浮遊液のSDH活性に対する界面活性剤の作用を検討した.

DMSによる外膜成分の修飾によってSDH活性は低下した. またDMSによって修飾された菌のSDH活性はSC,MCIO,DOC によって著しく阻害された. 7. 以上の結果から,上記界面活性剤は細胞質膜に存在するSDHに直接作用するのではなく,むしろ外膜層に作用して外膜層の基質透過性に変化を与えるものと思われる. したがってSDH活性の変動は基質の外膜透過性に依存したものと考える. なお基質の外膜層透過にLPSの関与は認められなかったが,外膜蛋白質と膿脂質の関与が示唆された...|$|R

The enzyme {{was considered to}} be located on the electron transport chain and to be an FAD-containing protein. The molecular weight of the subunit was estimated to be 44, 000. The enzyme (or the enzyme bound to the B. caldotenax membrane lipids) follows a ping-pong mechanism. The enzyme can oxidize NADH, but not NADPH, with 2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol, ferricyanide, menadione, and cytochrome c as electron acceptors. Membrane lipids or Triton X- 100 stimulated the enzyme activ-ity, except that with menadione. Lipids decreased the apparent affinity of electron acceptors and NADH to the enzyme, and increased the maximum velocity, except when menadione was used as the electron acceptor. Lipids partially protected the enzyme from thermal inactivation. The enzyme exhibited a continuous Arrhenius plot, while the lipids- or membrane-bound enzyme exhibited a discontinuous plot. Many investigations on the physiology, and espe-cially on the thermal properties of cytoplasmic enzymes, of thermophilic bacteria have been re-ported (/). In contrast to the cytoplasmic en-zymes, few reports on the membrane-bound or respiratory chain-linked enzymes of thermophilic bacteria have been presented. Recently the ter-minal oxidoreductase, cytochrome c oxidase [EC 1. 9. 3. 1], of the respiratory chain was highly puri-fied from Thermits thermophilus (2) and purified to homogeneity from a thermophilic bacterium PS 2 (5, Abbreviations: <b>sarcosinate,</b> <b>sodium</b> iV-lauroylsarcosi-nate; DC 1 P, 2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol; DTT...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} here was initiated {{to determine the}} possibilities of molecular methods for the detection and epidemiological investigation of HIV and HTLV infections. We present {{the results of a}} literature research and describe the development and partial evaluation of a new PCR method for the amplification of RNA and DNA sequences of the HIV- 1 pol, env and gag, HIV- 2 ltr and HTLV-I/II tax/rex genes. For the amplification of viral RNA, samples were treated with guanidium thiocyanate and <b>sodium</b> lauryl <b>sarcosinate</b> to disrupt the virus and to inactivate RNAses. Paramagnetic beads were used to extract the RNA, followed by solid-phase reverse transcription for cDNA synthesis. DNA or cDNA was amplified using a two-step PCR protocol in which the product from the first PCR was further amplified in a second PCR with nested primers combined with a touch-down temperature protocol to enhance sensitivity and specificity. A pilot study showed that in all peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from seven HIV- 1 -infected individuals of CDC class II, proviral HIV- 1 DNA was detected using three primer sets. HIV- 1 RNA could be detected in the plasma from ten of fifteen HIV- 1 -infected individuals of CDC class II. Together with data from the literature, our results indicate that PCR methods are useful in the detection of HIV- 1 infections and complementary to conventional methods such as enzyme immunoassays and Westernblot. They are especially useful when conventional methods do not allow a diagnosis to be made, for example in newborns of HIV-infected mothers, in monitoring of the viral load, and in patients with idiopathic CD 4 + T-lymphocytopenia. Using the same method, we amplified HIV- 2 and HTLV-I RNA and DNA sequences. However, clinical evaluation of these PCR methods must be conducted. This newly developed method may possibly be used in molecular epidemiological studies as we were able to directly sequence the product of the HIV- 1 env np-PCR, the V 3 variable region of the gp 120 gene. However, molecular epidemiology must be conducted at the clonal level with more than one isolated part of the viral genome. For molecular epidemiological studies of HIV- 1, for example, the variable regions V 3, V 4, and V 5 of the gp 120 gene together are useful targets. Promising methods for obtaining materials for PCR as well as serology with regard to epidemiology on the streets are the use of finger-prick blood spots on filter paper and saliva collection. Further studies are needed to determine the value of these methods in molecular epidemiological investigation...|$|R
40|$|Surfactants {{are used}} in many {{industrial}} applications, such as flotation, flocculation, water treatment, enhanced oil recovery, emulsification, drug delivery, personal care, detergency, chemical mechanical polishing, etc. The design, development, and characterization of greener surfactants in their applications are required to meet the increasing requirements for environmental protection and an escalating demand from the society for sustainable development. It is a challenge currently to develop structure-property-performance relationships for surfactant mixtures containing greener reagents to obtain maximum efficiency with minimum environmental damages. Even though conventional surfactants and their mixtures are well studied, the fundamental studies of the structure, property and performance relationships for greener surfactants when used individually or in combination with others are just started {{as more and more}} attentions are focusing on this area. In this work, solution behaviors of surfactant systems containing several amino acid based greener surfactants have been systematically investigated using various techniques, including surface tensiometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, viscometry and computer simulation to obtain information of the structures of the aggregates formed by greener surfactants or their mixtures with conventional ones in solutions. This comprehensive study helps to elucidate the mechanism of micellization behaviors of the greener surfactant mixtures and understand the roles of molecular structures and interactions in determination of system properties and performance. The colloidal and interfacial properties of a series of lipopeptides synthesized by chemo-enzymatic reactions were studied. They were found very surface active, especially C 12 /oligo(L-Glu). The effects of chain length of hydrophobic moiety, composition of oligopeptide as well as aqueous chemical conditions, such as pH, on the interfacial properties of the lipopeptides were studied. Results showed the mechanism of how the interfacial and colloidal properties of amino acid based surfactants can be fine tuned by adjusting structures of the molecules. Two new surfactants, Surfactin and FA-Glu, synthesized by genetically engineered bacteria were also evaluated. Both of them showed exceptional surface activity. Genetic engineering also showed its advantages when it was found that Surfactin was limited by its solubility. Quick modifications were made in the bacteria and better option FA-Glu was produced with improved structure for better solubility. The results provide fundamental knowledge of those greener surfactants on their structure-property relationships. A number of amino acid based greener surfactants with systematic structural variations, including sodium lauroyl glutamate (C 12 Glu), sodium lauroyl alaninate (C 12 Ala), <b>sodium</b> lauroyl <b>sarcosinate</b> (C 12 Sar), and sodium lauroyl glycinate (C 12 Gly), were tested as triblend mixtures with dodecyl glucoside (C 12 G 1) and lauramidoproply betaine (LAPB) to evaluate their performance as a function of their molecular structures. The C 12 Gly/C 13 G 1 /LAPB system was confirmed to have very high viscosity compared to the other systems. It was found the following micellar evolution processes happened in this system that delivered the high viscosity: small spherical micelles evolved into elongated rod-like micelles in the low concentration range, and networks of worm-like micelles formed in the high concentration range. The unique properties achieved by this system were attributed to the packing of the surfactant molecules in the system. Further results confirmed that C 12 Gly has a desired structure with a packing parameter of 0. 4 which favors formation of worm-like micelles. Foaming performance of the selected greener surfactant was also evaluated to compare with commercial benchmark system. Even though sodium dodecyl glycinate itself is not a good foaming agent as the petroleum based non-green surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulfate, when it is mixed with the other two ingredients, significant improvement can be achieved for both foamability and foam stability due to strong synergistic interactions among them. The mixture of sodium dodecyl glycinate, dodecyl glucoside and lauramidopropyl betaine actually can deliver equal viscosity, foamability and foam stability as the benchmark system, which makes this system a leading option for the future formulations in personal care industry. Computer simulation as a powerful tool was used to understand the mechanism how greener surfactant molecules interacted with each other and how they aggregated into micelles from molecular level. Simulation found that when different surfactant molecules were mixed together, the synergistic interaction reduced the electrostatic repulsion between molecules, which led to reduction of the effective space occupied by head groups making the two head groups overlapping on each other partially. The overlapping led to a close packing of molecules. The results suggest that geometry of molecules and the interactions among them play equally important roles in determining the packing of surfactants and in turn the packing controls properties and performance of the whole system. Thus a new formula for effective packing parameter of surfactant mixtures was proposed, in which not only the geometries of molecules but also the interactions among them were included to calculate the effective packing parameter for surfactant mixtures for better predictions of the properties and performance of surfactant mixture systems. The fundamental and systematical work accomplished through this work will have a profound impact on the understanding of greener surfactant mixture systems, as structure, property and performance relationships developed herein will in turn direct the use of greener surfactants in future applications for efficiency and low chemical footprin...|$|R
