5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital <b>staff</b> <b>were</b> U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his <b>staff</b> <b>were</b> responsible for key leaks.|$|E

Meyer and the production <b>staff</b> <b>were</b> adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E

The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. <b>Staff</b> <b>were</b> leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
