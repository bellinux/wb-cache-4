After Carrie systematically breaks Brody down and correctly surmises that Dana's phone call prevented the State Department bombing, he tearfully admits to his collaboration with Nazir and other al-Qaeda associates, and reveals that Nazir is planning an attack. Carrie gives Brody an ultimatum: either be exposed and sent to prison, or help the CIA in exchange for immunity. Left with no other options, Brody agrees to help the CIA.|$|E
25|$|The great {{event of}} Elizabeth's later years was the Seven Years' War. Elizabeth {{regarded}} {{the treaty of}} Westminster (16 January 1756, whereby Great Britain and Prussia agreed to unite their forces to oppose the entry into, or the passage through, Germany of the troops of every foreign power) as utterly subversive of the previous conventions between Great Britain and Russia. Elizabeth sided against Prussia over a personal dislike of Frederick the Great. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> reduced within proper limits {{so that he might}} no longer be a danger to the empire. Elizabeth acceded to the treaty of Versailles thus entering into an alliance with France and Austria against Prussia. On 17 May 1757 the Russian army, 85,000 strong, advanced against Königsberg.|$|E
25|$|When Coleridge's and Southey's plan {{to create}} a Pantisocratic nation in the Americas {{during the summer of}} 1794, Coleridge {{determined}} to marry Sara Fricker, sister of Southey's fiancee Edith Fricker. In order to fund the trip and the marriage, Coleridge was determined to have published his poetic-dramatic work, The Fall of Robespierre. The closet drama was written partly by Coleridge, the first act, and partly by Southey, the second and third, and it describes the events of Robespierre's final moments and his execution and that of 21 of his supporters along with denouncing tyranny. The work was published by Benjamin Flower and only under Coleridge's name. When the summer ended, Coleridge left for London and began to spend time with his school friends, including Lamb. Soon after, he stopped his communication with Sara Fricker, which caused problems between him and Southey. Matters were compounded when Mary Evans wrote to Coleridge during Autumn 1794 after hearing of Coleridge's and Southey's Pantisocratic plans; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to reconsider the idea. This letter was followed by letters from his brother George which also asked him to reconsider.|$|E

25|$|Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland) Camp Comic – Spike {{was born}} on 12 September (year unknown) and brought up in Edgbaston with his {{childhood}} sweetheart Brenda, {{the daughter of the}} local butcher. After leaving school he gained a good position in the Income Tax office, but resigned in 1959 and joined the entertainment staff at Maplins. It is not known how long he had known Ted, but they were already well-acquainted by the time they travelled on the train to the camp and it was suggested that it was Ted who got Spike the job. Spike shared a chalet with Ted, and there were many humorous scenes between the pair in their chalet, such as Spike being kept awake by Ted's snoring. Spike often tried to branch out into his own style of comedy, designing and making his own costumes and funny sequences. These received mixed reactions from the campers, but Ted criticised almost all of them. Spike was a very honest and law-abiding man, and was {{the only member of the}} entertainment staff who didn't run his own scheme to scam the campers for money. Although he was loyal to Ted and willing to turn a blind-eye to his schemes, he was often shocked at the lengths Ted would go to in order to make money. Spike had to make an impossible choice between his job and the woman he loved during the 1959 season, when his girlfriend, Brenda, said she would marry him only if he gave up his job and went to work for her father's business. He chose his job and ended their relationship. During the 1960 season he became involved with April, one of the new Yellowcoats. At the same time, Spike also fell in love with Gladys, but this never amounted to anything. He continued his relationship with April, and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to leave Maplins and go back to the tax office so they could get married and have a steady income. As with Brenda, he again decided against this in favour of show business. Spike's immediate intentions after the 1960 season were left unknown, though he revealed he was going to join Ted over Christmas playing a Chinese policeman in a pantomime. It was also implied that he had resumed his affair with April.|$|E

500|$|On another occasion, {{a prostitute}} {{was brought to}} Jackson's room after a concert in Madison Square Garden. There, the pop star interrogated the sex worker, asking why she was a prostitute, whether {{she wanted to have}} sex with him, and how much it would cost. The woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money, but that she would have sex with him for free because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him.</b> The prostitute then {{proceeded}} to unbutton her blouse, exposing her breasts. Apparently repulsed, Jackson turned his head and begged her to [...] "put them back". The singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her, which the prostitute declined to do; she was not there to talk. Instead, she gave Jackson her telephone number, urging him to call her when he wanted to [...] "get off".

500|$|Manga creator Katsura Hoshino {{said that}} she did not know how Allen originated, since she likes her main {{characters}} to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said that the general idea for his design was an [...] "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair and other things like that", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order (the group Allen joins in the series) she sensed a [...] "lack of coordination". Hoshino felt that a more-mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best with the Black Order uniform, she wondered if it should be more masculine. Because he is an Exorcist, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to have a [...] "very scary-looking image" [...] and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a [...] "gloomy" [...] impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century, and his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a [...] "gentlemanly image".|$|E
500|$|Political ideologues {{took issue}} with Ray's work. In a public debate during the 1960s, Ray and the Marxist filmmaker Mrinal Sen engaged in an argument. Sen criticised him for casting a matinée idol such as Uttam Kumar, whom he {{considered}} a compromise. Ray said that Sen only attacked [...] "easy targets", i.e. the Bengali middle-classes. However Ray himself has made movies on Bengali middle class in films like Pratidwandi and Jana Aranya set {{during the period of}} the naxalite movement in Bengal. Advocates of socialism said that Ray was not [...] "committed" [...] to the cause of the nation's downtrodden classes; some critics accused him of glorifying poverty in Pather Panchali and Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder) through lyricism and aesthetics. They said he provided no solution to conflicts in the stories, and was unable to overcome his bourgeois background. During the naxalite movements in the 1970s, agitators once came close to causing physical harm to his son, Sandip. Early in 1980, Ray was criticised by an Indian M.P. and former actress Nargis Dutt, who accused Ray of [...] "exporting poverty."

Martínez said that Cisneros told her to keep the plan a secret and that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> [...] "good and dead". Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, Martínez leaned forward in her seat and pointed at Cisneros, saying she told her exactly that. Defense {{attorneys}} tried to discredit Martínez' testimony and show the jury {{that she was a}} con-woman. They presented letters from several of her former clients who had paid around US$600 for love potions. One woman from San Antonio said that Martínez consulted her after she began having problems with her boyfriend and did not see positive results. Martínez denied knowing who the writers were, but changed her mind when the defense read the letters to her and the jury. She admitted that she used herbs, oils, and holy water in her sessions, and that she kept a human skull in her shop. She did not call herself a curandera (fortune teller) because she did not study for to earn the title. Martínez was then asked to read her cards for one of the attorney's in the courtroom to show the jury how she worked.|$|E
500|$|... "The Jacket" [...] {{was written}} by Seinfelds co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. The episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences; when he was dating Monica Yates, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to meet her father, Richard Yates, a respected novelist. David had just bought a suede jacket, and met Richard Yates at the Algonquin Hotel. Richard was, as David stated in an interview, [...] "...every bit as intimidating as Alton Benes". David's story is similar {{to what happened in}} the episode, as, when they headed out to the restaurant, his jacket was ruined by the snow. Additional dialogue at the store where Jerry buys his jacket was cut before broadcast, it featured a reference to Gary Gilmore. The material was later included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. [...] "The Jacket" [...] is the only episode in which one of Elaine's parents appears; Louis-Dreyfus once suggested Mary Tyler Moore to portray Elaine's mother, but the character never appeared on the show. The episode also contains the first mention to Elaine's job as a manuscript reader for Pendant Publishing, in early drafts of the script her job was an optician. Also in early drafts, in the final scene Kramer entered Jerry's house with a dove on his shoulder.|$|E

[...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes.

2500|$|In 1962–1963, {{the popular}} female {{playback}} singer Lata Mangeshkar {{raised the issue}} of playback singers' share in the royalties. Recognizing Rafi's position as the leading male playback singer, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5 percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. Lata's contention was {{that there was no way}} producers and music directors could deny this singing duo the royalty. Rafi stated that his claim on the filmmaker ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. After that, if the film proved a hit, the filmmaker was welcome to keep the Gramco (HMV) royalty he earned from it. If it did not prove to be a hit, argued Rafi, that he had already been paid the same fees for his song; so later the situation is resolved. Rafi stated that it is the producer who bets the money and the composer who creates the song, so his claim to the contribution of the song is compensated when the fees are paid. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer's name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of [...] "Tasveer Teri Dil Mein" [...] (Maya, 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director Salil Chowdhury sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as she was with him. The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two. In an interview given to The Times of India on September 25, 2012, Lata claimed to have received a written apology from Rafi. However, Shahid Rafi, Mohammad Rafi's son, rebuffs the claim, calling it an act to dishonor his father's reputation.|$|E
