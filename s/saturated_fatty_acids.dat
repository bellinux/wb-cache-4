5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher {{in comparison to}} the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition for fats {{differs from that}} of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> dietary cholesterol, and trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> than an unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule is broken down and categorized {{based on the number of}} carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Palmitic acid is a commonly studied example of the <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule.|$|R

25|$|In chickens, {{a limited}} number of studies have {{investigated}} the specific effect of diet on the fatty acid composition of preen oil in meat chickens. The preen oil of meat chickens is dominated by <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> which make up to 97% of the total fatty acids, with 13 different medium to long chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (C8:0 to C22:0) detected. The preen oil contained several odd-chain fatty acids, which suggests they may be derived from lipolysis by the uropygial gland and/or its microbiome. Diet and gender had small but significant effects on levels of specific saturated fatty acid in the preen oil. The fatty acid composition of the preen oil did not reflect the more diverse fatty acid compositions of the diet or whole blood. Therefore, this clearly indicate that measuring the fatty acid profile of preen oil is not a suitable alternative approach for predicting the fatty acid composition of the blood of meat chickens.|$|E
25|$|Only {{unsaturated}} fats can be trans or cis fat, {{since only}} a double bond can be locked to these orientations. <b>Saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are never called trans fats {{because they have}} no double bonds. Therefore, all their bonds are freely rotatable. Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a triple bond, are rare and of no nutritional significance.|$|E

25|$|Health {{groups have}} become {{increasingly}} vocal in their call for agricultural policies to contribute towards resolving the consumption problems of food; such as, excessive intake of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (FSA), sugar and salt, or under-consumption of vitamins and minerals.

500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the oil has anti-inflammatory properties; however, there have not yet been extensive tests, and the USDA regards pure emu oil as an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a 2009 article entitled [...] "How to Spot Health Fraud".

It has been scientifically shown to improve the rate of wound healing, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is not understood.

2500|$|In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert {{consultation}} {{report concluded}} that [...] "intake of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{is directly related}} to cardiovascular risk.

If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI <18.5 kg/m2). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.
