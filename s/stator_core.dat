50|$|The <b>stator</b> <b>core</b> {{is built}} with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|E

50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the <b>stator</b> <b>core</b> and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed.

40|$|Most of {{the volume}} in {{classical}} electrical machines is occupied by magnetic materials for creating an as good as possible magnetic path. In machines with planar flux paths (2 D geometries) the material is laminated to reduce eddy current losses in the core. Manufacturers typically supply reference values from Epstein frame measurements as a material performance specification and an easy way for comparison. However, the magnetic flux path in electrical machines is more complex due to rotating magnetic fields passing through the stator (with or without teeth), the rotor, and the airgap. Therefore, other material characterization methods, such as ring core measurements, are more suitable to characterize the magnetic materials for electrical machines.

In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, cooling inherently occurs through self-ventilation by both rotor discs. Nevertheless, an independent cooling system remains necessary for most applications. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, the individual <b>stator</b> <b>cores</b> with concentrated windings are potted in the stator housing using an epoxy resin.

40|$|The cores of {{electrical}} machines are generally punched and laminated {{to reduce the}} eddy current losses. These manufacturing processes such as punching and cutting deform the electrical sheets and deteriorate its magnetic properties. Burrs are formed due to plastic deformation {{of electrical}} sheets. Burr formed due to punching {{on the edges of}} laminated sheets impairs the insulation of adjacent sheet and make random galvanic contacts during the pressing of stacked sheets. The effect of circulating current occurs if the burrs occur on the opposite edges of the stacks of laminated sheets and incase of bolted or wielded sheets, induced current return through it. This induced current causes the additional losses in electrical machine. The existence of surface current on the boundary between two insulated regions causes discontinuity of tangential component of magnetic field. Hence, based on this principle, the boundary layer model was developed to study the additional losses due to galvanic contacts formed by burred edges. The boundary layer model was then coupled with 2 -D finite element vector potential formulation and compared with fine mesh layer model.
