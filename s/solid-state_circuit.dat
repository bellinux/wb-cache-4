50|$|The IEEE Donald O. Pederson Award in <b>Solid-State</b> <b>Circuits</b> is a Technical Field Award of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It was {{previously}} called the IEEE <b>Solid-State</b> <b>Circuits</b> Award. In November 2005 the award was renamed to honor Donald O. Pederson. He {{was one of}} the co-founders of the IEEE <b>Solid-State</b> <b>Circuits</b> Council, and was a driving force behind the initiation of the IEEE Journal of <b>Solid-State</b> <b>Circuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} of the society was made in 1966 by establishing the IEEE <b>Solid-State</b> <b>Circuits</b> Council (SSCC). In January 1997 the council became the IEEE <b>Solid-State</b> <b>Circuits</b> Society (SSCS).|$|R

50|$|Since the {{conductance}} {{was described}} as being controlled by the time integral of current as in Chua's theory of the memristor, the memistor of Widrow may {{be considered as a}} form of memristor having three instead of two terminals. However, one of the main limitations of Widrow's memistors was that they were made from an electroplating cell rather than as a <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> element. <b>Solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> elements were required to achieve the scalability of the integrated circuit which was gaining popularity around {{the same time as the}} invention of Widrow's memistor.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{brushless}} motor has permanent magnets which rotate around a fixed armature, eliminating {{problems associated with}} connecting current to the moving armature. An electronic controller replaces the brush/commutator assembly of the brushed DC motor, which continually switches the phase to the windings to keep the motor turning. The controller performs similar timed power distribution by using a <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> rather than the brush/commutator system.|$|E

50|$|Variations in triggered-sweep {{oscilloscopes}} include models offered with CRTs using long-persistence phosphors, such as type P7. These oscilloscopes {{were used}} for applications where the horizontal trace speed was very slow, or {{there was a long}} delay between sweeps, to provide a persistent screen image. Oscilloscopes without triggered sweep could also be retro-fitted with triggered sweep using a <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> developed by Harry Garland and Roger Melen in 1971.|$|E
50|$|A spatial power {{combiner}} generally {{refers to}} a microwave {{system in which the}} output power of several solid state circuits are combined in free space as opposed to in a lossy substrate. Many spatial power combiners use concepts from free-space optics in which dielectric lenses are used to focus a microwave beam into and out of a <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> array. For this reason, this field of research is also known as quasioptics.|$|E
50|$|Early {{alternating}} current (AC) fence chargers used {{a transformer and}} a mechanically driven switch to generate the electrical pulses. The pulses were wide and the voltage unpredictable, with no-load peaks in excess of 10,000 volts and a rapid drop in voltage as the fence leakage increased. The switch mechanism was prone to failure. Later systems replaced the switch with a <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit,</b> with an improvement in longevity but no change in pulse width or voltage control.|$|E

50|$|In 1987 {{an article}} was {{published}} detailing {{the development of}} a character string search engine (SSE) for rapid text retrieval on a double-metal 1.6-Î¼m n-well CMOS <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> with 217,600 transistors lain out on a 8.62x12.76-mm die area. The SSE accommodated a novel string-search architecture which combines a 512-stage finite-state automaton (FSA) logic with a content addressable memory (CAM) to achieve an approximate string comparison of 80 million strings per second. The CAM cell consisted of four conventional static RAM (SRAM) cells and a read/write circuit. Concurrent comparison of 64 stored strings with variable length was achieved in 50 ns for an input text stream of 10 million characters/s, permitting performance despite the presence of single character errors in the form of character codes. Furthermore, the chip allowed nonanchor string search and variable-length `don't care' (VLDC) string search.|$|E
50|$|Answering {{machines}} {{became more}} widely used after {{the restructuring of}} AT&T in 1984, which was when the machines became affordable and sales reached one million units {{per year in the}} US. While early answering machines used magnetic tape technology, most modern equipment uses solid state memory storage; some devices use a combination of both, with a <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> for the outgoing message and a cassette for the incoming messages.James P Mitchell displayed a working prototype of a digital outgoing message with a taped incoming system at an Iowa State University VEISHEA engineering openhouse in April 1982. This system won a gold award from the Engineering department. In 1983, Kazuo Hashimoto received a patent for a digital answering machine architecture with US Patent 4,616,110. The first digital answering machine brought to the market was AT&T's 1337; an activity led by Trey Weaver. Mr. Hashimoto sued AT&T but quickly dropped the suit because the AT&T architecture was significantly different from his patent.|$|E

40|$|The NASA N 3 -X blended-wing {{body with}} turboelectric {{distributed}} propulsion concept is being studied to achieve N+ 3 goals such as reduced noise, emissions, and improved energy efficiency. The electrical distribution system is cryogenic {{in order to}} maximize its efficiency and increase the power density of all associated components, while the motors, generators, and transmission lines are superconducting. The protection of a superconducting DC network poses unique electrical and thermal challenges due to the low impedance of the superconductor and operation in the superconducting or quenched states. For a given TeDP electrical system architecture with fixed power ratings, conventional and <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers combined with superconducting fault-current limiters are examined with both voltage and current source control to limit and interrupt the fault current. To estimate the protection system weight and losses, scalable models of cryogenic bidirectional current-source converters, cryogenic bidirectional IGBT <b>solid-state</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, and resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters are developed to assess how the weight and losses of these components vary as a function of nominal voltage and current and fault current ratings. The scalable models are used to assess the protection system weight for several trade-offs. System studies include the trade-off in fault-current limiting capability of SFCL on CB mass, alongside the fault-current limiting capability of the converter and its impact on CB fault-current interruption ratings and weight...|$|E
