[125] ["The clouds {{rose from}} the {{opposite}} valley, curling up perpendicular precipices like the foam of the Ocean of Hell, during a Spring-tide--it was white, and sulphury, and immeasurably deep in appearance. The side we ascended was (of course) not of so precipitous a nature; but on arriving at the summit, we looked {{down the other side}} upon a boiling <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> dashing against the crags on which we stood (these crags on one side quite perpendicular) ...

60|$|Up in the {{mountains}} now,--above some of the clouds undoubtedly, almost 'mong the stars, as Gillie put it,--Lewis wanders in company with Baptist Le Croix, half-forgetful of his promise to Lawrence. Below them lies a world of hills and valleys; above towers a fairy-land of ice, cliff, and cloud. No human habitation is near. The only indications of man's existence are so faint, and so far off in the plains below, that houses are barely visible, and villages look like toys. A <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> floats beneath them, {{and it is only}} through gaps in this sea that the terrestrial world is seen. Piercing through it are the more prominent of the Alpine peaks--the dark tremendous obelisk of the Matterhorn towering in one direction, the not less tremendous and far grander head of Mont Blanc looming in another. The sun shines brightly over all, piercing and rendering semi-transparent some of the clouds, gilding the edges and deepening the shadows of others.|$|E
6000|$|Meantime, {{the other}} has been {{watching}} the change of the clouds, and the march of the light along the mountain sides; he beholds the entire scene in broad, soft masses of true gradation, and the very feebleness of his sight is in some sort an advantage to him, in making him more sensible of the aërial mystery of distance, and hiding from him the multitudes of circumstances which {{it would have been}} impossible for him to represent. But there is not one change in the casting of the jagged shadows along the hollows of the hills, but it is fixed on his mind for ever; not a flake of spray has broken from the <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> about their bases, but he has watched it as it melts away, and could recall it to its lost place in heaven by the slightest effort of his thoughts. Not only so, but thousands and thousands of such images, of older scenes, remain congregated in his mind, each mingling in new associations with those now visibly passing before him, and these again confused with other images of his own ceaseless, sleepless imagination, flashing by in sudden troops. Fancy how his paper will be covered with stray symbols and blots, and undecipherable shorthand:--as for his sitting down to [...] "draw from Nature," [...] there was not one of the things which he wished to represent that stayed for so much as five seconds together: but none of them escaped, for all that: they are sealed up in that strange storehouse of his; he may take one of them out, perhaps, this day twenty years, and paint it in his dark room, far away. Now, observe, you may tell both of these men, when they are young, that they are to be honest, that they have an important function, and that they are not to care what Raphael did. This you may wholesomely impress on them both. But fancy the exquisite absurdity of expecting either of them to possess any of the qualities of the other.|$|E

50|$|A <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> forms {{generally}} in valleys or over seas in very {{stable air mass}} conditions such as in a temperature inversion. Humidity can then reach saturation and condensation leads to a very uniform stratocumulus cloud, stratus cloud or fog. Above this layer, the air must be dry. This is a common situation in a high-pressure area with cooling at the surface by radiative cooling at night in summer, or advection of cold air in winter or in a marine layer.|$|R

We soon entered the band <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> and did not again emerge from it that day. About noon, finding pasture for the animals and bushes for firewood at Los Arenales, we stopped for the night. This was near the uppermost limit of bushes, and the elevation, I suppose, was between seven and eight thousand feet.|$|R

25|$|Heavensward {{features}} {{new areas}} which are {{about three times}} as large as zones in the base game. The reason for the size increase is to accommodate flying gameplay. After completing certain quests and attuning to the air currents in an area, players gain {{the ability to use}} new flying mounts, such as airships, in that location. Flying allows access to previously unreachable points in the terrain. Airships built by Free Companies also have the ability to explore the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clouds</b> for rare materials, as well as the Diadem—an open world area where players can challenge large monsters for high level gear and spoils.|$|R
25|$|In Tarbes, fog {{and strong}} winds are rare. These climate {{characteristics}} of Tarbes {{are found in}} the north of the department, but with more fog in winter, and warmer daytime temperatures and lower precipitation in the summer. Conversely on the closer terrain the average quantities of precipitation increase. This varies greatly depending on exposure and slopes, but become abundant near the border ridges. The area between plain and mountain has a more humid climate and less sunny {{than the rest of the}} department. In the mountains the sun shines frequently above a <b>sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and the wind blows stronger and more often than on the plain (breezes and sometimes very strong winds from the south).|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Burtin {{was able}} to gain Eastman Kodak as another major client. Burtin’s work with Eastman Kodak {{included}} new construction techniques and a unique roof design.

These new techniques and designs brought considerable attention to Burtin’s Eastman Kodak Pavilion at the 1964-1965 World’s Fair. According to The Will Burtin Papers, the pavilion included an [...] "eighty foot high photo tower and moon deck." [...] Due to constant dispute with Kodak, Burtin’s agreement with the company was ceased before the pavilion was officially built; the Concrete Industry Board gave Burtin a special award in 1964 for its design.|$|R
