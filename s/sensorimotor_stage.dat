Such persistently altered behavior must be attributable to changes in physiological substrates responsible for song. We are currently working to identify the nature of such physiological changes, and to understand how they contribute to altered vocal learning. One possibility is that developmental agonist exposure results in altered expression of elements of endocannabinoid signaling systems. To test this hypothesis we have studied effects of the potent cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55212 - 2 (WIN) on endocannabinoid levels and densities of CB 1 immunostaining in zebra finch brain. Results We found that late postnatal WIN treatment caused a long-term global disregulation of both levels of the endocannabinoid, 2 -arachidonyl glycerol (2 -AG) and densities of CB 1 immunostaining across brain regions, while repeated cannabinoid treatment in adults produced few long-term changes in the endogenous cannabinoid system.

40|$|The {{emotional}} {{consequences of}} our own and others’ actions can influence our agentive self-awareness in social contexts. Positive outcomes are usually linked to the self and used for self-enhancement, whereas negative outcomes are more often attributed to others. In most situations, these causal attribution tendencies seem to be immediately present instead of involving reflective interpretations of the action experience. To address the question at which level of the cognitive hierarchy emotions and action perception interact, we adopted a social reward anticipation paradigm. Here, participants or their interaction partner received positive or negative action outcomes and performed speeded attribution choices regarding causation of the action outcome. Event-Related Potential (ERP) {{results showed that the}} emotional value of an outcome already influenced the classical N 1 self-attenuation effect, with reduced embodied agentive self-awareness for negative outcomes at initial <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stages.</b> At the level of the N 300, the degree of updating and affective evaluation associated with the respective attributive decision was reflected and particularly associated to attribution tendencies for positive events. Our results show an early interaction between emotion and agency processes, and suggest that self-serving cognition can be grounded in embodied knowledge from low-level sensorimotor mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Using an {{epigenetic}} model, in {{this paper}} we investigate the importance of sensorimotor experiences and environmental conditions in the emergence of more advanced cognitive abilities in an autonomous robot. We let the robot develop in three environments affording very different (physical and social) sensorimotor experiences: a ``normal'', standard environment, with reasonable opportunities for stimulation, a ``novel'' environment that offers many novel experiences, and a ``sensory deprived'' environment where the robot has very few and over-simplistic chances to interact. We then: (a) assess how these different experiences influence and change the robot's ongoing development and behavior; (b) compare the said development to the different <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stages</b> that infants go through and (c) finally after each ``baby'' robot has had time to develop in its environment, we recreate and asses its cognitive abilities using different well-known tests used with human infants such as violation of expectation (VOE) paradigm. Although our model was not explicitly designed following Piaget's, or any other sensorimotor developmental theory, we observed, and discuss in the paper, that relevant sensorimotor experiences, or the lack of, result in the robot going through unplanned development ``stages'' bearing some similarities to infant development, and could be interpreted in terms of Piaget's theory...|$|R

50|$|Piaget's <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage</b> {{comprised}} six sub-stages (see sensorimotor stages {{for more}} detail). In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by primitive reflexes. Discovery of new behaviors results from classical and operant conditioning, {{and the formation}} of habits. From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} in Piaget's stages of {{cognitive}} {{development is the}} <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage.</b> This stage lasts from birth to two years old.

5000|$|Cognitive {{development}} is Jean Piaget's theory.

The <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage</b> {{is the first of}} the four stages in cognitive development which [...] "extends from birth to the acquisition of language". In this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) with physical interactions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping). Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it. They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought {{toward the end of the}} stage.|$|E
2500|$|Song {{learning}} in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile {{listening to the}} father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template. During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called [...] "sub-song", which is akin to babbling in human infants. Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the stereotypy of the crystallized song – this is called [...] "plastic song". Finally, {{after two or three}} months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order). Some birds, such as zebra finches, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and <b>sensorimotor</b> learning <b>stages.</b>|$|R

50|$|Beginning in the 17th century, two {{philosophers}} independently wrote {{works that}} have been widely influential in child rearing. John Locke's 1693 book Some Thoughts Concerning Education is a well known foundation for educational pedagogy from a Puritan standpoint. Locke {{highlights the importance of}} experiences to a child's development, and recommends developing their physical habits first. In 1762, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau published a volume on education, Emile: or, On Education. He proposed that early education should be derived less from books and more from a child's interactions with the world. Of these, Rousseau is more consistent with slow parenting, and Locke is more for concerted cultivation.Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development describes how children represent and reason about the world. This is a developmental stage theory that consists of a <b>Sensorimotor</b> <b>stage,</b> Preoperational stage, Concrete operational stage, and Formal operational stage.

50|$|Another {{approach}} to viewing {{the ways in}} which information is processed in humans was suggested by Jean Piaget in what is called the Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory (Presnell, 1999). Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2-6 years), concrete operational (6-11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage,</b> newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 37) Infant cognition {{according to}} Jean Piaget develops for all humans regardless {{of culture in}} an invariant series of <b>stages</b> during the <b>sensorimotor</b> period. This study examined and compared the sensorimotor performance of six to twelve months old Asian Indian and American infants. Since child rearing practices in the two cultures differ considerably, we expected there might be differences in the rate but not the sequence of sensorimotor development. In addition since previous cross cultural research has been inconclusive about the roles ethnicity and social class (particularly the component of mother's education) play in infant cognition, we investigated these variables in relation to infant sensorimotor performance. Ninety-three Indian infants from the urban area of New Delhi and fifty-two American infants from Los Angeles comprised the study sample. All of the subjects were full term, normal, healthy, home-reared infants whose primary caretaker was the mother. The infants were grouped according to age (7 - 8 mo., 9 - 10 mo., and 11 - 12 mo.) and mother's level of formal education (high, low). The author and others observed the infants primarily in well baby clinics using a uniform procedure in both countries. The Casati-Lezine Scale of Infants Sensorimotor Development (1968) as modified by Kopp and Slgman (1972) was administered individually to the infant sitting his mother's lap. This scale examines <b>sensorimotor</b> behavior from <b>Stages</b> II I-VI as described by Piaget and contains four subtests: Exploration of Objects, Visual Pursuit, Hidden Object, and Use of Intermediaries (string, and object and support). Total and subtest scores were analyzed using a multifactor analysis of variance to determine differences by ethnicity at the three age levels. There were significant differences in three subtests at nine months and two subtests at twelve months favoring American infants. Although the Indian infants scored lower they were {{for the most part}} in the same stage as the American infants. There were no significant differences by mother's level of education in either culture, nor was there an interaction effect between this variable and ethnicity. Several demographic variables investigated on the Indian sample (sex, nursing, availability of information and household density) had no significant effect on infant scores. General child rearing practices related to physical freedom, interaction with people and materials, autonomy as well as behavior during testing in each culture are discussed. These observations indicate that American infants have greater opportunity for direct exploration and manipulation of their world while Indian infants have more opportunities for social stimulation. There is need for further research of a longitudinal nature to determine if these infants have more opportunities for social stimulation. Patterns of sensorimotor performance continue with older infants and infants from rural and newly urbanized families as well as those reared in traditional joint families. Research is also needed to examine the kinds of experiences valued in each culture for infants and how these might affect sensorimotor development...|$|R

5000|$|Developmental {{psychologist}} Jean Piaget {{noted that}} {{children in a}} developmental phase he called the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage</b> (a period which lasts {{up to the first}} two years of a child) begin to imitate observed actions. This is an important stage in the development of a child because the child is beginning to think symbolically, associating behaviors with actions, thus setting the child up for the development of further symbolic thinking. Imitative learning also plays a crucial role in the development of cognitive and social communication behaviors, such as language, play, and joint attention. Imitation serves as both a learning and a social function because new skills and knowledge are acquired, and communication skills are improved by interacting in social and emotional exchanges. It is shown, however, that [...] "children with autism exhibit significant deficits in imitation that are associated with impairments in other social communication skills." [...] To help children with autism, reciprocal imitation training (RIT) is used. It is a naturalistic imitation intervention that helps teach the social benefits of imitation during play by increasing child responsiveness and by increasing imitative language.|$|E
5000|$|Jean Piaget was a Swiss {{scholar who}} began his studies in {{intellectual}} development in the 1920s. Piaget’s first interests were those that dealt with {{the ways in which}} animals adapt to their environments and his first scientific article about this subject was published when he was 10 years old. This eventually led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Zoology, which then led him to his second interest in epistemology. Epistemology branches off from philosophy and deals with the origin of knowledge. Piaget believed the origin of knowledge came from Psychology, so he traveled to Paris and began working on the first “standardized intelligence test” at Alfred Binet laboratories; this influenced his career greatly. As he carried out this intelligence testing he began developing a profound interest in the way children’s intellectualism works. As a result, he developed his own laboratory and spent years recording children’s intellectual growth and attempted to find out how children develop through various stages of thinking. This led to Piaget develop four important stages of cognitive development: <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage</b> (birth to age 2), preoperational stage (age 2 to 7), concrete-operational stage (ages 7 to 12), and formal-operational stage (ages 11 to 12, and thereafter). Piaget concluded that adaption to an environment (behaviour) is mananged through schemes and adaption occurs through assimilation and accommodation.http://www.newriver.edu/images/stories/library/Stennett_Psychology_Articles/Piagets%20Theory%20of%20Cognitive%20Development.pdf ...|$|E
50|$|In {{developmental}} psychology, Jean Piaget was {{a pioneer}} {{in the study of the}} development of thought from birth to maturity. In his theory of cognitive development, thought is based on actions on the environment. That is, Piaget suggests that the environment is understood through assimilations of objects in the available schemes of action and these accommodate to the objects to the extent that the available schemes fall short of the demands. As a result of this interplay between assimilation and accommodation, thought develops through a sequence of stages that differ qualitatively from each other in mode of representation and complexity of inference and understanding. That is, thought evolves from being based on perceptions and actions at the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage</b> in the first two years of life to internal representations in early childhood. Subsequently, representations are gradually organized into logical structures which first operate on the concrete properties of the reality, in the stage of concrete operations, and then operate on abstract principles that organize concrete properties, in the stage of formal operations. In recent years, the Piagetian conception of thought was integrated with information processing conceptions. Thus, thought is considered as the result of mechanisms that are responsible for the representation and processing of information. In this conception, speed of processing, cognitive control, and working memory are the main functions underlying thought. In the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, the development of thought is considered to come from increasing speed of processing, enhanced cognitive control, and increasing working memory.|$|E

30|$|For Pons and Harris (2001), the {{correspondence}} between the three levels of consciousness and the three stages of cognitive functioning (sensorimotor, concrete operational, and formal operational) is questioned by some authors (Mounoud 1993, 1996; Karmiloff-Smith 1994; Zelazo 1999). In this case, the development of reflective consciousness would be {{closely linked to the}} particular activities or processes on which it focuses, and this would be maintained throughout development. In this case, some of Piaget’s observations of babies could be indicating early conceptual consciousness, even in the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage.</b> For example, when Jacqueline (Piaget’s daughter), aged 13  months, repeatedly sinks toys in the bathtub to observe how water squirts, throws a toy to see how it floats, or submerges it to see if it will come to the surface. These experiments can be seen, according to Pons and Harris, as indicating early conceptual consciousness even at the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage.</b> “The baby has a conceptual (and not just a practical) consciousness of his or her functioning (and not just of the result) and tries to understand that functioning (and not just to achieve success)” (Pons and Harris 2001, p. 224). In this respect, one can have recourse to Piaget’s observation of the two movements: the interiorization or logico-mathematical movement and the exteriorization or physical and causal movement, which occur at each level of grasp of consciousness, including in the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>stage.</b> These two parallel movements occur unconsciously and grasp of consciousness always comes after early successes of action, according to Piaget’s explanation.
