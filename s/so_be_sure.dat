6000|$|It is of this Figure, whom we see by the mind's eye {{in those}} Potsdam regions, visible {{for the last}} time seventy years ago, that we are now to treat, in the way of solacing ingenuous human curiosity. We are to try for some Historical Conception of this Man and King; some answer to the questions, [...] "What was he, then? Whence, how? And what did he achieve and suffer in the world?"--such answer as may prove {{admissible}} to ingenuous mankind, especially such as may correspond to the Fact (which stands there, abstruse indeed, but actual and unalterable), and <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of admissibility one day.|$|E

[...] "They can never do without you, now,--never, Phoebe; never--no more than if one of God's angels had been living with them, and making their dismal house pleasant and comfortable! Don't it seem to you they'd be in a sad case, if, some pleasant summer morning like this, the angel should spread his wings, and fly to the place he came from? Well, just so they feel, now that you're going home by the railroad! They can't bear it, Miss Phoebe; <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to come back!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Did you persevere with 'Sordello'? I hope <b>so.</b> <b>Be</b> <b>sure</b> {{that we may}} all learn (as poets) {{much and}} deeply from it, for the writer speaks true oracles. When you have read it through, then read for {{relaxation}} and recompense the last 'Bell and Pomegranate' by the same poet, his 'Colombo's Birthday,' which is exquisite. Only 'Pippa Passes' I lean to, or kneel to, with the deepest reverence. Wordsworth has been in town, and is gone. Tennyson is still here. He likes London, I hear, and hates Cheltenham, where he resides with his family, and he smokes pipe after pipe, and does not mean to write any more poems. Are we to sing a requiem? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hubert, I do {{not know}} why we are born to {{struggle}} and to suffer and at last be noosed with the rope of Doom. Yet I hope the priests are right and that we live again, though Solomon thought not so; that is, if we live where there is neither sin nor sorrow nor fear of death. If <b>so,</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that in some new land we shall meet afresh, and there I shall ask account of you of the wealth I entrusted to your keeping. Think of me kindly at times, for I have learned to love you who are of my blood, and while we live on in the hearts of those we love, we are not truly dead. Come hither that I may bless you in your coming in and going out while you still look upon the sun." ...|$|E

60|$|When midsummer was past, {{a company}} of young men upon a journey {{came to the house}} by Frodis Water. That was always a great day for Aud, when there were gallants at table; and what made this day the greater, Alf of the Fells was in the company, and she thought Alf fancied her. <b>So</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> Aud wore her best. But when Thorgunna came from the bed-place, she was arrayed like any queen and the broad brooch was in her bosom. All night in the hall these women strove with each other; and the little maid, Asdis, looked on, and was ashamed and knew not why. But Thorgunna pleased beyond all; she told of strange things that had befallen in the world; when she pleased she had the cue to laughter; she sang, and her voice was full and her songs new in that island; and {{whenever}} she turned, the eyes shone in her face and the brooch glittered at her bosom. So that the young men forgot the word of the merchants as to the woman's age, and their looks followed her all night.|$|E
6000|$|If he {{had done}} <b>so,</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> {{that we should have}} heard of it. For no man can become what he has become without making many an enemy; and he has his enemies already. On which {{statement}} naturally occurs the question--why? An important question too; because several of his later biographers seem to have running in their minds some such train of thought as this--Raleigh must have been a bad fellow, or he would not have had so many enemies; and because he was a bad fellow, there is an a priori reason that charges against him are true. Whether this be arguing in a circle or not, it is worth searching out the beginning of this enmity, and the reputed causes of it. In after years it will be because he is 'damnable proud,' because he hated Essex, and so forth: of which in their places. But what is the earliest count against him? Naunton, who hated Raleigh, and was moreover a rogue, has no reason to give, but that 'the Queen took him for a kind of oracle, which much nettled them all; yea, those he relied on began to take this his sudden favour for an alarm; to be sensible of their own supplantation, and to project his; which shortly made him to sing, [...] "Fortune my foe."' ...|$|E
60|$|Take common sense. Does {{not common}} sense {{tell us that}} if God made this world, and governs it by righteous and God-like laws, {{this must be a}} world in which evil-doing cannot thrive? God made the world better than that, surely! He would be a bad law-giver who made such laws, that it was as well to break them as to keep them. You would call them bad laws, surely! No, God made the world, and not the devil; and the world works by God's laws, and not the devil's; and it {{inclines}} towards good, and not towards evil; and he who sins, even in the least, breaks God's laws, acts contrary to the rule and constitution of the world, and will surely find that God's laws will go on in spite of him, and grind him to powder, if he by sinning {{gets in the way of}} them. God has no need to go out of His way to punish our evil deeds. Let them alone, and they will punish themselves. Is it not so in every thing? If a tradesman trades badly, or a farmer farms badly, there is no need of lawyers to punish him; he will punish himself. Every mistake he makes will take money out of his pocket; every time he offends against the established rules of trade or agriculture, which are God's laws, he injures himself; and <b>so,</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> it is in the world at large,--in the world in which men and the souls of men live, and move, and have their being.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{is a long}} word, Allan, and I {{dare say}} that what you <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> {{impossible}} will happen after all," [...] words that made me angry enough at the time, though in after years I often thought of them.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have written}} and ordered your last book, THE REAL THING, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> and don't send it. What {{else are you}} doing or {{thinking}} of doing? News I have none, and don't want any. I have had to stop all strong drink and all tobacco, and am now in a transition state between the two, {{which seems to be}} near madness. You never smoked, I think, so you can never taste the joys of stopping it. But at least you have drunk, and you can enter perhaps into my annoyance when I suddenly find a glass of claret or a brandy-and-water give me a splitting headache the next morning. No mistake about it; drink anything, and there's your headache. Tobacco just as bad for me. If I live through this breach of habit, I shall be a white- livered puppy indeed. Actually I am so made, or so twisted, that I do not like to think of a life without the red wine on the table and the tobacco with its lovely little coal of fire. It doesn't amuse me from a distance. I may find it the Garden of Eden when I go in, but I don't like the colour of the gate-posts. Suppose somebody said to you, you are to leave your home, and your books, and your clubs, and go out and camp in mid-Africa, and command an expedition, you would howl, and kick, and flee. I think the same of a life without wine and tobacco; and if this goes on, I've got to go and do it, sir, in the living flesh! ...|$|E
