40|$|An {{intermediate}} <b>symbol</b> <b>buffer</b> (ISB) configuration {{and method}} is provided {{such that the}} ISB memory comprises 15 portions, one for each HSDPA spreading code. Symbols associated with a spreading code are written to the memory portion associated with the same spreading code. When a covariance calculation is performed to obtain a more accurate channel estimate, only the symbols associated with spreading codes determined to be needed for the covariance calculation are written to the ISB by a buffer block and red from the ISB by a correlation core. The symbols associated with spreading codes that are not necessary for a covariance calculation may be masked from being written or read from the ISB. In some embodiments each memory portion is an individual memory block. In other embodiments a plurality of memory blocks may contain a plurality of memory portions, one memory partition designated, at least temporarily, for each spreading code...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 This report {{describes}} a connectionist architecture specifically {{intended for use}} in sequential domains requiring symbol manipulation. The architecture {{is based on a}} network formalism which differs from other connectionist networks developed for use in temporal/sequential domains. Units in this formalism are updated synchronously and retain partial activation between updates. They produce two output values: the standard sigmoidal function of the activity and its velocity. Activation flowing along connections can be gated by units. Well-behaved <b>symbol</b> <b>buffers</b> which learn complex assignment behavior can be constructed using gates. Full recurrence is supported. The network architecture, its underlying formalism, and its performance on an incremental parsing task requiring non-trivial dynamic behavior are presented. 2 ̆...|$|R

The UEs send the scheduling request (SR) in the UL <b>symbol,</b> including <b>buffer</b> information, HARQ feedback and the MCS and rank derived from their channel measurements. Notice {{that there is a}} delay between the instant when the channel is measured and the TTI when the transmission occurs, which may affect the link adaptation procedure. In addition, since the transmission direction may change at each TTI, creating sudden changes in the interference pattern, it further compromises the link adaptation procedure.|$|R
50|$|In the {{implementation}} stage the abstract network {{model of the}} solution is converted into a physical system, represented as a system implementation diagram (SID). The SID shows {{the system as a}} scheduler process that calls modules that implement the processes. Datastreams are represented as calls to inverted processes. Database symbols represent collections of entity state-vectors, and there are special <b>symbols</b> for file <b>buffers</b> (which must be implemented when processes are scheduled to run at different time intervals).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a transmission control problem in network-coded two-way relay channels (NC-TWRC), where the relay <b>buffers</b> random <b>symbol</b> arrivals from two users, and the channels {{are assumed to}} be fading. The problem is modeled by a discounted infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to find a transmission control policy that minimizes the <b>symbol</b> delay, <b>buffer</b> overflow and transmission power consumption and error rate simultaneously and in the long run. By using the concepts of submodularity, multimodularity and L-natural convexity, we study the structure of the optimal policy searched by dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. We show that the optimal transmission policy is nondecreasing in queue occupancies or/and channel states under certain conditions such as the chosen values of parameters in the MDP model, channel modeling method, modulation scheme and the preservation of stochastic dominance in the transitions of system states. The results derived in this paper can be used to relieve the high complexity of DP and facilitate real-time control. Comment: 32 page...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical tool, LibsafeXP, {{to protect the}} software against {{the most common and}} severe attack, buffer overflows. As a dynamic shared library and an extension to Libsafe and LibsafePlus, LibsafeXP contains wrapper functions for all the buffer related functions in C Standard Library. These wrapper functions are enforced to check the source and target buffer’s size using the following information: global buffer knowledge extracted from the program <b>symbol</b> information, heap <b>buffer</b> knowledge by intercepting memory allocation family functions, and stack buffer bound information by dynamically determined from the frame pointer. Compared with other approaches, LibsafeXP is more transparent to programs: it works on binary mode, and neither requires the source code nor any debugging information. The performance and effectiveness evaluation indicates LibsafeXP could be used to defend against buffer overflow attacks and impose about 10 percent overhead on the protected software. I...|$|R
40|$|PCI Express {{is third}} {{generation}} Computer Bus to inter connect peripherals in a Computer, Servers, Mobile sets and systems. PCS is the sublayer {{of the physical}} layer of PCI Express 1. 0. The major constituents of this layer are transmitter and receiver. Transmitter comprises of 8 b/ 10 b encoder. The Primary purpose of this scheme is to embed a clock into the serial bit stream of transmitter lanes. No clock is transmitted along with the serial data bit stream. This eliminates EMI noise and provides DC balance. Receiver comprises of special <b>symbol</b> detector, elastic <b>buffer</b> and 8 b/ 10 b decoder. Elastic buffer {{is nothing but a}} FIFO operated with two clocks. While a transaction, at one device Recovered Clock from the received data and the clock transmitted at another device may slightly differ. So, Recovered clock and the receiver clock will differ. In this case data corruption will occur. To avoid this situation elastic buffers are used and the data recovered through special symbols. When ever recovered clock is faster than system clock, there is overflow in the buffer. And when recovered clock is slower than system clock underflow in the elastic buffer will occur. 8 b/ 10 b decoder gives 8 bit character and data/control signals. Disparity error and Decode error can be known though this module. If any error is present in the received data then loopback signal is generated. This work uses VHDL to model different blocks of the PCS of physical layer of PCI Express.
