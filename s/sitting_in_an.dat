5|$|Magma <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{underground}} chamber {{for many}} years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E

In 2007, organisers of the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum, which is a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum, wrote to the Presidential Administration requesting a photograph of the President for his accreditation badge, and the Putin Administration sent back to the organisers a photograph of Putin <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> armchair next to a fireplace with Konni lying at his feet.|$|E
25|$|The AB-13 {{was a small}} single-bay biplane {{of mixed}} construction. It had wooden {{stressed-skin}} wings with plywood skinning that folded to allow easy storage aboard ship, while combat flaps were fitted as the aircraft was required to have sufficient maneuverability for air combat {{as well as its}} normal observation missions. The fuselage was of metal construction, with the pilot <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open cockpit, but the observer's position being enclosed. Both float and wheeled undercarriages were designed, with the seaplane having a single main float, while the landplane version had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Power was provided by a single Nakajima Hikari radial engine.|$|E
25|$|The single's music video, is {{credited}} to Alan Smithee (Nick Brandt removed his name {{due to the}} way Clive Davis re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins {{with the performance of}} the song Houston gives at the end of The Bodyguard. The video then cuts to Houston in a dark blue suit <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love. The video is inter-cut with scenes from The Bodyguard and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with the singer. At the time of the video's shooting Houston was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina so is shown only sitting in the theater scenes.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, the British engineering company, Vickers Limited, entered into an agreement with the Hart Engine Company of Leeds to fund development of an air-cooled radial engine, planned to generate 150hp (112kW). Vickers planned several aircraft around the promising new engine, including a tractor configuration single-seat fighter designed by Rex Pierson, the F.B.16. Pierson's new fighter, also known as the Hart Scout was a single-bay biplane with heavily staggered wings of unequal span. It had a volumous, ellipical section fuselage, with the pilot <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open cockpit above the lower wing and the Hart engine enclosed in a cowling. Armament was a single synchronised Vickers machine gun.|$|E
25|$|While an {{election}} petition is pursued similarly to normal civil claims, a judge <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> election court holds {{more of a}} inquisitorial role. This inquisitorial power requires the judge to examine and investigate possible electoral malpractice in the electoral area as a whole {{as opposed to being}} limited to determining the questions posed by the petition. To aid its decision, the court has the power to require the attendance of any person as a witness, and to examine such a witness even if they are not called by either of the opposing parties. Witnesses are required to answer all questions posed to them, but none of their answers may be admitted as evidence against them in future court proceedings except in cases of perjury proceeding against the witness in respect of the evidence given.|$|E

Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> armchair with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble.

The video continues with the singer performing dance routines throughout; interspersed are scenes of Usher singing the song on a background of blue pipes.
