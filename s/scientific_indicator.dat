40|$|In {{sustainability}} impact assessments {{the development}} of widely accepted indicators that structure the subject area and {{provide the framework for}} assessing sustainability impacts is clearly important. We argue that {{the development of}} sustainability indicators in science-based initiatives works across the science/policy interface where social and natural scientists as well as stakeholders and policy-makers both translate concepts and ideas to each other and thus make value judgments about the selection of indicators and related sub-classes. This explains why pure <b>scientific</b> <b>indicator</b> initiatives based on simple ‘knowledge transfer’ models are unlikely to succeed. Instead, sustainability indicator development requires a ‘knowledge transaction model’ which spans the boundary between the scientific and the political domains...|$|E
40|$|Background Nickel is an {{essential}} trace metal naturally found in the environment. It is also common in occupational settings, where it associates with various levels of both occupational and non-occupational exposure In vitro {{studies have shown that}} nickel exposure can lead to intracel-lular accumulation of Ni 2 +, which has been associated with global decreases in DNA methylation, increases in chromatin condensation, reductions in H 3 K 9 me 2, and elevated levels of H 3 K 4 me 3. Histone modifications {{play an important role in}} modulating chromatin structure and gene expression. For example, tri-methylation of histone H 3 k 4 has been found to be associated with transcriptional activation, and tri-methylation of H 3 k 27 has been found to be associated with transcriptional repression. Aberrant histone modifications have been found to be associated with various human diseases, including cancer.

One hundred and forty subjects with occupational exposure to Ni and 140 referents were recruited. H 3 K 4 and H 3 K 27 trimethylation levels were measured in subjects' blood cells. H 3 K 4 me 3 levels were found to be higher in nickel smelting workers (47. 24 ± 20. 85) than in office workers (22. 65 ± 8. 81; P = 0. 000), while the opposite was found for levels of H 3 K 27 me 3 (nickel smelting workers, 13. 88 ± 4. 23; office workers, 20. 67 ± 5. 96; P = 0. 000). H 3 K 4 me 3 was positively (r = 0. 267, P = 0. 001) and H 3 K 27 was negatively (r = - 0. 684, P = 0. 000) associated with age and length of service in smelting workers.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{important}} thought-experiments {{are associated}} with the work of Hilary Putnam, one designed to establish multiple realizabi-lity for mental kinds, the other designed to establish essentialism for natural kinds. Comparing the thought-experiments with each other reveals that the scenarios in both are structurally analogous to each other, though his intuitions in both are greatly at variance, intuitions that have been simultaneously well received. The intuition in the former implies a thesis that prioritizes pre-scientific over <b>scientific</b> <b>indicators</b> for identifying mental kinds in certain circumstances, while his intuition in the latter implies a converse thesis, prioritizing <b>scientific</b> over pre-scientific <b>indicators</b> for identifying natural kinds in analogous circumstances. In this paper I question whether we can consistently endorse both of these intuitions. A consideration is presented to attempt to justify the common intuition found in the multiple realization thought-experiment. Then it is argued that this same consideration has application in the structurally analogous Twin-Earth thought-experiment.

40|$|Water is of {{paramount}} importance to the Arabana {{people who live in the}} Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre region. Assessing the ongoing condition of aquatic ecosystems is an important part of management. Development of indicator frameworks that can incorporate both scientific and cultural values can ensure Indigenous involvement in management, but also facilitate ways in which local and traditional knowledge can be acknowledged as being of value. This project aimed to identify and document the values and indicators for water systems held by the Arabana people with the view to developing ideas about how future assessments across the whole region may: (i) engage with and then, (ii) build a template for cultural indicators across the whole region. This project was implemented using Indigenist and participant methodologies. Arabana people were employed as co-researchers. Three field trips and meetings were held to identify Arabana values for, and indicators about, water in their country. Results indicate that Arabana people value water in multiple ways including for survival, culture and identity. Interestingly, Arabana people also valued water variability and its absence: historical, dry or degraded water sites were noted as significant. Arabana people used a number of indicators or ‘signs’ to assess the ongoing condition of a site. This included flora, fauna, soil, knowledge, history, use, and pressure indicators. In many ways, the cultural indicators used by Arabana people have complementarity with <b>scientific</b> <b>indicators</b> and thus have potential to be built on and then implemented in conjunction with other indicator suites. A cultural indicator schemata is presented as is a co-engagement model for use in wider assessments with other Indigenous groups. However, this research concludes that it is not possible to develop a generic template for integration of all indicators across the region and questions whether or not this is really necessary. Ultimately, what is required is funding and investment into each Indigenous group across the Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre region to support each group to develop their own specific schemata (based potentially on the one we suggest here), and then allocation of funds to train and employ Indigenous people to implement them. The knowledge set built over time in this manner, especially if grounded in the principles of co-existence rather than integration, will also facilitate the conditions for effective and adaptive management. It will be a true complement to <b>scientific</b> <b>indicators</b> and knowledge, while respecting and incorporating Indigenous people aspirations in the region. Nursey-Bray.
