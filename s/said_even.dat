Federal and state campaign records show that, since late 2001, {{she had received}} nearly $180,000 in commissions from for such fundraising. This meant that Doolittle {{and his family had}} personally made money off his political fundraising. Doolittle aides <b>said</b> <b>even</b> though the PAC had made payments to other fundraisers, Julie Doolittle was entitled to 15 percent of all money the PAC brought in because those donations were raised at events she helped organize.|$|E
25|$|If a cow had {{two black}} or white hairs growing within one follicle, it was invalid. Rabbi Judah <b>said</b> <b>even</b> within one hollow. If the hairs grew within two {{adjacent}} follicles, the cow was invalid. Rabbi Akiva ruled that {{even if there were}} four or even five non-red hairs, if they were dispersed, they could be plucked out. Rabbi Eliezer ruled that even as many as 50 such hairs could be plucked. But Rabbi Joshua ben Bathyra ruled that even if it had only one non-red hair on its head and one on its tail, it was invalid. If the cow had two hairs in one follicle with their roots black and their tips red or with their roots red and their tips black, Rabbi Meir taught that what was visible determined validity; but the Sages ruled that validity followed the root.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} an etrog that is stolen or {{withered}} is invalid. If the larger {{part of it}} is covered with scars, or if its nipple is removed, if it is peeled, split, perforated, so that any part is missing, it is invalid. If only its lesser part is covered with scars, if its stalk was missing, or if it is perforated but nothing of it is missing, it is valid. A dark-colored etrog is invalid. If it is green as a leek, Rabbi Meir declares it valid and Rabbi Judah declares it invalid. Rabbi Meir taught that the minimum size of an etrog is that of a nut. Rabbi Judah taught that it is that of an egg. Rabbi Judah taught that the maximum size is such that two can be held in one hand. Rabbi Jose <b>said</b> <b>even</b> one that can be hold only in both hands.|$|E

25|$|Two {{institutions}} may be <b>said</b> <b>even</b> {{under the}} Second Empire to have retained their freedom: the Institute of France and the Protestant Consistory. In {{both of these}} Guizot continued to the last {{to take an active}} part. He was a member of three of the five academies into which the Institute of France is divided. The Academy of Moral and Political Science owed its restoration to him, and he became in 1832 one of its first associates. The Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres elected him in 1833 as the successor to Dacier, and in 1836 he was chosen a member of the Académie Française, the highest literary distinction of the country. In these learned bodies Guizot continued for nearly forty years to take a lively interest and to exercise a powerful influence. He was the jealous champion of their independence. His voice had the greatest weight in the choice of new candidates; the younger generation of French writers never looked in vain to him for encouragement, and his constant aim was to maintain the dignity and purity of the profession of letters. In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E

Although {{he was one of the}} longest-serving mayors of any city in United States history (1942 until his death in 1983), one historian describes Corning's tenure as [...] "long on years, short on accomplishments." [...] Grondahl cited Corning's preference for maintaining the status quo as a factor that held back potential progress during his tenure. While Corning brought stability to the office of mayor, it is <b>said</b> <b>even</b> those who admire him greatly cannot come up with a sizable list of [...] "major concrete Corning achievements."

Scott left his starring role on the Starz comedy series Party Down to join Parks and Recreation, and Lowe had recently departed from the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters. From the beginning, Scott was expected to become a regular cast member and, during the third season, eventual love interest for Leslie Knope, while Lowe was originally only intended to make a string of guest appearances in the third season and then depart the series. However, Lowe later signed a multi-year contract to become a regular cast member.

500|$|Till's case {{attracted}} widespread {{attention because}} of the brutality of the lynching, the victim's young age, and the acquittal {{of the two men}} who later admitted killing him. It became emblematic of the injustices suffered by blacks in the South. In 1955 The Chicago Defender urged its readers to react to the acquittal by voting in large numbers; this was to counter the disenfranchisement since 1890 of most blacks in Mississippi by the white-dominated legislature; other southern states followed this model, excluding hundreds of thousands of citizens from politics. [...] Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, said in 1985 that Till's case resonated so strongly because it [...] "shook the foundations of Mississippi—both black and white, because...with the white community...it had become nationally publicized...with us as blacks...it <b>said,</b> <b>even</b> a child was not safe from racism and bigotry and death." ...|$|E

[...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from In a Perfect World.... According to J.K.

After playing for the Comte de Paris, the Frenchmen wanted Adams to state his figures for an indefinite period. Adams also played for three Presidents of the United States; while in New York he was paid $100 per night by the Vanderbilt and Gould families.

500|$|Prosecutors {{agreed that}} Cisneros was guilty {{under the law}} of the parties - that she was guilty of the crime of murder even though she did not commit the crime directly. However, {{prosecutors}} failed to word her charge appropriately, suggesting that Cisneros [...] "directly" [...] hired Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez to murder Fischer instead of working through intermediaries. On February 14, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi ordered Cisneros released on a US$50,000 bond, about one-sixth of the original bond posted for her trial. The order stated that the prosecution did not agree to the bail, but the document stated they had failed to file the appropriate paperwork within the mandatory ten days. On February 22, a judge ordered her released from prison. She was unavailable for comment, and it was not known if she returned to Brownsville. Fischer's family denounced the ruling and said the appeals court [...] "seemed to have lost sight" [...] that their son was killed. Brownsville prosecutors <b>said</b> <b>even</b> if there was not enough evidence to convict Cisneros for capital murder, she could still be convicted of ordinary murder, since the appeal was approved because there was no direct evidence linking Cisneros with a murder-for-hire charge. The reversal was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in November 1996.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought that [...] "the out-takes [...] up to standard" [...] {{and said that the}} episode {{contains}} [...] "a number of great self-referential moments". Simone Knox praised its visual style in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of [...] "The Simpsons". The episode itself has been described by some critics as a kind of self-imposed benchmark of the show itself, with writer Bill Keveney commenting, [...] "the show picks its own benchmarks, as it did in 1995". Knox referred to it as not simply a clip show, but a clip show [...] "that looks at the series with a sense of hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson <b>said</b> <b>even</b> though the episode is a clip show, it [...] "gussies up the concept with some interesting elements, and keeps repetitive material to a minimum. Instead, it offers lots of then-unseen footage as well as old snippets from The Tracey Ullman Show. It still feels like a cheap way to crank out a new episode, but it’s one of the better clip shows you’ll see." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade and commented, [...] "apart from the creative material, what really makes this [...] shine is the hilarious hosting by Troy McClure." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times criticized the episode: [...] "Despite some interesting concepts such as a bored Troy McClure presenting to much amusement and the presence of deleted scenes and Tracey Ullman shorts amongst the clips, this is an episode that tries hard to find a hook but never quite manages, assuring it'll never make it into regular rotation on this viewer's watch." ...|$|E
