The average quantum well composition measured by atom probe tomography and quantitative {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} quantitatively agrees with measurements by X-ray diffraction. Atom probe tomography is further applied to study the distribution of indium atoms in non-polar a-plane (11 - 20) InGaN quantum wells. An inhomogeneous indium distribution is observed by frequency distribution analysis of the atom probe tomography measurements. The optical properties of non-polar (11 - 20) InGaN quantum wells with indium compositions varying from 7. 9 % to 20. 6 % are studied. In contrast to non-polar m-plane (1 - 100) InGaN quantum wells, the non-polar a-plane (11 - 20) InGaN quantum wells emit at longer emission wavelengths at the equivalent indium composition.

Commun. 133, 496 (1997) ]. Energy spectra of charged fusion products have been obtained from two spectrometers, and have been used to deduce various physical quantities in imploded capsules. In this paper the first use of 14. 7 MeV deuterium-helium 3 (D-[sup 3]He) proton spectra for diagnosing shell areal density (&# 0961;R) and fuel ion temperature (T[sub i]) is discussed. For thick-plastic shell capsules, shell areal densities between 20 and 70 mg/cm 2 and ion temperatures between 3 and 5 keV have been determined. The <b>spectral</b> <b>linewidths</b> associated with such capsules are found to be wider than the doppler widths.

50|$|In physics, {{monochromatic}} light is electromagnetic radiation {{of a single}} frequency. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic, since that would require a wave of infinite duration {{as a consequence of}} the Fourier transform's localization property (cf. spectral coherence). Even very controlled sources such as lasers operate in a range of frequencies (known as the <b>spectral</b> <b>linewidth).</b> In practice, filtered light, diffraction grating separated light and laser light are all routinely referred to as monochromatic. Often light sources can be compared and one be labeled as “more monochromatic” (in a similar usage as monodispersity).

Despite significant strain-field relaxation in the high-aspect-ratio nanowires, we achieve up to 1. 2 meV tuning of a dot's transition energy.

5000|$|Up to now, {{a typical}} one-component PDV {{instrument}} utilizes a pulsed injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser, {{one or two}} scientific grade CCD cameras and a molecular iodine filter. The laser is used to illuminate a plane of the flow with narrow <b>spectral</b> <b>linewidth</b> light. The Doppler shifted scattered light is then split into two paths using a beamsplitter and imaged onto the camera(s). In this manner the absolute absorption of scattered light, as it passes through an iodine cell placed {{in one of the}} beam paths, is measured at every spatial location within the object plane. For scattering by relatively large (i.e. Mie scattering) particles, this absorption is a function of particle velocity alone. Accurate calibration and image mapping algorithms have been developed with the result that velocity accuracies of ~1-2 m/s are possible. More details concerning the history of PDV, the art of its application and recent advances can be found in comprehensive review articles by Elliott and Beutner (1999) and Samimy and Wernet (2000).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of an {{idealized}} two-level atom the detailed balance for the emission and absorption which preserves the Planck formula for the black-body radiation leads to equality of cross-section of absorption and emission. In the solid-state lasers the splitting of each of laser levels leads to the broadening which greatly exceeds the natural <b>spectral</b> <b>linewidth.</b> In {{the case of}} an ideal two-level atom, the product of the linewidth and the lifetime is of order of unity, which obeys the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In solid-state laser materials, the linewidth is several orders of magnitude larger so the spectra of emission and absorption are determined by distribution of excitation among sublevels rather than by the shape of the spectral line of each individual transition between sublevels. This distribution is determined by the effective temperature within each of laser levels. The McCumber hypothesis is that the distribution of excitation among sublevels is thermal. The effective temperature determines the spectra of emission and absorption ( [...] The effective temperature is called a temperature by scientists even if the excited medium as whole is pretty far from the thermal state [...] ) ...|$|E
5000|$|Neodymium-doped {{solid state}} lasers {{continue}} to be the laser source of choice for industrial applications. Direct pumping of the upper Nd laser level at 885-nm (rather than at the more traditional broad 808-nm band) offers the potential of improved performance through a reduction in the lasing quantum defect, thereby improving system efficiency, reducing cooling requirements, and enabling further TEM00 power scaling. Because of the narrow 885-nm absorption feature in Nd:YAG, certain systems may benefit from the use of wavelength-locked diode pump sources, which serve to narrow and stabilize the pump emission spectrum to keep it closely aligned to this absorption feature. To date, high power diode laser locking schemes such as internal distributed feedback Bragg gratings and externally aligned volume holographic grating optics, VHG’s, have not been widely implemented due to the increased cost and assumed performance penalty of the technology. However, recent advancements in the manufacture of stabilized diode pump sources which utilize external wavelength locking now offer improved spectral properties with little-to-no impact on power and efficiency. [...] Benefits of this approach include improvements in laser efficiency, <b>spectral</b> <b>linewidth,</b> and pumping efficiency.|$|E
