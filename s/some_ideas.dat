Super Mario Sunshine was first shown at Nintendo Space World 2001. The game was later shown again at E3 2002.|$|E

He also stated that he had <b>some</b> <b>ideas</b> for new songs, and that the band would be soon starting to make a new album. On June 9, 2014, Deryck Whibley has stated {{on his personal}} Facebook page that he was working on new Sum 41 music out of his home studio to get ready to record some new tunes.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding {{a fistful of}} dollars. The club {{officials}} were all set to go with this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also <b>some</b> <b>ideas</b> that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E

500|$|The I Ching itself, shorn of its commentaries, {{consists}} of 64 combinations of 8 trigrams (called [...] "hexagrams"), traditionally chosen by throwing coins or yarrow sticks, {{to give the}} diviner <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> of the situation at hand and, through reading of the [...] "changing lines", <b>some</b> <b>idea</b> of what is developing.|$|R
5|$|The team {{wanted the}} theme of the game to {{resonate}} with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. Although the framework of the story was completed prior to Studio Ghibli's involvement with the game, they still took part in many discussions regarding <b>some</b> <b>ideas,</b> including the game's final scenes.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on <b>some</b> <b>ideas</b> by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
5|$|When Devon Banks, the Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content, and Theme Park Talent Relations {{visits from}} Los Angeles, Jack fears {{that he is}} trying to take his job. After having his {{assistant}} Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with <b>some</b> <b>ideas</b> so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. <b>Some</b> <b>ideas</b> thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{with several}} {{previous}} Bond films, {{the story from}} Fleming's novel is almost entirely dispensed with, and {{little more than the}} name of Hugo Drax was used in film, in favour of a film more in keeping with the era of science fiction. The 2002 Bond film Die Another Day makes further use of <b>some</b> <b>ideas</b> and character names from the novel. Tom Mankiewicz wrote a short outline for Moonraker that was mostly discarded. According to Mankiewicz, footage shot at Drax's lairs was considerably more detailed than the edited result in the final version. The crew had shot a scene with Drax meeting his co-financiers in his jungle lair and they used the same chamber room below the space shuttle launch pad that Bond and Goodhead eventually escape from. This scene was shot but later cut out. Another scene involving Bond and Goodhead in a meditation room aboard Drax's space station, was shot but never used in the final film. However, press stills were released of the scene which featured on Topps trading cards in 1979 as was a cinema trailer which featured a close-up of Jaws' reaction after Bond punches him in the face aboard the space station, neither of which featured in the complete film. Some scenes from Mankiewicz's script were later used in subsequent films, including the Acrostar Jet sequence used in the pre-credit sequence for Octopussy, and the Eiffel Tower scene in A View to a Kill.|$|E
