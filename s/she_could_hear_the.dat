500|$|... "All Is Full of Love", {{the closing}} track of Homogenic, was the album's last song {{to be written}} and recorded. Produced by Björk, the {{original}} version of the song was replaced [...] "at the last minute" [...] by Howie B's version. It {{was inspired by the}} spring while producing the album in Málaga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Björk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then she realized it was spring after <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.|$|E
60|$|And {{all around}} was this cradle of snow, {{and there was}} firm snow underfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles. It was night, and silence. She {{imagined}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> stars. She imagined distinctly <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> celestial, musical motion of the stars, quite near at hand. She seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you quite well, Elsa?" [...] {{he asked}} {{after a long}} pause, during which the girl thought that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> beating of her own heart.|$|E
60|$|Ten days passed. All <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>the</b> Baron {{were the}} same words, 'Bad abed,' till one afternoon, after a gallop of the {{physician}} to the Lodge, the tidings spread like lightning that the Baron was dying.|$|R
60|$|At {{once all}} the lights went out, for the fire-flies fled in every direction; but in the {{darkness}} Twinkle thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> drone of the big bass fiddle and the flute-like trill of the ladybugs.|$|R
60|$|Presently the hen espied {{a hollow}} {{underneath}} the King's rocky throne, and crept into it unnoticed. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> chattering {{of those around}} her, but it was almost dark underneath the throne, so that soon she had fallen fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|Outside, in the {{darkness}} of the tangled jungle, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> roaring of lions, the laughing of hyenas, and the countless, nameless noises of the midnight jungle.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{steps of}} her uncle approaching, and the {{situation}} flashed upon her, luminous and clear. She hurriedly folded the {{sheet of paper and}} thrust it into her bosom.|$|E
6000|$|Paula drooped, {{and sighed}} inaudibly, and, {{as she went}} down the room and out the door, and as Bonbright stepped eagerly forward with the telegrams, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of her husband's conversation: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you stand}} it?" [...] and glared as if insane. Her eyes blazed, too. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> appalling clamour of his thoughts. She {{suspected}} {{in him a}} sudden regret, a fresh fit of jealousy, a dishonest desire of evasion. She shouted back angrily-- ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Schuyler {{strained}} her ears, but, {{though the}} horses were walking now, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing. <b>The</b> deep silence round them was emphasized by the soft trample of the hoofs and thin jingle of steel that seemed unreal and out of place there in the wilderness of snow and stars.|$|R
6000|$|Benita {{sank to the}} ground, and {{the next}} thing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{remember}} was <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> soft voice of Jacob Meyer, who said: ...|$|R
60|$|A {{high wind}} howled {{among the trees}} outside the house; Dea could hear the tiny {{branches}} cracking under the whip-lash of the blast, breaking away from the parent stem and sending an eddy of dry dead leaves whirling wildly along the narrow streets and into the open portals of the vestibule. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> fall of the torrential rain, and the flames, which sacrilegious hands had kindled, dying away with long-drawn-out hissing moans of pain. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> wind in its rage lashing those flames back into life again, and {{could see through the}} opening overhead the huge volumes of black smoke chased across the sky.|$|E
60|$|It grew dark; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{whisper of}} the waves upon Bryngelly beach. It grew dark; the night was closing round. She paddled to within a few fathoms of the shore, and called in her clear voice.|$|E
60|$|Close to {{her there}} was the {{snorting}} of horses, the clanging and noise of moving mounted men. Heron's coach had taken the lead; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> creaking of its wheels, the calls of the driver urging his beasts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here," [...] said I, lifting {{my finger}} at the same time. <b>She</b> hesitated; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> words amidst the uproar now pervading both school-rooms; I {{repeated}} the sign; she approached; again she paused within half a yard of the estrade, and looked shy, and still doubtful whether she had mistaken my meaning.|$|R
60|$|Jess {{was outside}} the tent again, the red knife in her hand. She flung the accursed thing from her. That shriek must have awakened every soul within a mile. Already <b>she</b> <b>could</b> faintly <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> stir of men down by the waggon, and the patter of the feet of Jantje running for his life.|$|R
60|$|There {{was dead}} silence. As she stood there, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> again <b>the</b> ticking of the clock, and the chock of piles of books {{taken out of}} the low cupboard. Then came the faint flap of books on the desks. The {{children}} passed in silence, their hands working in unison. They were no longer a pack, but each one separated into a silent, closed thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, ma'am; Mr. Fiorsen and Count Rosek {{went into}} the country this afternoon. I haven't their address at present." [...] She must have turned white, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> man saying: [...] "Anything I can get you, ma'am?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{through all}} her {{thoughts}} passed the rider who even now was thundering over the green sward {{on his way}} to her. In her fancy at first, and later in her ears, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of his sweeping gallop.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} of several {{persons in the}} next room now. The voices of women and children came to her distinctly. Many of the words were Japanese, but others were of a tongue with which she was not familiar.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> herself <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} {{tears in her}} own voice, {{and she began to}} cry again. He did not answer, but went on with his work. She waited a few minutes, in anguish. Fear came over her, she was panic-stricken with terror, like a child; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not go home again to her father; she was held by the power in this man who had taken her.|$|R
60|$|But Grace's fear {{just now}} was not imaginative or spiritual, and she heeded these {{impressions}} but little. She {{went on as}} silently as <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> avoiding the hollows wherein leaves had accumulated, and stepping upon soundless moss and grass-tufts. She paused breathlessly once or twice, and fancied that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear,</b> above <b>the</b> beat of her strumming pulse, the vehicle containing Fitzpiers turning in at the gate of her father's premises. She hastened on again.|$|R
50|$|By Lilith's own account, {{she fled}} the Garden of Eden over irreconcilable {{differences}} with Adam, {{but not before}} witnessing the Word of God (possibly as Lucifer was expelled from Heaven). Adam and Lilith represented the image of God, halved into masculine and feminine sides. Therefore, when Lilith witnesses the Word of God, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> feminine side of it. She later invoked it to escape the Garden of Eden.|$|R
6000|$|Yet he came not, and {{the stillness}} [...] Dampened round {{her like a}} tomb; She could feel cold eyes of spirits [...] Looking on her through the gloom, <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> groping {{footsteps}} [...] Of some blind, gigantic doom.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> servant {{showing the}} visitor into the room, {{shutting}} the door upon him, and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress. Lucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting. The man before her was not Henchard.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned off}} the gas at the meter, and went upstairs to bed. From the far room <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> gentle, but {{profound}} vibrations of Geoffrey's snoring. She was tired after her day: too tired to trouble about anything any more.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing through <b>the</b> floor, {{although}} she listened intently, and thereupon {{went to the}} kitchen to finish her interrupted breakfast. Coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor she took up some sewing, waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might take away the breakfast, which she meant to do herself, to discover what was the matter if possible. Overhead, as <b>she</b> sat, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> now <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> floorboards slightly creak, as if some one were walking about, and presently the movement was explained by the rustle of garments against the banisters, the opening and the closing of the front door, and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her way into the street. She was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a well-to-do young lady in which she had arrived, with the sole addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled himself}} up. There {{was a risk}} that he might say too much, and while he hesitated Evelyn listened. The door was open {{and the house was}} quiet, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> click of the billiard balls. It looked as if Dick and Carrie had {{finished}} their game, {{there was no time for}} clever maneuvering; she must be frank. She gave Jim a quick glance and then looked away.|$|R
60|$|Faint {{and miserable}} as Jenny seemed to be, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> allusion to her exploit during {{the storm of}} the Castle, without {{bursting}} into a laugh which weakness soon converted into a hysterical giggle. Confounded at her state, and reflecting with horror on the distress which {{must have been in}} the Castle, Morton repeated his commands to Headrigg in a peremptory manner; and when he had departed, endeavoured to soothe his visitor.|$|R
6000|$|Yet he came not, and {{the stillness}} [...] Dampened round {{her like a}} tomb; [...] She could feel cold eyes of spirits [...] Looking on her through the gloom, [...] <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> groping {{footsteps}} [...] Of some blind, gigantic doom.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had begun}} a hymn; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> ninth baronet across the aisle, singing of the hosts of Midian. Her little finger touched Val's thumb--they were holding the same hymn-book--and a tiny thrill passed through her, preserved--from twenty years ago. He stooped and whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{entrance}} of Queen Berengaria {{into the interior}} of Richard's pavilion was withstood--in the most respectful and reverential manner indeed, but still withstood--by the chamberlains who watched in the outer tent. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> stern command of the King from within, prohibiting their entrance.|$|E
6000|$|A {{lady with}} one of her ears applied [...] To an open keyhole heard, inside, [...] Two female gossips in {{converse}} free-- [...] The subject engaging them was she. [...] "I think," [...] said one, [...] "and my husband thinks [...] That she's a prying, inquisitive minx!" [...] As soon as no more of it <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> [...] <b>The</b> lady, indignant, removed her ear. [...] "I will not stay," [...] she said, with a pout, [...] "To hear my character lied about!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{then waited}} a moment or two, whilst he closed both the shutter and the window, she {{standing}} the while on the stone step before the portico. In <b>the</b> stillness <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him open <b>the</b> drawing-room door, then cross the hall and finally unbolt the heavy outer door.|$|R
6000|$|The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook {{over her}} head, [...] <b>She</b> listen'd,--nought else <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>The</b> wind ceas'd, her heart sunk in her bosom with dread For she {{heard in the}} ruins {{distinctly}} the tread [...] Of footsteps approaching her near.|$|R
