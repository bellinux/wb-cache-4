These are usually taken to include rubbing the ball on the ground, scuffing with a fingernail or other sharp object, or tampering with the seam of the ball.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subsection</b> <b>3</b> {{reveals an}} {{abandonment}} of the cleared areas, the decline of Olea, {{and the spread of}} Pistacia, Pinus brutia and Quercus coccifera (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As {{this is the time of}} the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Montana voters {{adopted a}} new {{constitution}} which greatly expanded the state's treatment of water and water rights. Article IX, Section 3, Subsection 1 recognized and confirmed all existing water rights. Subsection 2 reiterated the 1889 constitution's wording, with only minor and non-substantive changes. <b>Subsection</b> <b>3,</b> however, established state ownership of all waters (atmospheric and ground, as well as surface) within the state, declared them available solely {{for the use of}} the people, and declared that appropriation of water must be for beneficial purposes. Subsection 4 required the state to administer, control, and regulate water rights, and to establish a centralized record of such rights. At no time did the 1971 constitutional convention recognize the control over Native American water rights exercised by the federal government under Winters and Powers.|$|E

[...] On July 1, 1973, the state adopted model legislation known as the Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act (Montana Code Ann. 87-5-101-132), which required the state Fish and Game Commission to identify and protect threatened and endangered wildlife, conduct research on non-game and endangered species, and acquire and manage habitat for their use.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the Fourth Circuit's narrow {{interpretation}} of the Act's public accommodations provision in the Denny decision wrongly constricts the Act's broad remedial purpose. Part I outlines the creation, existence, and debilitation of the Act. Part II describes the Fourth Circuit's ruling in Denny. Part III {{argues that the}} Fourth Circuit wrongly decided the public accommodations issue in Denny. Specifically, the Court erred by imposing a strict statutory approach to interpreting <b>subsection</b> (b) (<b>3),</b> contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent. In addition, the Fourth Circuit Court's interpretation does not comport with <b>subsection</b> (b) (<b>3)</b> 's broad remedial language. Finally, Denny devalues the Act's purpose of protecting all citizens equally, regardless of race. Accordingly, if the United States Supreme Court grants certiorari, the high Court should reverse Denny v.

40|$|The English edition differs only {{slightly}} from the Russian original. The main struc­ tural difference {{is that all the}} material on the theory of finite noncooperative games has been collected in Chapter 2, with renumbering of the material of the remain­ ing chapters. New sections have been added in this chapter: devoted to general questions of equilibrium theory in nondegenerate games, <b>subsections</b> <b>3.</b> 9 - 3. 17, by N. N. Vorob'ev, Jr.; and § 4, by A. G. Chernyakov; and § 5, by N. N. Vorob'ev, Jr., on the computational complexity of the process of finding equilibrium points in finite games. It should also be mentioned that <b>subsections</b> <b>3.</b> 12 - 3. 14 in Chapter 1 were written by E. B. Yanovskaya especially for the Russian edition. The author regrets that the present edition does not reflect the important game-theoretical achievements presented in the splendid monographs by E. van Damme (on the refinement of equilibrium principles for finite games), as well as those by J. e. Harsanyi and R. Selten, and by W. Giith and B. Kalkofen (on equilibrium selection). When the Russian edition was being written, these direc­ tions in game theory had not yet attained their final form, which appeared only in quite recent monographs; the present author has had to resist the temptation of attempting to produce an elementary exposition of the new theories for the English edition; readers of this edition will find only brief mention of the new material...|$|R
