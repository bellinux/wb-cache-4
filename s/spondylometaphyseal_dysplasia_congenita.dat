40|$|Skeletal dysplasias are {{challenging}} for diagnostics and treatment. We present {{a series of}} fifteen patients with different forms of skeletal dysplasias with age ranged from 6 to 17 years with variable clinical presentations managed {{as a part of}} the project of scientific cooperation between Turner Paediatric Orthopaedic Institute and Orthopaedic Hospital Vienna-Speising. The spectrum of diagnoses included multiple epiphyseal <b>dysplasia,</b> spondyloepiphyseal <b>dysplasia</b> <b>congenita,</b> diastrophic <b>dysplasia,</b> metaphyseal <b>dysplasia,</b> <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Stickler syndrome, Kniest dysplasia, and anauxetic dysplasia. Complex treatment, which included axial correction and juxta-articular realignment, was performed as a single-stage, or consecutive surgery. Surgical techniques included corrective osteotomies with internal fixation, guided growth technique and external fixation devices. Best results (full axial correction, normal alignment of the joint) were achieved in 8 patients, including 2 patients with metaphyseal dysplasia, 2 patients with multiple epyphyseal dysplasia, 2 patients with spondyloepyphyseal dysplasia, patient with Stickler syndrome and patient with <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> Good results (partial correction at the present time) were seen in 4 patients (2 patients with Kniest dysplasia, 1 - with multiple epyphyseal dysplasia and 1 - with anauxetic dysplasia). Satisfactory results (non-progressive condition in previous progression) were obtained in 2 patients with diastrophic dysplasia, and poor results (progression of the deformity) - in 1 patient with diastrophic dysplasia. Positive results in most of the cases of our series make promising future for usage of complex approach for orthopedic management of children with skeletal dysplasias; advanced international cooperation is productive and helpful for diagnostics and management of rare diseases...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{radiographic}} {{evaluation of}} an infant boy and his father revealed findings suggesting a new variant of <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> with an apparently autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The main clinical findings included short stature and marked ligamentous laxity in the infant. X-ray findings included severe and peculiar multiple metaphyseal involvement and striking vertebral undermineralisation in the infant, and platyspondyly in the father. However, all the epiphyses were normal. Laboratory studies were essentially normal except for an extremely raised serum alkaline phosphatase in the infant.

In our study, 12 patients (6 families) with H-SMD were identified and underwent comprehensive assessment accompanied by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Pedigree analysis in all families was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. Presentation typically occurred between 12 and 36 months. In addition to the two disease-defining features of <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and hypomyelination on MRI, common clinical signs and symptoms included motor deterioration, spasticity, tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, cognitive defects, pulmonary hypertension, nystagmus, and vision loss due to retinopathy. The course of the disease was slowly progressive. All patients had maternally inherited or de novo mutations in or near exon 7 of AIFM 1, within a region of 70 bp, including synonymous and intronic changes. AIFM 1 mutations have previously been associated with neurologic presentations as varied as intellectual disability, hearing loss, neuropathy, and striatal necrosis, while AIFM 1 mutations in this small region present with a distinct phenotype implicating bone. Analysis of cell lines derived from four patients identified significant reductions in AIFM 1 mRNA and protein levels in osteoblasts.

40|$|The {{features}} {{of a child with}} spondyloepiphyseal <b>dysplasia</b> <b>congenita</b> resulting from a mutation in one COL 2 A 1 allele were studied. The child was heterozygous for a G to A transition in exon 48 that resulted in the substitution of glycine 997 by serine in the triple helical domain of alpha 1 (II) chains of type II collagen. Her longitudinal growth was close to the mean growth curve for children with this chondrodysplasia. Expression of the mutation by chondrocytes would account for the abnormal growth and development of the bones of the limbs and spine. Early expression of the mutation by epithelial cells and later expression by chondrocytes of the developing craniofacial structures would also account for her complex pattern of craniofacial anomalies. The findings in this study confirm that mutations of exon 48 of the COL 2 A 1 gene, that alter the normal Gly-X-Y triplet structure of the corresponding region of alpha 1 (II) chains of type II collagen, produce the spondyloepiphyseal <b>dysplasia</b> <b>congenita</b> phenotype...|$|R

Whole-exome sequencing of four individuals affected by this disorder from two Brazilian families identified two previously unreported homozygous mutations in PCYT 1 A. This gene encodes the alpha isoform of the phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1 choline enzyme, {{which is responsible for}} converting phosphocholine into cytidine diphosphate-choline, a key intermediate step in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis pathway. A different enzymatic defect in this pathway has been previously associated with a muscular dystrophy with mitochondrial structural abnormalities that does not have cartilage and/or bone or retinal involvement.

40|$|<b>Spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (SMD) {{comprises}} {{a heterogeneous}} group of heritable skeletal dysplasias characterized by modifications of the vertebral {{bodies of the}} spine and metaphyses of the tubular bones. The genetic etiology of SMD is currently unknown; however, the type X collagen gene (COL 10 A 1) is considered an excellent candidate, for two reasons: first, Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, a condition known to result from COL 10 A 1 mutations, shows a significant phenotypic overlap with SMD; and, second, transgenic mice carrying deletions in type X collagen show SMD phenotypes. Hence, we examined the entire coding region of COL 10 A 1 by direct sequencing of DNA from five unrelated patients with SMD and found a heterozygous missense mutation (Gly 595 Glu) cosegregating with the disease phenotype in one SMD family.

Derived from the Greek opsismos ("late"), the name [...] "opsismodysplasia" [...] describes a delay in bone maturation. In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by [...] (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of ossification (bone cell formation), platyspondyly (flattened vertebrae), irregular metaphyses, an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection. Opsismodysplasia is congenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is rare, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited.

40|$|A {{child with}} spondyloepiphyseal <b>dysplasia</b> <b>congenita</b> {{was shown to}} be {{heterozygous}} for a mutation of the COL 2 A 1 gene that encodes the α 1 (II) chain of type II collagen.

Carboxymethylation confirmed {{that some of the}} type II collagen chains contained cysteine residues that are not normally present in α 1 (II) chains. Cyanogen bromide peptide mapping showed that the abnormal cysteine residue was located in the α 1 (II) CB 10. 5 peptide. Amplification products of the corresponding region of α 1 (II) cDNA prepared from cultured dermal fibroblasts were shown by chemical cleavage and single strand conformation polymorphism analyses to contain a sequence anomaly. DNA sequencing showed a transition of C 2913 T in exon 41 of one allele of the COL 2 A 1 gene resulting in the substitution of arginine 789 by cysteine in the α 1 (II) chain. The mutation resulted in the loss of a MaeII cleavage site that was used to confirm that the proband was heterozygous for the mutation and that neither parent showed evidence of the mutation. The type II collagen extracted from cartilage and from chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads showed similar characteristics. Approximately a third of the type II collagen chains were mutant, and the secretion of molecules containing mutant chains was impaired.
