40|$|Laser {{cleaning}} is an optodynamic {{process in}} which the optically induced removal of a liquid or a <b>solid</b> <b>contaminant</b> from a substrate is accompanied by a optoacoustic wave in the surrounding air. In our experiments we used both dry and steam laser-cleaning techniques for various samples. Optoacoustic wave, produced by the abrupt heating and detachment of the contaminants, was observed with a probe-beam deflection technique. We determined two characteristic parameters of the optoacoustic wave: the amplitude and the time-of-flight of the acoustic signal. With an analysis of these waves we also determined possible generating mechanisms. The decrease of the amplitude and the velocity of propagation, which approaches sonic speed, of the consecutive waves indicate that the dynamics during the laser-cleaning process is progressively weakened. The cleaning process is over when both the parameters reach a constant value, so with measuring optoacoustic waves the progress of the cleaning process could be observed on-line...|$|E

The tribological tests were performed using 0. 63, 0. 85 and 1. 1 m s- 1 average sliding speeds and 120 N contact load to mimic the boundary lubrication regime of the sliding reciprocating motion of the piston ring/liner interface in an engine. The presence of the <b>solid</b> <b>contaminants</b> in engine oils leads to an increase in friction coefficient, wear and frictional power losses, increasing the surfaces roughness as a consequence.

40|$|With {{increasing}} demand in industry to produce solid-solid bonds, {{the need for}} their quantitative characterization, {{particularly with respect to}} their strength, becomes more urgent. In the present paper, restricted to diffusion bonds in metallic systems, we define strength as the ultimate engineering stress achieved in a uniaxial tensile test at slow strain rate. It is assumed that the reduction of strength is basically determined by a lack of metallic bonding over a fraction of the total area to be bonded, with metallically bonded areas being separated by crack-shaped voids. In the present paper, these voids are considered to contain a vacuum or, at most, a low pressure gas. In principle, they could be filled with some form of a <b>solid</b> <b>contaminant</b> (oxide, e. g.) which increases the complexity of the analysis[1].

More than 80 % of severe damages can be referred back to the effects of fluid contamination. The traditional approach tothe solution of this problem is the introduction of properly designed filtration elements combined with the developmentof filtration strategies tailored for every application need. This approach can be considered substantially passive in nature,since it allows the contaminant to be present in the fluid and provides means for its removal in order to keep eitherdistribution or density of solid particles within prescribed limits. The passive approach, however, does not allow anydynamic estimation of the damages caused to components by fluid contamination, and the knowledge gained on thecorrelation of fluid contamination to component damage is mainly empirical in nature.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing ball bearings service life is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and ball bearings dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of ball bearings also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of ball bearings thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of <b>solid</b> <b>contaminant</b> particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between ball bearings temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical conveyor idlers bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants. Applied experimental methodology included thermographic inspection, as well as usage of custom designed test rig for ball bearings service life testing. Finally, by obtained experimental data processing in advanced software, statistically significant mathematical correlation between mentioned bearings characteristics was determined and applied in commonly used internal radial clearance equation. That is the most important contribution of performed research - the new equation and methodology for ball bearings internal clearance determination which could be used for eventual improvement of existing bearings service life equations.

40|$|Al-Montaser Bellah Al-Ajlony. Ph. D., Purdue University, May 2014. Radiation Induced Surface Modification and Contamination for EUV Lithography and Fusion Applications. Major Professor: Ahmed Hassanein. The {{effect of}} {{ionizing}} radiation on materials surfaces is of major interest for many engineering applications. The {{importance of this}} topic rises from {{the severity of the}} implications that a surface at a certain application might suffer due its interaction with some sort of ionizing radiation. The severity of implication is not always related to the severity of the radiation, in many applications the concern comes from the over-sensitivity of the surface to a low doses of radiations. One example of these sensitive applications is the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) induced surface contaminations of the optics in EUV lithography devices. In this application, a small dose of ionizing radiation (EUV at 13. 5 nm wavelength) can cause slight change in the chemical composition of the irradiated surface. This change in chemical composition can cause large change in the surface optical properties of the irradiated surface (EUV optics). This degradation in reflectivity is an issue that needs to be avoided. ^ On the other extreme where intense radiation is implemented, the main concern of the radiation-surface interaction comes from the severity of the irradiation process. The plasma-facing component (PFC) in future thermonuclear devices represent the ultimate example where the materials might be exposed to severe irradiation processes. Under such extreme irradiation processes, some candidate PFC materials exhibit the formation of very fine and fragile nanostructure (Fuzz) that can be washed out into the fusion device plasma and stop the fusion reaction. These two extreme examples of the radiation-surface interaction were selected to be my PhD research topic. ^ The change in chemical properties of Ru surface during exposure to a 13. 5 nm wavelength of EUV light radiation was investigated. This study shows a real time tracking to {{the early stages of the}} EUV induced carbon contamination process. In another similar study, The changes of chemical composition of Ru mirror surface during 100 eV electron bombardments have been studied using XPS. The reason behind coupling these two studies is due to the fact that the mechanism by which the EUV radiation can alter the chemical composition of the mirror surface is between two main mechanisms; photons dissociation and secondary electrons dissociation processes. ^ Although the results obtained by these two studies were useful to understand the mechanisms in which the surface composition can be altered during the EUV exposure, many vital details about the gradual transformation of the adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules to carbon rich <b>solid</b> <b>contaminant</b> layer are not well understood. These important information was hidden beneath the photoelectron signal interference between the Ru 3 d lines and the C 1 s line. For this reason we also extensively studied this transformation during the EUV irradiation by changing the target materials to Au. Due to this reason, the changes in surface properties of Au surface in a high vacuum atmosphere during EUV exposure have been also studied. ^ One of the most important finding we observed during the last three studies is that, the adsorption process is at the very early stage of the EUV induced contamination process. Therefore, the rate of adsorption on the irradiated surface always govern the rate of the entire contamination process. In attempt to understand the impact of the low energy electron irradiation on the kinetics of the adsorption process, we also investigated the impact of 100 eV electron beam on the physisorption of hydrocarbons and water molecules on Au surfaces. ^ After this study we moved to the second part of the selected research topic which was investigating the surface morphology evolution of the W surface exposed to high flux of He ion irradiation. Our first investigation was an attempt to understand the basic parameters under which this interesting phenomenon of fuzz formation occurs. For this reason, a series of pure W samples were irradiated by high fluxes of low energy He+ ions of high doses at 900 °C. The phenomenon of He ions induced fuzz formation was the most prominent observation that has been noticed in most of the irradiation cases. Several attempts have been made to understand this phenomenon by varying many irradiation parameters such as irradiation dose, ions flux, and the energy of incident He ions. We also studied the effect of carbon contaminations on the He induced surface morphology evolution of W target. ...|$|E

In particular, this work quantifies the effect 100 % RCA has on the drying shrinkage of the resulting concrete.
