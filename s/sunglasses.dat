5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop {{at the back}} of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can {{discourage}} the bird. A basic disguise such as <b>sunglasses</b> worn on the back of the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial at}} the upper {{regional}} court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009. It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens. All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues, due to the security concerns, the great interest by the national and international media, and the public. El-Sherbini's widower, brother and parents acted {{in the role of}} 'co-claimant' and were represented by eight lawyers. On {{the first day of the}} trial, the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany, France and Egypt was present in court; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask, <b>sunglasses,</b> hat and a hood. The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth. The defendant complied, except for removing his <b>sunglasses,</b> for which he was fined for contempt of court. The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds of bias as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene. This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where Azalea rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark <b>sunglasses</b> awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building.

Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and <b>sunglasses.</b> The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} of the first series, Macfadyen, along with co stars Keeley Hawes and David Oyelowo were wary of playing the lead characters in their mid-twenties, but since felt they {{earned the right to}} be in the series. During {{production of}} episodes three and five of the first series, Macfadyen burst a blood vessel on one of his eyes. Macfadyen compensated by wearing <b>sunglasses</b> in order to hide it.

5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, her face in the policeman's <b>sunglasses,</b> and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E

5|$|The {{film version}} of the novel {{has not been the}} only movie to have a {{character}} borrowing some aspects of Wintour. Edna Mode's similar hairstyle in The Incredibles has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Wintour. Fey Sommers in the Ugly Betty television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and <b>sunglasses,</b> to Wintour's last name homophonous with 'Winter', while Sommers' is homophonous with 'Summer'.|$|E

5|$|The video's {{first scene}} {{is set in}} a desert at night. Rihanna, wearing a {{garrison}} cap, <b>sunglasses,</b> and a stylized white top, stands in front of an army. This scene is intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker; she wears an army hard hat, pink lace up boots, and a skin-colored top with small black rectangles covering her breasts. Halfway through the first verse, the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut, short black dress with spiked shoulder pads, and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. <b>Sunglasses</b> do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|After {{a horrible}} night, Quagmire {{approaches}} Lois about talking to Brenda about leaving Jeff. At lunch, Lois and Brenda begin {{talking about the}} situation, and requests that Brenda remove her <b>sunglasses,</b> revealing a bruise over her eye.

Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda, where Quagmire confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists, and he wants her back. The two then embrace each other by hugging, until Jeff enters the intervention, causing an enraged Quagmire {{to tell him that}} Brenda has agreed to leave him. Pressured by Jeff, Brenda reveals that the two are engaged, and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and <b>sunglasses</b> – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Impressed {{with the}} film's script, V. Srinivas Mohan became the visual effects {{supervisor}} in December2007. He asked Shankar {{to increase the}} filming schedules by six months to include pre-production requirements. Both Mohan and Shankar visited several visual effects companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran visual effects budget was 700million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200million. As a result, the visual effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear <b>sunglasses</b> {{for most of the}} film to reduce the cost and difficultly of animating his eyes.|$|E
5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and <b>sunglasses</b> in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|P.N.03 was {{the first}} of the Capcom Five to be released. Before the game's debut in Japan, Capcom {{distributed}} playable demos to stores and released screenshots to the media. Upon P.N.03s release, Capcom shipped 25,000 copies to Japanese retailers. Under 11,000 units were sold, which made the game Japan's 26th best-selling title during the last week of March 2003. These low sales failed to help Capcom meet its yearly sales goals. The North American localization was announced in July 2003. Few aspects of the game were changed for the North American market. Capcom advertised a free T-shirt as a pre-order incentive in North America. Promotional <b>sunglasses</b> modeled after Vanessa's were also released.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{numbers at}} Redland were further boosted by a {{marketing}} campaign by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership {{to attract more}} people, especially students, to use the station. The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed {{a support group for}} the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, <b>sunglasses</b> and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} appointment, Khar visited India and held {{peace talks with}} her Indian counterpart, S. M. Krishna. Relations between the two {{countries}} had been suspended following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and did not resume until February 2011, five months before her visit. The Indian media reported extensively on her fashion and appearance, including her Birkin bag, <b>sunglasses,</b> Jimmy Choo stilettos and pearl necklaces. She held talks with leaders of the Hurriyat Conference before meeting Indian government representatives, a decision which was criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's main opposition party, which said it was a breach of protocol and demanded an inquiry into the matter. She later led an unsuccessful move to grant India most favoured nation status. In August 2011 she visited China and held talks with Yang Jiechi, the Chinese Foreign Minister. Hindustan Times reported that, in contrast to her reception in India, she was largely ignored by the Chinese media.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed under the {{direction}} of Hype Williams to promote the single. The dance sequence was choreographed by George Hubela (known as GEO) and the video takes place in a futuristic spaceship-like setting where Simpson performs an intricate dance choreography with four male and four female dancers. She wears a rainbow-colored tank top and a mini skirt in the video. At one part, the dancers perform in pairs with Simpson in front of them. Later, Simpson dances beside a male dancer while wearing <b>sunglasses</b> and a white top with a bedazzled American flag. In the video's final scene, Simpson, accompanied by the same dancers from the beginning, perform choreography in a red room, and dance with futuristic pole-stands. The music video also features her younger sister Ashlee Simpson as one of the background dancers.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with {{shots of}} a {{construction}} site, where Ciara arrives {{in a large}} construction vehicle. Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} a pile of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator <b>sunglasses.</b> She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of a pile of tires. She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up.|$|E
5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding {{a gun to his}} own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in <b>sunglasses.</b> The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary English-speaking audience of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, <b>sunglasses,</b> bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E
