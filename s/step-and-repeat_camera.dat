He helped {{to design a}} <b>step-and-repeat</b> <b>camera</b> to make photomasks, and a method for aligning the masks.

5000|$|A stepper is {{a device}} {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} of integrated circuits (ICs) that is similar in operation to a slide projector or a photographic enlarger. The term [...] "stepper" [...] is short for <b>step-and-repeat</b> <b>camera.</b> Steppers are {{an essential part of the}} complex process, called photolithography, that creates millions of microscopic circuit elements on the surface of tiny chips of silicon. These chips form the heart of ICs such as computer processors, memory chips, and many other devices.|$|E

Jean Hoerni was involved with diffusion {{and he had a}} great deep, physical insight into {{a lot of things about}} the physics of semiconductors. Gordon Moore also was involved with diffusion. He made a great contributionâ€¦he was the only one that knew how to blow glass so he was making all the jungles for the diffusion and he also was involved with metal evaporation. Sheldon Roberts just went off and got us right into the silicon crystal business. Vic Grinich was the one that really knew what transistors were and what they were used for and he set up all the testing facilities. Julie Blank was in charge of the facilities and also making equipment. Gene Kleiner was a magnificent equipment manufacturer, great machinist. He just loved that. He was good at that. And Gene also started taking over some of the administrative tasks. It's looked on as a group of eight but we did get some other key people and that's where the story is not quite accurate. The contributions of the people outside of the eight of us never got really recognized very well. Dave Allison, in particular, was a key person involved with the diffusions." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the fabrication of high-quality interferogram-type diffractive optical elements with conventional photolithographic techniques {{and compare the}} results with those achievable with electron-beam lithography. The fringes associated with the phase transfer function of the binary phase holographic interferogram are approximated with rectangles, which can be realized at submicron accuracy using a pattern generator and <b>step-and-repeat</b> <b>camera.</b> The effects of the rectangle quantization are analyzed both numerically and experimentally {{with the aid of}} diffraction patterns produced by simple focusing elements. Both resolution and diffraction efficiency of the best holograms approach their theoretical values...|$|E
