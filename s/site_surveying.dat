30|$|Typically, <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> is an {{inevitable}} phase for WiFi fingerprint-based localization which {{is regarded as}} one of the most promising techniques for indoor localization.

In the proposed scheme, we use homomorphic encryption to protect the location privacy of the participants which get involved in the <b>site</b> <b>survey.</b> Further, we employ differential privacy model to ensure that the released data will not breach an individual’s location privacy regardless of whether she is present or absent in the <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> group.

Moreover, it can become a powerful instrument for the client’s team and the General Contractor all along the construction phase, starting from the construction site organization to answer the bid requests. It can also support the supervision of work progress and amount, and allow to periodically reconsider them in compliance with available resources. Starting from these statements, the authors have developed some studies to obtain a systematic and methodological approach for <b>site</b> <b>surveying</b> and optimization. Then, the research focuses primarily on the definition of proper requirements to outline a 5 D site management throughout the whole construction process. After the definition of different needs for the different actors of construction process, the research moved to the possible BIM use for the satisfaction of these needs by the definition of customized parameters dealing with site spaces and facilities, quantities, time and cost management. The parameters have been identified to respond the needs of the on-field case study concerning the realization of a school complex in Cernusco sul Naviglio (Milan). Furthermore the field test proved efficiency and promptness to changes of the developed method in particular concerning scheduling optimization.

This <b>site</b> <b>surveying</b> method is combined with other techniques in recording the entire set of rock mass characteristics.

To illustrate these remarks, we have relied upon the surveying campaign undertaken for the Saint-Beat Tunnel, in proceeding with a comparison of the discontinuities identified on a digital image of borehole walls and manually on core samples. We have highlighted the biases induced using these methods, and such biases must be incorporated in order to better characterize the geometry of the given fracture network...|$|E

30|$|From the above, it can {{be easily}} noticed that {{applying}} tape measurement is simple but slow, tedious, and unsafe. While laser scanners (e.g., Jaselskis et al. 2005; Akinci et al. 2006; Bosché et al. 2009; Tang et al. 2011) or total stations (e.g., Shen et al. 2011; Al-Ali 2011) are accurate, fast, and very little training {{is required for the}} surveyors, these technologies suffer from high equipment cost. For small projects, they are impracticable since the projected savings hardly justify employing such devices. Also, the equipment is not easily portable and time spent for on-site data surveying is another issue that impedes the application of these technologies. In contrast, photogrammetry is a technology that utilizes cameras or camcorders to collect spatial data of the environment in the form of point clouds or wireframe representations.
