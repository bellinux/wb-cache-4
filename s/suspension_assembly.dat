[...] The front <b>suspension</b> <b>assemblies</b> on the Juvaquatre were intended to minimize the risk of wear on the components leading to misalignment of the wheels, featuring just three joints on each assembly and the transversely mounted leaf spring constituting the fourth flexible element of a simple parallelogramme structure.

In this investigation, an improved numerical model for non-operational shock response of a load/unload hard disk drive is implemented by including design parameters of suspension such as dimple preload, suspension material, dimple height and the surface diameter of the dimple in the model. Results for dimple and lift-tab separation, as well as the maximum impact stress at the dimple region, as a function of preload and suspension design parameters, will be presented...|$|R

50|$|The FD (1967-72) was {{released}} {{at a time}} when the UK was undergoing a currency crisis as well as increasingly militant labour relations, resulting in rising prices and reduced quality. On paper, this new 1599 cc and 1975 cc overhead camshaft engine design (the Slant Four) was advanced, but suffered an out of balance couple which earned it the US tag 'Hay Baler'. The suspension design of the car was far less compromised than most previous British mass-produced efforts, featuring a live axle with trailing arms, Panhard rod and coil springs instead of the traditional leaf springs, and a double wishbone front <b>suspension</b> <b>assembly,</b> but the FD's on-road performance and durability were less than its on paper promise in standard form.

5000|$|The {{complete}} rear <b>suspension</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is carried}} in a steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and lower links (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower link pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|E
