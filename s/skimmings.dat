60|$|The {{upshot of}} my meditations was that I asked Stephen {{down to dinner}} with us from church one day. I had heard a rumour {{that he was going}} to see Lizzie Pye over at Avonlea, and I knew it was time to be stirring, if {{anything}} were to be done. If it had been Jane Miranda I don't know that I'd have bothered; but Lizzie Pye wouldn't have done for a stepmother for Althea's boys at all.

I gather from what Mrs. Joel said that she's rather touched in her mind too, and has an awful hankering to get home here--to this very house. She appears to have the idea that it is hers, and all just the same as it used to be. I guess she is a sight of trouble, and Mrs. Joel ain't the woman to like that. But there! She has to work most awful hard, and I suppose a sick person doesn't come handy in a hotel. I guess you've got your revenge, Anna, without lifting a finger to get it.

"But, oh, Marilla, I {{really felt}} that I had tasted the {{bitterness}} of death, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go out alone," [...] she said mournfully that night. [...] "I thought how splendid {{it would have been}} if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance, too. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but there's no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the Queen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second <b>skimmings.</b> Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity--THEY have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon {{is going to be a}} minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else with a name like that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. He's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{small town}} in {{question}} was Quincy, Washington. Fateful Harvest won book {{of the year honors}} from the press group Investigative Reports and Editors and for which Wilson was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize. It details Wilson's investigation into the recycling of fly ash, tire ash, flue dust, tailings, phosphoric acid from car factories, baghouse dust from recycling plants, zinc <b>skimmings</b> from galvanizing industries, and assorted other industrial byproducts with heavy metals such as arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, lead, titanium and other chemicals into plant fertilizer based on the agronomic benefits of their alkalinity (sold as lime) or their micronutrients zinc and manganese. Part of the reasoning behind this is that plants growing in alkaline soils do not uptake the metals as easily. The problem was brought to Wilson's attention in 1996 by a woman named Patty Martin, the mayor of a small rural town named Quincy, Washington, and together Wilson and a small group of farmers conducted the investigation. The issue of heavy metals in fertilizer is sometimes mistakenly confused with biosolids, although there may be some crossover.|$|E
50|$|Wilson {{reports that}} the Bay Zinc Company, founded by Dick Camp Sr., is {{a pioneer in the}} {{recycling}} of industrial byproducts into fertilizer. Dick Camp Jr. recounts that his dad may have been the first to use flue dust from steel smokestacks, which is higher in heavy metals than the previously used zinc <b>skimmings.</b> Wilson finds that in 1988 Camp had been instrumental in creating the loopholes in the which allowed heavy metals in fertilizers to go unregulated. Wilson discovers that between 1990 and 1996 Bay Zinc took in roughly one and a half million pounds of lead, eighty-six thousand pounds of chromium, and nineteen thousand pounds of nickel. However, Wilson notes that Bay Zinc is relatively small in comparison to Alabama-based Frit Industries, the leader, which connected one its major factories to Nucor Steel. Together eight companies process 120 million pounds of industrial byproducts into fertilizer, roughly half of the total zinc fertilizer sold in the country (157). Wilson says this trade is facilitated by state industrial material exchanges (IMEX) and that twenty-six states have them. Later Wilson goes to see what he calls Monsanto Mountain -- Monsanto had decided in 1994 that it no longer wanted the liability of using its industrial byproducts as fertilizer.|$|E
50|$|The treated ore is {{introduced}} to a water-filled aeration tank containing surfactant such as methylisobutyl carbinol (MIBC). Air is constantly forced through the slurry and the air bubbles attach to the hydrophobic copper sulfide particles, which are conducted to the surface, where they form a froth and are skimmed off. These <b>skimmings</b> are generally subjected to a cleaner-scavenger cell to remove excess silicates and to remove other sulfide minerals that can deleteriously impact the concentrate quality (typically, galena), and the final concentrate sent for smelting. The rock which has not floated off in the flotation cell is either discarded as tailings or further processed to extract other metals such as lead (from galena) and zinc (from sphalerite), should they exist. To improve the process efficiency, lime is used to raise the pH of the water bath, causing the collector to ionize more and to preferentially bond to chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and avoid the pyrite (FeS2). Iron exists in both primary zone minerals. Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27-29% copper); {{the remainder of the}} concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of pyrite, sphalerite or galena. Chalcocite concentrates typically grade between 37% and 40% copper-in-concentrate, as chalcocite has no iron within the mineral.|$|E
40|$|A {{bench scale}} {{simulation}} of <b>skimmings</b> generation {{was conducted in}} this study {{as well as an}} analysis into the rates of <b>skimmings</b> generation at the industrial level. The experimental apparatus consists of a graphite crucible containing liquid zinc at 4600 C which is stirred using a six bladed impeller. A jet of either nitrogen or air was directed on to the bath liquid surface simulating the flow from the air knives. The rate of <b>skimmings</b> generated for variable rotational speeds was measured for zinc compositions corresponding to GA and GI operations. Moreover, a numerical simulation of liquid zinc flow in the crucible was carried out to determine the surface area of the liquid zinc free surface exposed to the gas stream. This calculation was used to determine the rate of <b>skimmings</b> generated per unit surface area for each rotational speed. It was found that the rate of <b>skimmings</b> generated increased with surface velocity and the rate using nitrogen was lower than for air. Furthermore, dross particles imbedded in the <b>skimmings</b> from both laboratory and industrial samples were similar in morphology and composition. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} compost production yields as {{a percent}} of raw product mix using poultry litter, poultry processing plant dissolved air flotation <b>skimmings,</b> sawdust, wood chips and ground yard debris. Three different mixes were used and identified as Mixes 1, 2 and 3. Mixes 1 and 2 were produced using windrows and a windrow turner and Mix 3 was made using a covered in-channel compost turner. Mixes 1 and 2 were poultry litter compost with a screened mass yield of 80 and 77 percent, respectively. Mix 3 was a dissolved air flotation compost with a screened mass yield of 40 percent. Results from plant experiments show poultry litter compost can be used successfully in potting mixes for poinsettia and chrysanthemum production. A compost produced from dissolved air flotation <b>skimmings,</b> a poultry processing waste, can be used in field corn production but had little influence in the production of soybeans.

30|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to reveal the oscillation and propagation characteristics of ULF waves observed near the dayside magnetopause. A comparative study of such ULF wave phenomena is made by using the data obtained from the successive <b>skimmings</b> of the dayside magnetopause by the GEOTAIL Satellite performed on three successive days of 9, 18, and 27 December 1994. The instrumentations of GEOTAIL are good for such a task, since the satellite simultaneously measured the magnetic and electric fields, and low energy plasma data. Based the observed data, we studied the dynamic spectral characteristics of both magnetic and electric fields. The results revealed that the dominant ULF waves appearing in the dynamic spectra were Pc 3 and Pc 5 oscillations. The Pc 3 oscillations were observed during a limited local time around noon without an extension to the dawn and dusk flanks, and dominantly appeared at a frequency of ~ 25 mHz in the azimuthal component of the magnetic field. This frequency component showed clear resonant oscillation characteristics. In addition to this, a fast mode earthward propagation characteristic was also recognized. The Poynting flux of the Pc 3 signals showed that the energy flux was about 10 nJ/m 2 s on average, the strongest being along the magnetic field line. Pc 5 oscillations showed another dominant spectral power {{which appeared in the}} radial component of the electric field, suggesting that the resonance oscillations were well established. However, the Pc 5 oscillations in the subsolar region did not show any earthward propagation characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The nickel of most {{lateritic}} ores {{is extracted}} as a FeNi alloy containing {{a certain amount}} of cobalt. The utilization of this ferroalloy is effectively limited to the fabrication of stainless steels, which absorbs about 40 pct of the total nickel consumption. The production of electrolytic nickel from ferronickel is feasible, but it requires anodes made of alloy enriched to at least 80 pct Ni. Such enrichment is complicated by the simultaneous oxidation of nickel during the slagging of iron, which accelerates as the iron is depleted and becomes prohibitive for an alloy with more than 60 pct Ni. A simple and economical upgrading of ferronickel up to 90 pct Ni is proposed by a two-stage converting with oxygen, under simultaneous addition of nickeliferous laterite. Nickel losses are effectively restricted by the two-stage operation. The rich slags of the second stage, produced in contact with an alloy of more than 60 pct Ni, are recycled in liquid state into the empty first stage converter. The subsequent addition of the low grade liquid metal into the first stage converter ""washes"" the rich slags and reduces their nickel content. The slags of the first stage, produced in contact with low grade alloys, contain little nickel and are discarded. The overall nickel loss is considerably reduced by blowing in short blows with intermediate slag <b>skimmings.</b> The addition of the lateritic ore, during converting, achieves a very satisfactory and inexpensive temperature control, substitutes as a flux, and introduces nickel and oxygen to the process at a very minimal cost. The heat evolved during the oxidation of the iron in the molten alloy is effectively utilized for the smelting of the laterite added.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{strategy}} for handling paper mill solid waste is typically disposal in landfills. However, several drawbacks {{are associated with}} this type of solid waste management, such as increasing costs due to oil price rise, governmental restrictions on land use, and environmental concerns such as leaching of disposed contaminants into groundwater, as well as methane generation of and release to the atmosphere, thus contributing to global warming. An alternative to reduce solids prior to disposal and to recover methane as a renewable fuel is anaerobic digestion, but it is not yet clear whether such an approach is feasible in paper mills. In this study, the anaerobic digestion of paper mill waste streams was evaluated for a paper plant located in Belen, Costa Rica, to investigate up to what extent certain waste streams can be anaerobically digested, to what extent energy can be produced in the form of methane for implementation in a wastewater treatment plant and to evaluate the conditions that will favor methane generation from select waste streams. Batch assays were performed to evaluate the biodegradability of single and combined waste samples under ideal, laboratory conditions. Samples were obtained from the manufacturing plant as well as the wastewater treatment plant at the paper mill under study. The ultimate biodegradability ranged 25 to 85 % in terms of volatile solids destruction, corresponding to the waste activated sludge (WAS) and Flotation Cell rejects, respectively. The COD destruction of single samples ranged from 45 to 63 %, corresponding to WAS and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) dissolved air flotation (DAF) <b>skimmings,</b> respectively. Methane generation ranged from 80 to 190 ml at 35 oC/g COD added for all single samples (excluding underflows). In combination Feed 1 was reduced by 46 and 52 % and Feed 2 by 27 and 38 %, respectively. Two combinations of two single samples each (Feed 1 and 2), formulated according to plant operational data, and their solids and COD destruction as well as methane generation in semicontinuous flow anaerobic digesters were evaluated at different solids retention times (30, 20, 15, and 7 days). Nutrients (N, and P) availability as well as alkalinity in the plant waste streams were evaluated and minimum supplements were used to support an efficient anaerobic digestion process. The reactors reached stable operation at all retention times evaluated. Methanogenesis was the predominant, terminal metabolic process under anaerobic, mesophilic conditions, but the overall process rate was determined by the hydrolysis of the particulate substrate. Reactors fed with Feed 1 achieved the highest level of destruction, which amounted to 85 % of phosphorus that is typically present in paper mill wastes. Alkalinity addition to the feed (3. 5 mg NaHCO 3 /L) was necessary to maintain the reactors pH above 6. 9. M. S.
