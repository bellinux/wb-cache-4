Using a new, economic, and miniature control unit, we achieved improvements of the systems versatility, transportability, and pressure robustness. A further important improvement with respect to pressure resistance was achieved when a flexible pumping tube was inserted between the <b>solenoid</b> <b>pump</b> and the flow resistance acting as a pressure reservoir and pulsation damper.

A self-injurious behavior inhibiting system (SIBIS) is {{fastened to the}} arm of a person with chronic self-injurious behavior patterns. An electric shock is delivered into the arm whenever the device senses above-threshold acceleration of the head such as occur with head-bangers. Sounding a buzzer tone with the shock eventually allows transference of the aversive stimulus to the buzzer so shocks are no longer necessary.

40|$|In {{the last}} four decades, various {{techniques}} including spectroscopic, wet chemical and mass spectrometric methods, have been developed and applied {{for the detection of}} ambient nitrous acid (HONO). We developed a HONO detection system based on long path photometry which consists of three independent modules i. e., sampling module, fluid propulsion module and detection module. In the propulsion module, <b>solenoid</b> <b>pumps</b> are applied. With <b>solenoid</b> <b>pumps</b> the pulsed flow can be computer controlled both in terms of pump stroke volume and pulse frequency, which enables the attainment of a very stable flow rate. In the detection module, a customized Liquid Waveguide Capillary Cell (LWCC) is used. The customized LWCC pre-sets the optical fiber in-coupling with the liquid wave guide, providing the option of fast startup and easy maintenance of the absorption photometry. In summer 2014, our system was deployed in a comprehensive campaign at a rural site in the North China Plain. More than one month of high quality HONO data spanning from the limit of detection to 5 ppb were collected. Intercomparison of our system with another established system from Forschungszentrum Juelich is presented and discussed. In conclusion, our instrument achieved a detection limit of 10 pptV within 2 min and a measurement uncertainty of 7 %, which is well suited for investigation of the HONO budget from urban to rural conditions in China...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} {{for the design}} of a {{residential}} oil burner is presented involving a low pressure, air atomizing nozzle. Advantages of this approach, relative to conventional, pressure atomized burners include: ability to operate at very low excess air levels without smoke, ability to operate at low (and possibly variable) rates, reduced boiler fouling, and low NO{sub x}. The nozzle used is a low pressure, airblast atomizer which can achieve fuel spray drop sizes similar to conventional nozzles and very good combustion performance with air pressure as low as 5 inches of water (1. 24 kPa). A burner head has been developed for this nozzle and combustion test results are presented {{in a wide variety of}} equipment including cast iron and steel boilers, warm air furnaces, and water heaters over the firing rate range 0. 25 gph to 1. 0 gph (10 to 41 kW). Beyond the nozzle and combustion head the burner system must be developed and two approaches have been taken. The first involves a small, brushless DC motor/fan combination which uses high fan speed to achieve air pressures from 7 to 9 inches of water (1. 74 to 2. 24 kPa). Fuel is delivered to the atomizer at less than 1 psig (6. 9 kPa) using a <b>solenoid</b> <b>pump</b> and flow metering orifice. At 0. 35 gph (14 kW) the electric power draw of this burner is less than 100 watts. In a second configuration a conventional motor is used with a single stage fan which develops 5 to 6 inches of water pressure (1. 24 to 1. 50 kPa) at similar firing rates. This burner uses a conventional type fuel pump and metering orifice to deliver fuel. The fuel pump is driven by the fan motor, very much like a conventional burner. This second configuration is seen as more attractive to the heating industry and is now being commercialized. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 An autonomous, in-situ {{instrument}} {{was developed to}} detect dissolved copper in seawater, suitable for deployment on time scales from weeks to months. A commercially available in-situ nitrate analyzer (YSI 9600) was adapted to measure copper (II) in seawater by chemiluminescence.

40|$|Introduction to rf Systems The rf {{systems for}} the buncher and the cooler are {{required}} to match the muon beam into the longitudinal acceptance of the cooling channel and to replenish the beam energy lost during ionization cooling.

40|$|Seyonic is {{developing}} a family of high-speed micro flow sensors with full-scale sensitivities between 0. 25 and 10 microliter per sec-ond.

The sensor is able to measure not only the flow, but also the instantaneous pressure in the systems under evaluation.

40|$|Unloading-induced myofiber atrophy is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs in the aging population, bed-ridden patients and astronauts. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether or not dynamic foot stimulation (DFS) applied to the plantar surface of the rat foot can serve as a countermeasure to the soleus muscle atrophy normally observed in hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats. Thirty mature adult (6 -month-old) male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into ambulatory control (AMB), hindlimb unloaded alone (HU), or hindlimb unloaded with the application of DFS (HU+DFS) groups. A dynamic pattern of pressure was applied to the right foot of each HU animal using a specially fabricated boot containing an inflatable air bladder connected to a <b>solenoid</b> air <b>pump</b> controlled by a laptop computer. The anti-atrophic effects of DFS were quantified morphometrically in frozen cross-sections of soleus muscle stained using the metachromatic-ATPase fiber typing technique. Application of DFS during HU significantly counteracted the atrophic response observed in the soleus by preventing approximately 85 % of the reduction in Type I myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) observed during HU. However, DFS did not protect type II fibers of the soleus from HU-induced atrophy or any fiber type in the soleus muscle of the contralateral control leg of the DFS-treated HU animals. These results illustrate that the application of DFS to the rat foot is an effective countermeasure to soleus muscle atrophy induced by HU...|$|R

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} calculations done {{to determine the}} relief capacity of the <b>solenoid</b> vacuum <b>pumping</b> line. The calculations were done by David Bell, a co-op student from the University of Wisconsin. The calculations are attached. The conclusion is that the vacuum pumping line has a venting capacity of 129 g/s warm helium or 298 g/s warm nitrogen. Both of these capacities are {{much larger than the}} expected operating mass flow rates of the liquid helium (5 to 15 g/s) or liquid nitrogen (2 or 3 g/s) circuits. The calculations assume the solenoid vacuum vessel is at 3 psig and the relief plate is set at 1. 5 psig. Additional calculations were done to prove that the venting capacity of the vacuum pumping line exceeded flowrates due to a failure mode. These calculations are attached. Since the system is not finalized, (pipe sizes not determined, components sized [...] .) the calculations were done by first picking reasonable line sizes based on known allowed pressure drops in the system and then doing a maximum delivery rate calculation if a line was completely severed in the vacuum space of the solenoid/control dewar. The numbers from these calculations say that failure mode flow rates are 80 g/s liquid helium or 80 g/s liquid nitrogen. Both these values are less than the capacity of the relief line. In the five months since the (12 / 92 Dave Bell) calculations were done, some changes occured to the relief path. The most notable is that the radiation shield is now considered to be 6. 625 -inch O. D. instead of 6. 00 -inch used in the venting calculation. This change would tend to lower the capacity numbers. Another change was that for about half the venting path the chimney vacuum shell size was increased to 10 -inch pipe. This change tends to increase the capacity numbers which were done assuming 8 -inch pipe. These changes taken together probably offset each other or make the capacity numbers better. In either case, since the margin of safety is large, the calculations have not been redone...|$|R

In this thesis {{we are going to}} present a touch screen operated liquid dispenser machine. Using a touch screen interface, we can effectively increase operator accuracy, reduce training time and improve overall efficiencies, thus keeping cost down a properly designed touch screen interface can improve overall accuracy. Present liquid dispenser machine available in industries are costly, complex and hard in design and fabrication. Main requirement from this machine is its metering or measuring quality. Accuracy of measuring is very less in various machine. Hence, the basic theme behind this research is to improve these disadvantages of liquid dispenser machine. The liquid dispenser machine presently available is based on practice and past experience of the employer in his working field and also, its efficiency declines at a greater rate after a period of time. By surveying the present machines and comparing their present limitations, new model will be fabricated so that designs data can be obtained to formulate experimental data based model for this process.

The hydrodynamic injections created by IDEA operation were found to be highly reproducible, efficient, and possess a negligible degree of sampling bias. In Chapter 4, the spatial characteristics of microchannel deformation due to IDEA actuation have been investigated using fluorescence microscopy.
