Naval message traffic is transmitted <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> character set and optionally files are compressed. Both character translation and data compression can be used as add-on data encryption. A masterkey is constructed from a set of service keys from which masterkey is allowed to access.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{findings from}} a study that investigated domestic rainwater harvesting [DRWH] as a measure to improve water-access in a remote water-insecure Indigenous community, Black Tickle – Domino, on the southern coast of Labrador. Water security refers to the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate qualities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development (UN Water, 2014). DRWH, or harvesting rainwater for general purpose or drinking water, has been promoted by previous researchers as way to improve water <b>security</b> in areas <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> access, especially in Africa (Helmreich & Horn, 2009) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a novel {{formulation of the}} multi-armed bandit model, which we call the contextual bandit <b>with</b> <b>restricted</b> context, where {{only a limited number}} of features can be accessed by the learner at every iteration. This novel formulation is motivated by different online problems arising in clinical trials, recommender systems and attention modeling. Herein, we adapt the standard multi-armed bandit algorithm known as Thompson Sampling to take advantage of our restricted context setting, and propose two novel algorithms, called the Thompson Sampling <b>with</b> <b>Restricted</b> Context(TSRC) and the Windows Thompson Sampling <b>with</b> <b>Restricted</b> Context(WTSRC), for handling stationary and nonstationary environments, respectively. Our empirical results demonstrate advantages of the proposed approaches on several real-life datasetsComment: IJCAI 201...|$|R
