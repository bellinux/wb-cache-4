25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{composed}} the gospel-influenced ballad [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] with James Wright. The lyrics {{are in the}} form of a prayer that conveys a message of unconditional love for God. The song features a verbal recording of Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, who reads two verses from the Bible. The singer wrote the album's fifth cut [...] "Say Somethin, which features rap verses from Snoop Dogg and was produced by The Neptunes. Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as [...] "a musical oddity", and characterized the production as [...] "strange instrumentation, weird melodic shifts, hectic drum patterns and a bed of synths." [...] Lyrically, the protagonist makes sexual advances to a romantic interest with the line [...] "If it's worth your while, do something good to me." [...] When interpreting the lyrics in the female role, Cummings noted [...] "a shy woman who doesn't need to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all to get a man's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it at first I {{thought it was a}} cool and interesting track, but I didn't know if it was very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E

However, he sometimes would spend many hours at their discussion meetings without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all. In 1917 he joined in a scheme to purchase The Mill House, Tidmarsh, the place lived in by Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington and Ralph Partridge and which he occasionally visited.|$|R

Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families [...] [...] [...] All {{they have to do is}} just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".|$|E

To interpret this as <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all about our relationship with the U.S. is nonsense." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractI argue that, {{contrary}} to folklore, Einstein never really cared for geometrizing the gravitational or (subsequently) the electromagnetic field; indeed, {{he thought that}} the very statement that General Relativity geometrizes gravity “is not <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all”. Instead, I shall show that Einstein saw the “unification” of inertia and gravity as one of the major achievements of General Relativity. Interestingly, Einstein did not locate this unification in the field equations but in his interpretation of the geodesic equation, the law of motion of test particles...|$|R
