25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
500|$|A thief sneaks {{into the}} Robinson {{home with the}} {{intention}} of looting it. He is discovered by a young girl, Edna Robinson, and flees taking only her toy bank containing the paltry sum of 29 cents USD, [...] She is <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the theft of her bank that the parents decide to inform the police. They go to the police station and report the robbery, but the police laugh at them. The parents go home and inform Edna that the police will not do anything, which makes her all the more determined. So Edna goes to the police station by herself and informs the police captain of the robbery and its details. He assigns his officers to work on the case and they arrest several men carrying toy banks. They ask Edna to identify the robber, but she says he is not present. The police set the men free and Edna decides to take the task upon herself. So she gets a police whistle and starts investigating on her own, eventually finding the thief.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, the privations of the captivity, {{including}} their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, {{at one point}} Anastasia became <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, [...] "Something has happened to them in there." [...] But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards weren't watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, {{the head of the}} detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{contributing}} to the political unrest was a group known as the [...] "Voluntaryists," [...] who were also opposed to the grant. Their issue with it was not, however, over any sort of religious difference. They opposed {{the idea of the}} government granting money to any private institution of higher education, and <b>so</b> were <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the Maynooth Grant.|$|R
50|$|During elimination, Chance calls So Hood {{down to the}} carpet.

He gives her one last hug, and then she leaves.|$|R
50|$|The film then jumps {{ahead to}} 1982, {{at which point}} Holly and Marina are {{attending}} university together. In addition, they are both sleeping with the same professor; a man that Marina had originally thought boring. Nat comes to visit, and he and Holly reconnect. Holly decides {{she wants to be}} with him. But, when she goes to end things with her professor, she sees Marina kissing him goodbye. She runs back to Nat, <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> she forgets <b>about</b> the relationship they were about to enter. Holly soon confronts Marina and the two fight. While Marina soon makes up with Holly, she ruins things between Holly and Nat by telling them both that the other hasn't wanted to talk to them. Ultimately, the three of them are reunited at a New Year's party, where Nat announces his intent to marry his girlfriend Isabel.|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the work}} ethic was of prime {{importance}} in his development, Grace insisted that cricket must also be enjoyable and freely admitted that his family all played {{in a way that}} was [...] "noisy and boisterous" [...] with much [...] "chaff" [...] (i.e., a Victorian term for teasing). W. G. and E. M. in particular were noted throughout their careers for being noisy and boisterous on the field. They were extremely competitive and always playing to win. Sometimes this went to extremes (e.g., on one occasion at school, E. M. was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> a decision going against him that he went home and took the stumps with him) and developed into the gamesmanship for which E. M. and W. G. were always controversial.|$|E
2500|$|For example, one {{may make}} the {{following}} logical reasoning and support it using {{the basis of this}} rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert [...] "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer," [...] but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because no one can make every shot.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly before Christmas 1966, Elvis {{proposed}} to Priscilla. Accounts suggest that Priscilla threatened {{to take her}} story to the press if Elvis refused to marry her, and that her father threatened to have Elvis charged under the Mann Act; [...] "taking a minor across state lines for sexual purposes". Colonel Parker, Elvis' manager, also attempted to encourage him to marry by reminding him about his RCA [...] "morals clause" [...] within his record contract. Priscilla suggested in a 1973 interview with Ladies' Home Journal that she and Elvis were quite happy to just live together, but [...] "at that time it wasn't nice for people to [...] live together". Accounts by Elvis' cook, Alberta, claim that he was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the wedding that she caught him crying about it one day. When she asked why he didn't just cancel the wedding if it upset him so much, he replied [...] "I don't have a choice." [...] Marty Lacker, a close friend to Elvis, has also spoken about Elvis' reluctance to marry, while others such as Joe Esposito have asserted that Elvis was excited to marry Priscilla.|$|E

The same Mexicans that ten years ago were talking about {{themselves}} as Spaniards are coming on real strong these days as Mexicans. Everyone should be proud of what they are, of course, but race is only skin-deep. It's phony and it comes out of frustration; the la raza people are not secure. They look upon Cesar as their 'dumb Mexican' leader; he's become their saint. But he doesn't want any part of it.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} between libraries and cats is at times contentious. There have been attempts {{in one case}} to remove a cat from a library based upon concerns about patrons with allergies claiming violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in another specific case the reaction of a cat to other service animals.
