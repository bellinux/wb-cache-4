5000|$|<b>Silpha</b> is a genus of {{the family}} Silphidae, or Carrion Beetles, {{formerly}} including several North American species. The genus is sometimes called siphids. All North American silphid beetles are now reorganized in either the subfamily Nicrophorinae, with the only genus in North America being Nicrophorus, and subfamily Silphinae, including the genera Aclypea, Heterosilpha, Necrodes, Necrophila, Oiceoptoma, and Thanatophilus. [...] The genus Oxelytrum is sometimes included due to a dubious Texas record, but to date has never been validated. [...] While members of the genus Nicrophorus typically bury carrion for their larvae to feed upon, members of subfamily Silphinae lay their eggs directly on or in a blown carcass. This is because the larvae not only feed on the carrion, but also upon fly maggots. There are 30 species of silphids in North America North of Mexico.|$|E

The vegetation of the survey sites consist of four types, deciduous forest, mixed forest of deciduous and sasa types, and bushes. A total of 1, 084 individuals in 6 species of carrion beetles by using bait traps were investigated and among them, Nicrophorus quadripunctatus was the most dominant species with 947 (87. 36 %).

40|$|Two endomychid species {{described}} from El Hierro (Canary Islands) {{are removed}} from the Canarian fauna: Dapsa hierrensis Franz, 1976 is a synonym of Archipines intricata (Gorham, 1889), nov. syn., and the single specimen (holotype) was probably collected in Central America. Dapsa curta Franz, 1976 is also poorly described and based on a single female. Without a male {{it is not possible}} to assess with full confidence if it belongs to the African genus Danae or more probably to the Oriental genus Tragoscelis, and to which species. It is for sure not a Dapsa and its Canarian origin relates probably to another labeling error of the author, who also collected in Borneo, where this latter genus is present with 5 species. Consequently, Dapsa curta Franz, 1996 is proposed as nomen dubium. Furthermore, three genera are recorded for the Canaries for the first time: <b>Silpha</b> puncticollis Lucas, 1854 (Silphidae), the coffee bean borer Araecerus fasciculatus (DeGeer, 1775), and Bruchela rufipes (Olivier, 1790) both Anthribidae.

40|$|The {{forensic}} {{application of}} entomology is well known, {{but it is}} generally a field which concentrates on Diptera. Many Coleoptera also have forensic application, but are generally neglected by forensic entomology researchers. Necrophilic Coleoptera are diverse and therefore have application in estimating Post-Mortem Interval (PMI) by community composition, {{but they are also}} valuable in estimating PMI by development. In addition, Coleoptera are more common in stored product cases. Six species of forensically important Coleoptera were studied, three from the family Dermestidae (Dermestes haemorrhoidalis, D. maculatus and D. peruvianus) and three from the family Silphidae (<b>Silpha</b> punctulata, Thanatophilus micans and T. mutilatus). The effect of killing method and storage time on larval length was investigated in T. micans. Coleopteran larvae were shown not to behave {{in the same way as}} dipteran larvae. In contrast to dipteran larvae, it is recommended that coleopteran larvae be killed using ethanol. A development model is presented for T. micans. This represents the first statistically robust development model for forensically important Coleoptera, and the first development model for forensically important Silphidae. The model offers a method of estimating PMI which can be used once Diptera are no longer present on a corpse. Upper lethal temperature limits for four species of carcass beetle were determined. A comparison between species shows distinct differentiation between families and species. This differentiation accounts for microhabitat differences which these species show on carcasses. Bioclimatic models for the six species showed contrasting distributions, with both widespread and localised species. These models allow forensic investigators to assess whether the absence of a species from a corpse is forensically significant, or a result of the species distributions. Moisture-related variables were shown to be more important in predicting species distributions than temperature at a regional scale. Forensic entomology standards can be adjusted based on the findings of this study. Length was again shown to be an inferior measurement of larval age. Coleopteran development has been shown to be useful, and should be given greater consideration in future work. T. micans has been shown to be capable of locating and ovipositing on carcasses promptly after death, making it a good forensic indicator. Further work is needed for the full potential of necrophilic Coleoptera to be realised...|$|E
40|$|Necrophagous beetles (Coleoptera) {{are very}} {{interesting}} and diverse ecological group of species with an immense impact on a natural nutrient cycle. Their main food source and breeding ground are carrions of vertebrates, human remains included. This relationship is often used in various ways by forensic entomology, but its potential was not jet fully reached, because our knowledge of biology and ecology of these beetles is very much incomplete. In this thesis I would like to explore geographic distribution, ecological requirements and developmental biology of several Central European necrophagous beetles as an outcome of their ecological and evolution strategies. For that I raised three broad research questions. Which factors are determining the local abundance of carrion beetles (Coleoptera: Silphidae) ? How the current geographical distribution of open-landscape carrion beetles looks like in the Czech Republic? How the temperature affects the development of Sciodrepoides watsoni (Spence, 1813) ? We found out that soil type can have significant effect on abundance of carrion beetles. They showed preference for chernozem [...] Nicrophorus antennatus (Reitter), N. germanicus (Linnaeus), N. interruptus (Stephens), N. sepultor (Charpentier), <b>Silpha</b> obscura obscura (Herbst), T. sinuatus (Fabricius) or for fluvisol as did N. humator (Gleditsch). These findings support our hypothesis that soil type could {{be an important factor}} determining the occurrence of necrophagous European carrion beetles. To collect novel data of the current geographical distribution of carrion beetles we used 420 baited pitfall traps at 84 localities, and we collected 71 234 specimens of 15 silphid species. Among them, three endangered carrion beetle species listed on the Czech Red List of Invertebrates, were found. Two are vulnerable thermophilic species of open landscapes, Nicrophorus antennatus (Reitter, 1884) (collected around Louny and Židlochovice) and Nicrophorus germanicus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Louny, Zábřeh and Židlochovice). The third is the near threatened species, Nicrophorus sepultor Charpentier, 1825 (collected around Louny, Kutná Hora, Zábřeh and Židlochovice), which also prefers open landscapes. We studied development of common Holarctic beetle Sciodrepoides watsoni under five constant temperature regimes in laboratory (15, 18, 21, 25 and 28 °C). Parameters of thermal summation models and their standard errors were calculated for each developmental stage (egg, three larval instars and pupae). We also find a new character for larval instar determination (head width) and proposed novel approach for future studies of size-based characters in instar determination...|$|E
