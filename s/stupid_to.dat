5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto {{gave him}} a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E
5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E

Sorry to have to be so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government.

25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{censorship}} {{issues with}} Cannibal Holocaust concern the on-screen killings of animals. Deodato himself has condemned his past actions, saying [...] "I was <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> introduce animals." [...] Although six animal deaths appear onscreen, seven animals were killed for the production, as the scene depicting the monkey's death was shot twice, {{resulting in the}} death of two monkeys. Both of the animals were eaten by indigenous cast members, who consider monkey brains a delicacy. The animals that were killed onscreen were: ...|$|E

In December 2007 she appeared on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and revealed that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet, saying [...] "How <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> challenge me! I made them all put their {{money on the table}} in front of me. The next day I had scrambled eggs for breakfast." ...|$|E
500|$|With Formby's growing {{success on}} stage, Beryl {{decided it was}} time for him to move into films. In 1934 she {{approached}} the producer Basil Dean, the head of Associated Talking Pictures (ATP). Although he expressed an interest in Formby, he did not like the associated demands from Beryl. She also met the representative of Warner Bros. in the UK, Irving Asher, who was dismissive, saying that Formby was [...] "too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> play the bad guy and too ugly to play the hero". Three weeks later Formby was approached by John E. Blakeley of Blakeley's Productions, who offered him a one-film deal.|$|E
500|$|But none of {{this meant}} that Strang was {{illiterate}} or simple. [...] Although his teachers [...] "not unfrequently turned me off {{with little or no}} attention, as though I was too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> learn and too dull to feel neglect," [...] Strang recalled that he spent [...] "long weary days... upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking... my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears." [...] He studied works by Thomas Paine and the Comte de Volney, whose book Les Ruines exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and felt that}} Michael's antics—largely {{the fact that he}} easily {{believes}} he has herpes—were too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> be believable; however, he felt that the episode's main story largely worked as planned. However, McNutt panned the episode's secondary story focusing on Andy, noting that it [...] "lazily tapped into the series' basic structure". He ultimately concluded that [...] "without any particularly strong jokes, it fell entirely on Andy's character, and there just wasn't enough there to support it". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that, while Michael's story [...] "had its moments", it was largely [...] "creepy and uncomfortable". He also criticized Andy's characterization, noting that, in the episode, he was written extremely similar to Michael.|$|E
500|$|At home, Patrick is {{typically}} depicted either sleeping, watching TV, or {{engaged in the}} [...] "art of doing nothing", at which he is an expert. All the furnishings in the space under his rock are made of sand, and Patrick can simply opt to quickly build up furniture as needed; even so, his living space is sparse and contains only the barest essentials. Aside from his best friend SpongeBob, who is often impressed by Patrick's capacity {{to come up with}} naïve yet genius plans or solutions, Patrick frequently irritates those around him and is confounded by the simplest of questions or subjects. The characters of Mr. Krabs and Squidward have no patience for Patrick's stupidity, and the former does not pay him much regard; Clancy Brown, who provides Mr. Krabs' voice, said, [...] "The only person that he [...] doesn't hire is Patrick because Patrick is just too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> work for nothing." [...] Sandy often gets annoyed by Patrick, but still sees him as a friend.|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} Truth, Levin {{was invited to}} write a column in The Manchester Guardian about ITV, Britain's first {{commercial}} television channel, launched in 1955. Mooney describes his television reviews as [...] "notably punchy" [...] and The Times wrote, [...] "Levin took out his shotgun and let loose with both barrels". Levin gave the opening programmes a kindly review, but by the fourth day of commercial television {{he was beginning to}} baulk: [...] "There has been nothing to get our teeth into apart from three [...] different brands of cake-mix and a patent doughnut". Thereafter, he did not spare the network: [...] "cliché succeeded to cliché"; [...] "a mentally defective aborigine who was deaf in both ears would have little difficulty in leaving 'Double Your Money' £32 richer than when he entered"; and after the network's first hundred days he attributed its viewing figures to the [...] "number of people who are sufficiently <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> derive pleasure from such programmes".|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{eventually}} supplant Christianity with a religion more amenable to National Socialist ideology, Himmler, together with Alfred Rosenberg, sought {{to replace it with}} Germanic paganism (the indigenous traditional religion or Volksreligion of the Germanic peoples), of which the Japanese Shinto was seen as an almost perfect East Asian counterpart. For this purpose they had ordered the construction of sites for the worship of Germanic cults in order to exchange Christian rituals for Germanic consecration ceremonies, which included different marriage and burial rites. In Heinrich Heims' Adolf Hitler, Monologe im FHQ 1941-1944 (several editions, here Orbis Verlag, 2000), Hitler is quoted as having said on 14 October 1941: [...] "It seems to be inexpressibly <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> allow a revival of the cult of Odin/Wotan. Our old mythology of the gods was defunct, and incapable of revival, when Christianity came...the whole world of antiquity either followed philosophical systems on the one hand, or worshipped the gods. But in modern times it is undesirable that all humanity should make such a fool of itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to recording, DJ Premier {{had listened}} to Nas's debut single, later stating [...] "When I heard 'Halftime', that was some next shit to me. That's just as classic to me as 'Eric B For President' and 'The Bridge'. It just had that type of effect. As simple as it is, all of the {{elements}} are there. So from that point, after Serch approached me about doing some cuts, it was automatic. You'd be <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> pass that up even if it wasn't payin' no money." [...] Serch later noted the chemistry between Nas and DJ Premier, recounting that [...] "Primo and Nas, {{they could have been}} separated at birth. It wasn't a situation where his beats fit their rhymes, they fit each other." [...] While Serch reached out to DJ Premier, Large Professor contacted Pete Rock to collaborate with Nas on what became [...] "The World Is Yours". Shortly afterwards, producers Q-Tip and L.E.S. chose to work on the album. Nas's father, Olu Dara, also contributed with a cornet solo on [...] "Life's a Bitch", which features rapper AZ.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club {{announced}} on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using [...] "easy everyday means". The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, [...] "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token." [...] However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve.|$|E

500|$|The game {{begins and}} Stanley {{proves to be}} a horrible player. Furthermore, Michael cannot make a shot, nor is he a fan of passing or defending. Upon gaining {{possession}} of the ball, Michael fools around and intentionally acts <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> tease the opponents, which results in Roy Anderson (David Denman) snatching the ball and scoring against Michael's team. Despite the fact that Michael {{is the one who}} foolishly lost the ball, he blames the scoring on his teammates' ineptitude. Jim switches with Michael on defense and defends Roy. As Jim begins to show his prowess at the game, Roy and Jim gradually become aggressive toward each other, with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) looking on. At a crucial point in the game, Michael is accidentally hit in the face and claims it is a [...] "flagrant personal intentional foul". He pettily stops the game and declares the office winners since they were winning when the foul occurred. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, conceding the victory to the warehouse staff. As everybody returns to work, Kevin demonstrates his excellent shooting skills.|$|E
500|$|In April 1986 Yankovic {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio to begin the sessions to his follow-up to 1985's Dare to Be <b>Stupid.</b> <b>To</b> produce the album, Yankovic brought in former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer, who had also produced Yankovic's previous albums. Backing Yankovic were Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in roughly three sessions. The first session took place between April 22 and 23, and yielded four originals: [...] "Don't Wear Those Shoes", [...] "One of Those Days", [...] "Dog Eat Dog", and [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The second session, which spanned August 4–5, produced three parodies: [...] "Living with a Hernia", [...] "Addicted to Spuds", and [...] "Here's Johnny". The final session, which lasted from August 29 to September 1 produced the parody [...] "Toothless People", an original song named [...] "Good Enough for Now", and the album's titular polka medley. Thematically, Yankovic described the record as [...] "not a whole lot different than" [...] the other albums he had recorded, calling the process [...] "even a bit formulaic".|$|E
500|$|Friday saw {{yet more}} {{witnesses}} for the prosecution, {{bringing the total}} brought by Davy to about 60. [...] The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. [...] Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish {{whether or not she}} could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. [...] On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. [...] One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too <b>stupid</b> <b>to</b> have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing [...] "a little". [...] This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. [...] Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. [...] Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her [...] "deplorable condition". [...] Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. [...] The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a [...] "poor, miserable wretch" [...] at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.|$|E
