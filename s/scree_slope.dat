25|$|The {{southern}} boundary {{is formed}} by Scale Beck and its tributary Black Beck. Mellbreak has a third much lower top overlooking this steep sided valley, Scale Kott (1,109ft). At {{the head of}} Black Beck is the connection to Starling Dodd, running south west from Scale Knott. This could hardly be considered a ridge in walking terms, since it begins {{at the foot of}} an 800ft <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> on the northern flank of Starling Dodd.|$|E
25|$|To the {{north-east}} the fell {{is separated}} from Skiddaw by Carlside Col (2,345ft), a depression that contains Carlside Tarn, the only standing water found at any altitude in the Skiddaw group. Very shallow and frequently dry in summer, the tarn has no plant life. Set in a particularly windy location, the slight retaining bank at the south-eastern edge may be in danger of erosion. The Skiddaw side of the col is a rough <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> while the Carl Side slope is gentler and grassed.|$|E
2500|$|The Zuytdorp {{departed}} from the Cape of Good Hope on 22 April 1712 with at least 200 to 250 people on board, including women and children, and disappeared. It is now thought to have struck the Zuytdorp Cliffs on the central coast of Western Australia in early June 1712. The first signs of the wreck were found in 1927 {{but it was not}} until 1959 that the identity of the wreck was confirmed by Dr [...] The discovery of a considerable amount of material from the wreck on the <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> and top of the cliffs established that many people had managed to get off the stricken vessel and on to shore. Exactly how many people survived the disaster is uncertain and estimates vary from 30 up to 180 or more. There has been speculation that the survivors headed east along the Murchison River, 60 kilometres to the south. However, finds of a coin and a 'Leyden Tobacco Tin' at wells to the north, as well as linguistic and technological evidence suggest they headed north, perhaps ending up in the northern Gascoyne, about 450 kilometres north of the wrecksite. In both cases it is thought the survivors ultimately integrated with local Aboriginal populations.|$|E
50|$|It {{could be}} planted in alpine <b>scree</b> <b>slopes</b> and in rock gardens.|$|R

5000|$|Easy angled <b>screes</b> <b>slopes</b> lead {{across the}} Saddle to Kibo Hut, 4700 m, 4.5-5 hrs.|$|R
50|$|The {{most direct}} {{line of ascent}} is arguably from Finestrat, {{starting}} at Font del Molí, heading towards the mountain's south face. From here, a long, steep, <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> can be seen. It is possible (although unpleasant) to ascend the scree directly, or follow the trail which runs parallel to the <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> on the right hand side. Both the trail and the <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> are marked with fading red painted symbols. The trail is easy to lose in mist. From {{the top of the}} <b>scree</b> <b>slope,</b> the trail turns east towards the summit. There are lots of criss-crossing paths here, which makes the route very difficult to follow in mist.|$|E
50|$|The steep <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> {{is a good}} basking {{area for}} adders and common lizards.|$|E

5000|$|La Ferrassie is {{an archaeological}} site in Savignac-de-Miremont, in the Dordogne department, France. [...] The site, {{located in the}} Vézère valley, {{consists}} of a large and deep cave flanked by two rock shelters within a limestone cliff, under {{which there is a}} <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> formation.|$|E

50|$|Before 2017, the {{municipality}} {{was located in}} the Schiers sub-district of the Prättigau/Davos district on a <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> above the Taschinasbach. It consists of the Haufendorf village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Grüsch and the hamlets of Überlandquart und Cavadura (since 1874).|$|E
50|$|Tievebulliagh {{is formed}} from a {{volcanic}} plug, the intense heat generated by molten basalt {{has given rise}} to the formation of a durable flint, porcellanite, which is found {{at the foot of the}} eastern <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> of the mountain. Three small outcrops of porcellanite can be seen on the higher south-east slope.|$|E

50|$|The former {{municipality}} {{is located}} in the Calanca sub-district of the Moesa district. It is located on the left bank of the Calancasca river at an elevation of 1132 m. It is on a <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> from a prehistoric rock slide. It consists of the village of Cauco and the hamlets of Lasciallo, Masciadone and Bodio (GR).|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} route requires crampons and an ice axe, {{but does not}} require roping up, as there are no large crevasses on Chachani. Two traverses over relatively steep terrain constitute the main challenges {{on the way to}} the summit. The final push to the summit is a very steep <b>scree</b> <b>slope,</b> which provides for a fast descent back to the first traverse.|$|E
50|$|There are views {{available}} {{from a nearby}} <b>scree</b> <b>slope.</b> The views are mainly east, south and west from here; the summits of Big Mountain, Sideling Hill, Williamsburg Mountain and Blue Knob {{can be seen in}} the distance. Butler Knob is located within the Rothrock State Forest, all camping and activities on the mountain are subject to the rules and regulations of that agency.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} a subalpine, or {{sometimes}} an alpine climate. It grows on rocky terrain, such as outcrops, <b>scree</b> <b>slopes,</b> and crevices in cliffs. The rock is usually limestone, or sometimes quartzite.|$|R
50|$|Cryptogramma crispa grows among acidic {{rocks in}} areas where snow lies {{until late in the}} year. It is a pioneer species on stable <b>scree</b> <b>slopes</b> and also occurs on cliffs and dry stone walls.|$|R
50|$|Kilmond Scar is a {{prominent}} south-facing scarp of Upper Carboniferous Limestone. Its rock ledges and <b>scree</b> <b>slopes</b> support {{a variety of}} drought-tolerant flora. Elsewhere, deeper limestone soils support a diversity of calcareous grassland species.|$|R
5000|$|The caves are {{accessed}} {{from within}} the St. Michael's Cave auditorium. Cavers must descend a <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> to access the entrance which {{is marked by a}} sign engraved into the rock with the inscription [...] "To Leonora's Caves 1867". However, it is not clear when the caves were discovered. The caves are difficult to enter and for that reason is largely unspoilt.|$|E
50|$|St. Valentin auf der Haide (San Valentino alla Muta) is {{a village}} in South Tyrol in the parish of Graun im Vinschgau. The village on the Reschen Pass lies at a height of 1,472 metres between the Haidersee and Reschensee on the <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> of the Mals Heath. St. Valentin auf der Haide has about 800 {{inhabitants}} who predominantly earn a living from summer and winter tourism.|$|E
50|$|From {{that point}} a path crosses the stream, climbs a steep <b>scree</b> <b>slope</b> {{to the east}} and enters a valley (corrie), then climbs another steep slope to reach a col (Tizi'n'Toubkal at 3,940m). At the col the route turns left (northwards) to the summit ridge of Jbel Toubkal. The 4,167m summit is crowned with a curious {{pyramidal}} metal frame and views take in most of the Atlas and Little Atlas Mountains.|$|E
50|$|The {{ring ouzel}} (Turdus torquatus) is a European {{member of the}} thrush family, Turdidae. It is the {{mountain}} equivalent of the closely related common blackbird, and breeds in gullies, rocky areas or <b>scree</b> <b>slopes.</b>|$|R
