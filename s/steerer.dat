5|$|The bicycle {{made for}} Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The {{distance}} from bottom bracket to rear axle was 419mm {{rather than his}} normal 403. The distance from the bottom bracket to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the <b>steerer</b> column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.|$|E
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum <b>steerer</b> tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E

5000|$|When the <b>steer</b> wrestler {{is ready}} he [...] "calls" [...] for the <b>steer</b> by {{nodding his head}} and the chute man trips a lever opening the doors. The {{suddenly}} freed <b>steer</b> breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer.

The <b>steer</b> wrestler attempts to catch up to the running <b>steer,</b> lean {{over the side of the}} horse which is running flat out and grab the horns of the running <b>steer.</b> The <b>steer</b> wrestler then is pulled off his horse by the slowing <b>steer</b> and plants his heels into the dirt further slowing the <b>steer</b> and himself.

40|$|Revalor® {{implants}} (containing {{trenbolone acetate}} plus estradiol) were evaluated in a grazing-finishing system using <b>steers</b> with a known previous implant history. Grazing gains were not improved by either Ralgro® or Revalor implants, suggesting that previously implanted <b>steers</b> may {{not respond to}} implants during a later growing phase. During the finishing phase, <b>steers</b> implanted with Revalor gained 5. 4 to 8. 0 % faster (P<. 05) than <b>steers</b> implanted with Synovex-S®.

40|$|A feedlot {{demonstration}} utilizing Encore®, a new longterm implant product, {{was completed}} at the Allee Demonstration Farm at Newell, Iowa in 1999. Seventyone <b>steers</b> (697 lbs.) were allotted by weight and hide color and {{assigned to one}} of three treatments: 1) Encore® (43. 9 mg estradiol = E) on day 0; 2) Encore® plus Component® TS (140 mg trenbolone acetate = ETS 0) on day 0; or 3) Encore® on day 0 followed by Component® TS (ETS 100) on day 100. Due to wide standard deviation in the weight of <b>steers</b> {{at the beginning of the}} demonstration, cattle were harvested in two groups. Approximately half of each treatment group was sorted by visual appraisal as to market readiness. Statistical interactions existed within treatment group between first and second harvest dates, therefore data were split and analyzed accordingly. In the first harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had higher marbling scores than ETS 100 <b>steers,</b> and lower average daily gain than E <b>steers</b> and ETS 100 <b>steers.</b> In the second harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had more fat at the 12 th/ 13 rib than ETS 100 <b>steers,</b> but did not differ from E <b>steers.</b> Marbling scores were also higher for ETS 0 <b>steers</b> than either ETS 100 or E <b>steers</b> in the second harvest group.

2500|$|There {{was a great}} {{struggle}} over the nature and role of the pastoral {{in the early part}} of the century. After Pope published his Pastorals of the four seasons in 1709, an evaluation in the Guardian praised Ambrose Philips's pastorals above Pope's, and Pope replied with a mock praise of Philips's Pastorals that heaped scorn on them. [...] Pope quoted Philips's worst lines, mocked his execution, and delighted in pointing out his empty lines. [...] Pope later explained that any depictions of shepherds and their mistresses in the pastoral must not be updated shepherds, that they must be icons of the Golden Age: [...] "we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then to have been, when the best of men followed the employment" [...] (Gordon). [...] Philips's Pastorals were not particularly awful poems, but they did reflect his desire to [...] "update" [...] the pastoral. [...] In 1724, Philips would update poetry again by writing a series of odes dedicated to [...] "all ages and characters, from Walpole, the <b>steerer</b> of the realm, to Miss Pulteney in the nursery." [...] Henry Carey was one of the best at satirizing these poems, and his Namby Pamby became a hugely successful obliteration of Philips and Philips's endeavor. [...] What is notable about Philips against Pope, however, is the fact that both poets were adapting the pastoral and the ode, both altering it. [...] Pope's insistence upon a Golden Age pastoral no less than Philips's desire to update it meant making a political statement. [...] While it is easy to see in Ambrose Philips an effort at modernist triumph, it is no less the case that Pope's artificially restricted pastoral was a statement of what the ideal should be.|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} wrestling the <b>steer</b> {{to the ground}} is to lean from the galloping horse which is running beside the <b>steer,</b> transferring {{the weight of the}} upper body to the neck of the <b>steer,</b> with one hand on the near horn of the <b>steer</b> and the far horn grasped in the crook of the other elbow. One then lets the horse carry his feet by the <b>steer</b> until his feet naturally fall out of the stirrups.

60|$|There {{is another}} little item about Gamming which {{must not be}} {{forgotten}} here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat <b>steerer</b> or harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of {{the eyes of the}} whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim death.|$|E
