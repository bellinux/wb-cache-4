60|$|In animals the {{phenomena}} of asexual propagation are so obscure, that at present we cannot {{be said to}} know much about them; but if we turn to that mode of perpetuation which results from the sexual process, then we find variation a perfectly constant occurrence, to a certain extent; and, indeed, I think that {{a certain amount of}} variation from the primitive stock is the necessary result of the method of <b>sexual</b> <b>propagation</b> itself; for, inasmuch as the thing propagated proceeds from two organisms of different sexes and different makes and temperaments, and as the offspring is to be either of one sex or the other, it is quite clear that it cannot be an exact diagonal of the two, or it would be of no sex at all; it cannot be an exact intermediate form between that of each of its parents--it must deviate to one side or the other. You do not find that the male follows the precise type of the male parent, nor does the female always inherit the precise characteristics of the mother,--there is always a proportion of the female character in the male offspring, and of the male character in the female offspring. That must be quite plain to all of you who have looked at all attentively on your own children or those of your neighbours; you will have noticed how very often it may happen that the son shall exhibit the maternal type of character, or the daughter possess the characteristics of the father's family. There are all sorts of intermixtures and intermediate conditions between the two, where complexion, or beauty, or fifty other different peculiarities belonging to either side of the house, are reproduced in other members of the same family. Indeed, it is sometimes to be remarked in this kind of variation, that the variety belongs, strictly speaking, to neither of the immediate parents; you will see a child in a family who is not like either its father or its mother; but some old person who knew its grandfather or grandmother, or, it may be, an uncle, or, perhaps, even a more distant relative, will see a great similarity between the child and one of these. In this way it constantly happens that the characteristic of some previous member of the family comes out and is reproduced and recognised in the most unexpected manner.|$|E

Twenty-seven species of bees were identified as pollinators. At Lethbridge, honey bees (Apis mellifera) comprised 74 % of the observations, bumble bees 16 %, and leafcutter bees 10 %, while at Spring Coulee, the proportions were honey bees 14 %, bumble bees 69 %, and leafcutter bees 17 %. The rate of foraging by pollinator species from flower to flower varied; bumble bee species, especially Bombus nevadensis Cress., foraged consistently more efficiently than honey bees or alfalfa leafcutter bees, Megachile rotundata (F.). A theoretical approach used to predict the bee populations required to pollinate varying flower densities shows that the population of B. nevadensis required is about half those of Bombus huntii Greene and M. rotundata and less than one-quarter that of the honey bee. Pollination by B. nevadensis consistently resulted in more seeds per pod than with any other bumble bee species, the honey bee, or M. rotundata. Of the nine species of bumble bee that established colonies in artificial domiciles near the field, B. nevadensis established the most colonies each year.

Both phenomena have been hypothesized to provide fitness advantages to populations, but such explanations require rather than explain the initial establishment of mobile elements and genes for sex. Genes encoding sexuality may invade asexual populations as molecular parasites, whose success then allows mobile elements to spread as parasites of sexual genomes. The prediction that mobile elements can invade only sexual populations was tested using isogenic sexual and asexual populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the retrotransposon Ty 3. Active Ty 3 elements more consistently invaded sexual than asexual populations. In subsequent experiments involving selection on media containing ethanol as a carbon source or $ beta$-glycerophosphate as a limiting phosphorus source, transposition by galactose-induced Ty 3 elements produced none of the mutations involved in adaptation to these media, and conferred no adaptive advantage among competing populations.

While genetic diversity studies have included cultivars from this subgroup, intra- population structure and phylogenetic relationships per se are still unknown. In addition, none of these studies have attempted to study the evolutionary history and epigenetic polymorphism in this subgroup.

The results show that despite being phenotypically distinct, these cultivars are strikingly genetically similar with a narrow genetic base. While DNA methylation polymorphisms are common amongst EAHB cultivars, MSAP does not detect any obvious relationship between DNA methylation variation and phenotypic variation in East African Highland bananas. This study demonstrates that the EAHB subgroup has low mutation rates, show past population expansion but may have suffered a genetic bottleneck that may have led to the low genetic diversity. Extensive linkage disequilibrium and balancing selection were observed. Finally, I discovered that EAHB cultivars and Zebrina (wild AA cultivar) underwent a speciation event 928 thousand years and their most recent common ancestor dates back 2980 thousand years ago. 2016 - 05 - 1...|$|R

The morphology of many colonial organisms can be idealized as comprising an integrated collection of feeding and reproductive entities called modules connected by a common vascular system. The arrangement of modules and vascular connections defines two contrasting morphologies and associated life histories: (1) Sheets-like colonies have a robust morphology with uniformly distributed modules interconnected by relatively short vascular stolons. Sheets are typically highly specialized to particular habitats, persistent over time, resistant to disturbance, and competitively superior to their counterparts. (2) Runner-like colonies tend to have a relatively haphazard distribution of modules with long vascular stolons. They are typically transient generalists with the potential to escape competitive encounters or unfavorable conditions via <b>sexual</b> and asexual <b>propagation.</b> The colonial hydroids (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa), Podocoryna carnea and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, exemplify these contrasting morphologies and life history attributes-specifically, P. carnea is runner-like and H. symbiolongicarpus is sheet-like. Competition in these species is mediated by nematocysts (stinging cells) deployed by specialized structures that represent a form of inducible defense. Further, colonies display a high degree of morphological plasticity that may affect competitive ability. As expected, H. symbiolongicarpus predominates in natural populations; however, P. carnea seems to be the competitive dominant under laboratory conditions. To illuminate this apparent incongruity, an integrative approach was used to assess differences in competitive ability through (1) video microscopy and digital image analysis of vascular fluid flow physiology, (2) ecological studies and digital image analysis of colony morphology under varying environmental conditions, (3) proteolytic assay of nematocyst venom, and (4) age-specific study of competitive ability and colony morphology using digital image analysis. The most intriguing results suggest that competitive ability may vary during colony development. Small H. symbiolongicarpus colonies shortly after metamorphosis are likely far more competitively able than clonal replicates of mature colonies. Both the observed prevalence of H. symbiolongicarpus in natural populations and the competitive superiority of P. carnea in the laboratory may thus be explained...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi selecionar matrizes e clones, provenientes de propagação sexuada e assexuada, com potencial de propagação in vitro, para produção de mudas de mangabeira. Foram coletados frutos de 11 matrizes e de cada matriz selecionaram-se 24 sementes em bom estado fitossanitário. Após a desinfecção, as sementes foram inoculadas em meio MS, sem reguladores de crescimento, obtendo-se uma média de germinação de 92, 4 %, e as matrizes não apresentaram diferença significativa entre si. Na fase de multiplicação, em meio MS, com os reguladores de crescimento BAP (6 -benzilaminopurina) e AIB (ácido indol- 3 -butírico), ambos na concentração de 1, 28 mg L- 1, a melhor matriz foi a C 1 e o melhor clone foi o C 1 15. Em todas as fases foi observada alta variabilidade, em menor porcentagem na matriz e maior porcentagem no clone dentro da matriz. A seleção deve ser realizada principalmente nos clones dentro da matriz.

The objective of this work was to select better mother plants and clones from <b>sexual</b> and assexual <b>propagation,</b> with potential to survive in vitro, for producing mangaba seedlings. Fruits were collected from 11 mother plants and from each plant, 24 seeds without aparent diseases were selected. After superficial desinfection, seeds were inoculated in MS medium without growth regulators and having a germination of 92. 4 % without significant difference between mother plants. On multiplication phase, with MS medium, with growth regulators BAP (6 -benzilaminopurine) and IBA (indol- 3 -butiric acid), both at concentration of 1. 28 mg L- 1; the better mother plant was C 1 and better clone was C 1 15. During all phases of this work there was a high variability, mainly among clones. The selection must be made mainly among clones in mother plants...|$|R
