The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> was fixed at 15 % for the rotational set-aside and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of set-aside. The set-aside requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the intervention stocks of cereals continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate.</b> This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the obligatory <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> barely affects the set-aside area in Finland; (b) the change of the obligatory <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU set-aside system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of <b>set-aside</b> <b>rate</b> is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the set-aside obligatory), rather than to cut the set-aside rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the set-aside area shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU set-aside requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of current market {{conditions}} and Agenda 2000 CAP reforms, particularly the 'rebalancing' of support between cereals and oilseed crops, on crop gross margins and hence on the incentive to produce oilseed rape on three representative farm types in eastern England. Results indicate that under a conventional rotation, oilseed rape area falls substantially {{on two of the}} farm types considered. However, the incentive to plant break crops more frequently increases after the reform; under a two-break crop rotation, oilseed rape area remains at pre-reform levels. Oilseed rape prices of c. Â£ 100 per tonne, particularly when combined with unrestricted <b>set-aside</b> <b>rates,</b> conventional rotations and low cereal prices, would give farmers in eastern England substantial incentives to reduce the area of the crop grown...|$|R
