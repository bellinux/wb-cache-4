40|$|Porous {{pavement}} is {{a special}} type of pavement that allows rain and snowmelt to pass through it, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and surrounding areas. In addition, porous pavement filters some pollutants from the runoff if maintained. There {{are two types of}} porous pavement: porous asphalt and pervious concrete. Porous asphalt pavement consists of an open-graded coarse aggregate, bonded together by asphalt cement, with sufficient interconnected voids to make it highly permeable to water. Pervious concrete consists of specially formulated mixtures of Portland cement, uniform, open-graded coarse aggregate, and water. Pervious concrete has enough void space to allow rapid percolation of liquids through the pavement. The porous pavement surface is typically placed over a highly permeable layer of open-graded gravel and crushed stone. The void spaces in the aggregate layers act as a storage reservoir for runoff. A filter fabric is placed beneath the gravel and stone layers to screen out fine soil particles. Figure 1 illustrates a common porous asphalt pavement installation. Two common modifications made in designing porous pavement systems are (1) varying the amount of storage in the stone reservoir beneath the pavement and (2) adding perforated pipes {{near the top of the}} reservoir to discharge excess storm water after the reservoir has been filled. Some municipalities have also added storm water reservoirs (in addition to stone reservoirs) beneath the pavement. These reservoirs should be designed to accommodate runoff from a design storm and should provide for infiltration through the underlying subsoil. APPLICABILITY Porous pavement may substitute for conventional pavement on parking areas, areas with light traffic, and the shoulders of airport taxiways a runways, provided that the grades, <b>subsoils,</b> <b>drainage</b> characteristics, and groundwater conditions are suitable.

The use of {{geophysical}} {{methods such as}} that of Spontaneous Potential (SP) to investigate areas where the geomorphological processes occur, has the role to identify less visible processes as for example subcutaneous erosion or piping, <b>subsoil</b> water <b>drainage</b> and finding specific spatial differences of these processes. Comparative study of these sites allows correlation between geomorphological factors, soil and climate, but also to observe the evolution of subsurface erosion or underground water infiltration over time. During this investigation a series of mesh grids have been made in areas with different characteristics (lithology, pedology, slope, exposition, etc.) at different time periods in order to spot and analyse the change in data in the chosen sites, various conditions given. Values expressed in millivolts (mV) obtained by the Spontaneous Potential method have been put into an algorithm for interpolation looking to yield a pattern of values of {{what is happening in the}} soil during that period of time. Thus, in the autumn, the investigation site at the nivation niche Baia Vulturilor, returned values of between - 22. 6 mV and 65. 6 mV, while in spring in the same site, values were within the range of - 14. 4 mV / 30. 1 mV. On the other hand, on the site of the cryopediment under the Semenic peak, in the spring, return values ranged from - 40. 4 mV and - 1. 1 mV. A particular case is that of the glacis near Piatra Goznei peak; in this area anthropogenic electricity influences on soil can be found. Based on some models a trend of water movement in the soil could be established, this depending heavily on the amount of precipitation infiltration, local lithology, depth of soil and their structure, and evapotranspiration process.

In the first part, basic agricultural land improvement measures such as <b>drainage,</b> <b>subsoiling</b> etc. are evaluated. In the second part, the effect of the farming system on soil structure is summarized in an index with three positive factors and three negative factors.

40|$|Perth is {{a rapidly}} growing city {{and the demand for}} urban land has been {{steadily}} increasing over recent years (D. P. I., 2011) and the meeting of environmental legislations for storm-water management and floodplain strategic management is the kernel around which a variety of skills and deep speculation revolves. Technological advancement and multi-variable calculus have made possible the ability to predict how a given artefact will behave according to a defined series of variables in the environment within which the apparatus is expected to perform its duty. This is to introduce the key role that modelling resembles within the design process. In geological terms, it is known with deposition that Perth is accommodated over a rather variegated spectrum of soil types that ranges from sand, silt, clayey sand and clay. Due to this multi-faceted nature there are no standard design guidelines for <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> systems at date. A calibrated mathematical model can readily facilitate the design process and decision making thanks to its ability to provide groundwater mounding height values for environments with different physical and hydrogeological characteristics. <b>Subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> is used throughout the world to control shallow groundwater levels to facilitate land use in both agricultural and urban development. The term subsoil implies that a buried pipe is used as opposed to an open drain, usually where land values are high. The primary mechanism by which <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> functions is the provision of an outlet from a slotted pipe system such that groundwater can flow by gravity, according to Darcy’s law, towards the pipe thus lowering groundwater levels. <b>Subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> is usually constructed in parallel or sub-parallel lines, so that the water table mounds between the parallel drainage lines. Critical parameters determining whether a <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> system operates as intended are: the soil permeability, the volume of water to be drained in unit time and drain spacing. On the Swan Coastal Plain <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> has been used in urban developments where the water table has been shallow for decades, generally with success owing to the characteristically sandy soils and the relatively low rainfall in the South West of Western Australia. This paper describes a <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> experimental site in the City of Armadale, instrumented to monitor water table mounding between a set of parallel subsoil drains in imported sand fill in 2009 and 2010. The paper describes the data collected together with application of a suitable model to represent the relevant components of water flux, and an application of that model to design the <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> systems on the Swan Coastal Plain. It is the contention of this paper that a properly designed and calibrated model is to foresee the rise and decline of the perched water table under a given set of environmental conditions. Doing so, {{it will be possible to}} implement the Best Practice Technique (BPT) while addressing the need to avoid the oversizing of sand-fill requirements and consequent levitation of capital budget, maximise the security of assets and obviate the violation of buildings’ structural integrity. In terms of literature review, it has been deliberately decided to report references that are relevant to the Western Australia scenario solely: this is justified by the unique morpho-geological arrangement of the Swan Coastal Plain; in fact, overseas regulators for urban development may enforce building codes, approval schemes and land sub-divisional requirements that are not parallel to the Australian decisional criteria for such practices...|$|E

40|$|Salt marshes are a {{characteristic}} feature of estuaries and coastal seas. They {{are found in}} the upper coastal intertidal zones between land and water, which are regularly flooded by tides and surges. They are covered with salt-tolerant vegetation types, such as herbs and grasses. Sheltering from continuous intense hydrodynamic forcing by waves and currents and sufficient supply of (fine) sediment are the two main requirements for salt marsh development. The presence of vegetation accelerates the sediment settlement by reducing the wave forces on the bed material. Addition-ally, the roots of the plants stabilize the accumulated sediments and amplify the process of <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage,</b> consoli-dation and compaction. Salt marshes and the intertidal flats in front form a coherent system with many mutual dependencies. Coastal flood risk reduction by creating and restoring ecosystems is increasingly seen as a promising supplement to conventional coastal engineering methods. Salt marshes, mangrove forests and reed fields can act as a vegetated foreshore in front of a coastal dike. In such a combined dike-foreshore system, the foreshore plays a role in attenuating storm waves, whereas the dike retains the surge and the remaining wave energy. The current study focuses on the process of wave attenuation by vegetation and, vice versa, the process of breakage of vegetation due to wave action. Hydraulic Structures and Flood Ris...|$|E
40|$|Subsoil {{compaction}} affects {{all aspects}} of soil quality, and contrary to topsoil compaction it is persistent. Natural alleviation processes such as wetting/drying, freezing/thawing and biological activity including root growth decrease rapidly with depth. In compacted soil, these alleviation processes are moreover diminished because root growth and biological activity are reduced and soil water contents remain higher in compacted than in well-structured soil. Wheel loads are still increasing and, in consequence, the extent and severity of subsoil compaction. Sustainable soil management requires the uncompromising criterion that no subsoil compaction can be accepted. Consequently, only field traffic with wheel loads lower than the carrying capacity of the subsoil is allowed. This implies that subsoil stress caused by wheel load should not exceed {{the strength of the}} subsoil. Therefore, this chapter emphasises the importance of soil strength and the calculation of soil stresses in the subsoil. One of the main constraints in using the carrying capacity concept proves to be the lack of data on soil strength. Existing recommended limits for wheel loads and inflation pressures are not adequate and can result in over or underestimating of allowable wheel loads and subsequent uneconomical solutions or <b>subsoil</b> compaction. Adequate <b>drainage</b> of soils is a prerequisite for reduced subsoil compaction. Mouldboard ploughing with all tractor wheels on the non-ploughed ‘land’ and umbilical systems for applying manure slurry are realistic options to reduce compaction. Controlled traffic systems that limit the wheeled area may be implemented by the use of wide span vehicles and by steering tractors along traffic lanes. Although we support such provisions, our chapter will advocate and focus primarily on adjusting wheel loads to the carrying capacity of the subsoils. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was set up}} to investigate the effects of soil loosening on the drainage efficiency of a structurally unstable silty clay loam in Devon. Such soils are common to the Palaeozoic slates of South West England, and in many parts of Wales and Scotland. The dominance of the fine earth fraction these soils by silt sized particles and the associated low clay fractions (10 - 35 %) gives rise to weak structures that are unsuitable f or mole drainage. Six drains were laid with permeable fill at a 20 m spacing on a gently sloping site at Seale-Hayne College Farm. A year after installation half the site was loosened to a depth of 0. 4 m. The whole site was then cultivated and winter wheat sown. The study concentrated on the modification of the soil physical environment and water transmission routes following loosening operations for autumn re-wetting, the winter period and spring drying. Data collection involved the analysis of drainflow hydrographs and the measurement of soil water physical parameters. Results from an intensive twelve month monitoring period indicate that the modification of <b>subsoil</b> to improve <b>drainage</b> does not necessarily give the results expected. In this study {{it has been shown that}} loosening of an unstable silty clay loam did not enhance drainage, in fact the reverse was true which can have dire consequences in terms of trafficability and plant root growth. Loosening lead to an increased porosity which resulted in a greater, albeit temporary, retention of water within the disturbed zone. This means that loosened soils were wetter prior to a rainstorm and remained so for a longer period after rainfall. This response, in turn lead to significant reductions in soil shear strength, which has important implications for successful crop husbandry in the autumn and spring periods when field operations are necessary. Further work is required to assess the temporal persistence of soil loosening on soil physical conditions and crop responses...|$|R

40|$|Objective of Research The {{interest}} in crop modelling started since the introduction and popularisation of computer technology, which facilitated the dynamic simulation of complex natural systems. In particular, crop growth and soil water balance models for irrigation scheduling are popular at locations where {{water is a}} limiting factor for crop production. In a Water Research Commission project, the soil water balance model (SWB) for irrigation scheduling under full and deficit irrigation was made available. The SWB model is a relatively simple generic crop growth model based on sound physical and physiological principles, (i. e. mechanistic) using daily climatic inputs for daily time-step calculations of the soil-plant-atmosphere water balance to estimate plant growth water use. The SWB model was primarily developed for predicting real-time soil water deficit of field crops with a one-dimensional canopy light interception and water redistribution procedure. Hedgerow tree crops are planted in widely spaced rows to allow access between trees to carry out necessary management practices (e. g. pest control and harvesting). Distribution of energy is not uniform in widely spaced crops. In addition, localised under tree irrigation is often used for tree crops to reduce system installation costs. This irrigation (micro- or drip) only wets a limited area under the canopy of the trees so that evaporation from the soil surface is also not uniform. One can expect root density to vary with depth {{as well as with}} distance between the rows so water uptake for transpiration will also vary in two dimensions. It is also essential {{to take into account the}} limited volume of soil wetted under micro-irrigation. If this is not done, the soil capacity will be incorrectly estimated with a standard one-dimensional approach, leading to undesirable over-irrigation in the wetted zone, as well as possible crop stress resulting from a too long an irrigation interval. In order to accurately estimate canopy growth, water balance and yield, it is therefore essential to model canopy radiant interception and soil water balance of hedgerow tree crops in two dimensions and on an hourly time step, based on sound physical principles. Lack of suitable user-friendly tools to mechanistically describe the two-dimensional energy and soil water balance of tree crops was identified. Due to the importance of fruit crops, on the export as well as local markets, as well as the encouraging results from the initial SWB model, it was decided to improve the SWB model by incorporating a two-dimensional system for use in hedgerow plantings. This thesis reports on the methodology developed to monitor the energy and soil moisture differences within various hedgerows through 24 hour cycles and the results obtained, as well as the subsequent use of the results to evaluate the 2 -dimensional water balance model. This research was an integral, but independent, part of a larger research thrust, i. e. the development of a two-dimensional fruit tree water balance model that can account for the unique fractional interception of solar radiation associated with hedgerow orchards as opposed to the horizontal planar interception encountered in agronomic crops. The primary objective of this thesis is not the actual programming and mathematical manipulations of the relevant algorithms but to create a reliable data base and then evaluate the model. The primary objective of this thesis was to evaluate the model for deciduous fruit trees using peaches as an example and evaluate the model for evergreen fruit trees using citrus as an example. Model description In the overall research thrust two types of model, both predicting crop water requirements on a daily time step, were developed for hedgerow tree crops and included in SWB: i) A mechanistic two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference, Richards’ equation based soil water balance model; and ii) An FAO-based crop factor model, with a quasi- 2 D cascading soil water balance model. For the sake of clarity and completeness, the principles of the models are presented in the thesis and are briefly described in this subsection. The first model calculates the two-dimensional energy interception for hedgerow fruit trees, based on solar and row orientation, tree size and shape, as well as leaf area density. The two-dimensional soil water redistribution is calculated with a finite difference solution. The two-dimensional energy interception model assumes leaves to be uniformly distributed within an ellipsoid truncated at its base, and radiation penetrating the canopy is attenuated according to Beer’s law. This geometry is very versatile as many different shapes can be generated. In order to determine the spatial distribution of soil irradiance across the tree row, the canopy path length through which the radiation must travel to reach a certain point on the soil surface is calculated. Radiation can penetrate neighbouring rows, so two rows on either side of the simulated row are considered. Beam or direct radiation and diffuse radiation for the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) and NIR (near-infrared radiation) wavebands are calculated separately, as they interact differently with the canopy. The ratio of actual measured to potential radiation is used to estimate the proportion of direct and diffuse radiation in these two spectral bands. The attenuation of beam radiation by the canopy is strongly dependent on zenith angle, and, for crops planted in rows, azimuth angle and row orientation will also be crucial. Elevation and azimuth angles are calculated from latitude, solar declination that depends on day of year, and time of day. Before the length of canopy through which radiation penetrates can be calculated, azimuth angle needs to be adjusted to take row orientation into account. Input data required to run the two-dimensional canopy interception model are: day of year (DOY), latitude, standard meridian, longitude, daily solar radiation, row width and orientation, canopy height and width, bare stem height and distance from the ground to the bottom of the canopy, extinction coefficient, absorptivity and leaf area density. In order to simulate two-dimensional water movement in the soil, a grid of nodes were established. This divides the soil up into a number of elements. The distances between nodes are selected so that model output can easily be compared to field measured values. Each element has its own physical properties, so this scheme allows variation in soil properties in two dimensions. Symmetry planes are assumed to occur mid-way between two rows on either side of the hedgerow and no water flux is allowed across these planes. The model redistributes water in the soil in two-dimensions using a finite difference solution to Richards’ continuity equation for water flow. The aim is to find the matric potentials, which will cause the mass balance error to be negligible. This is done using the Newton-Raphson procedure. Two lower boundary conditions can be chosen in the model: i) gravity drainage for well-drained soils, and ii) zero-flux lower boundary to simulate an impermeable layer. A precipitation or irrigation in mm is converted to a flux in kg m- 1 s- 1 by dividing the time step and multiplying by the horizontal distance over which the water is distributed. The infiltration does not have to be uniform over the surface. Non-uniform infiltration is especially important in very coarse soils where lateral redistribution is likely to be limited, or in the case of micro-irrigation. As with the infiltration flux, evaporation is multiplied by the horizontal distance over which it occurs in order to get an evaporative flux in kg m- 1 s- 1. Potential vapotranspiration (PET) is calculated from weather data using the Penman-Monteith equation and the maximum crop factor after rainfall occurs. PET is then partitioned at the soil surface into potential evaporation and potential transpiration depending on solar orientation, row direction and canopy size, shape and leaf area density. Crop water uptake (transpiration) can either be limited by atmospheric demand or soil-root water supply. Root densities at different soil depths are accounted for in the calculation of root water uptake. The user can specify root depth and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil. Required inputs for the two-dimensional soil water balance model are: starting and planting dates, altitude, rainfall and irrigation water amounts, as well as maximum and minimum daily temperature. Two points on the water retention function (usually field capacity and permanent wilting point), initial volumetric soil water content and bulk density are required for each soil layer. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity can also be entered as input for each soil layer, or calculated by the model using the water retention curve. Row distance, wetted diameter of micro-jets or drippers, fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil as well as distance of the nodes from the tree row are also required as input. The second, simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach, was developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with limited input data. This model includes a semi-empirical approach for partitioning of aboveground energy, a cascading soil water redistribution that separates the wetted and non-wetted portion of the ground, as well as prediction of crop yields. The FAO-based crop factor procedure was combined with the mechanistic SWB model, thereby still allowing evaporation and transpiration to be modelled separately as supply and demand limited processes. The crop factor model does not grow the canopy mechanistically and therefore the effect of water stress on canopy size is not simulated. The simpler crop factor model should, however, still perform satisfactorily if the estimated canopy cover closely resembles that found in the field. The following input parameters are required to run the FAO-type crop factor model: planting date, latitude, altitude, maximum and minimum daily air temperatures, FAO crop factors and duration of crop stages. The input data required to run the two-dimensional cascading model are rainfall and irrigation amounts, volumetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point, as well as initial volumetric soil water content for each soil layer. Row spacing, wetted diameter, distance between micro-irrigators or drippers and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil are also required. Required input data for yield prediction with the FAO model are FAO stress factors for growing stages and potential yield. Field Trial Evaluation of the model was carried out for a wide range of conditions (row orientation, period of the year and canopy density). For this purpose, two field trials were set up. The first trial was established in a peach (Prunus persica cv Transvaalia) orchard on the lysimeter facilities at Hatfield (Pretoria University experimental farm). This provided a site where detailed observations could be easily recorded to evaluate the SWB model for deciduous trees. The second trial was established in a citrus clementine (Citrus reticulate cv. Nules Clementine) orchard at the Syferkuil experimental farm of the University of the North. This was the site where measured data were collected to evaluate the SWB model for evergreen trees. In both field trials, the following field measurements were carried out and used to evaluate the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model: i) Weather measurements (temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall). ii) Soil texture, bulk density, penetrometer resistance. iii) Volumetric soil water content with neutron water meter and time domain reflectometry (TDR). iv) Soil matrix potential with heat dissipation sensors. v) Root distribution by taking soil core samples and washing out roots to determine root length. vi) Soil irradiance at different distances from the tree row with tube solarimeters. v) Leaf area index and density with a LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyser. vi) Canopy size and row orientation. In addition, load cell lysimeters were used in the peach orchard at Hatfield in order to measure crop water use. An additional field trial was carried out at the Hatfield experimental station on Leuceaena (Leucaena leucocephela) trees in order to test the two-dimensional radiant interception model for different environmental conditions (tree size and shape as well as row orientation). For the same purpose, two other trials were carried out on two commercial orchards at Brits in Empress Mandarin (Citrus reticulate cv. Empress) and Delta Valencia (Citrus sinensis [L. ] cv. Osbeck) orchards. In these field trials, weather data were recorded, soil irradiance across the row was measured with tube solarimeters, as well as leaf area index and density, canopy size and row orientation. Results The simple, quasi two-dimensional, cascading soil water balance model was calibrated using data from the peach trial at the Hatfield experimental station. In the process, FAO basal crop coefficients (Kcb) were determined for first and second leaf peach trees. The daily crop factor (Kc) was calculated using evapotranspiration measurements from the lysimeters and the grass reference evapotranspiration calculated from weather data. The Kcb values for the various growth stages were determined by fitting an appropriate line through the lower values of Kc, which were taken to reflect the condition where the soil surface was dry (negligible evaporation), <b>subsoil</b> <b>drainage</b> was negligible and there was sufficient water not to restrict transpiration. There was good agreement between predicted and measured daily soil water deficit for water stressed and non-stressed treatments. This was expected since the calibration data came from the trial. Field measurements in Hatfield also indicated that in hedgerow plantings the whole area across the row must be borne in mind when assessing soil water content. The practice of using single or restricted locality measurements, as utilised in agronomic crops, can be misleading in orchards. The reason for this is the effect of the irrigation distribution and rain interception by the canopy, the variation in radiation interception by the canopy across the row, the irradiance reaching the soil surface as the season progresses, the presence of a grass sod or bare soil in the inter-row region and the root density across the row. In both field trials at Hatfield and Syferkuil, it was found that there are significant amounts of roots in the inter-row region and thus this portion of the rooting volume must not be disregarded when assessing the water balance. The two-dimensional energy interception and soil evaporation components were evaluated separately. The crucial interactions between the model components were integrated in the validation of the two-dimensional soil water balance model, which uses the energy interception and soil evaporation sub-models to split evaporation and transpiration. The radiant interception model predictions and the tube solarimeter measured soil irradiance generally gave very good agreement at different distances from the tree row and in different orchards. However, some discrepancies between measurements and model predictions occurred. This was attributed to the presence of trunks and branches shading the tube solarimeters at low leaf area densities, irregularities in the shape of the hedgerow, and nonuniform distribution of leaves within the canopy. In one case the canopy shape differed drastically from that used in the model. The output obtained with the two-dimensional soil water balance model was compared to independent field measurements in order to evaluate the full SWB two-dimensional model. Volumetric soil water content data collected with the TDR system in the peach and citrus orchards were compared to SWB simulations. Results of model simulations done during drying cycles showed that the surface layer predictions were generally very good. However, in certain situations discrepancies between measurements and simulations were observed, in particular, for deeper soil layers. This could have been due to spatial variability of soil properties, as well as soil disturbance during the installation of TDR probes. It is clear that TDR probes can be used in irrigation scheduling to determine crop water use over certain periods. Caution should, however, be exercised in the interpretation of absolute values of volumetric soil water content obtained from the probes. Scenario modelling and sensitivity analyses were carried out by varying some input parameters and observing variations in certain output variables. The aim was to show an application of this tool to identify the most suitable management practice in order to maximise water use efficiency. Two case studies were considered for two “virtual” orchards located at different latitudes and in different climates (Kakamas in the Northern Cape and Stellenbosch in the Western Cape). The results of the scenario simulations indicated that, based on the inputs used, the orchards should be planted in a N-S row orientation, a wetted diameter of 0. 5 m should be applied when the canopy width is 2 m, in order to minimize water losses through evaporation. As the canopy width increased to 3 m, so the wetted diameter should be increased to 1. 5 m. If the wetted diameter is too small, transpiration and thus yield will be reduced. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out for both case studies varying the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil, and observing variations in the output results of evaporation and transpiration. The contribution to crop water uptake from the inter-row volume of soil can be high, in particular under high atmospheric evaporative demand, and this needs to be accounted for in irrigation management in order to maximise rainfall use efficiency in areas of higher summer rainfall. Conclusions and recommendations The methodologies developed to measure the temporal and spatial variation in solar radiation and thus the energy distribution within Hedgerow orchards worked well. The methods used to measure the temporal and spatial variation of the soil water balance also worked well. Thus a very good data set was generated that enabled the sound evaluation of the 2 -D SWB model. Thus one can conclude that the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model that was developed in the overall research thrust and included in the Soil Water Balance irrigation scheduling model worked well. The simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach and a cascading soil water balance, that was also developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with a limited set of input data, also gave very satisfactory results. The FAO-based model and the cascading soil water balance were calibrated for first leaf and second leaf peaches at Hatfield. The two-dimensional model was fully evaluated for deciduous orchards using data obtained in field trials on peaches and Leucaena (Hatfield). For model validation in evergreen citrus orchards, data obtained in field trials set up at the Syferkuil experimental station (University of the North) and on two commercial farms in Brits were used. Irregular trunks and branches could cause inaccuracies in predictions of the energy balance. At low leaf area densities, the shade from trunks and branches is not accounted for in the SWB model. The relative importance of non-symmetric canopy shape as opposed to nonuniform leaf distribution did have an effect but indications where that this was not critical. The major difficulties encountered in the evaluation of the soil water balance were due to spatial variability of soil properties and disturbance of the soil when the water status monitoring sensors were installed. Careful installation is therefore recommended when using sensors that give localised measurements like those used in this study (heat dissipation sensors and TDR probes). The successful evaluation of the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model opens the opportunity to develop a useful yield predictor and productivity efficiency measure if one knows the canopy to fruit ratio. This information could also be useful for fruit colour and internal quality research. As demonstrated with data from the peach trial at Hatfield, soil or cover crops between rows can also have a large effect on the efficient use of rainfall, and this could be further investigated. The biggest contribution of this model is likely to be the quantification of the contribution that rainfall can make to crop water use by taking the non-irrigated inter-row soil reservoir into account. It is recommended to accurately estimate the root fraction in the wetted and nonwetted volume of soil by digging a trench across the row, taking core soil samples and determining root densities. The two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference soil water balance model is expected to be more accurate than the cascading soil water balance, due to the sound physical principles on which it is based. The mechanistic detailed approach could give guidance with respect to the magnitude of errors made by using simpler, more empirical approaches. However, the two-dimensional model will also require more input parameters compared to the simpler cascading model. In particular, the most difficult parameters to determine will be the leaf area density for the radiation energy interception part due to the cost of the instrumentation, and the hydraulic conductivity for the soil part due to the specialised knowledge and scientific equipm...|$|E
3000|$|The {{present study}} area {{proved that the}} GIS and RS {{technique}} used for computation and analysis of various morphometric parameters of the basin and helps to understand various terrain parameters such as nature of the bedrock, infiltration capacity, surface runoff, etc. The Shanur River is well drained in nature with the stream order varying from 1 to 4. The basin is dominated by lower order streams and the total length of stream segments. Stream frequency and drainage density is the prime criterion for the morphometric classification of drainage basins, which certainly control the runoff pattern, sediment yield, and other hydrological parameters of the drainage basin. The detailed study shows 19 morphometric parameters that have been calculated {{with the help of}} Arc GIS- 10 software. The bifurcation ratio ranges is 3.5 – 4.71 and the total bifurcation ratio is 12.57. The quantitative analysis of linear, relief and aerial parameters using GIS and RS techniques is found to be of immense utility in river basin evaluation, basin prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resource management. The bifurcation ratio in the basin indicates normal basin category and the presence of moderate drainage density suggesting that, it is moderate permeable <b>subsoil</b> and coarse <b>drainage</b> texture. The morphometric analysis of the drainage network of the basin show dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage patterns with moderate drainage texture. The variation in stream length ratio might be due to change in slope and topography. The morphometric analysis is carried out in 4 stream order of Shanur River Basin using GIS and RS techniques for determining the linear aspects such as stream order, bifurcation ratio, stream length and L u/S u. The difference in stream length ratio might be due to changes in slope and topography. The basin is having moderate to high relief of the terrain and elongated in shape. The higher drainage density indicates that the sub-basin is impermeable subsoil and sparse vegetation cover. The Channel index (C [...] i [...]), Valley index (V [...] i [...]), Rho coefficient (ρ) and minimum aerial distance (A dm) Kms values are 0.38, 1.14, 0.31, and 38.42, respectively, indicating that the Shanur River Basin is elongated in shape, with high discharge of runoff and impermeable subsoil condition. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have best efficient tool in drainage delineation. The conventional methods of morphometric analysis are time-consuming and error prone, while use of GIS method allows for more reliable and accurate estimation of similar parameters of Shanur River Basin. The first and second stream order is a high priority stream and is prone to comparatively higher erosion and soil loss. Geological field verification also agrees with the present morphological-based prioritization. Hence, appropriate soil erosion control measures are required in this basin to conserve the land from further erosion.|$|R
40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak <b>subsoil</b> is present, <b>drainage</b> in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.

40|$|Geology and soils {{in general}} Surinam is {{situated}} at {{the northern edge of}} the very old and stable Guiana shield. Six-sevenths of the country’s surface are occupied by formations belonging to the shield and designated together as the basal complex. However, the Roraima formation does not belong to the complex. It was deposited during the Mesozoic (probably the Cretaceous) as a thick layer mainly consisting of sandstone that covered the greater part of the shield. Later on the original sandstone plateau was dissected, a process accelerated by the uplifting of the shield, and finally it disappeared almost completely by erosion. The former surface is now only represented by the flat tops of some table-mountains one of which is found in the interior of Surinam: Tafelberg. See Schols & Cohen (1953). The surface of the northern seventh part of the country is occupied by deposits of Quaternary age. In general may be distinguished (from the south to the north) : 1) The Zanderij formation, consisting mainly of sands of continental origin; 2) the Coropina formation, comprising the “old coastal plain”; the main parts are (a) the so-called “schols”, i. e. the remnants of an old sea-clay plain, separated by filled-up tidal gullies, and (b) the remnants of the offshore bars that formerly separated the plain from the sea; 3) the Demerara formation, comprising the “young coastal plain”. See Van der Eyk (1954, 1957). Geological-pedological classification of the savannas Savannas are found on the basal complex, the Roraima, the Zanderij and the Coropina formation. Cohen & Van der Eyk (1953) classify them as follows: I Savannas of the Coropina formation 1. Watamalejo-type – on the offshore bars 2. Welgelegen-type – on the “schols” II Savannas of the Zanderij formation a. Kasipora-type – on dry bleached sand soils b. Zanderij-type – on wet bleached sand soils c. Coesewijne-type – on non-bleached soils III Savannas of the Roraima formation: Tafelberg-type IV Savannas of the basal complex 1. Paroe-type – on granitic soils 2. Bosland-type – on schist hills 3. Saban-pasi-type – on subgraywacke hills Savanna soils The climate is characterized by the sequence of a long rainy season (April-July), a long dry season (August-November), a short rainy season (December-January) and a short dry season (February-March). In connection with this periodicity the water-table in many places fluctuates strongly {{in the course of the}} year. During the dry seasons the upper layers of the savanna soils are always completely dry, except just after a shower. A soil is called very dry if even during the rainy seasons the upper layers are not influenced by the ground water. A very wet soil, however, at this period is covered by some cm of water; in addition it is characterized by many small hummocks, in Surinam called “kawfoetoes”, which are built up by worms and in which these animals are able to keep their heads above the water. Certain soils occur that in spite of deep watertables are wet, because an impermeable layer in the <b>subsoil</b> impedes <b>drainage</b> of the topsoil. Of course there is a scala between the extremes “very dry” and “very wet”. The texture of the upper layers ranges from bleached and slightly red sand to sandy and silty clay. Object of the investigation The flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas are the object of this investigation. These savannas do not only represent the types of the Zanderijand the Coropina-formation, but also the Bosland- and the Saban-pasi-type, for these two types are present on the basal complex only near its northern border. The following savannas have been studied. Welgelegen-type: the savannas of Bersaba and Vierkinderen, the Bigi-olo savanna near Hanover and the Fransina savanna near Welgelegen; Kasipora- and Zanderij-type: the white-sandy part of the Lobin savanna near Zanderij; Coesewijne-type: the loamy part of the Lobin savanna, the savanna Mimili Okili near Powaka, the Doti savanna near Wisawini and the Coesewijne savanna near Bigipoika; Saban-pasi-type: the Gros savanna and the De Jong Noord savanna. Data of some other authors pertaining to these and the other types have also been taken into account, some published (Lanjouw, 1936; Maguire c. s., 1948; Heyligers, 1963), some unpublished. The savannas present a marked diversity, among other things with regard to the structure of their vegetation. However, nearly all satisfy this definition: “A savanna (or a campo) is an area with a xeromorphic vegetation comprising an ecologically dominant ground layer consisting mainly of grasses, sometimes together with sedges, and with or without trees and/or shrubs either forming a more or less continuous layer, or in groups, or isolated. ” The species have been studied with respect to the relation with the habitat, the means of dispersal and the area of distribution, all in mutual correlation. Vegetationunits have been distinguished and classified; ecological and chorologic aspects have been taken into account. A combination of all data, obtained during this as well as former investigations by others, permits the drawing of a provisional and general picture of the flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas as far as the present aspects are concerned. The following statements all apply to N. Surinam only, unless mentioned otherwise. Flora Habitat in general. Nearly all plants occurring on the savannas are heliophilous and are able to survive repeated burning. The flora of the open vegetation types consists of about 270 species the majority of which (72 %) is restricted to the open savannas. However, there are species occurring either in other open situations too, partly as weeds (8 %), or on wet savannas and other wet places (3 %), or in savanna rivulets and in swamps (7 %), or in savanna bushes (8 %). Out of ca. 100 species of the savanna bushes only 15 % are restricted to this vegetation type. The other species occur either also in the open savanna (20 %), or along forest borders (8 %), or in savanna wood and forest (23 %) and/or even in rain forest (31 %). A group of 12 % belonging to the last category does not flower or even not grow high in the bushes. Quite apart from this division other groups may be distinguished among the species of the bushes in the following way: occurring also in secondary forest (31 %) in marsh forest (9 %), in swamps (3 %). The trees and shrubs of the savannas support only few epiphytes and (half-) parasites; these belong to 19 different species. In the field nearly all species show some (factual) range with regard to the degree of moistness and the texture of the soil. The texture itself is not necessarily the decisive factor as there is a relation between the texture and some other properties of the soil, e. g. the consistency and the mineral content. This has not been further investigated. The same holds for the species preferring slightly shaded localities. These spots have a microclimate that differs more from that of its surroundings than in light intensity only. The majority of the open-savanna species have diaspores that are not obviously adapted to any agent of dispersal (71 %). The remaining 29 % are distributed over 6 different categories. The diaspores of the species of the bushes belong partly to the non-adapted forms too (35 %), but 50 % of them are fleshy. Generally speaking, the savanna species have a wider geographic distribution than the spieces of the flora of Surinam as a whole. This is particularly true for the opensavanna species. On the basis of similar areas of distribution the species are classed under 6 geographic elements, viz. the Guianan (G), the northern South-American (N), the northern + eastern South-American (NE), the Middle- and northern + eastern South-American (MNE), the South-American (S) and the American element (A). The distribution of the species of the open-savanna vegetations and of the bushes, respectively, among the geographic elements is as follows (percentages) : G 12 : 26; N 11 : 18; NE 16 : 13; MNE 10; 3; S 9 : 18; A 42 : 22. It appears from a comparison of these figures too, that the species of the first group in general have a wider distribution. Apart from the geographic elements the Roraima element has been distinguished. It comprises all species collected on one or several of the table-mountains in the Guianan interior. The distribution of these species among the geographic elements does not differ considerably from the one of the savanna flora as a whole. It may have appeared already from the foregoing that the species of the bushes, though presenting a higher percentage of adapted diaspores, nevertheless do not have areas of distribution wider than those of the open-savanna species. The expected correlation is, however, apparent if the two groups are considered separately: the mean area of distribution of the species with adapted diaspores is wider than the one of those with non-adapted diaspores. A comparison of the ecological and the chorologic aspects brings to the fore two focal points within the savanna flora: The elements with a small distribution (G and N) are most numerously represented on wet to very wet sandy (in particular white-sandy) soils, whereas the elements with a wide distribution (MNE, S and A) are concentrated on dry and moist non-bleached sands and loams and on very wet soils and present a preference-top on dry and moist loamy sand. The Roraima species are by far the most numerous on the wet white sand, in general they are more numerous on wet than on dry soils. Vegetation Vegetation-units have been distinguished and classified according to the BraunBlanquel school. It has been attempted to make the groups of so-called characteristic and differential species correspond with ecological groups in the sense of Duvigneaud (1946, 1949). The latter consist of species with clear, sociological affinities between them because of similar habitat requirements. The open-savanna (and orchard-savanna)|$|R
