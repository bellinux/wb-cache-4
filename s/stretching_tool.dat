50|$|There are two {{categories}} of songket weaving equipments; the main weaving equipment made from wooden or bamboo frame; and the supporting equipment which includes thread <b>stretching</b> <b>tool,</b> motif making tool, thread inserting and picking tools. The materials for making songket consist of cotton or silk threads or other fibers as the base fabric and decoration threads made from golden, silver or silk threads. It is believed that in ancient times, real gold threads were used to create songket; the cotton threads were run along heated liquid gold, coating the cotton and creating gold thread. However today because the scarcity and the expensiveness of real gold threads, imitation gold or silver threads are commonly used instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} is stretching/drying. This is time sensitive, {{and has to be}} done from start to finish without stopping. The drying hide is {{continuously}} pulled and stretched in all directions, which lubricates the fibers of the hide with the oil of the dressing, and ensures that the fibers stay lubricated. This may be done on a rack with a <b>stretching</b> <b>tool,</b> or by hand. Often the hide is stretched against a steel cable or a rounded steel or wooden blade (with care not to cut the hide). This must be done until the hide is completely dry and no longer cool to the touch or else the finished buckskin will be stiff, and will have to be dressed and stretched over again.|$|E

Stretching different parts of a shape is also a useful operation for generating shape variations. Under stretching, texture-like geometric details should not be preserved but rather replicated. We propose a simple method that help create model variation by applying non-uniform stretching on 3 D models. The method replicates the geometric details and synthesizes extensions by adopting texture synthesis techniques on surface details. We work on analyzing and separating the stretching of surface details from the stretching of the base mesh enabling the appearance of preserved details. The efficiency of our method {{is a result of}} defining a local parametrization with the help of curve skeletons.

40|$|The {{stretch forming}} process {{is used to}} make {{structural}} sheet metal parts in the aerospace industry. The development of <b>stretch</b> forming <b>tools</b> has long been plagued by significant challenges. First, the low production volumes within the aerospace industry and {{the large numbers of}} stretch formed parts make the process capital intensive. Second, the development of <b>stretch</b> forming <b>tooling</b> has long been more of an art than a science. This results in poorly designed tools, poor quality parts, and lengthy tooling development cycles. A <b>stretch</b> forming <b>tool</b> capable of rapid reconfiguration was previously designed to address these issues. This tool is used in conjunction with a self-tuning shape control algorithm, which guides the die to the correct shape. There have been many simulations, and lab scale successes with these algorithms, but production scale implementations have experienced difficulties. These problems are related to the method of system identification and process variation. To better understand these issues, analysis and simulation are performed on the various forms of the algorithm. These investigations le...|$|R

The influence of rotation in data modeling affects the result of resistivity values in both of the 1 -D and 2 -D models, difference its because the rotation direction can affect the impedance values and then affect the resistivity value and then skindepth.

40|$|Abstract Mesh {{deformation}} {{has become}} {{a powerful tool for}} creating shape variations. Existing deformation techniques work on preserving surface details under bending and twisting operations. Stretching different parts of a shape is also a useful operation for generating shape variations. However, under stretching, texture-like geometric details should not be preserved but rather replicated. We propose a simple and efficient method that helps create model variations by applying non-uniform stretching on 3 D models with organic geometric details. The method replicates the geometric details and synthesizes extensions by adopting texture synthesis techniques on surface details. We work on analyzing and separating the stretching of surface details from the stretching of the base mesh resulting in the appearance of preserved details. The efficiency of our method is attributed to a local parametrization of the surface with the help of curve skeletons. We show a variety of experimental results that demonstrate the usefulness of this intuitive <b>stretching</b> <b>tool</b> in creating shape variations.

40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{influence}} of the algorithmic theories of generation and control of triangular, quadrilateral, hexahedral and tetrahedral meshing, i. e. which are the most common types of meshes used in the software of finite elements for large plastic deformation. The importance of these methods is due to the fact that they are the spine of Finite Element Methods (FEM). Design/methodology/approach: It was numerically evaluated the parameters influencing mapped (structured) and free meshing on sheet forming simulation (stretching). For the tests a <b>stretching</b> <b>tool</b> with geometry proposed by Nakazima was used. The study presents the results in terms of the major true strains (ε 1, ε 2, ε 3) and a comparison with experimental data was carried out (validation). Findings: The analysis showed that Shell-type elements are dependent of the element format choice and the way of application in the geometry. Objects built with Shell type elements, i. e. components that will suffer large plastic deformation are extremely sensitive to the mesh format, refinement and way that it was applied. A relationship was also shown among equivalent meshes for elements in the format Tri and Quad. Research limitations/implications: To describe the complete influence of the type of meshing are beyond the scope of this study as it was used only one commercial software and one method of forming. Practical implications: The correct choice of the meshing parameters can provide more accurate results during the simulations of sheet stretching process. Originality/value: The paper shows the differences and implications of the correct choice of meshing during finite element analysis...|$|E

50|$|Distributed {{cognition}} sits at {{the intersection}} of psychology, sociology, and cognitive science. It is essentially the theory that knowledge and the thinking with that knowledge are <b>stretched</b> across the <b>tools,</b> situation, other people, and context. It originated with the work of anthropologist Edwin Hutchins in the 1990s with his studies of navigation on a naval aircraft carrier. His work on understanding naturally situated cognition led to the conclusion that cognition is socially distributed. Rather than looking for knowledge structures within an individual, his work showed that cognitive activity, or knowing what to do, was a situated process, influenced by other people, tools, and the situation.|$|R
50|$|The Neolithic period (stretching from 5000 BC to 2000 BC.) saw {{the arrival}} of an {{agriculture}} based on slash-and-burn: land is reclaimed from the forest after having fired and is then used for breeding before sprinkling grass. This evolution {{was made possible by}} the development of methods of extracting stones and their shaping. In a quarry in Plussulien, about 5000 dolerite axes were extracted per year, representing 40% of the axes of the Breton peninsula. The dissemination of these <b>tools</b> <b>stretched</b> to Paris basin, and 10 copies of these axes were found to Belgium and southern England. The region also imported yellow blond flint blades from Touraine.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{ecosystem}} {{is rapidly}} and constantly expanding. In numerous sectors, the Internet has {{acted as a}} 'black hole', attracting the majority of transactions and leaving less and less space to the offline businesses. Among others, the Internet has dematerialized physical assets and services, lowered down of the production and distribution costs, strongly contributed to the diffusion of the 'free' goods and services, multiplied the multi-sided markets and caused a shift from supply-driven systems toward demand-drive ones. All these features have impacted the traditional ways of performing economic activities. In order {{to cope with the}} disruptive effect of the Internet, firms have transferred their business online, adapted and evolved their business models or created completely new ones. Often, the outcome of such transformations creates frictions with the traditional regulatory environment where the businesses take place, and decision-makers and enforcers must deal with unprecedented challenges. In order to efficiently regulate the online markets, decision makers and regulators might need to undergo the same process that firms were called to perform: transfer and adapt the rules to the online world. While accomplishing this change, it might also be that, in some cases, it will be more efficient to set completely new rules instead of trying to <b>stretch</b> the old <b>tools</b> to newly created online businesses...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{connection}} to the Internet has becoming a fundamental issue {{to the development of}} the society more and more improvements and new access technologies have appeared. Guifi. net proposes a free, neutral and open community wireless network with the principal aim to arrive to users that doesn't have many other options. The optimization of the resources of the network becomes more important for this kind of connections. This study pretends to analyze and learn the behavior of the principal Internet access figure of this network, the proxies. This network element allows to the final user that is properly registered to access Internet with an authentication. Proxies in Guifi. net are administrated by organizations and public institutions and they are commonly federated what means that all the users registered in a proxy can access to another federated proxy with the same authentication. So, final users have several options to connect. To proceed with the performance analysis of these network elements two differentiated stretches have been defined, the step between the final client and the proxy and the step between the proxy and the web server where the content is. To analyze the first <b>stretch,</b> ping <b>tool</b> has been used while to analyze the second step wget tool has been selected. Ping is based in the IP layer meanwhile wget works in the TCP layer so some readjustment have to be done to compare the results obtained. In this sense, a calibration of the ping method with a TCP based tool as iperf has been applied, doing the test to some iperf servers available in the network. The required figures to evaluate the performance are latency, throughput, packet loss, intermediate nodes between client and proxy and distance. Tests reveal that not all the federated proxies are available to a single user due to the singular topology of the network. Also reveal that there is a direct connection between the number of intermediate nodes and the latency, throughput and packet loss performance, meanwhile distance doesn't follows any relation. So, it is possible to conclude that for these tests the proper criterion for the proxy election is the number of intermediate nodes instead the distance which is the commonly used...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{cells can}} be {{classified}} as “active soft matter,” with mechanical characteristics modulated by external cues such as pharmaceutical dosage or fever temperature. Quantifying the effects of chemical and physical stimuli on a cell’s mechanical response informs models of living cells as complex materials. We discuss the mechanical behavior of single cells in terms of fluidity, or hysteresivity normalized to the extremes of an elastic solid or a viscous liquid. This parameter, which complements stiffness when describing whole-cell viscoelastic response, can be determined for a suspended cell within subsecond times. Questions remain, however, {{about the origin of}} fluidity as a conserved parameter across timescales, the physical interpretation of its magnitude, and its potential use for high-throughput sorting and separation of interesting cells by mechanical means. We have selected optical <b>stretching,</b> a noncontact <b>tool</b> that deforms cells in the suspended state via photonic pressure, to explore the linear power-law-rheology regime (1 % strain, 1 s timescale) of single cells. Cells were probed for several seconds each by applying an oscillatory photonic stress, and machine vision was used to extract time-dependent elongation and phase lag from phase-contrast images. Our experiments employing various chemoenvironmental conditions – temperature, pharmacological agents, pH, and osmolarity – extend familiarity with suspended-cell mechanics in the context of both soft-matter physics and mechanical flow cytometry development. The strong influence of both osmotic volume changes and the cytoskeleton-disassembling drug latrunculin supports the interpretation of fluidity as a reciprocal friction within the actin cytoskeleton, with implications both for cytoskeletal models and for expectations when separating interesting subpopulations by mechanical means in the suspended state...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} mechanisms of strategy switching in the stabilization of unstable dynamics, this work investigates how human subjects learn to become skilled users of an underactuated bimanual tool in an unstable environment. The tool, which consists of a mass and two hand-held non-linear springs, is affected by a saddle-like force-field. The non-linearity of the springs allows the users to determine size and orientation of the tool stiffness ellipse, by using different patterns of bimanual coordination: minimal stiffness occurs when the two spring terminals are aligned and stiffness size grows by <b>stretching</b> them apart. <b>Tool</b> parameters were set such that minimal stiffness is insufficient to provide stable equilibrium whereas asymptotic stability can be achieved with sufficient stretching, although {{at the expense of}} greater effort. As a consequence, tool users have two possible strategies for stabilizing the mass in different regions of the workspace: 1) high stiffness feedforward strategy, aiming at asymptotic stability and 2) low stiffness positional feedback strategy aiming at bounded stability. The tool was simulated by a bimanual haptic robot with direct torque control of the motors. In a previous study we analyzed the behavior of naı̈ve users and we found that they spontaneously clustered into two groups of approximately equal size. In this study we trained subjects to become expert users of both strategies in a discrete reaching task. Then we tested generalization capabilities and mechanism of strategy-switching by means of stabilization tasks which consist of tracking moving targets in the workspace. The uniqueness of the experimental setup is that it addresses th...|$|R
