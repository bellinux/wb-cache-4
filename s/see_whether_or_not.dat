5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E

Metzger was questioned twice, and denied any wrongdoing, but suspended himself from the Rabbinical High Court in June 2005, while waiting to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the Israeli Attorney General, Menachem Mazuz, decided to indict him.

25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept {{of social and cultural}} exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it was Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18–22.|$|E

[...] According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at Sylvan Lake that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> she had been able to.

500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And this is where I have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> there's a God." ...|$|E

500|$|The Posen speeches made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are {{the first}} known {{documents}} in which a high-ranking member of the Nazi government spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war. Himmler mentions the [...] "Judenevakuierung" [...] or [...] "evacuation of the Jews", which he uses synonymously with their extermination. At {{one point in the}} speech, Himmler says: [...] "elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it", briefly pausing in the middle of [...] "elimination" [...] (Ausschaltung) before going on to say [...] "extermination" [...] (Ausrottung). His hesitation in the middle of saying [...] "elimination" [...] can be considered as a quick mental check to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it is acceptable to use such words in front of his given audience. The answer is yes: it is the seniority of the SS in private. This has been compared to another incident of self-verification in the opposite way, where Josef Goebbels, in his Total War speech on February 18, 1943, begins to say [...] "Ausrottung des Judentums" [...] ("extermination of Jewry") but switches to saying [...] "Ausschaltung", bearing in mind that he is speaking very publicly.

50|$|TNP {{is excited}} at a {{wavelength}} of 408 and 470 nm, and fluoresces in the 530-560 nm range. This {{is a very}} useful range of excitation because {{it is far from}} where proteins or nucleotides absorb. When TNP-ATP is in water or other aqueous solutions, this emission is very weak. However, once TNP-ATP binds to a protein, there is a dramatic increase in fluorescent intensity. This property enables researchers to study various proteins’ binding interaction with ATP. Thus, with enhanced fluorescence, it can be <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a protein binds to ATP.|$|R

It was only after Sheaffer left the site, having seen nothing unusual, that Beckjord reported manifestations of Bigfoot.|$|E
