40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set {{collected}} from financial statements of all Singapore listed firms from 1983 to 1991, we provide international {{evidence on the}} determinants {{of the amount of}} <b>secured</b> <b>loans</b> as a fraction of total <b>secured</b> and unsecured <b>loans.</b> This data set comprises a much wider range of firms than most previous studies. We show that consistent with the agency-cost hypothesis, firms with more growth opportunities use more <b>secured</b> <b>loans.</b> This is in contrast to the opposite result reported in Barclay and Smith (1995 b) who measure secured debt as a fraction of total long-term fixed claims. We also find strong support for the hypothesis that smaller firms use more <b>secured</b> <b>loans.</b> In contrast, Leeth and Scott (1989), using survey data on small firms, find an insignificant firm size effect. Finally, we show that the use of <b>secured</b> <b>loans</b> is positively related to asset riskiness and loan size, and is negatively related to asset specificity.

2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a <b>secured</b> <b>loan</b> of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of <b>secured</b> {{syndicated}} <b>loans</b> and data from two field studies, I explore whether the collateralization of intangibles was associated with risky lending in the syndicated loan market. While the predominant managerial and scholarly perspective suggests that intangible assets are not eligible collateral, I find that twenty-one percent of U. S. -originated <b>secured</b> <b>loans</b> include intangible assets as loan collateral, and the collateralization of intangibles has significantly increased in the recent decade. I hypothesize and find that intangible redeployability and borrower reputation are positively related to the probability of using intangibles as loan collateral. I further hypothesize and find that collateralizing loans by intangibles significantly increases loan pricing and the supply of credit to firms. Moreover, <b>loans</b> <b>secured</b> by intangibles perform no worse to other <b>secured</b> <b>loans.</b> Overall, {{the results suggest that}} the collateralization of intangible assets is an economically sustainable credit market innovation that alleviates financing frictions...|$|R
