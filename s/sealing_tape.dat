5000|$|Familiarity {{with the}} Teflon brand of {{fluoropolymers}} {{has led to}} the practice of erroneously referring to PTFE-based thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> as [...] "Teflon tape". Chemours, owners of the Teflon trademark, no longer manufactures any thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape,</b> and the company has launched a campaign against the practice.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} material {{also used}} to make threaded joints watertight is thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
25|$|PTFE {{is widely}} used as a thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> in {{plumbing}} applications, largely replacing paste thread dope.|$|R
5000|$|Box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> pressure-sensitive-taps are {{available}} in various widths i.e. 36, 48, and 72 mm widths and several thicknesses. BOPP and PET are used as a backings. Taping is done either manually or by semi automatic machine.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Revolite (then a {{division}} of Johnson & Johnson) developed an adhesive tape made from a rubber-based adhesive applied to a durable duck cloth backing. This tape resisted water and was used as <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> on some ammunition cases during that period.|$|E
5000|$|A {{case sealer}} or box sealer {{is a piece}} of {{equipment}} used for closing or sealing corrugated boxes. It is most commonly used for regular slotted containers (RSC) and can involve adhesive (cold water-borne or hot melt adhesive), box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> or [...] Gummed (water activated) tape.|$|E

50|$|Threaded pipe joints {{are sealed}} with thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> or pipe dope. Many {{plumbing}} fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with plumber's putty.|$|R
5000|$|Box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> (also [...] "Packing Tape"; [...] "Parcel tape", UK) {{is a type}} of {{packaging}} tape which is clear or opaque, and used for closing packages for shipment. It is usually two inch (48 mm) or three inch (72 mm) wide and is made of a polypropylene or polyester backing.|$|E
50|$|ASTM International has {{dozens of}} {{standards}} related to pressure-sensitive tape. Some {{of them are}} for general types of PSA tape: Others are for specific types. For example, ASTM D1000 has test methods for electrical tapes. There are ASTM specifications for many tapes including: D2301 for vinyl electrical tape, D5486 for box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> etc. Several of the ASTM test methods are coordinated with PSTC, other trade associations, and other international organizations.|$|E
5000|$|With semi {{automated}} equipment, {{the operator}} typically fills and loads a {{box at the}} entrance to the case sealer; the box may or may not have the bottom flaps previously closed. The operator closes the top flaps and feeds the box in or through a machine which automatically applies the closure. This helps save time and controls the application of the closure materials such as box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "plumber's tape" [...] {{has been}} applied to thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> in recent years. In the {{plumbing}} trade, plumber's tape is the name given to a strap of material with holes in it used for supporting pipes and fixtures.|$|R
50|$|Effects on {{recyclability}} {{are particularly}} important when tape is applied to paper surfaces, such as corrugated fiberboard and other packaging. When taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film-backed box <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|R
5000|$|In a bind, master {{plumbers}} {{have been}} known to replicate the sealing action of a ferrule by using an artfully [...] "woven" [...] piece of thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape.</b> This is attempted as a temporary solution to prevent a leak until a proper ferrule can be procured.|$|R
50|$|Thread {{seal tape}} used in {{plumbing}} applications is most commonly white, {{but it is}} also available in various colors. It is often used to correspond to color coded pipelines (US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand: yellow for natural gas, green for oxygen, etc.). These color-codes for thread <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> were introduced by Bill Bentley of Unasco Pty Ltd in the 1970s. In the UK, tape is used from coloured reels, e.g. yellow reels for gas, green for potable water.|$|E
5000|$|Labour Cost: During {{installation}} MI cable {{must not}} be bent repeatedly as this will cause work hardening and cracks in the cladding and cores. A minimum bend radius must be observed and the cable must be supported at regular intervals. The magnesium oxide insulation is hygroscopic so MICC cable must be protected from moisture until it has been terminated. Termination requires stripping back the copper cladding and attaching a compression gland fitting. Individual conductors are insulated with plastic sleeves. A <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> insulating putty or an epoxy resin is then poured into the compression gland fitting to provide a watertight seal. If a termination is faulty due to workmanship or damage then the magnesium oxide will absorb moisture and lose its insulating properties. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between 1 and 2 hours of labour (an electrician {{should be able to}} make a termination in 10 to 15 minutes on up to 4 core smaller sizes). Installation of a three-conductor MI cable (size No. 10 AWG — about 5 square mm) takes about 65% more time than installation of a PVC-sheathed armoured cable of the same conductor size. Installation of MICC is therefore a costly task. Certain PTFE, silicone or other polymer-insulated cables have been substituted in applications which require similar properties in terms of flame spread, which use less labour to terminate. MICC is still used in applications which are particularly suited to its combination of properties.|$|E
30|$|Real-time PCR {{apparatus}} (CFX 96, Bio-Rad), {{associated with}} CFX Manager Software (version 1.6, Bio-Rad), {{was used for}} the real-time PCR. Each reaction was done in duplicate in a volume of 20 µL with 96 -well optical-grade PCR plates, sealed with optical <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> (Bio-Rad). Amplification reactions were done with SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and following temperature profiles: one cycle at 95 °C (3  min), 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C (30  s), annealing at 60 °C (30  s), extension at 72 °C (30  s) and one final cycle at 95 °C (30  s). Melt curve analyses were performed by slowly heating the PCR mixtures from 65 °C to 95 °C (1 °C per cycle of 10  s) with simultaneous measurements of the SYBR Green I signal intensities. Relative expressions were calculated by the formula  2 −∆∆Ct.|$|E
5000|$|Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> (also {{known as}} PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in <b>tape</b> form. Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R
5000|$|If a tape {{remains on}} {{corrugated}} box during recycling, a tape should be chosen {{which does not}} hinder box recyclability. [...] For example, when taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film backed box <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|R
5000|$|The Tylenol Crisis of 1982 {{involved}} over-the-counter medications. Due to FDA regulations, many {{manufacturers of}} food and medicine (as well as other products) now use induction sealing and other special means to help provide evidence of tampering. Break-away components which cannot be reattached are useful. Custom <b>seals,</b> <b>tapes,</b> labels, RFID tags, etc. are sometimes added.|$|R
30|$|This lack of {{evidence}} {{might be due to}} variations in application protocols, differences in bone conditions at the site of implantation, and variations in individual PRP quality. In this study, we examined platelet adhesion under the most popular protocol for PRP application—coating by simple immersion. This procedure is superior in terms of complete exclusion of air bubbles generated on the implant surface by visual inspection. To our knowledge, no studies have exclusively performed direct application of PRP in any form [40] or platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in implant holes to improve the initial stability of implants. When implant hole conditions are not favorable for mechanically tight contact between bone and implant surface, a clotted PRP or PRF membrane might function like a <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> to temporally and mechanically stabilize the implants. However, it is not yet accepted that the functionalization of implants using PRP, like the PRP immersion procedure, contributes to stabilization of placed implants in the medium term.|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{the overall}} {{building}} envelope airtightness concerning energetic aspects, the condensation caused by air exfiltration is still a challenge today. For {{a better understanding of}} the processes inside lightweight constructions, hot-and cold-box experiments and airflow measurements on 14 different full-scale wall assemblies under realistic climatic conditions were performed. The influences of different mineral wool airflow permeabilities and leak configurations, as well as different pressure differences were analyzed. Despite a certain level of uncertainty, the results show some interesting aspects about the influencing factors of the convective moisture entry. The distributions of the water content between sheathing and insulation samples show that more water remains inside the mineral wool with low air permeability, while in case of the more air permeable mineral wool, more water accumulates in the sheathing. Moreover, the findings indicate that the moisture distribution over the height of the sheathing is more influenced by the pressure difference level than by insulation air permeability or arrangements of the small openings. For the tested configurations, a lateral flow due to openings near the studs shows the highest total moisture contents inside the assemblies. In contrast, we could not observe significant differences concerning the moisture content for the different leak arrangements and diameters with the same total leakage area under humidification test conditions, although differences in the flow behavior are clearly detected. However, another important finding of these experiments is that, despite good workmanship, a small amount of air and moisture seams to penetrate the <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> joints...|$|E
40|$|Land {{certificates}} {{issued by}} {{agencies of the}} National Land Agency, or BPN have signs or traits that have so hard to forge its own identity in any official document issued by BPN.

5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape.</b> The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this work deals with the {{characterization}} of 12 commercially available <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> for microtiter plates with regard to their oxygen and water vapor permeability. Special attention was given to the influence of the evaporation on the liquid temperature in the well. The results of the experimental analysis showed that three of the investigated <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not permit oxygen transport and are therefore unsuitable for aerobic cultivation. With respect to water vapor permeability, the remaining <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> exhibit vast differences. On average, the water loss was 40 % of the initial volume after 24 hours at 37 °C and 45 % humidity. This immense liquid loss led to differences of up to 3. 8 °C from to the desired temperature due to evaporative cooling. Accordingly, none of the 12 <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> met the requirements of the user. To address this optimization potential, a mathematical model was developed. With the help of the model, it was shown that, contrary to oxygen supply, the evaporation rate is linearly dependent {{on the size of the}} diffusion area. A reduction of the diffusion area can therefore reduce evaporation without affecting oxygen transport. The second part focused on the development of a measurement technique for the quantitative, non-invasive detection of viscosity in shake flasks. The measurement technique is based on detecting the position of the rotating bulk liquid as it changes with respect to the direction of centrifugal acceleration dependent on the viscosity. It is possible to correlate this offset in the liquid motion with the viscosity. For non-invasive detection of the liquid position, a fluorescence as well as a transmission measurement were developed. To convert the information about the liquid’s position in the shake flask into a viscosity signal, a calibration was established using model fluids of known viscosity. The developed 8 -flask-device was validated by the cultivation of the bacteria Paenibacillus polymyxa and Xanthomonas campestris. The comparison of the online measurement technique with a conventional measurement on a rheometer showed that the viscosity can be measured with an accuracy of 3. 11 mPa·s ± 0. 6 mPa·s up to 120 mPa·s...|$|R
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench.|$|R
50|$|Petroleum-based {{pipe dope}} is not {{intended}} for use on threaded PVC, CPVC or ABS pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic.
