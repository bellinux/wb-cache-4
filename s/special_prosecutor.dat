5|$|A {{total of}} 60 cases {{were ordered to}} be reviewed. A <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor</b> was hired because Cook County State's Attorney, Richard Devine, had a {{conflict}} of interest stemming from his tenure at the law firm of Phelan, Pope & John, which had defended Burge in two federal suits.

5|$|The Office of the <b>Special</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a bill in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of the}} banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E
5|$|Breyer {{served as}} a law clerk to Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg during the 1964 term (list), and served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission. He was a special {{assistant}} to the United States Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust from 1965 to 1967 and an assistant <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor</b> on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 1974 to 1975 and served as chief counsel of the committee from 1979 to 1980. He worked closely with the chairman of the committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to pass the Airline Deregulation Act that closed the Civil Aeronautics Board.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue. Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take a new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor</b> in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
50|$|While {{the most}} {{prominent}} <b>special</b> <b>prosecutors</b> have been those appointed since the 1870s to investigate presidents and those connected to them, the term {{can also be used}} to refer to any prosecutor appointed to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance thereof. For example, because district attorneys' offices work closely with police, some activists argue that cases of police misconduct at the state and local level should be handled by <b>special</b> <b>prosecutors.</b>|$|R

5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor</b> under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Eve, Edgeworth {{is arrested}} {{for the murder}} of {{attorney}} Robert Hammond. He initially refuses Phoenix's help, but ultimately relents. Manfred Von Karma, Edgeworth's mentor, has himself appointed as a <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> After Phoenix learns that another man, Yanni Yogi, shot Hammond, he discovers that Von Karma provided him with the gun. Years earlier, Edgeworth's father, Gregory, convinced a judge to penalize Von Karma for misconduct, ruining his spotless record. Unable to deal with such a blemish on his legacy, Von Karma murdered Gregory in cold blood, leaving Edgeworth to believe himself responsible. Phoenix explains that Edgeworth motivated him to become an attorney: When a young Phoenix was accused of stealing money (a crime for which Larry was the true culprit), Edgeworth persuaded his teacher not to punish him. Following his father's murder, however, Edgeworth, motivated by a hatred of criminals, decided to become Von Karma's pupil instead. After Von Karma suffers a breakdown in court and confesses to the cover-up, Edgeworth is set free. Nevertheless, he decides to rethink whether or not he should resume his previous duties. Meanwhile, Maya, who had been acting as Phoenix's assistant, announces that she will be returning to her home village to finish her training as a spirit medium.|$|E

50|$|The Puerto Rico Office of the <b>Special</b> Independent <b>Prosecutor's</b> Panel (Oficina del Panel sobre el Fiscal Especial Independiente) is an {{autonomous}} {{agency of the}} executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico that appoints <b>Special</b> Independent <b>Prosecutors</b> Fiscal Especial Independiente (FEI) to investigate and prosecute government officials who engage in criminal conduct. FEIs are equivalent to <b>special</b> <b>prosecutors</b> while the agency is synonymous to the United States Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel but at the state government level rather than federal.|$|R
50|$|Roughly twenty <b>special</b> <b>prosecutors</b> (called {{independent}} counsels after 1983) {{were appointed}} under the Ethics in Government Act and its reauthorizations during the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations. These include significant {{investigations into the}} Iran-Contra affair and the Whitewater controversy, the latter of which ultimately led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal. Numerous smaller investigations into cabinet secretaries for relatively minor offenses, such as drug use, were also carried out by <b>special</b> <b>prosecutors</b> during this period.|$|R

25|$|On October 20, 1973, after Cox {{refused to}} drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> Richardson {{resigned}} in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon’s search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the Solicitor General Robert Bork. Though Bork said he believed Nixon’s order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being “perceived {{as a man who}} did the President’s bidding to save my job.” Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the <b>special</b> <b>prosecutor.</b>|$|E
50|$|In early 2008, <b>special</b> <b>prosecutors</b> {{assigned}} to the case agreed that critical information was not {{turned over to the}} original defense team. On January 18, 2008, defense attorneys released evidence that further suggested Masters' innocence. Defense attorneys had touch DNA testing done in the Netherlands on evidence found at the scene, but tested samples did not include Masters' DNA. Rather, the DNA results pointed to Hettrick's sometime boyfriend. <b>Special</b> <b>prosecutors</b> {{assigned to}} the appeal recommended overturning Masters' sentence {{as a result of the}} DNA findings. The DNA results were confirmed by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.|$|R
2500|$|Yielding to American pressure, on 25 September 1945, the Congress enacted C.A. No. 682 {{creating}} the People's Court and the Office of <b>Special</b> <b>Prosecutors</b> {{to deal with}} the pending cases of [...] "collaboration".|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, the Special Counsel {{report on}} the case was released.

[...] Special Counsel Report [...] The fairness, quality and accuracy of the <b>Special</b> <b>Prosecutor's</b> Report has been called into question, however, including the <b>Special</b> <b>Prosecutor's</b> opinion that the exculpatory material allegedly withheld would have made {{much of a difference}} in the outcome of the trial, and whether the material was deliberately concealed.|$|R
