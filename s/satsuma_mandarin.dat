Moreover, when applied together, sucrose sup-plementation counteracted the effect of partial defoliation on fruit set. When sucrose was supplied continuously from flow-ering until harvest, it increased the concentrations of soluble and insoluble sugars in fruits.

40|$|Background and Aims: Cohort {{studies in}} Japan {{indicate}} that citrus fruit and β-cryptoxanthin–rich <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> are candidate foods for lowering cardiovascular risk; however, {{there have been}} few intervention studies of β-cryptoxanthin and <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> supplementation. Methods and Results: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial was performed. Apparently healthy men and women were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving concentrated β-cryptoxanthin–rich <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> juice (β-cryptoxanthin 4  mg per 125  mL/day: active group) and one receiving β-cryptoxanthin–deprived <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> juice (β-cryptoxanthin 0  mg per 125  mL/day: control group) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), which assesses arterial stiffness. An oxidative stress biomarker and clinical outcomes were also evaluated. Effect of the intervention on the outcome variables was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. After the trial, a prespecified 8 -month follow-up examination was conducted. One hundred eighteen subjects were randomly assigned, and 117 completed the intervention. Serum β-cryptoxanthin concentration was increased among the active group after β-cryptoxanthin–rich <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> juice supplementation. Both supplementations lowered baPWV and oxidative stress biomarker levels; however, there was no additional effect in the active group compared with the control group. At the 8 -month examination, the increase in baPWV among the active group was smaller than that among the control group. Conclusion: <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> juice supplementation is potentially beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk; however, additional β-cryptoxanthin supplementation did not enhance this effect.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between carotenoid accumulation and {{the expression of}} carotenoid biosynthetic genes during fruit maturation was investigated in three citrus varieties, <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> (Citrus unshiu Marc.), Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), and Lisbon lemon (Citrus limon Burm. f.). We cloned the cDNAs for phytoene synthase (CitPSY), phytoene desaturase (CitPDS), ζ-carotene (car) desaturase (CitZDS), carotenoid isomerase (CitCRTISO), lycopene β-cyclase (CitLCYb), β-ring hydroxylase (CitHYb), zeaxanthin (zea) epoxidase (CitZEP), and lycopene ε-cyclase (CitLCYe) from <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin,</b> which shared high identities in nucleotide sequences with Valencia orange, Lisbon lemon, and other plant species. With the transition of peel color from green to orange, the change from β,ε-carotenoid (α-car and lutein) accumulation to β,β-carotenoid (β-car, β-cryptoxanthin, zea, and violaxanthin) accumulation was observed in the flavedos of <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> and Valencia orange, accompanying the disappearance of CitLCYe transcripts {{and the increase in}} CitLCYb transcripts. Even in green fruit, high levels of β,ε-carotenoids and CitLCYe transcripts were not observed in the juice sacs. As fruit maturation progressed in <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> and Valencia orange, a simultaneous increase in the expression of genes (CitPSY, CitPDS, CitZDS, CitLCYb, CitHYb, and CitZEP) led to massive β,β-xanthophyll (β-cryptoxanthin, zea, and violaxanthin) accumulation in both the flavedo and juice sacs. The gene expression of CitCRTISO was kept low or decreased in the flavedo during massive β,β-xanthophyll accumulation. In the flavedo of Lisbon lemon and <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin,</b> massive accumulation of phytoene was observed with a decrease in the transcript level for CitPDS. Thus, the carotenoid accumulation during citrus fruit maturation was highly regulated by the coordination of the expression among carotenoid biosynthetic genes. In this paper, the mechanism leading to diversity in β,β-xanthophyll compositions between <b>Satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> and Valencia orange was also discussed {{on the basis of the}} substrate specificity of β-ring hydroxylase and the balance of expression between upstream synthesis genes (CitPSY, CitPDS, CitZDS, and CitLCYb) and downstream synthesis genes (CitHYb and CitZEP) ...|$|E

Chlorinated water reduced the microbial counts to levels below the lower limit of detection (1. 4 log CFU/ml for bacteria and 2. 0 log CFU/ml for fungi) in most agricultural water samples. Microbial counts of pesticide solution, which contained the agricultural water or chlorinated water for the mixture, were lower in sanitary field than in control field in both fruit orchards. The number of bacterial and mold species detected in agricultural water, chlorinated water, and pesticide solution were almost proportional to microbial counts in each sample throughout the year. The chlorination treatment of agricultural water tended to reduce the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit during production season. The ethyl alcohol spray treatment on packing shed equipment resulted in a substantial microbial reduction on plastic harvest basket and container in persimmon orchard and plastic harvest basket and container, gloves, scissors, and size sorter in <b>satsuma</b> <b>mandarin</b> orchard.
