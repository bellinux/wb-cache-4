The paper aims {{to take a}} step back in time and examine how Aristotle perceives happiness and how his definition is expressed through his work - Nicomachean Ethics. By thorough reading and analysis of Nicomachean Ethics, we aim to set up a sharper definition of what happiness is and how it is achieved, according to Aristotle. Furthermore, the project draws on utilitarianism as a point of comparison and looks into this philosophical theory’s thoughts on happiness. Through several relevant discussions, the project seeks to understand the similarities or differences between Aristotle’s philosophy and that of utilitarianism. Furthermore, how Aristotle’s or the utilitarian philosophy might look if directly applied onto a modern society and whether that would even be possible. This project finally, within the conclusion, summarizes Aristotle’s definition and concludes that the theories of utilitarianism and Aristotle are incomparable beyond <b>superficial</b> <b>measure</b> and that, in theory, both of the theories could be applied directly onto a society but neither without raising either ethical or social issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{membrane}} Nafion ® {{is commonly}} used as a polymer electrolyte fuel cell technology, particulary for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC). Ionic conductivity, mechanical and chemical resistances are the main characteristics for obtaining a good efficiency in the PEMFC and DMFC performance. The conductivity in the membrane Nafion ® in combination with their morphological characteristics allows the development of different phenomena as kinetics and transports (mass, electrons and freight) during operation of the PEMFC. The phenomena mentioned are performed in the interface electrode-electrolyte, where is located a triple contact area; electrode-catalyst-electrolyte. The present study {{is focused on the}} probably Nafion membrane effect when electrons are traversing the membrane to the active sites on the electrodes, this effect may be the principal cause of increases in the ohmic losses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the short and {{long-term}} effects of the establishment of a number of new industries in two “growth areas”. These to “growth areas” are Stephenville and Come-by-Chance. [...] In this study the techniques of input-output analysis are used. This method allows us to trace the probable impact of any new industry upon the entire economy through the interindustry transactions of the input-output table. Input-output analysis is more suitable than any other method for this type of study, since the analysis is detailed enough to show effects at the level of the individual industry. In this way, the dangers of more aggregate methods to overstate the degree of substitution possible between inputs and outputs of different industries is avoided. Also it is possible to analyze developments within each sector of the economy rather than having to consider only the effect upon the whole economy. [...] In Chapter I the methodology of the study is explained. A short survey of the development of input-output techniques for the type of problem examined in this paper is given. These techniques are criticized and modified to suit the {{purpose of this}} paper. [...] In Chapter II we identify the new manufacturing establishments entering the two “growth areas” during the period 1968 - 1972. The inputs and outputs of each of these establishments is identified and they are quantified in both physical and value terms. Physical quantification is necessary because in most cases the only source of information is engineering data. Conversion to value terms is necessary because the input-output tables are constructed in value terms. These inputs and outputs are related through an activity matrix in which production activities as well as import and export activities are shown. The intersectoral and interregional origins of inputs and the destination of outputs are established. [...] In Chapter III we compute (through the input-output table) the direct, indirect and induced (through household income) expansions in output, employment and income generated by each of the new establishments in the two regions. [...] Effects upon imports are examined in Chapter IV. [...] Changes in the long-run structure of the economy are examined in Chapter V. [...] In Chapter VI it is shown that although there has been a <b>superficial</b> <b>measure</b> of success in diversifying the structure of the Newfoundland economy, the province has not been provided with a basis for continued economic growth or development...|$|E
40|$|Shoulder {{pathology}} in {{the overhead}} sport athlete {{has become a}} major area of orthopedic research. Two research areas are the relationship of lateral scapula displacement (LSD) to shoulder pain, and general factors related to shoulder pain. LSD has been associated with painful shoulders, but little effort has connected LSD with other aspects of shoulder function. Also current measurement techniques with the shoulder abducted have shown questionable reliability. Underlying contributors to shoulder pain have been studied, but their presence still needs to be supported and better understood. Therefore {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the reliability of <b>superficial</b> LSD <b>measures</b> with the shoulder abducted, and to determine the relationship of LSD and shoulder pain with internal to external rotation torque ratios, passive internal and external rotation, and anterosuperior humeral head position on the glenoid fossa. Twenty-nine Division II collegiate female athletes voluntarily participated. All subjects were measured superficially for LSD, internal to external torque ratios, videotaped to measure passive internal and external shoulder rotation, and radiographed twice to permit LSD measurement and humeral head position on the glenoid fossa. In the first phase of the study, the mean of three <b>superficial</b> LSD <b>measures</b> was correlated with a similar measure acquired on a radiograph. The results demonstrated a low reliability between the <b>superficial</b> and radiograph <b>measure.</b> Intratester reliability for the three <b>superficial</b> <b>measures</b> was acceptable. In second phase of the study, low and high LSD groups were identified and examined for differences in torque ratios, passive internal and external rotation and anterosuperior humeral head position. No overall significant difference was found, but the torque ratio was significantly greater in the high LSD group. Post-hoc testing revealed a significantly less passive internal rotation in the high LSD group. In the third phase of the study, subjects reporting shoulder pain were compared to painfree subjects for torque ratios, passive internal and external rotation, anterosuperior humeral position, and LSD. There was an overall significant difference between the two groups. The pain group displayed a significantly higher internal to external rotation torque ratio, inferior humeral head position and decreased passive internal rotation. ...|$|R

Features at various linguistic levels suggested in existing literature are evaluated, including the Swedish readability formula LIX. Natural language processing methods and resources are employed to investigate characteristics that go beyond traditional <b>superficial</b> <b>measures.</b> A comparable corpus of eay-to-read and ordinary texts from three genres is investigated, and it is shown how features present at various levels of representation differ quantitatively across text types and genres. The findings are confirmed in significance tests as well as principal component analysis. Three machine learning algorithms are employed and evaluated in order to build a statistical model for text classification. The results demonstrate that a proposed language model for Swedish (SVIT), utilizing a combination of linguistic features, actually predicts text complexity and genre with a higher accuracy than LIX. It is suggested that the SVIT language model should be adopted to assess surface language properties, vocabulary load, sentence structure, idea density levels as well as the personal interests of different texts.

40|$|Motivation: Comparative {{genomics}} aims {{to understand}} the structure and function of genomes by translating knowledge gained about some genomes to the object of study. Early approaches used pairwise comparisons, but today researchers are attempting to leverage the larger potential of multi-way comparisons. Comparative genomics relies on the structuring of genomes into syntenic blocks: blocks of sequence that exhibit conserved features across the genomes. Syntenic blocs are required for complex computations to scale to the billions of nucleotides present in many genomes; they enable comparisons across broad ranges of genomes because they filter out much of the individual variability; they highlight candidate regions for in-depth studies; and they facilitate whole-genome comparisons through visualization tools. However, the concept of syntenic block remains loosely defined. Tools for the identification of syntenic blocks yield quite different results, thereby preventing a systematic assessment of the next steps in an analysis. Current tools do not include measurable quality objectives and thus cannot be benchmarked against themselves. Comparisons among tools have also been neglected—what few results are given use <b>superficial</b> <b>measures</b> unrelated to quality or consistency. Results: We present a theoretical model {{as well as an}} experimental basis for comparing syntenic blocks and thus also for improving or designing tools for the identification of syntenic blocks. We illustrate the application of the model and the measures by applying them to syntenic blocks produced by three different contemporary tools (DRIMM-Synteny, i-ADHoRe and Cyntenator) on a dataset of eight yeast genomes. Our findings highlight the need for a well founded, systematic approach to the decomposition of genomes into syntenic blocks. Our experiments demonstrate widely divergent results among these tools, throwing into question the robustness of the basic approach in comparative genomics. We have taken the first step towards a formal approach to the construction of syntenic blocks by developing a simple quality criterion based on sound evolutionary principles.

40|$|Literature {{suggests}} that in theory, the efficiency of user charges for health services {{is related to the}} level of externality, the price elasticity of demand, the proportion of total costs which are private access costs, and the level of the government budget constraint. Theoretical models predict that price elasticity of demand for health services is likely to be higher for lower income groups and that user charges are therefore unlikely to promote equity, or reduce the discrepancies between the utilisation rates of the rich and poor, ‘ceteris paribus’. Empirical evidence tends to confirm the latter prediction but to suggest that user charges in many countries provide the scope for welfare gains for the majority. Unfortunately, this scope is seldom exploited in practice. It is argued that many countries have little choice but to try to exploit the potential for majority gains, but that more emphasis should be placed on ensuring quality improvements than on <b>superficial</b> financial <b>measures</b> of success...|$|R

The concurrent {{validity of the}} PBU in a clinically relevant sample is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the concurrent validity and diagnostic accuracy of the PBU in measuring TrA muscle activity in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain. METHOD: This study was performed using a validation, cross-sectional design. Fifty patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain were recruited for this study. To test the concurrent validity both PBU measures (index test) and <b>superficial</b> electromyographic <b>measures</b> (reference-standard test) were compared and collected by a physical therapist in a series of voluntary contraction maneuvers of TrA muscle. RESULTS: Participants were on average 22 years old, weighed 63. 7 kilos, 1. 70 meters height and mean low back pain duration was 1. 9 years. It was observed a weak and non-significant Phi coefficient (r= 0. 2, p< 0. 20). With regards to diagnostic accuracy tests, our results suggest a low sensitivity (60 %) and specificity (60 %) of the PBU. The positive predictive value was high (0. 8) and negative predictive value was low (0. 2). Conclusions: Concurrent validity of the PBU in measuring TrA muscle activity in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain is poor given the low correlation and diagnostic accuracy with superficial EMG...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bio-inspired sensing {{modalities}} {{enhance the}} ability of autonomous vehicles to characterize and respond to their environment. This paper concerns the lateral line of cartilaginous and bony fish, which is sensitive to fluid motion and allows fish to sense oncoming flow {{and the presence of}} walls or obstacles. The lateral line consists of two types of sensing modalities: canal neuromasts measure approximate pressure gradients, whereas <b>superficial</b> neuromasts <b>measure</b> local flow velocities. By employing an artificial lateral line, the performance of underwater sensing and navigation strategies is improved in dark, cluttered, or murky environments where traditional sensing modalities may be hindered. This paper presents estimation and control strategies enabling an airfoil-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle to assimilate measurements from a bio-inspired, multi-modal artificial lateral line and estimate flow properties for feedback control. We utilize potential flow theory to model the fluid flow past a foil in a uniform flow and in the presence of an upstream obstacle. We derive theoretically justified nonlinear estimation strategies to estimate the free stream flowspeed, angle of attack, and the relative position of an upstream obstacle. The feedback control strategy uses the estimated flow properties to execute bio-inspired behaviors including rheotaxis (the tendency of fish to orient upstream) and station-holding (the tendency of fish to position behind an upstream obstacle). A robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal artificial lateral line composed of ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) and embedded pressure sensors experimentally demonstrates the distributed flow sensing and closed-loop control strategies...|$|R

METHODS In 20 volunteers, 6 mm punch biopsies were harvested at the palate. A xenogeneic collagen matrix (XCM) was sutured in one site; the other one was left untreated (control). Biopsies with a diameter of 8 mm were subsequently obtained at 4, 8, 15 and 29 days and histological and immunohistologic analyses were performed. RESULTS At day 4, wound bed keratinization amounted to 12. 4 ± 7. 5 % (control) and 18. 0 ± 10. 2 % (XCM). This increased up to day 8 (19. 7 ± 25. 5 % control; 29. 1 ± 8. 0 % XCM) and reached complete keratinization at day 15 in both groups. The quantitative analyses of the <b>superficial</b> compartment <b>measured</b> an increase in the amount of granulation tissue (32 - 88 % control; 14 - 41 % XCM) from day 4 to day 8. Angiogenesis was first detected at 8 days. At day 29, the amount of connective tissue in all compartments reached values similar to the native tissue at baseline. CONCLUSIONS The application of a XCM as a wound dressing on palatal wounds might be beneficial in the early stages of wound healing.

Samples {{were collected from}} Ria Formosa, Portugal, to assess the temporal and spatial variability of microphytobenthic chlorophyll in two types of intertidal sediment: mud and sand. Chlorophyll pigments were measured spectrophotometrically after freeze-drying and extraction into an acetone–water mixture. Time-series of <b>superficial</b> chlorophyll <b>measured</b> at two sites during 2006 – 2007 showed no obvious seasonal peaks. A truncated Fourier series was fitted to the time-series data. Seasonality was very weak: only 5 % of the estimated total variance {{could be explained by}} annual cycle components up to 3 year 1, while 25 % was explained by waves with periods from 14 to 91 days. The residual error of the Fourier series was partitioned into within-day variance (61 %) and other components (9 %). The within-day variation was made up of roughly equal contributions from: (i) variability associated with sampling within-sites; and (ii) differences between-sites. There were no significant correlations between MPB chlorophyll and tidal range, wind speed, solar irradiance, water temperature and salinity and water nutrient concentrations. Sediment type was once more confirmed to be a key factor to MPB spatial variability.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the use of}} attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as a method to study differences in the molecular components of human stratum corneum in vivo. These variations {{as a function of}} the anatomic site and of the depth into its layered structure are important to understand the biology and physiology of the tissue. In this preliminary study we have investigated spectroscopic changes in 18 healthy individuals. Total reflection–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy represents a potentially powerful tool to study biophysical properties of surfaces. We observed that, in vivo, biophysical parameters of the stratum corneum (such as hydration, lipid composition, and conformation of the aliphatic chains) are indeed dependent on the anatomic site. As in total reflection–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments the penetration depth of the evanescent field into the stratum corneum is comparable with the thickness of a layer of corneocytes, this technique can be used to follow the distribution of lipids, water, and proteins as a function of depth into the tissue. We found that, in vivo, these molecular components are non-uniformly distributed, in agreement with the presence of water and lipid reservoirs as observed with ex vivo ultrastructural investigations. Composition and conformational order of lipids are also a function of depth into the stratum corneum. Finally we compared the in vivo <b>superficial</b> hydration <b>measured</b> using the infrared absorption of the OH stretch of water, with the hydration measured using the Skicon hygrometer.

A model for such a programme is defined as being based on five components; economic, social, institutional, infrastructural and spatial. The problems encountered in the Tunisian rural sector are extremely varied and highly complex, including limited physical resources, abundant human resources and a poorly developed economic base. The national {{government has}} made various unsuccessful attempts to solve the problems prior to adopting an IRD strategy in 1973. Against a background of limited resources, the Implementation of the IRD programme in Monastir has focused on three aspects; the creation and consolidation of employment, vocational training and the improvement of rural living standards. Progress In these areas has met with mixed success. Close investigation at the village level, however, reveals a generally successful implementation of rural development, particularly evident in the increasing popularity of the village as a place in which to live. One of the major problems with the implementation of the rural development programme has been the allocation of priorities and the failure to discern major objectives. This has been particularly true in the development of agriculture where <b>superficial</b> temporary <b>measures</b> and uneconomic prestige projects have been applied instead of attempts being made to tackle fundamental causes of the problems. Overall, however, the Tunisian rural development programme as studied in Monastir Governorate illustrates the viability and potential success of IRD as a strategy for rural development...|$|R
40|$|A {{modification}} of the microdissection technique of Hanssen was utilized in dogs to <b>measure</b> <b>superficial</b> (SNGFR) and juxtamedullary nephron filtration rate (JMGFR) in control and saline-expanded dogs. During control studies SNGFR was 60 ± 4 and JMGFR was 72 ± 5 nl/min. During saline loading SNGFR was 74 ± 8 and JMGFR was 65 ± 6 nl/min. The ratio SNGFR: JMGFR significantly increased from 0. 84 ± 0. 03 to 1. 15 ± 0. 08. Glomerular perfusion rate (GPR) was measured with the microsphere method during control and saline loading. Superficial GPR did not change significantly but juxtamedullary GPR increased from 225 ± 42 to 323 ± 39 nl/min. Calculated superficial nephron filtration fraction was unchanged after saline expansion but juxtamedullary filtration fraction decreased from 0. 34 ± 0. 07 to 0. 24 ± 0. 07. The data demonstrate a tendency for filtration to shift toward the superficial part and plasma flow toward the deep part of the kidney cortex. GFR in juxtamedullary nephrons appears to be less plasma flow-dependent than in superficial nephrons. The fall in filtration fraction in the deep cortex may affect sodium excretion by juxtamedullary nephrons...|$|R
30|$|Key {{measures}} {{within this}} domain were collected with the MyotonPRO (Myoton AS; Estonia) [21, 22]. The measurement probe (D[*]=[*] 3  mm) was placed perpendicularly on the pre-marked skin areas above the muscle being measured, QM and the ITB (see Fig.  1 c). The device was then {{lowered into the}} measurement position and held steady while it automatically performed the predefined measurement series (five single measurements with a recording interval of 1  s for each measuring point, using the average for data analysis). The method of myometry developed for <b>measuring</b> <b>superficial</b> skeletal muscles consists of (a) creating a constant pre-compression 0.18  N over the area of 7.1  mm 2, followed by a brief (15  ms) mechanical impulse of 0.4  N to the contact surface of the skin; (b) recording {{the response of the}} tissue in a form of damped oscillation that is registered by an accelerometer in a form of an oscillation acceleration graph; and (c) subsequently conducting signal processing and computing for the variables of interest. Of the five available variables, we chose the two most pertinent to our study aims—elasticity and dynamic stiffness.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThere is no universally {{accepted}} imaging method to diagnose scapholunate ligament (SLL) tears. Our {{aim was to}} use sonography to evaluate the reliability of SLL length at baseline compared with a standardized dynamometer maneuver in healthy normals. Materials and methodsSonographic exams from 31 consented asymptomatic patients between 18 years and 45 years of age were collected on a total of 60 wrists. The length of the SLL was measured superficially and {{at a depth of}} 3. 0  mm during static and dynamic squeeze maneuver. Inter- and intraexaminer reliability was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). ResultsThe <b>superficial</b> ligament length <b>measured</b> 0. 60  cm ±  0. 11  cm with a deep measurement of 0. 20  cm ±  0. 06  cm. Dynamic evaluation revealed superficial and deep measurements at 0. 62  ±  0. 12  cm and 0. 20  ±  0. 06  cm, respectively. There {{was no significant difference between}} the SLL length at rest and during the squeeze test. The interexaminer and intraexaminer reliability was rated at fair to very good. ConclusionThe evaluation of the dorsal SLL by sonographic squeeze test is reliable. Future studies will apply this method to suspected SLL tears...|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{the lungs}} of adult sheep with chronic {{respiratory}} diseases was readily achieved using both 5 [*]MHz linear and sector scanners. Superficial lung abscesses in eight sheep appeared as anechoic areas containing multiple hyperechoic dots bordered distally by a broad hyperechoic capsule. Unilateral fibrinous pleurisy (2 sheep) appeared as an anechoic area containing a hyperechoic latticework. Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) lesions appeared as sharply demarcated hypoechoic areas in the lung parenchyma initially in the cranioventral lung lobes (21 sheep) with lesions also present in the caudodorsal diaphragmatic lobe (11 sheep); abscesses and areas of calcification within the OPA tumour mass were also identified. Daily treatment with procaine penicillin for 30 consecutive days was successful in both sheep with unilateral fibrinous pleurisy and six sheep identified with <b>superficial</b> lung abscesses <b>measuring</b> 2 – 8 [*]cm in diameter; only one of two sheep with more extensive lesions recovered. Auscultation of the chest failed to detect adventitious sounds {{in any of the}} ten sheep with lung abscesses; normal breath sounds were reduced over the area of fibrinous pleurisy; no pleuritic rubs were heard. Wheezes and crackles auscultated in some OPA cases and did not correlate well with lesions detected ultrasonographically...|$|R

40|$|Background & aim: Menopause is {{accompanied}} with many {{problems such as}} coital discomfort, reduction of endometrial thickness {{and an increase in}} pH. Vitamin D is effective on proliferation and repair of epithelial tissue. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin D on vaginal atrophy among menopause women. Methods: In the present double-blind clinical trial study, forty-four women were randomly divieded into two groups. Treatment group received the vitamin D vaginal suppository, and the control group received placebo vaginal suppository in an 8 week period. Dyspareunia was assessed in first, 2, 4 and 8 weeks visit. The mean of Ph and maturation index of <b>superficial</b> cells were <b>measured</b> in the begnning of the study {{and at the end of}} the eighth week. The mann-whitney test was used for data analysis. Results: The mean of superficial cells and vaginal pH in the treatment group were (69. 76 ± 12. 4) (1. 42 ±. 67) respectively while these figures were 54. 66 ± 18. 38 and 2. 9 ± 0. 73 for the control group [...] The mean of sexual pain decreased considerably in the treatment group. Conclusion: Vitamin D is effective in maturation index and decreased pH and dyspareunia in menopause women...|$|R
50|$|Needle EMG use in {{clinical}} settings has practical {{applications such as}} helping to discover disease. Needle EMG has limitations, however, in that it does involve voluntary activation of muscle, and as such is less informative in patients {{unwilling or unable to}} cooperate, children and infants, and in individuals with paralysis., Surface EMG can have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface EMG. Adipose tissue (fat) can affect EMG recordings. Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the active muscle directly below the surface decreased. As adipose tissue increased, the amplitude of the surface EMG signal directly above the center of the active muscle decreased. EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who have lower body fat, and more compliant skin, such as young people when compared to old. Muscle cross talk occurs when the EMG signal from one muscle interferes with that of another limiting reliability of the signal of the muscle being tested. Surface EMG is limited due to lack of deep muscles reliability. Deep muscles require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order to achieve an EMG signal. Surface EMG can only <b>measure</b> <b>superficial</b> muscles and even then it is hard to narrow down the signal to a single muscle.|$|R
