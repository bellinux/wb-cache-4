40|$|In {{the recent}} {{research}} studies, Brain-Computer Interaction {{is considered a}} new research opportunity and novel way {{to interact with the}} game player in gaming and entertainment sector. There has been little academic research on players' attention and meditation with mobile input gaming devices. The research focuses on mobile interaction input for mobile games with the aim of study to examine how attention (e. g. focus, concentration) and meditation (e. g. calmness, stress) differs between mobile inputs. By comparing attention and meditation levels of players across mobile input, the research plans to achieve this by extracting information from mobile players using low cost electroencephalography headset to understand mobile input interaction and measure emotional states of users interacting with the mobile platform. Results showed that players have lower attention level on hard <b>key</b> than <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> while hard key meditation level is higher than <b>soft</b> <b>key...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Screen-labeled {{function}} keys are {{a special case}} of <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> ({{function keys}}) where keys are placed near a screen, which provides labels for them. These are today most commonly found in kiosk applications, such as automated teller machines and gas pumps. Screen-label function keys generally date to the late 1960s, and kiosk applications were particularly common in the 1990s and 2000s. Most recently, these keys have found use in point of sale systems; NCR Corporation claims that their DynaKey system [...] "has been proven to reduce training time and cashier errors". An alternative to screen-labeled function keys is buttons (virtual keys) on a touchscreen, where the label is directly pushable. The increased prevalence of touchscreens in the 2000s {{has led to a}} decrease in screen-labeled function keys. However, screen-labeled function keys are inexpensive and robust, and provide tactile feedback.|$|R
50|$|To {{make matters}} worse, some phones {{make it easier}} to call the {{emergency}} services when the keypad is locked than it would be otherwise. An example of this is a <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> programmed to make an emergency call when the keylock is set. On touch-screen phones, passcode screens often include a single button that, when touched for just a few seconds, will dial emergency services. The result is that it is often preferable to disable the passcode since, while doing so increases the likelihood of pocket dialing family and friends, it is considered a lesser evil than pocket dialing the emergency services.|$|R
5000|$|H-DOS was {{remarkable}} and is of historical significance because it featured a simple menu system. The [...] through [...] keys beneath the 7" [...] screen corresponded to five menu items {{displayed at the}} bottom of the screen. This menu was context sensitive and greatly facilitated entering DOS commands. All but the least frequently used commands were available as F-key menu selections, and this greatly reduced the amount of typing required. This user interface was comparable to the many DOS shell programs available at the time, but functioned much more smoothly because of the <b>soft</b> <b>key</b> concept.|$|R

50|$|A {{multi-function}} display (MFD) {{is a small}} screen (CRT or LCD) surrounded by multiple <b>soft</b> <b>keys</b> (configurable buttons) {{that can be used}} to display information to the user in numerous configurable ways.

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} a <b>soft</b> display <b>key</b> as applied to input of large {{character}} sets or vocabularies such as Kanji, the ancient Chinese ideographic script is discussed. The Japanese orthography {{and the necessity of}} using Kanji characters in data terminals are explained. Problems arising from the number and complexity of Kanji symbols for the manufacture and use of keyboard devices are stated. A review is made of devices and methods presently used or suggested. The feasibility of the <b>soft</b> display <b>key</b> is then demonstrated. Some requirements for the design and implementation of a soft display keyboard for Kanji are considered. In conclusion, implications to man/computer interface design, human factors engineering and hardware unification and standardization are stated...|$|R
