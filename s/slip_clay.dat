50|$|Rio Grande Glaze Ware {{was fired}} in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The lead-based pigment yielded a black glazing paint despite the {{presence}} of oxygen, while iron-based, non-glazing pigment yielded a matte red paint. Red design elements were most often outlined in black. On most pots, background colors ranged from red to olive to yellow, achieved with clay slips containing iron. A white slip was sometimes achieved by using <b>slip</b> <b>clay</b> imported from the Acoma-Zuni region to the west.|$|E
50|$|Early Philippine {{painting}} can {{be found}} in red <b>slip</b> (<b>clay</b> mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed Manunggul Jar. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000 BC has been found in Sanga-Sanga Cave, Sulu and Cagayan's Laurente Cave. It has been proven that by 5000 BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the archipelago.

40|$|In {{this case}} study, Sayong paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> used is {{produced}} by the combination of local Sayong clay and paper pulp in producing ceramic output through casting technique. The purpose {{of this research is}} to develop knowledge regarding the character of Sayong paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> and to find out the capability of the slip producing an output. The process involved from preparing Sayong <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> and Sayong paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> until casting output is produced. Apart of Sayong Clay as main material test, three types of paper pulp which is copy print paper, tissue paper and news print paper will be use in this research. The research involved a series of laboratory test which is rheology test, clay body test after slip casting process and practical test of casting output. The result of basic Sayong <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> will be the benchmark through out analyzing the character of Sayong Paper Clay and the casting output. From the conducted experiment, dried paper pulp content used up to 4 % is capable to produce casting output. In rheology test, it is shown that Sayong paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> had low density but high fluidity level and capable to keep slip liquidity in particular time. The shrinkage, strength, weight loss and water absorption of clay body out put is fluctuated according to the percentage of paper pulp. Practical test on casting output proved that the increment of paper pulp content produced more rough texture on the surface and uneven thickness of an output. From the clay body test, the result also showed that all three types of paper pulp used does not giving any large impact towards the character of casting <b>slip.</b> Sayong paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> is capable to produce ceramics product through casting technique. However it is limited to hollow casting technique only because of its physical texture...|$|R
25|$|The {{making of}} {{earthenware}} began to replace stone utensils in Mexico began around the Purrón period (2300-1500 BCE). Many of these first ceramics were gourd or squash shaped, a carry over from when these vegetables {{were used to}} carry liquids. This earthenware developed into a pottery tradition that mostly used clay thinly coated with a fine <b>clay</b> <b>slip.</b> Most <b>clays</b> in Mexico need temper to regulate water absorption, with one significant exception being the clay used in the Fine Orangeware of the Gulf Coast.|$|R
50|$|Pottery Mound Polychrome is {{considered}} a variant of San Clemente Glaze Polychrome, {{in the sense that}} the San Clemente slip scheme (different slip color on interiors and exteriors) is combined with the canon of red matte paint outlined in black glaze paint. In some of the most boldly executed examples of this type, however red matte paint designs are sometimes not framed in black. The background colors used in contrasting pairs include red (grading to orange), yellow (grading to olive), and white (probably using <b>slip</b> <b>clay</b> from the Acoma area, in imitation of Acoma-Zuni wares). Pottery Mound Polychrome dates from AD 1400 to 1490. The sole center of production was Pottery Mound, a village on the lower Rio Puerco (east).|$|E
50|$|The {{second phase}} {{consists}} of applying {{a layer of}} raw clay inside the mould, which can be incised beforehand {{in order to obtain}} effects of relief. The thinness of the layer varies according to the type of object to be realized. The faces of the mould are joined together, the object is then unmoulded, and the craftsman can proceed to the final improvements, typically smoothing the junction. The craftsman also creates a small opening, a vent hole that allows steam to escape during the firing. The vent can also be used for assembly, allowing intervention inside the piece. The limbs are then joined to the body either by pasting them with <b>slip,</b> <b>clay</b> mixed with water, or by mortice and tenon joint.|$|E
5000|$|Regarded as the [...] "national" [...] pottery {{of ancient}} Etruria, bucchero ware is {{distinguished}} by its black fabric {{as well as}} glossy, black surface achieved through the unique [...] "reduction" [...] method {{in which it was}} fired. After the leather-hard unfired ware was arranged in the kiln and the fire started, the vent holes were closed, thus reducing the supply of oxygen required in a normal kiln firing. In the smoke-filled atmosphere of the kiln, the oxygen-starved flames drew oxygen molecules from the iron oxide of the pottery. This process caused the fabric of the clay to change color from its natural red to black. Thus, in contrast to the black-glazed Campanian ware of the Greek colonists in southern Italy, the lustrous, shiny, black surface of many bucchero pots was achieved by diligent burnishing (polishing) or, occasionally, through the application of a thin <b>slip</b> (<b>clay</b> emulsion).|$|E

Further evidences of painting are manifested in the tattoo tradition of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as Pintados or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas. Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the Maranao who are well known for the Nāga Dragons and the Sarimanok carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.|$|E
40|$|My {{reasons for}} writing this thesis {{is to present}} my {{findings}} which have resulted from my explorations into the development of ash glazes, local slip glazes, once fire techniques {{and the production of}} an oriented ash glaze surface which will be consistent enough to be used on a steady line of functional dinnerware and accessories. Investigation into these areas was stimulated by a striving to join myself with the closeness of ash and natural clay glazes to the relation of the clay-forming process itself. Also the investigation has led toward the development of the once fire method which has resulted in great savings economically, time-wise, and ecologically. This once fire process joins the raw clay and <b>slip</b> <b>clay</b> ash glaze without taking away the fresh raw quality of the clay by being fired from raw clay to finished product in a one step process...|$|E

50|$|The Undercliff is a {{landslide}} complex in Cretaceous soft rocks, a bench of <b>slipped</b> <b>clays</b> and sands above a low sea-cliff, backed by higher (100 metres) Upper Greensand and Chalk cliffs. The largest urban landslide complex in northern Europe, it dates from two main phases of landslides {{after the last}} Ice age: 8000-4500 years and 2500-1800 years ago. It is flanked by highly active landslip zones that have seen major slides {{over the past two}} centuries: the Blackgang landslip at the west, and the Bonchurch Landslips at the east. The main section is more stable, though there are ongoing concerns over coastal erosion, further slippage and subsidence. The main through road, Undercliff Drive, was disrupted by a mud slide near St Lawrence in 2001, requiring 18 months to build a new road section and in 2014 further erosion after heavy rain fell and the road was under repair, leading to more damage, and nine houses being evacuated.|$|R

Famous examples of this type exist in Tlaxcala and Puebla states. Many figurines were also made using molds. Sometimes vessels were made with several molded pieces with the upper part finished by coiling.|$|R

When dry, the solid clay can then also be removed. The slip used in slip casting is often liquified with a substance that reduces the need for additional water to soften the slip; this prevents excessive shrinkage which occurs when a piece containing a lot of water dries.|$|R
