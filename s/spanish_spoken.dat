2500|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>spoken</b> in Chile is distinctively accented {{and quite}} {{unlike that of}} {{neighboring}} South American countries because final syllables and [...] "s" [...] sounds are often dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section {{at the center of}} the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.|$|E
