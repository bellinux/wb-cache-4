500|$|Anarchy Online is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{published and}} developed by Norwegian video game development company Funcom. Released {{in the summer}} of 2001, the game was the first in the genre to include a science-fiction setting, dynamic quests, instancing, free trials, and in-game advertising. The game's ongoing storyline revolves around the fictional desert planet [...] "Rubi-Ka", the source of a valuable mineral known as [...] "Notum". [...] Players assume the role of a new colonist to Rubi-Ka. [...] With no <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> to win Anarchy Online, the player advances the game through the improvement of a character's skills over time.

500|$|The game {{is unique}} {{in the context of}} the Half-Life series in that it is the only game divided into {{separate}} missions, each with a <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> to pursue, instead of consisting of a single unbroken narrative. How players perform in each mission is ranked at the conclusion of the level as a grade from [...] "A" [...] to [...] "F". This score is based on each player's accuracy with weapons, the number of kills they acquired and the amount of damage they sustained during the course of the mission. Should players successfully complete the game's nine missions with [...] "A" [...] grades on every level, they are given access to a bonus cooperative mission, in which they can play as a pair of Vortigaunts, as well as the ability to play through the PlayStation 2 version of the original Half-Life as a Vortigaunt.|$|E
500|$|The <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> of {{the assault}} has {{been the source of}} {{historical}} controversy. Traditionally, the [...] "copse of trees" [...] on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force. Historical treatments such as the 1993 film Gettysburg continue to popularize this view, which originated in the work of Gettysburg Battlefield historian John B. Bachelder in the 1880s. However, recent scholarship, including published works by some Gettysburg National Military Park historians, has suggested that Lee's goal was actually Ziegler's Grove on Cemetery Hill, a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards (274m) north of the copse. The much-debated theory suggests that Lee's general plan for the second-day attacks (the seizure of Cemetery Hill) had not changed on the third day, and the attacks on July 3 were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded. The copse of trees, currently a prominent landmark, was under ten feet (3m) high in 1863, only visible to a portion of the attacking columns from certain parts of the battlefield.|$|E
500|$|In September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, {{received}} US patent 3150739 {{which was}} the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omni-directionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems. Able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 cycles per second (15Hz), a <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> of Dones’ invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an audible indication of the direction from which they emanate. Dones' loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name [...] "The Octavium" [...] from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the Grateful Dead, bassist Monk Montgomery, bassist Nathan East, and the Pointer Sisters. The Octavium speaker and Dones' subwoofer technology was also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce low pitch frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie Earthquake. [...] During the late 1960s Dones’ Octavium was favorably reviewed by audiophile publications including Hi-Fi News and Audio Magazine.|$|E

500|$|Several {{main story}} {{missions}} {{of the game}} are Stage Battles based on real time strategy elements. The player, while still in control of Eddie, is required to defend a giant stage where new allies will spawn, holding out until a <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> is completed. The player creates an army for attacks by building merchandise booths on [...] "fan geysers" [...] through Clementine's magic. Once enough fans are collected, the player can summon different allies, each consuming a specific number of fans, or upgrade their stage {{to allow them to}} produce more powerful allies. A character known as Mangus acts as the [...] "sound guy" [...] to help in the construction of these units and stage upgrades, and also warns the player of enemy attacks. Once the player has gathered their army, they can then seek out and attack their opponents. Eddie is able to control the entire army to follow, attack, or defend a point, and can use specialized squads of specific units to perform certain tasks, such as having a group of headbangers use their headbanging to destroy statues. The player can also use Eddie directly in combat during this battles. Ultimately, Eddie transforms into a winged demon who can fly above the battlefields to issue orders or lay out attacks. Spells in Eddie's arsenal can help control the performance of his armies, such as temporarily boosting their attack skills or creating a rally flag which troops will gather at, while others hinder the performance of the enemy faction by removing enemy buffs or preventing the creation of enemy units for a short time. Each of the different units, including special allies that Eddie meets in the game, has a special co-op move they can perform with Eddie; for example, Eddie's first ally, Ophelia, can be tossed at foes by Eddie {{in the style of the}} Fastball Special. These co-op moves are also available outside of Stage Battle missions.|$|E

[...] Other alternatives, like Jean Darlan and Charles de Gaulle, had been rejected by the British and American governments for a variety of political reasons. Clark would be Eisenhower's personal representative, with Lemnitzer as the top invasion planner, Hamblen as the invasion's logistics expert, and Holmes serving as translator. [...] Wright would serve as the liaison with the French Navy, with the <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> of convincing the French to have their fleet anchored in Toulon join the Allied cause.|$|E
2500|$|Captive {{insurance}} companies {{may be defined}} as limited-purpose {{insurance companies}} established with the <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may {{take the form of}} a [...] "pure" [...] entity (which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company); of a [...] "mutual" [...] captive (which insures the collective risks of members of an industry); and of an [...] "association" [...] captive (which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association). Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.|$|E

[...] He was concerned that if he attempted to turn Schofield by crossing the Harpeth and getting between him and Nashville, the maneuver would be time consuming and the open terrain of the area would reveal his movements prematurely, causing Schofield to simply withdraw again. The Confederates began moving forward at 4:00p.m., with Cheatham's corps on the left of the assault and Stewart's on the right. Bate's division, on the left, was delayed in reaching its starting point as it marched around Winstead Hill, a movement that delayed the start of the entire army. Hood divided Forrest's cavalry—Chalmer's division on the far left, beyond Bate, and Buford and Jackson with Forrest, covering Stewart and facing the fords on the Harpeth. Lee's corps, and almost all of the army's artillery, had not yet arrived from Columbia. Hood's attacking force, about 19–20,000 men, was arguably understrength for the mission he assigned—traversing two miles (3km) of open ground with only two batteries of artillery support and then assaulting prepared fortifications.|$|E
