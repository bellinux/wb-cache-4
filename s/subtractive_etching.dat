40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{possibilities}} of focused ion beam (FIB) applications in microsystem technology are reviewed. After {{an introduction to the}} technology and the operating principles of FIB, two classes of applications are described. First the subject of FIB for microsystem technology inspection, metrology and failure analysis is outlined. A procedure for cross sectioning on samples is presented, as well as some examples of how this technique can be applied to study processing results. The second part of the paper is on the use of FIB as a toot for maskless micromachining. Both <b>subtractive</b> (<b>etching)</b> and additive (deposition) techniques are discussed, as well as the combination of FIB implantation of silicon with subsequent wet etching. We will show the possibility to fabricate three-dimensional structures on a micrometre scale, and give examples of recent realizations thereof. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} very large scale {{integration}} will require substantial progress {{in all aspects}} of silicon technology: processing, lithography, modeling, design tools, chip architecture, and applications This paper will survey current trends in silicon integrated circuit fabrication, focusing on new developments and outstanding problems. Progress in both bipolar and MOSFET technologies will be considered. Silicon fabrication techniques will be described in terms of the repetitious application of operations that are additive (oxidation, doping, deposition), selective (lithography), and <b>subtractive</b> (<b>etching).</b> The objective of these operations is a reliable and predictable device structure. Device structures will be described in terms of isolation areas, devices, contacts (intraconnection vias), wiring (interconnection lines), and passivation. Immediate problems in isolation size, device performance, contact resistance, and wiring topography will be identified. Future needs for improved structures will be indicated. Promising new approaches such as lightly-doped drain FETs and silicide-on-polysilicon (polycide) wiring will be described. Throughout this discussion the importance of process modeling will be emphasized...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} investigations on Cu, Ag, and Au <b>subtractive</b> <b>etching</b> by H₂ and CH₄ plasmas below room temperature. Both blanket film of Cu, Ag, and Au etching and patterning {{studies were}} performed for the applications of these metals as interconnects in electronic devices and photonic devices to replace current Damascene process. The nm scale Cu patterning in H₂ plasma was demonstrated by etching Ta/Cu/Ta stacks. Also, Ag and Au etching was feasible in H₂ plasma unlike other transition metals such as Ti, Ta, Ni, Cr, Al, and Pt indicating the etching chemistry {{based on the}} similar electronic structures of group 11 metals plays important role. In addition, employing CH₄ plasma allowed the use of photoresist mask and patterned Cu, Ag, and Au with high selectivity. The overall etch mechanism is the combination of chemical reactions and physical (photon and ion) bombardment in H₂ and CH₄ plasma. However, the Cu etching mechanism is more dependent on the chemistry while Ag and Au patterning were dominated by physical bombardment. Finally, the direction for future work including further mechanistic study and process optimization is suggested. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a silicon-based three-axial force sensor {{to be used in}} a flexible smart interface for biomechanical measurements. Normal and shear forces are detected by combining responses from four piezoresistors obtained by ion implantation in a high aspect-ratio cross-shape flexible element equipped with a 525 m high silicon mesa. The mesa is obtained by a <b>subtractive</b> dry <b>etching</b> process of the whole handle layer of an SOI wafer. Piezoresistor size ranges between 6 and 10 m in width, and between 30 and 50 m in length. The sensor configuration follows a hybrid integration approach for interconnection and for future electronic circuitry system integration. The sensor ability to measure both normal and shear forces with high linearity (∼= 99...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} part of the article, the <b>subtractive</b> processes—laser <b>etching</b> and cutting—in the {{presence}} of liquid water will be reviewed; but the rarely used methods of water assisted/ underwater laser processing, such as welding, silicon wafer breaking, surface modification of polymers, pulsed laser deposition, particle formation and water mask defined microstructures fabrication, will also be described. Etching and cutting under water provide better tolerances and smaller heat-affected zone widths and avoid the re-deposition of debris. Irradiation under water results in increased wetting of fluoropolymers, and laser ablation in water vapor provides deposition of highly crystalline hydroxyapatite coatings. Laser irradiation of solid targets in water has been used to fabricate Ag, Au, Ni, Cu and carbon nanoparticles. The results of an original study on the formation of free-standing high aspect ratio PbðZrxTi 1 xÞO 3 microplates fabricated by laser irradiation of PbðZrxTi 1 xÞO 3 ceramics in water are also reported. The platelets were up to 60 mm in diameter and 50 – 160 nm in thickness. The use of neutral liquids other than water and some medical applications of underwater/water-assisted laser light driven processes will also be briefly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground ContextA {{large number}} of interbody fusion cages are made of {{polyetheretherketone}} (PEEK). To improve bone on-growth, some are coated with {{a thin layer of}} titanium. This coating may fail when subjected to shear loading. PurposeThe purpose of this testing was to investigate whether impaction of titanium-coated PEEK cages into the disc space can result in wear or delamination of the coating, and whether titanium cages with <b>subtractive</b> surface <b>etching</b> (no coating) are less susceptible to such failure. Study Design/SettingA biomechanical study was carried out to simulate the impaction process in clinical practice and to evaluate if wear or delamination may result from impaction. Materials and MethodsTwo groups of posterior lumbar interbody fusion cages with a similar geometry were tested: n= 6 titanium-coated PEEK and n= 6 surface-etched titanium cages. The cages were impacted into the space in between two vertebral body substitutes (polyurethane foam blocks). The two vertebral body substitutes were fixed in a device, through which a standardized axial preload of 390 [*]N was applied. The anterior tip of the cage was positioned at the posterior border of the space between the two vertebral body substitutes. The cages were then inserted using a drop weight with a mass representative of a surgical hammer. The drop weight impacted the insertion instrument at a maximum speed of about 2. 6 [*]m/s, which is in the range of the impaction speed in vivo. This was repeated until the cages were fully inserted. The wear particles were captured and analyzed according to the pertinent standards. ResultsThe surface-etched titanium cages did not show any signs of wear debris or surface damage. In contrast, the titanium-coated PEEK cages resulted in detached wear particles of different sizes (1 – 191 [*]µm). Over 50 % of these particles had a size < 10 [*]µm. In median, on 26 % of the implants' teeth, the coating was abraded. Full delamination was not observed. ConclusionsIn contrast to the surface-etched implants, the titanium-coated PEEK implants lost some coating material. This was visible to the naked eye. More than half of all particles were of a size range that allows phagocytosis. This study shows that titanium-coated implants are susceptible to impaction-related wear debris...|$|R
40|$|Although copper (Cu) is the {{preferred}} interconnect material due to its lower resistivity than aluminum (Al), Cu <b>subtractive</b> <b>etching</b> processes have not been developed at temperatures less than 180 °C, primarily due to the inability to form volatile etch products at low temperature. The conventional damascene technology avoids the need for <b>subtractive</b> <b>etching</b> of Cu by electroplating Cu into previously etched dielectric trenches/vias, followed by a chemical/mechanical planarization (CMP) process. However, a critical "size effect" limitation has arisen for damascene technology {{as a result of}} the continuing efforts to adhere to "Moore's Law". The size effect relates to the fact that the resistivity of damascene-generated lines increases dramatically as the line width approaches the sub- 100 nm regime, where feature size is similar to the mean free path of electrons in Cu (40 nm). As a result, an alternative Cu patterning process to that of damascene may offer advantages for device speed and thus operation. This thesis describes investigations into the development of novel, fully-plasma based etch processes for Cu at low temperatures (10 °C). Initially, the investigation of a two-step etch process has been studied. This etch approach was based on a previous thermodynamic analysis of the Cu-Cl-H system by investigators at the University of Florida. In the first step, Cu films are exposed to a Cl₂ plasma to preferentially form CuCl₂, which is believed to be volatilized as Cu₃Cl₃ by subsequent exposure to a hydrogen (H₂) plasma (second step). Patterning of Cu films masked with silicon dioxide (SiO₂) layers in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactor indicates that the H₂ plasma step in the two-step process is the limiting step in the etch process. This discovery led to the investigation of a single step Cu etch process using a pure H₂ plasma. Etching of blanket Cu films and Cu film patterning at 10 °C, display an etch rate ~ 13 nm/min; anisotropic etched features are also observed. Comparison of H₂ plasma etching to sputtering of Cu films in argon (Ar) plasmas, indicates that both a chemical component and a physical component are involved in the etching mechanism. Additional studies using helium plasmas and variation of power applied to the plasma and etching surface demonstrate that the etch rate is controlled by reactive hydrogen species, ion bombardment flux and likely photon flux. Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) of the H₂ plasma during the Cu etching process detects Cu emission lines, but is unable to identify specific Cu etch products that desorb from the etching surface. Variation of Cu etch rates as a function of temperature suggests a change in mechanism for the removal of Cu over the temperature of - 150 °C to 150 °C. OES analyses also suggest that the Cl₂ plasma step in the two-step process can inhibit Cu etching, since the subsequent H₂ (second) plasma step shows a time delay in film removal. Preliminary results of the etching of the SiO₂ mask material in H₂ plasmas with various intentionally introduced contaminants demonstrate the robustness of the H₂ plasma Cu etch process.
