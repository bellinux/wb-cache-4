40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to address the {{possible}} biologic effects {{of the use of}} permanent magnets and <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in orthodontics. In recent decades, the development of new, small and highly effective rare earth magnets, producing <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> as well as their potential for multiple applications in orthodontics have significantly increased the interest in their use. The influence of <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on osteoblastic activity and orthodontic movement still remains an issue requiring further investigation. The author examined the effect of <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on osteoblastic cell cultures under the influence <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> with an intensity of 178 mT (miliTesla), produced by neodymium-iron-boron (Ne 2 Fe 14 B) magnets. The results of this in vitro study, did not show any influence of <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on osteoblastic activity. Today, {{it is well known that}} <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> produced by small, permanent, rare earth magnets used in orthodontics have no harmful effect on tissues or cells. It seems that the better or quicker therapeutic results achieved by some researchers with permanent magnets, are due more to the biomechanical properties of some magnetic systems and less to the biologic effects of <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> When used in clinical practice, permanent magnets should be plated with biocompatible materials in order to avoid corrosion and toxicity...|$|R

However, the influence {{of external}} <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on properties of metallic functional materials is rarely reviewed. In this paper, the effect of <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> subjected in solidification and/or annealing on the properties of Fe–Ga magnetostrictive material, high strength high conductivity Cu-based material (Cu–Fe and Cu–Ag alloys), and Fe–Sn magnetic material were summarized.

25|$|Using {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) to image the human OFC is a challenge, because this brain region is in proximity to the air-filled sinuses. This means that signal dropout, geometric distortion and susceptibility artifacts are common when using EPI at higher magnetic field strengths. Extra care is therefore recommended for obtaining a good signal from the orbitofrontal cortex, and a number of strategies have been devised, such as automatic shimming at high <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strengths.|$|E
25|$|The fMRI concept {{builds on}} the earlier MRI {{scanning}} technology and the discovery of properties of oxygen-rich blood. MRI brain scans use a strong, permanent, <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to align nuclei in the brain region being studied. Another magnetic field, the gradient field, is then applied to spatially locate different nuclei. Finally, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is played to kick the nuclei to higher magnetization levels, with the effect now depending on where they are located. When the RF field is removed, the nuclei {{go back to their}} original states, and the energy they emit is measured with a coil to recreate the positions of the nuclei. MRI thus provides a static structural view of brain matter. The central thrust behind fMRI was to extend MRI to capture functional changes in the brain caused by neuronal activity. Differences in magnetic properties between arterial (oxygen-rich) and venous (oxygen-poor) blood provided this link.|$|E

2500|$|The {{moving coil}} driver, more {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "dynamic" [...] driver is the most common type used in headphones. [...] It consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The magnet in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. [...] A voice coil, a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like. [...] When the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field which reacts against the <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate back and forth. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air producing sound waves.|$|E
2500|$|The precessing nuclei {{can also}} {{fall out of}} {{alignment}} with each other (returning the net magnetization vector to a non-precessing field) and stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because {{of the difference in}} the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions [...] ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller dipole-dipole interaction effects). In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to [...] of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay—the T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ("well-shimmed") <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cyclotron}} accelerates a {{charged particle}} beam using a high frequency alternating voltage which is applied between two hollow [...] "D"-shaped sheet metal electrodes called [...] "dees" [...] inside a vacuum chamber. The dees are placed {{face to face}} with a narrow gap between them, creating a cylindrical space within them for the particles to move. The particles are injected into the center of this space. The dees are located between the poles of a large electromagnet which applies a <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> B perpendicular to the electrode plane. The magnetic field causes the particles' path to bend in a circle due to the Lorentz force perpendicular to their direction of motion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{results of}} studies on the {{biological}} influence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are controversial and do not provide clear answers regarding their impact on cell functioning. Fluoride compounds are substances that influence free radical processes, which occur when the reactive forms of oxygen are present. It is not known whether <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> (SMF) cause any changes in fluoride assimilation or activity. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work was to determine the potential relationship between <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> exposure to, and the antioxidant system of, fibroblasts cultured with fluoride ions. Three chambers with <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> of different intensities (0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 7 T) were used in this work. Fluoride ions were added at a concentration of 0. 12 mM, which did not cause the precipitation of calcium or magnesium. The results of this study show that <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> reduce the oxidative stress caused by fluoride ions and normalize the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT). <b>Static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> modify the energy state of fibroblasts, causing an increase in the ATP concentration and a decrease in the MDA concentration.

2500|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} fields {{are created by}} charged particles in matter such as electrons. [...] A stationary charge creates an electrostatic field in the space around it. [...] A steady current of charges (direct current, DC) creates a <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> around it. [...] The above fields contain energy, but cannot carry power because they are static. [...] However time-varying fields can carry power. [...] Accelerating electric charges, such as are found in an alternating current (AC) of electrons in a wire, create time-varying electric {{and magnetic}} fields in the space around them.

2500|$|A {{cyclotron}} {{is a type}} {{of particle}} accelerator invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1934 in which charged particles accelerate outwards from the centre along a spiral path. The particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and accelerated by a rapidly varying (radio frequency) electric field. Lawrence was awarded the 1939 Nobel prize in physics for this invention. Cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the synchrotron, and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and nuclear medicine. The largest single-magnet cyclotron was the [...] synchrocyclotron built between 1940 and 1946 by Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley, which could accelerate protons to 730MeV.

2500|$|Professor Raymond Andrew at the University of Nottingham in the UK {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. He {{was the first to}} report the introduction of the MAS (magic angle sample spinning; MASS) technique that allowed him to achieve spectral resolution in solids sufficient to distinguish between chemical groups with either different chemical shifts or distinct Knight shifts. In MASS, the sample is spun at several kilohertz around an axis that makes the so-called magic angle θm (which is ~54.74°, where [...] ) with respect to the direction of the <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> B0; as a result of such magic angle sample spinning, the chemical shift anisotropy bands are averaged to their corresponding average (isotropic) chemical shift values. The above expression involving cos2θm has its origin in a calculation that predicts the magnetic dipolar interaction effects to cancel out for the specific value of θm called the magic angle. One notes that correct alignment of the sample rotation axis {{as close as possible to}} θm is essential for cancelling out the dipolar interactions whose strength for angles sufficiently far from θm is usually greater than ~10kHz for C–H bonds in solids, for example, and it is thus greater than their CSA values.|$|E

2500|$|A {{magnetic}} resonance imaging instrument (MRI scanner), or [...] "nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) imaging" [...] scanner as it was originally known, uses powerful magnets to polarize and excite hydrogen nuclei (i.e., single protons) of water molecules in human tissue, producing a detectable signal which is spatially encoded, resulting in images of the body. The MRI machine emits a radio frequency (RF) pulse at the resonant frequency of the hydrogen atoms on water molecules. Radio frequency antennas ("RF coils") send the pulse {{to the area of}} the body to be examined. The RF pulse is absorbed by protons, causing their direction with respect to the primary magnetic field to change. When the RF pulse is turned off, the protons [...] "relax" [...] back to alignment with the primary magnet and emit radio-waves in the process. This radio-frequency emission from the hydrogen-atoms on water is what is detected and reconstructed into an image. The resonant frequency of a spinning magnetic dipole (of which protons are one example) is called the Larmor frequency and is determined by the strength of the main magnetic field and the chemical environment of the nuclei of interest. MRI uses three electromagnetic fields: a very strong (typically 1.5 to 3 teslas) <b>static</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to polarize the hydrogen nuclei, called the primary field; gradient fields that can be modified to vary in space and time (on the order of 1kHz) for spatial encoding, often simply called gradients; and a spatially homogeneous radio-frequency (RF) field for manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei to produce measurable signals, collected through an RF antenna.|$|E
