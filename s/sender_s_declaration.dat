40|$|Abstract. In {{electronic}} {{communications and}} in access to systems, {{the issue of}} authentication of the <b>Sender</b> <b>S</b> of a message M, aswellasofthe message itself, is of paramount importance. Recently S. Goldwasser has raised the additional issue of Deniable Authentication where the <b>sender</b> <b>S</b> authenticates the message M to the Receiver’s (R) satisfaction, but can later deny his authorship of M even to an Inquisitor INQ who has listened to the exchange between S and R and who gains access {{to all of the}} the secret information used by S and R. We present two practical schemes for Deniable Authentication of messages M of arbitrary length n. In both schemes the Receiver R is assured with probability greater than 1 − 2 −k,wherekis a chosen security parameter, that M originated with the <b>Sender</b> <b>S.</b> Deniability is absolute in the information theoretic sense. The first scheme requires 2. 4 kn XOR operations on bits and one public key encoding and decoding of a short message. The second scheme requires the same number of XOR operations and k multiplications mod N, whereNis some fixed product of two large primes. A key new feature of our method is the use of a Shannon-style error correction code. Traditional authentication for a long message M starts by hashing M down to a standard word-size. We expand M through error correction. The first Deniable Authentication method is provably valid for any encryption scheme with minimal security properties, i. e. this method is generic. The second Deniable Authentication method is provably valid under the usual assumption that factorization is intractable. Background and New Results The question of authentication of transmitted messages is of paramount importance. When a <b>Sender</b> <b>S</b> communicates with a receiver R and sends him a message M, it does not suffice for R to authenticate (identify) S in order to know that M has actually originated with S. AnAdversaryAD can actively tap the line between S and R, andafterRhas authenticated the <b>sender</b> <b>S,</b> AD can block the Sender’s transmission and inject his own message ¯ M to R...|$|R

30|$|The {{basic idea}} behind {{opportunistic}} forwarding is that relay nodes are selected {{in such a}} way that the highest geographical gain is introduced per message retransmit. In other words, when a <b>sender</b> <b>S</b> broadcasts a DENM message, only the nodes located at the edge of S’ transmission domain are selected as forwarding nodes F (Figure 5). To achieve this behavior, every node has to wait a certain time before it gets the opportunity to retransmit a received message. This waiting time is dependent on the distance between the previous sender of the message and the possible relay node: the larger the distance, the shorter the waiting time. If the waiting timer of a relay candidate expires and it has not yet overheard a retransmission of the same packet by any of its neighbors, then it is allowed to retransmit the message. However, when such a retransmit is overheard during the waiting phase, the node cancels its timer and destroys the message.|$|R

However, in their model, the underlying network is abstracted as directed node disjoint paths (also called as wires/channels) between S and R, where the intermediate nodes are oblivious, message passing nodes and perform no other computation. In this work, we first show that the characterization of USMT given by Desmedt et. al [4] does not hold good for arbitrary directed networks, where the intermediate nodes perform some computation, beside acting as message forwarding nodes. We then give the true characterization of USMT in arbitrary directed networks.
