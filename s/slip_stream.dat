50|$|The series {{consists}} of three separate arcs. The first is about Capeta's first experiences with kart racing {{at the age of}} 10. The next arc, which starts four years later, deals with Capeta trying to handle his growing financial issues due to the high cost involved in kart racing. The third is about Capeta trying to realize his dream of beating his rival and becoming a professional racer, venturing through into a more senior category: Formula Three. Both the anime and manga features numerous references and homages to Initial D and Best Motoring International, as well as Formula One.

40|$|I. Plasma Oscillations and Radio Noise {{from the}} Disturbed Sun. Many {{investigators}} {{have suggested that}} plasma oscillations in the solar corona may {{be the source of}} large bursts of radio noise in the meter wavelength region. Two aspects of this problem are considered in this report: (a) the excitation of plasma oscillations by directed beams of charged particles, and (b) the conversion of energy in the longitudinal plasma oscillations to transverse electromagnetic waves by means of random inhomogeneities in electron density. It appears unlikely that charged particles whose velocity is much less than the r. m. s. thermal velocity of the coronal electrons will excite plasma oscillations. Charged particles whose velocity is much greater than the r. m. s. thermal velocity excite oscillations in a band of frequencies, including frequencies above the local plasma frequency. However, qualitative arguments indicate that the noise should be concentrated in a narrow band of frequencies slightly below the local plasma frequency. Thus it is impossible to explain the Type II (slow) bursts in the manner assumed and unlikely that the Type III (fast) bursts are explainable in this manner. The transfer of energy is studied in detail and it is shown that only waves whose phase velocity is less than the directed beam of charged particles receive energy from the beam. It is shown that plasma oscillations radiate a small fraction of their energy if the electron density is not uniform. In particular, random fluctuations in density, of the amount expected in thermal equilibrium, cause about 10 [superscript - 5] of the plasma-oscillation energy to be radiated; the remainder is dissipated by short-range collisions. Larger fluctuations than this are likely, and hence more energy should be radiated. II. A Field Analysis of the M Type Backward Wave Oscillator. A field theory of electron beams focused by crossed electric and magnetic fields is given. The theory is basic {{to the understanding of the}} small signal behavior of crossed field electron devices. It is applied to explain the <b>slipping</b> <b>stream,</b> or diocotron, effect as a coupling of two surface waves of the electron beam, and to derive the start oscillation conditions of the M-type backward wave oscillator. It is found that the <b>slipping</b> <b>stream</b> effect can reduce the starting current by an appreciable factor. The results are compared with the thin beam theory which neglects space charge effects. An analysis of a loaded strip transmission line is given, from which a method of representing space harmonic slow wave circuits by a surface admittance boundary condition is obtained. Forward and backward space harmonic interaction may be treated equally well...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPost-combustion CO 2 capture {{technologies}} tested above âˆ¼ 20 MWe on {{flue gas}} <b>slip</b> <b>streams</b> from {{coal-fired power plants}} are thus far exclusively aqueous solutions of amines or ammonia. These near-term technologies, when combined with compression to pipeline pressures, impose a âˆ¼ 25 - 30 % load on a coal-fired power plant and nearly double the cost of electricity. Much of this increase {{is due to the}} relatively low CO 2 concentration and ambient conditions of flue gas, which poses an inherently difficult separation. Nonetheless, this relatively high energy and monetary cost provides an incentive for the development of next generation lower-energy and lower-cost capture processes. Since 2006, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has had an active program to review and conduct due diligence on emerging post-combustion CO 2 capture technologies. Using this knowledgebase, we critically review and analyze the status of the broad spectrum of next generation technologies, including solvents, adsorbents, membranes, and other capture processes. This effort spans some 125 post-combustion capture technologies and is part of EPRI's on-going effort to understand the landscape of CO 2 capture technologies, to identify research gaps, and to accelerate relevant research fields. We use the taxonomy of technology readiness level (TRL) to rank and classify the landscape of CO 2 capture technologies. We provide overview results of this ranking exercise and show how the findings will be used by EPRI and the utility industry to better identify opportunities to accelerate the development cycle and to anticipate the timing of major pilots and eventual commercial offerings. This analysis also leads us to several important insights, especially for capture technologies applied at power plant scales...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically {{the combined}} consequences of electromagnetohydrodynamic forces and interfacial <b>slip</b> on <b>streaming</b> potential mediated pressuredriven flow in a microchannel. Going beyond traditional Debye-Huckel limit, we first derive a closed-form analytical solution for velocity field by considering nonlinear electrical potential distribution, wall slip effects, externally imposed transverse magnetic field, and laterally applied electric {{field in the}} plane of flow. The effects of electrical double-layer (EDL) formation and the consequent interfacial phenomena are critically examined under such situations. An expression for induced streaming potential in the microchannel is deduced considering EDL formation {{and the consequences of}} finite conductance of the immobilized Stern layer. This simplified analytical expression is later on critically assessed against three-dimensional simulation paradigm of streaming potential mediated flows, which is a first effort of this kind. We demonstrate that flow rate increases progressively with increasing surface potential and eventually approaches to a limiting value. Combination of electromagnetohydrodynamic effect with liquid slip is shown to amplify the flow rate, even at lower values of surface potential. Our study brings out the possibility of achieving an optimum flow rate by judicious application of combined electromagnetohydrodynamics. The present analysis has significant consequence in the design of advanced microfluidic devices with improved efficiency and functionality...|$|R
