5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E

His first film role was a bit part in the 1962 adaptation of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner starring Tom Courtenay and he also acted on-stage opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in Semi-Detached (1962) by David Turner. He appeared in several episodes of the BBC police series Z-Cars in 1963–64 as a detective constable. Between 1964 and 1966, he starred in two series of the ABC Weekend Television/ITV production Redcap, playing the hard-nosed military policeman Sergeant John Mann.

In 1967 he appeared in the Granada TV/ITV series, Inheritance, alongside James Bolam and Michael Goodliffe, as well as appearing in TV plays such as The Talking Head and episodes of series such as Budgie, where he played against type (opposite Adam Faith) as an effeminate failed playwright with a full beard and a Welsh accent.|$|E

Ringo Starr was the first to leave, as he said he could not stomach the food; McCartney {{departed}} in mid-March, while Harrison and Lennon were more interested in Indian religion and remained until April. According to the author Geoffrey Giuliano, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed after hearing rumours that the Maharishi had behaved inappropriately towards women who accompanied the Beatles to India, though McCartney and Harrison later discovered this to be untrue and Lennon's wife Cynthia reported there was [...] "not a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> evidence or justification".|$|E

500|$|The College Dropout {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times dubbed it [...] "2004's first great hip-hop album". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised its [...] "substance, social commentary, righteous anger, ornery humanism, dark humor, and even Christianity", calling it [...] "one of those wonderful crossover albums {{that appeal to}} a huge audience without sacrificing a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> integrity". Dave Heaton of PopMatters called the album [...] "musically engaging", writing that [...] "every single one of these songs comes off like a genuine extension of Kanye's personality and experiences". URB wrote that the album [...] "manages to be both visceral and emotive, sprinkling the dancefloors with tears and sweat." [...] Mojo dubbed the album [...] "manna for hip hop fans starved of basic but ballistic beats-and-breaks fare in an increasingly litigious age." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Elaine Marley has garnered a positive reception from critics within {{the video game}} industry. Described by GameSpot as {{the impetus for the}} whole series, critics lauded Elaine's non-conformity to the damsel in distress stereotype. GameSpot noted that Elaine is usually much more proficient at escaping trouble [...] "than the so-called hero who comes to save her", while the video game culture journal Eludamos approved of the character for allowing a level of [...] "feminine expression which did not necessary always conform to passive ideals of the damsel in distress". The website That Guy with the Glasses put Elaine as the eighth best female character in gaming, describing her as possibly the only staple character in the series to have [...] "a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> sanity and smarts", praising the character's independence and resilience as well as noting that as a woman in the Golden Age of Piracy, Elaine has risen to a position of power far above what would be historically considered normal for the time.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{the agents}} visit Boggs in prison, where he makes an impassioned revelation about the kidnapped couple {{based on a}} piece of [...] "evidence" [...] that is really a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> Mulder's T-shirt. Satisfied that he is lying, the pair prepare to leave. Scully looks back at Boggs and sees another vision of her father, {{speaking}} to her and singing the song that had been played at his funeral, [...] "Beyond the Sea". She does not tell Mulder about this, and the pair discuss the possibility that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with a partner to avoid execution. They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found, hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice. He does not fall for the trick, but gives the agents vague clues about the case. Scully, acting on these, first finds a warehouse where the couple had been held, and later leads Mulder and several other agents to a boathouse where the kidnapper is holding the couple. The girl is rescued, but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|Lennon became {{convinced}} that the Maharishi, {{who said he was}} celibate, had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a [...] "lecherous womaniser". [...] According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made [...] "sexual advances" [...] towards her. However, Cynthia Lennon said she thought Mardas had put the [...] "young and impressionable" [...] girl up to it. Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, {{many of the people who}} were there, including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> evidence or justification." [...] Likewise McCartney said [...] "It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation and I think that it was completely untrue".|$|E
500|$|... "Listen" [...] scored {{generally}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics.

Describing the song as a [...] "devastatingly beautiful ballad", Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote, [...] "Beyoncé delivers {{the performance of}} her career, another defining moment in the brilliant flick [...]" [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted that the song [...] "adds grit and touching gravity to Deena". Another reviewer of the same publication called the song [...] "epic" [...] noting that Beyoncé [...] "unfurls the true range of her magnificent voice". Comparing the song to Andrew Lloyd Webber's [...] "piano weepie", a writer of The Observer stated that [...] "Listen" [...] is a [...] "bangers-to-ballads ratio to die for". Calling the song a [...] "showstopper", Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote: [...] " [...] is a big, soppy ballad that will move some to tears and irk others as a stunning example of art imitating life imitating art without a <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> irony." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "Listen" [...] will undoubtedly be [...] "the payoff for fans of Beyoncé's voice who sat through the first [...] minutes of [...] waiting for the cum shot." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen's review for Entertainment Weekly was less impressed, describing [...] "Listen" [...] as [...] "gloopy" [...] and [...] "an inspirational ballad about 'the song in my heart', which builds to an enormous schlock-opera climax".|$|E

ASR consists of glass, fiber, rubber, automobile liquids, plastics and dirt. ASR is sometimes differentiated into shredder light fraction and dust.
