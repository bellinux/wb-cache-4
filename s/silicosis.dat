5|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} is another {{significant}} risk factor. <b>Silicosis</b> {{increases the risk}} about 30-fold. Those who smoke cigarettes have nearly twice the risk of TB compared to nonsmokers.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} no {{documented}} cases of <b>silicosis</b> developed from exposure to volcanic ash. However, long-term studies necessary to evaluate these effects are lacking.|$|E
5|$|Silicon {{is present}} in silatrane, a highly toxic rodenticide. Long-term {{inhalation}} of silica dust causes <b>silicosis,</b> a fatal disease of the lungs. Silicon is an essential trace element. Silicone gel {{can be applied to}} badly burned patients to reduce scarring.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause <b>silicosis.</b> Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for <b>silicosis.</b> The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{she worked}} on the family farm and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper. Her mother {{died of cancer in}} 1924. Pat, who was 12 at the time, assumed all the {{household}} duties for her father (who died in 1929 of <b>silicosis)</b> and two older brothers, William Jr. (1910–1997) and Thomas (1911–1992). She also had a half-sister, Neva Bender (born 1909), and a half-brother, Matthew Bender (born 1907), from her mother's first marriage; her mother's first husband had died during a flash flood in South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of <b>silicosis</b> in occupational studies (for {{people who work in}} mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Guideline values have been created for exposure, but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50µg/m3 and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50µg/m3. It is thought that the guidelines on {{exposure levels}} could be exceeded for short periods of time without significant health effects on the general population.|$|E
5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a hydro-electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of <b>silicosis.</b> The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for coal miners.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in charge}} of the Constantinople hospital, he {{attempted}} to elope with one of his patients, but was captured and tried for breach of conduct, as the female patient was in fact the wife of a Turkish officer. While being deported to Canada, Harrison escaped while his ship was docked in Morocco. Making his way to Ireland, Harrison posed as a Catholic and joined the Free State Army. After he was discovered, he quickly crossed to Wales to treat the coal miners there for <b>silicosis.</b> In 1923 Harrison married his fourth wife, Eva Olwen Bowen in Cardiff, still without divorcing his three previous wives, and set off with her on an adventure in the Caribbean. It is thought that Harrison deserted her sometime in the mid-1920s. During the 1930s Harrison worked in 15 countries and dependencies across Latin America and the Middle East. For one year, he served as the physician for a guerrilla army fighting the Japanese, who were then engaged in the Second Sino-Japanese War with China. After 1938, Harrison traveled to Shanghai using borrowed funds from a medical school classmate in Jamaica and from his own brother in Ontario, and set up a private medical practice, assisting the Chinese Red Cross wherever possible.|$|E
5|$|Total {{production}} of slate in Wales declined from 54,000tons in 1958 to 22,000tons in 1970. The Diffwys quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1955 after almost {{two centuries of}} operation. The nearby Votty and Bowydd quarries closed in 1963. In 1969, the Dinorwig Quarry was closed, and over 300 quarrymen lost their jobs. The following year the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley and the Braichgoch Slate Mine near Corris announced their closure. The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1971, but was later reopened by another company. By 1972, {{the number of men}} employed in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1,000. There was little alternative employment in the slate-producing areas, and the closures resulted in high unemployment and a drop in population as younger people moved away to find work. In 1979, after a long struggle, the government recognized <b>silicosis</b> as an industrial disease meriting compensation. There was an increase in demand for slate in the 1980s, and although this came too late for many quarries there was still some production in the Blaenau Ffestiniog area at the Oakeley, Llechwedd and Cwt-y-Bugail quarries, though the bulk of roofing slate production was at the Penrhyn Quarry. Further mechanization was introduced, with a computerized laser beam being used to aid the sawing of the slate blocks.|$|E
25|$|According to CDC data, <b>silicosis</b> in the United States is {{relatively}} rare. The incidence of deaths due to <b>silicosis</b> declined by 84% between 1968 and 1999, and only 187 deaths in 1999 had <b>silicosis</b> as the underlying or contributing cause. Additionally, cases of <b>silicosis</b> in Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio are highly correlated to industry and occupation.|$|E
25|$|Recently, <b>silicosis</b> in Turkish denim sandblasters was {{detected}} {{as a new}} cause of <b>silicosis</b> due to recurring, poor working conditions.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{complications}} of <b>silicosis</b> also include Chronic Bronchitis and airflow limitation (indistinguishable from that caused by smoking), non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection, fungal lung infection, compensatory emphysema, and pneumothorax. There are some data revealing {{an association between}} <b>silicosis</b> and certain autoimmune diseases, including nephritis, Scleroderma, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, especially in acute or accelerated <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silica flour {{is nearly}} pure SiO2 finely ground. Silica flour {{has been used}} as a {{polisher}} or buffer, as well as paint extender, abrasive, and filler for cosmetics. Silica flour has been associated with all types of <b>silicosis,</b> including acute <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The herbal extract tetrandrine may slow {{progression}} of <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicosis</b> {{resulted}} in 46,000 deaths in 2013 down from 55,000 deaths in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Protective {{measures}} such as respirators have brought a steady decline in death rates due to <b>silicosis</b> in Western countries. However, {{this is not true}} of less developed countries where work conditions are poor and respiratory equipment is seldom used. For instance, life expectancy for silver miners in Potosí, Bolivia is around 40 years due to <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicosis</b> {{resulted}} in 46,000 deaths globally in 2013 down from 55,000 deaths in 1990.|$|E
25|$|For acute <b>silicosis,</b> {{bronchoalveolar lavage}} may {{alleviate}} symptoms, {{but does not}} decrease overall mortality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicosis</b> {{is seen in}} horses {{associated}} with inhalation of dust from certain cristobalite-containing soils in California.|$|E
25|$|He also forced {{adoption}} of water hydrants {{to lay the}} dust created by mining drills, {{the main cause of}} <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{observations}} on industry workers in Lucknow (India), experiments on rats found that jaggery (a traditional sugar) had a preventive action against <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic simple <b>silicosis</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to occur from environmental exposures to silica in regions with high silica soil content and frequent dust storms.|$|E
25|$|Inhaling finely divided {{crystalline}} silica is toxic {{and can lead}} to <b>silicosis,</b> bronchitis, lung cancer, and systemic autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Regulations restricting silica {{exposure}} 'with {{respect to}} the <b>silicosis</b> hazard' specify that they are concerned only with silica, which is both crystalline and dust-forming.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicosis</b> {{is due to}} {{deposition}} of fine respirable dust (less than 10 micrometers in diameter) containing crystalline silicon dioxide {{in the form of}} alpha-quartz, cristobalite, or tridymite.|$|E
25|$|Social realist artist Noel Counihan {{depicted}} men {{who worked}} in industrial mines in Australia in the 1940s dying of <b>silicosis</b> in his series of six prints, 'The miners' (1947 linocuts).|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, OSHA officially {{mandated}} that companies must provide certain safety measures for employees {{who work with}} or around silica, {{in order to prevent}} <b>silicosis,</b> lung cancer, and other silica-related diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicosis</b> (particularly {{the acute}} form) is {{characterized}} by shortness of breath, cough, fever, and cyanosis (bluish skin). It may often be misdiagnosed as pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pneumonia, or tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The name <b>silicosis</b> (from the Latin silex, or flint) was {{originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic hammer drill was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{characteristics}} in sperm heads allow {{the selection of}} spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Likewise, zona imaging uses birefringence on oocytes to select the ones with highest chances of successful pregnancy. Birefringence of particles biopsied from pulmonary nodules indicates <b>silicosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicosis</b> (previously miner's phthisis, grinder's asthma, potter's rot {{and other}} occupation-related names) {{is a form}} of {{occupational}} lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis.|$|E
25|$|Inhaling finely divided {{crystalline}} silica dust {{can lead to}} <b>silicosis,</b> bronchitis, or lung cancer, as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates the tissue, reducing lung capacities. It {{increases the risk of}} systemic autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis compared to expected rates in the general population.|$|E
25|$|Because of work-exposure to silica dust, <b>silicosis</b> is an {{occupational}} hazard to mining, sandblasting, quarry, ceramics and foundry workers, {{as well as}} grinders, stone cutters, refractory brick workers, tombstone workers, pottery workers, fiberglass manufacturing, flint knappers and others. Brief or casual exposure to low levels of crystalline silica dust are said to not produce clinically significant lung disease.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza's health {{began to}} fail in 1676, {{and he died}} on 20 February 1677 {{at the age of}} 44. His {{premature}} death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly <b>silicosis</b> as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses that he ground. Later, a shrine was made of his home in The Hague.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} occupational hazards associated with mining, including exposure to rockdust {{which can lead}} to diseases such as <b>silicosis,</b> asbestosis, and pneumoconiosis. Gases in the mine can lead to asphyxiation and could also be ignited. Mining equipment can generate considerable noise, putting workers at risk for hearing loss. Cave-ins, rock falls, and exposure to excess heat are also known hazards.|$|E
