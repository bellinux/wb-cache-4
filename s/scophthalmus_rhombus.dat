50|$|The brill, <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus,</b> is {{a species}} of {{flatfish}} in the turbot family (Scophthalmidae) of the order Pleuronectiformes. Brill {{can be found in}} the northeast Atlantic, Baltic Sea, and Mediterranean, primarily in deeper offshore waters.|$|E
50|$|Brill have slender bodies, brown {{covered with}} lighter and darker {{coloured}} flecks, excluding the tailfin; {{the underside of}} the fish is usually cream coloured or pinkish white. Like other flatfish the brill has the ability to match its colour to the surroundings. Brill weigh up to 8 kg and can reach a length of 75 cm, but are less than half that on average. Part of the dorsal fin of the fish is not connected to the fin membrane, giving the fish a frilly appearance. They are sometimes confused with the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), which is more diamond-shaped. The two species are related and can produce hybrids.On the west coast of Canada (outside the range of <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus)</b> local fisherman refer to the petrale sole, Eopsetta jordani, as brill.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{characterize}} sperm quality and to quantify seasonal changes in sexual hormone (testosterone [T], 11 -ketotestosterone [11 -KT] and 17, 20 β-dihydroxypregn- 4 -en- 3 -one [17, 20 β-P]) levels in male brill (<b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus)</b> plasma, as well as to test a more intensive sampling strategy to establish relationships between sex steroid levels and sperm production parameters. Sperm concentration ranged from 0. 5 to 3. 1 × 109 spermatozoa mL- 1, and changes in sperm quality parameters depending on sampling date were observed. Plasma sexual steroid levels remained high and changed in parallel during the spawning season and afterwards decreased to very low levels in summer. The analysis of annual changes of 11 -KT and T ratios suggests that 11 -KT can be the main circulating androgen for stimulating spermatogenesis in S. rhombus and that T could be involved in the beginning of spermatogenesis through the positive feedback on brain-pituitary-gonad axis. Finally, daily 11 -KT and T levels showed similar patterns of variation in males sampled, whereas 17, 20 β-P amounts showed somewhat opposite trends. These differences could be related with the different role of androgens and progestin during the spermatogenesis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B. V.

40|$|Lepeophtheirus thompsoni and Lepeophtheirus europaensis are two {{parasitic}} copepods naturally isolated {{on their}} sympatric hosts, i. e. turbot (Psetta maxima L.) and brill (<b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus</b> L.), respectively They {{are able to}} meet, mate and hybridize on turbot experimentally but they are naturally prevented from doing so by a strong host preference when given a choice. Theory suggests that such a pattern is possible, but only under conditions of competition for the resource. In the present study the attachment rates of the two copepods were studied experimentally under various conditions of competition, infectious dose and number of available hosts. The results suggest a greater sensitivity to competition for the generalist species L. europaensis than for the specialist L. thompsoni, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions...|$|E

If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of Belgian beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results suggest an opportunistic utilization by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Also, two strategically different feeding habits could be distinguished between the five flatfish species. Turbot and brill mainly fed on large, highly mobile prey (e. g. fish, mysids) and had a rather narrow prey spectrum, whereas plaice, dab and sole ate more benthic prey (e. g.

40|$|On sandy beach {{nursery grounds}} {{along the west}} coast of Ireland, 0 year-group turbot Scophthalmus maximus were found to consume six types of crustaceans, in {{addition}} to polychaetes. The 0 year-group brill <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus</b> fed almost exclusively on mysids, even though nine taxonomic prey groups were identified in the sediment across the investigated beaches. Both species avoided non-motile organisms such as gastropods and bivalves, which were present in high abundances in the sediment and their growth and condition was not significantly related to the quantity or type of prey consumed, temperature or salinity. A high incidence of feeding was detected for both species over the duration of the study, suggesting that food was not limiting on west of Ireland nursery grounds. Temporal partitioning of settlement was detected between S. maximus and S. rhombus, indicating that inter-specific competition for food does not occur between these two flatfish species on west of Ireland nursery grounds...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the P. schlosseri organic mucus extract (extracted with the polar solvent ethanol and {{non-polar}} solvents DMSO) exhibited greater potent inhibitory activity against both bacterial and fungal pathogens than the aqueous mucus extract against human pathogens tested. Earlier, Subramanian et al. (2008) also reported low microbial growth inhibition in aqueous fish mucus extracts {{of a wider}} range of fish species including Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), koi carp (Cyprinus carpio), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) could be due to the presence of low levels of enzymes. In contradiction, this strong inhibitory effect of aqueous mucus extract was reported from various eel fishes Anguilla linnaeus and Mastacembelus armatus (Bragadeeswaran & Thangaraj, 2011; Uthayakumar, Ramasubramanian, Senthilkumar, Brindha, & Harikrishnan, 2012). Hellio et al. (2002) reported that fish (Pollachius virens, Labrus bergylta, <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus,</b> Platichthys flesus, and Solea solea) mucus extracted with ethanol and DMSO (organic extract) showed strong bactericidal activity against a broad range of pathogens. The {{results of the present study}} also indicated that the proteinaceous substances in the mucus of P. schlosseri, extracted using organic solvents, had most active antimicrobial components.|$|E
40|$|In the North Sea, turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and brill (<b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus)</b> {{represent}} highly valuable {{species in}} commercial fisheries. Still, available data for both species are limited, making stock assessment difficult. Long-term fisheries data {{have the potential}} to improve the understanding of stock dynamics such as long-term distribution changes or development in species' abundances. Historical British otter trawler lpue (landings-per-unit-effort) data from 1923 to 2009, and at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles, revealed that the distribution patterns of turbot and brill were different for most of the 20 th century and only became similar in the recent decade. Further, between the 1920 s and 1960 s, turbot was commonly caught in the northern North Sea and in particular on Turbot Bank, at that time a turbot hotspot off the east coast of Scotland. Within a short time period turbot nearly disappeared from this region. Brill, in contrast, revealed a stable distribution in the southern and central North Sea with a slow expansion into the central North Sea. We used survey cpue (catch-per-unit-effort) from the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS; 1970 – 2009) and the Beam Trawl Survey (BTS; 1985 – 2009), as well as British otter trawler lpue, as proxies for the abundance of adult turbot and brill. Commercial lpue suggested for brill and turbot a long-term decrease in abundance. IBTS cpue suggested an increase in abundance for turbot, but this was not confirmed by the BTS. For brill, both surveys did not show a clear trend...|$|E
40|$|The {{diets and}} the trophic niche overlap between seven {{flatfish}} species were studied in a coastal nursery adjoining to the Tagus estuary (Portugal). Fish were sampled monthly, from March to November 1999, using a beach seine. Arnoglossus imperialis (Rafinesque, 1810), Arnoglossus laterna (Walbaum, 1792) and Arnoglossus thori Kyle, 1913, fed mainly on crustaceans. The diets of Buglossidium luteum (Risso, 1810) and Dicologoglossa cuneata (Moreau, 1881) were mainly composed of Bivalvia and Polychaeta, while for <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus</b> (Linnaeus, 1758) the main food items were Mysidacea and Teleostei. The diet of Pegusa lascaris (Risso, 1810) was mainly composed by Cumacea, Bivalvia, Decapoda and Amphipoda. Based on diet similarities two main groups were identified: one composed of A. imperialis, A. laterna, A. thori and S. rhombus, {{and the other}} grouping B. luteum, P. lascaris and D. cuneata. For the most common flatfishes, a similar pattern of diet seasonal variation was found, such that Amphipoda presented higher indices values in the period from March to June, while from July to November, Decapoda were more abundant. Although high values of diet overlap were obtained {{among some of the}} species, the main items in the diet of flatfishes are probably the most abundant prey in this coastal area, which suggests a generalist and opportunistic utilization of these food resources. Furthermore, niche overlap between these species is probably minimized by differences in resource use in other niche dimensions, namely time and space...|$|E
40|$|Genetic maps {{constitute}} valuable {{tools to}} detect genomic regions associated with complex traits {{and to go}} forward to understand their genetic basis. Flatfish include several species of great commercial value for which increasing genomic resources are available including genetic maps and EST databases. Application of comparative mapping strategies to flatfish is relevant to obtain genetic information associated with productive traits. The brill (<b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus)</b> is a flatfish species closely related to turbot (S. maximus) whose meat is highly appreciated in the Spanish market. The Junta de Andalucia local Government has begun a program to adapt this species to captivity for its future production. In this study, we developed the first genetic map of brill using the current turbot genetic map as starting point. This strategy enabled us to select a number of homogeneously distributed markers in the turbot map and to apply cross-species microsatellite amplification to obtain informative markers. Nearly two hundred microsatellites from the framework turbot map were used for validation, and 100 markers were finally informative for mapping. The parents and offspring of the two families (54 and 88, respectively) used to construct the genetic map were genotyped with this panel. All markers, except eleven, were successfully grouped and ordered in 24 linkage groups. Linkage groups and order of markers were highly consistent with the previous turbot genetic map. Linkage map information was used {{to carry out a}} preliminary study on growth-related QTL for body weight, length and Fulton's condition factor in the two families, as the main phenotypic traits of interest in this species.

40|$|Monthly {{samples were}} taken in the surf zone of sandy beaches along the Belgian coast from May 1996 until July 1997 at four {{selected}} stations. Temporal patterns of the macrocrustacean and fish species residing the surf zone were investigated, {{as well as the}} abiotic variables structuring the community. In total 34 species were recorded belonging to caridean shrimps (3), anomuran and brachyuran crabs (5), cephalopods (2) and fish (24). The brown shrimp Crangon crangon dominated almost all samples (> 80 %). Total densities often exceeded 400 ind per 100 m², and if C. crangon was excluded 10 ind per 100 m². Notwithstanding the harsh hydrodynamic conditions, the surf zone of Belgian sandy beaches is used intensively by a number of epibenthic macro-crustaceans and demersal fish species. Seven resident and ten migrant species were identified. As mainly juvenile fishes were present, the surf zone of the Belgian sandy beaches may act as a nursery for longer (e. g. plaice Pleuronectes platessa) or shorter (e. g. brill <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus)</b> periods. However, its nursery function should be studied in more detail, since the highly dynamic circumstances and more specifically wave height and wind speed may be important structuring factors for the epibenthic communities. The surf zone of Belgian sandy beaches also seems to function as a transient area to other nurseries (e. g. bass Dicentrarchus labrax) or between a nursery and the true marine environment (e. g. dab Limanda limanda). Temporal variation in community structure was greatly masked by spatial differences between sites. Although variables such as salinity and hydrodynamic factors may have influenced the data, clear temperature-related, seasonal patterns occur. Most likely, extreme winter conditions and subsequent migration of organisms to deeper waters caused a decline in winter in both density and diversity...|$|E
40|$|Coastal bays provide {{habitats}} for juveniles {{and adults}} of many marine species. Mont Saint-Michel Bay (MSMB, France) hosts a highly diversified fish community and constitutes {{one of the}} most important nursery grounds for many commercially exploited marine species, such as sea bass, flatfish, clupeids and rays in the English Channel. Besides, MSMB also suffers from the massive invasion of an exotic mollusc, the American slipper-limpet (Crepidula fornicata, L). This species arrived four decades ago and now represents the main filter-feeder biomass in the bay (150 Mt), an order of magnitude larger than local farmed and natural shellfishes. Recent analyses underlined the impact of this small gastropod on the trophic structure of this bay and its negative influence on juvenile sole densities in the nursery grounds. The present study uses a geostatistical approach to explore the effect of the extension of the slipper-limpet on flatfish (common sole Solea solea, L plaice Pleuronectes platessa, L brill <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus,</b> L and flounder Platichthys flesus, L) spatial distribution. Data collected during survey of the MSMB at the end of the 1970 s and three decades later have been used to build interpolated maps of (1) slipper-limpet and (2) flatfish spatial distributions. Slipper-limpets were concentrated in a small area, in the western part of the MSMB, in the 1970 s while today they occupy half of the bay. This rapid proliferation led to the decrease of available surface for flatfishes, which previously occupied the whole bay and are now restricted to its eastern part. The present study highlighted that the negative influence on fish habitat in MSMB is apparently more related to changes in the substratum than to trophic interactions. This invasion has possible consequences on flatfish population renewal at a large scale and may also damage other benthic or demersal species, such as rays...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Engenharia Biológica, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2015 The skin, {{the largest}} organ of fish’s body and first barrier against {{external}} agents, plays {{a crucial role}} against environmental aggressions and is decisive in communication between individuals. Cutaneous lesions are common in fish and may result in an open door for infectious agents and originate osmotic stress, which can be life threatening for the animal. Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and brill (<b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus)</b> are two closely related congeneric species with striking differences in their skin, since turbot presents tubercles instead of the scales found in brill. In this work, gene expression analyses were performed in order to analyze the genetic differences in the skin response between the two species. Skin scraping areas (72 h after injury) from three biological replicates of each species were compared with normal skin areas from the same individuals. A previously reported 4 x 44 k Agilent turbot microarray was employed, after evaluating its suitability by comparison of the base sequence of common genes using bioinformatics. Skin-related genes from previous studies (1564 sequences) were taken as a reference to screen the turbot database and the oligo-probes in the microarray. Among them, 584 (~ 37 %) were present in the turbot database (e-value 200 fluorescence units) were identified in each (turbot: 15, 739; brill: 12, 393) and in both species (10, 065). Among them, 1750 differentially expressed genes (t-test p-value p 2) were detected in brill, 1461 in turbot, and 885 showed differences between species, respectively. These results strongly suggest: 1) the turbot microarray is suitable for gene expression analysis in brill, and 2) a notable different occurs in the response of the skin to damage in the two species...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{flatfish}} {{captured in}} demersal fisheries {{along the west}} coast of Ireland include quota species such as plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), in addition to high value non-quota species, turbot (Psetta maxima L.) and brill (<b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus</b> L.). Important non-commercial angling species of interest include flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). However, knowledge of the population dynamics of these flatfishes along {{the west coast of}} Ireland is lacking, and considered to be inadequate for the establishment of any population trends. In light of this, habitats along the west coast of Ireland serving as nursery grounds for the juveniles of these species were investigated (2000 - 2009). Correctly distinguishing between pairs of recently settled flatfish species, which are morphologically similar in appearance, was a prerequisite to this research. Counts of the meristic characters, fin rays, which are species specific, proved to be a reliable identification tool for juveniles. Plaice were the most abundant flatfish species present on nursery grounds, followed by turbot, {{and to a lesser extent}} brill. Assessment of nursery grounds over the eight year period, revealed both inter-annual and spatial variability in the relative abundance, growth, and condition of plaice, turbot and brill. Certain trends were revealed in these parameters, indicating the existence of both high and low quality nursery habitats. Abundances of both plaice and turbot on nursery grounds were negatively correlated with sea water temperatures during the pelagic stage. Baseline data on the timing of critical events, including hatching, larval durations, and settlement, in addition to growth experienced during early life, were established from the otolith microstructure of turbot. Post-settlement growth rate estimates of turbot also indicated certain locations as high quality nurseries. The feeding ecology of juvenile turbot and brill on nursery grounds was described, with temporal and resource partitioning revealed, implying that competition is unlikely to arise between these two morphologically similar species. A high incidence of prey was observed in the gut content of all turbot and brill, suggesting that food was not limited on Irish nursery grounds. Turbot fed on a much wider range of prey in contrast to brill, which fed almost exclusively on one prey organism. This observation may be one reason for the general sparse distribution of brill. The improved understanding of the early life history of plaice, turbot and brill may aid in the development and implementation of effective management strategies in the future; at the very least for the protection of important nursery grounds, as any loss, or decline in the quantity or quality of these areas, will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the recruitment of these species...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} study on the epi- and hyperbenthic fauna of the surf zone of sandy beaches of the Belgian coast. Therefore, as a first {{objective}} of this thesis, {{a lot of attention}} has been paid to the inventarisation (species composition), and to the investigation of the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of both communities. A temporal and a spatial campaign were performed during which the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled. During the temporal campaign monthly samples were taken at 4 selected stations and the spatial campaign involved sampling of 12 stations along the Belgian coast. All in all, the surf zone of the Belgian coast is a habitat for a considerable number of species. The surf zone harbours a rich hyperbenthic fauna and also the epibenthic assemblage is diverse. Total hyper- and epibenthic densities were comparable or even higher than those of the adjacent, subtidal regions. It seems that the Belgian surf zone can be seen as an extension of the rich shallow sand bank system in front of the coast. Differences in total hyperbenthic densities with other European sandy beaches might be linked to the degree of exposure. An attempt was made to elucidate the major environmental variables structuring the communities. Therefore several environmental variables were measured at the moments of sampling. Different uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used for the analyses of the data. Although clear temperature-related seasonal distribution patterns were observed, the hyper- and epibenthic communities of the surf zone can also be influenced severely by hydrodynamic factors and this both by short-term events (e. g. storm) and long-term effects (influence on morpho- dynamics of the beach). Spatial differences were found both in species richness and in density. In general, highest hyper- and epibenthic densities were found on flat, wide beaches, but also intermediate sites and sites with a high turbidity were characterised with high densities and a high number of species. Although clear distribution patterns could be observed, the much lower densities of the epibenthos compared to the hyperbenthos, might require a higher sampling effort with replicate sampling in future research. Furthermore, this study indicates that both intertidal and subtidal characteristics should be considered if the (mobile) surf zone fauna is investigated. Stomach/gut content analyses were performed on five common flatfish fish species from epibenthic samples taken during the temporal campaign in order to unravel part of the surf zone food web. Additional fish were obtained from commercial fishermen. Prey items of all species included hyperbenthic (e. g. mysids), endobenthic (e. g. polychaetes) and epibenthic (e. g. shrimps) species. Little dietary overlap was observed. If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of the studied beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results confirm the opportunistic utilisation by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Such opportunistic utilisation of food resources can be important for teleosts frequenting physically stressed environments such as surf-exposed beaches. The diets of turbot Scophthalmus maximus and brill <b>Scophthalmus</b> <b>rhombus</b> reveal part of the main interactions between the hyper- and epibenthos, whereas those of plaice Pleuronectes platessa, dab Limanda limanda and sole Solea solea reveal important links between the epibenthos and the macro-endobenthos within the local surf zone food web. Three 24 -hours sampling cycles were performed to study short term migration patterns. Again the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled alternatingly each hour. Stomach content analyses were performed on juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa of the first 24 h-cycle (spring tide). Possible interactions between the epi- and hyperbenthic organisms are discussed. Despite the turbulent conditi...|$|E
