500|$|The tigress is a <b>solid-cast</b> {{statuette}} weighing [...] {{and measuring}} [...] {{from head to}} tail. She {{was designed to be}} soldered onto some other object as its handle; traces of tin were found beneath her rear paws, which have a [...] "smoothly concave curve". She looks most aesthetically pleasing when the serpentine curves of her head, back, rump, and tail form a line at an angle of about 45°, when the rear paws are flat, allowing for their curve. Her gender is obvious as there are six engorged teats under her belly. She is carefully decorated on her back, but her underside is [...] "quite perfunctorily finished". Her stripes are represented by two engraved lines, with a black niello inlay between them, in most places not meeting the engraved lines. Neither her elongated body, nor the distribution of the stripes are accurate for the species; she has a long dorsal stripe running from the skull along the spine {{to the start of the}} tail, which is typical of tabby cats rather than tigers. The figure has no stripes around her tail, which thickens at the end, suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion's tail, which tigers do not have, although Roman art usually gives them one.|$|E
5000|$|He had {{a long-standing}} {{relationship}} with sponsor Tom Arter, riding his Arter-AJS (350cc) and Arter-Matchless (500cc) machines which were later developed with special lightweight frames, disc brakes and six-spoke, <b>solid-cast</b> (non wire-spoked) Elektron wheels dubbed [...] "cart wheels" [...] and artillery wheels by the UK press.|$|E
50|$|The inventions of Jean Maritz gave {{perfectly}} straight bores {{which could}} perfectly fit the ball diameter, and therefore vastly increase efficiency. In the horizontal method developed by Maritz, the <b>solid-cast</b> cannon itself was revolved horizontally, while the drill remained static, in a method {{similar to that}} of a lathe.|$|E
5000|$|The Harley-Davidson FLSTF Fat Boy is a V-twin {{motorcycle}} {{and one of}} {{the best}} selling models produced by Harley-Davidson. Designed by Willie G. Davidson and Louie Netz, their prototype Fat Boy was built for the Daytona Bike Week rally in Daytona Beach in 1988 and 1989. [...] The Fat Boy is unusual for having <b>solid-cast</b> disc wheels.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{installation}} of a mortise lock actually weakens {{the structure of the}} typical timber door, it is stronger and more versatile than a bored cylindrical lock, both in external trim, and functionality. Whereas the latter mechanism lacks the architecture required for ornate and <b>solid-cast</b> knobs and levers, the mortise lock can accommodate a heavier return spring and a more solid internal mechanism, making its use possible. Furthermore, a mortise lock typically accepts a wide range of other manufacturers' cylinders and accessories, allowing architectural conformity with lock hardware already on site.|$|E
5000|$|Changing {{the overall}} {{attitude}} of drummers concerning {{the sound of}} acrylic drums has been a focus of the review media. In 2007 articles and reviews, the magazines gave unabashed praise for the look and sound of modern acrylic drums. Superlatives like [...] "fat" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] were liberally applied. These terms are normally given to wood-shelled drums to indicate that they have abundant low and midrange frequencies. With {{the right combination of}} drumheads and tuning, acrylics don't have to sound brittle or artificial. European e-zine www.drummersdigest.com posted a very positive review of a Kirchoff Arctic series <b>solid-cast</b> acrylic kit, to include audio recordings that prove acrylics can sound as musical as other drum shell materials.|$|E

40|$|<b>Solid-cast</b> forming actinomycotic canaliculitis is an {{uncommon}} cause of unilateral chronic red eye resistant to conventional topical medical therapy. The authors report {{the history of}} a 62 -year old woman who was complaining of mucopurulent discharge from the right lower canaliculus for a period of 12 months. Culture yielded a few colonies of Actinomyces. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilation of the right lower canaliculus. The signal was hypointense and heterogeneous on both T 1 and T 2 weighted sequences. Surgery enabled removal of several solid yellowish casts and resulted in resolution of the disease. Histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of dense, basophilic conglomerates of filamentous organisms. Because rhinologists have more and more opportunities to perform surgery of the lachrymal pathway they need to be informed about this clinical entity...|$|E
