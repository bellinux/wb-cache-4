5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended {{use of the}} Magic Wand for self-treatment by patients with myalgia. They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that <b>such</b> <b>treatment</b> {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of {{selenium}} deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease. Also, selenium interacts with other minerals, such as zinc and copper. High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio and lead to Zn reduction; in <b>such</b> <b>treatment</b> cases, Zn levels should be monitored. Further {{studies are needed to}} conﬁrm these interactions.|$|E
5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of <b>such</b> <b>treatment</b> would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
50|$|Diseases {{that may}} be {{susceptible}} to <b>such</b> <b>treatments</b> include diabetes, inherited cataracts and cystic fibrosis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Such</b> <b>treatments</b> can be {{administered}} parenterally (intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly) or through inhalation of a pharmaceutically-composed aerosol.|$|R

5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to <b>such</b> <b>treatment</b> does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied <b>such</b> <b>treatment,</b> has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Kansas District Court {{granted a}} {{petition}} from Manning for a legal name change. An Army spokesman stated {{that while the}} Army would update personnel records to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male. Manning sought hormone therapy {{and the right to}} live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. <b>Such</b> <b>treatment</b> is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is not available in military prisons. The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{treatments}} {{used for}} the control or eradication of fungal infections and/or insect infestations in buildings and the residues of <b>such</b> <b>treatments</b> do not pose a proven hazard to the general population. There is, however, an apparent potential risk from <b>such</b> <b>treatments</b> and from the presence of treatment residues in treated buildings for persons who suffer from chemical sensitivity&hellip; it is concluded that further investigation and evaluation is required of alternative chemical and non chemical treatments of fungal infections and/or insect infestations in buildings.|$|R
50|$|For {{fallopian tube}} obstruction, {{alternative}} medicine {{has been used}} as a form of fertility treatment. A study of the use of alternative methods showed that only a minority of infertile couples utilize <b>such</b> <b>treatments.</b> It also showed that alternative methods are more often chosen by couples who were wealthier, have not yet achieved pregnancy, or had a belief in the effectiveness of <b>such</b> <b>treatments.</b> Of the study participants, 29% used a CAM modality for treatment, 22% used acupuncture, 17% used herbal therapies like Fuyan Pill, and 1% using meditation.|$|R
50|$|Its {{counterpart}} TCM includes other <b>such</b> <b>treatments</b> as {{herbal medicine}} (中药), acupuncture, dietary therapy, and both tui-na and shiatsu massage. Qigong and Taijiquan are also {{closely associated with}} TCM.|$|R
5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting <b>such</b> <b>treatment</b> from parents.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. <b>Such</b> <b>treatment</b> may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Such</b> <b>treatment</b> of the Christians for refusals by {{the girls}} is also {{confirmed}} in {{the accounts of}} British officer James Scurry, who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics. In his book The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry, who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years, in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib (1824), Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls, after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood. About 200 young women, the prettiest and fairest, were selected for Tipu's seraglio. The rest {{of the women were}} distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there. The future Christian progeny of these young girls and women were lost, and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today.|$|E

40|$|Prof Peter Taylor {{opened the}} {{symposium}} focussed on optimisation {{of treatment for}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at each stage of the patient’s journey. Prof Ronald van Vollenhoven reviewed the evidence for first- line biologics in the ‘exceptional patient’ and explored which patients may be suitable for <b>such</b> <b>treatments.</b> Prof Taylor then expanded on how use of <b>such</b> <b>treatments</b> could be optimised and when to introduce biologic therapy for the so-called ‘standard’ patient. Finally, Prof Daniel Aletaha discussed treatment options and targets for patients who have failed on a biologic as ‘the rule’ {{in the treatment of}} RA...|$|R
50|$|Medical {{management}} {{may involve}} immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} methotrexate, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine.

5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter {{has a history of}} high blood pressure, but this is a common problem in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation, radiation therapy to the pituitary, traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin) with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of <b>such</b> <b>treatment,</b> has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|The local Norman {{population}} {{sought refuge}} in the castle {{to escape from the}} French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non-combatants were allowed inside, increasing {{the number of people in}} the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle's supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege-lines. The idea was to keep as many people as possible within Château Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who turned back to the castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Château Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. <b>Such</b> <b>treatment</b> of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418–1419, both in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
25|$|Ryan’s {{efforts on}} {{shigellosis}} {{have focused on}} vaccine development and host-pathogen interactions. In 2006, Ryan showed that administration of antibiotics to children with shigellosis in Bangladesh did not increase toxin production by the bacterium. This finding supports targeted antimicrobial treatment of humans with shigellosis. <b>Such</b> <b>treatment</b> is usually contraindicated in humans infected with Shiga-toxin expressing E. coli infection (STEC/EHEC: enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli), in whom <b>such</b> <b>treatment</b> substantially increasing the risk of renal failure.|$|E
50|$|Antimonials, in pre-modern medicine, were {{remedies}} principally containing antimony, used chiefly for emetic purposes. They {{might also}} have qualified for cathartic, diaphoretic, or simply alternative uses. <b>Such</b> <b>treatments</b> were considered unparalleled in their strength.|$|R
