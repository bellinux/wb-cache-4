5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are <b>strong</b> <b>in</b> compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very <b>strong</b> <b>in</b> tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
