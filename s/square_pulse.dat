50|$|In general, the <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> {{is not a}} {{desirable}} waveform from a pulse compression standpoint, because the autocorrelation function is too short in amplitude, {{making it difficult to}} detect targets in noise, and too wide in time, making it difficult to discern multiple overlapping targets.|$|E

50|$|Class-D {{amplifiers}} work by {{generating a}} train of <b>square</b> <b>pulses</b> of fixed amplitude but varying width and separation, the low-frequency portion of whose frequency spectrum {{is essentially the}} signal to be amplified. The high-frequency portion serves no purpose other than to create a two level waveform. Because it has only two levels, it can be amplified by simple switching. The output of such a switch is an identical train of <b>square</b> <b>pulses,</b> except with greater amplitude. Such amplification results in a wave-form with the same frequency spectrum, but with every frequency uniformly magnified in amplitude.|$|R
50|$|Pulse-Frequency Modulation (PFM) is a {{modulation}} {{method for}} representing an analog signal using only two levels (1 and 0). It {{is analogous to}} Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM), in which the magnitude of an analog signal is encoded in the duty cycle of a square wave. Unlike PWM, in which the width of <b>square</b> <b>pulses</b> is varied at constant frequency, PFM fixes the width of <b>square</b> <b>pulses</b> while varying the frequency. In other words, {{the frequency of the}} pulse train is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal at sampling intervals. The amplitude and width of the pulses is kept constant.|$|R
50|$|The Rectiverter handles peak {{rectifier}} loads very well. The load {{peak current}} {{will be limited}} by the maximum current limitation of the AC output stage.

Rather than applying square pulses of varying widths to the inductor, <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> trains with a fixed 50% duty cycle are used to charge the inductor to a predefined current limit then discharge the inductor current to, but not below, zero. The frequency of these pulse trains is then varied to produce the desired output voltage {{with the aid of}} the output filter capacitor.|$|E

5000|$|A {{commonly}} used radar or sonar pulse is the linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulse (or [...] "chirp"). It {{has the advantage}} of greater bandwidth while keeping the pulse duration short and envelope constant. A constant envelope LFM pulse has an ambiguity function {{similar to that of the}} <b>square</b> <b>pulse,</b> except that it is skewed in the delay-Doppler plane. Slight Doppler mismatches for the LFM pulse do not change the general shape of the pulse and reduce the amplitude very little, but they do appear to shift the pulsein time. Thus, an uncompensated Doppler shift changes the target's apparent range; this phenomenon is called range-Doppler coupling.|$|E
50|$|A {{pulse forming network}} (PFN) is an {{electric}} circuit that accumulates electrical energy over a comparatively long time, then releases the stored {{energy in the form}} of a relatively <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> of comparatively brief duration for various pulsed power applications. In a PFN, energy storage components such as capacitors, inductors or transmission lines are charged by means of a high voltage power source, then rapidly discharged into a load via a high voltage switch, such as a spark gap or hydrogen thyratron. Repetition rates range from single pulses to about 104 per second. PFNs are used to produce precise nanosecond-length pulses of electricity to power devices such as klystron or magnetron tube oscillators in radar sets, pulsed lasers, particle accelerators, flashtubes, and high voltage utility test equipment.|$|E

The controls are usually potentiometers but the circuit can also be controlled by light, temperature, pressure etc. by replacing a potentiometer with a suitable sensor (e.g., photo resistor for light sensitivity). Most of the time there is also a power switch (often a toggle switch) and a volume knob. The circuit is a simple DIY noisemaker circuit that is relatively inexpensive and easy to build, easily adaptable and is configurable in many ways. It has been built into a wide variety of cases, from metal IKEA bowls to light bulbs, an old Atari mouse or joystick. Its flexibility has led to wide scale popularity among electronics enthusiasts.

40|$|Transformation of <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> {{signals by}} the {{multilayer}} Rosen type piezoelectric transformer (PT) is investigated {{with the goals}} to preserve the signal waveform and achieve maximum efficiency for power electronics and LED lighting applications. The voltage gain of the transformer is calculated from equations of linear piezoelectricity and motion for a broad frequency range that includes multiple resonant frequencies of PT. The transformation of the <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> is simulated numerically by applying the voltage gain function to the Fourier spectrum of the input signal, and then restoring the time domain output signal from its spectrum. A half bridge MOSFET amplifier is built to drive the PT in the experimental setup. The measurements of the input and output waveforms and their Fourier spectra verify the calculations. It is shown that {{the components of the}} spectrum and the waveform of the <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> signal can be preserved in the output signal by using multiple resonant frequencies of the transformer.

40|$|Using the plasmid DNA pSV 2 -neo (which, when {{integrated}} into the cellular genome confers resistance to the antibiotic G 418 for selection), we examined and compared the transfection efficiency on NIH 3 T 3 cells electropermeabilized by applying a sequence of high-frequency unipolar or bipolar square waves or a single <b>square</b> <b>pulse.</b> Results show that a bipolar square wave is, at least, 1. 7 - and 5. 5 -fold more efficient than the unipolar square wave and single <b>square</b> <b>pulse,</b> respectively. In the range of electric field strength used for optimum transfection, the survivability of electropermeabilized cells was comparable between the unipolar and bipolar square waves but fell considerably with the single <b>square</b> <b>pulse.</b> Qualitative comparison of cell permeabilization induced by {{the three types of}} wave forms and monitored by ethidium bromide uptake revealed that only the bipolar square wave permeabilizes the cell membrane symmetrically at the two hemispheres facing the electrodes. With unipolar square wave or single <b>square</b> <b>pulse,</b> the membrane is permeabilized either on one side or asymmetrically.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether it is possible to reduce a charge per pulse, which is needed for selective nerve stimulation. Simulation is performed using a two-part simulation model: a volume conductor model to calculate the electrical potential distribution inside a tripolar cuff electrode and a human fiber model to simulate the fiber response to simulation. Selective stimulation is obtained by anodal block. To obtain anodal block of large fibers, long square pulses (> 350 μs) with a relatively high currents (1 - 2. 5 mA) are usually required. These pulses might not be safe for a long-term application because of a high charge per pulse. In this study, several pulse shapes are proposed that have less charge per pulse compared with the conventional <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> and would therefore be safer in a chronic application. Compared with the conventional <b>square</b> <b>pulse,</b> it was possible to reduce the charge with all proposed pulse shapes, but the best results are obtained with a combination of a square depolarizing pulse and a blocking pulse. The charge per pulse was up to 32 % less with that pulse shape than with a <b>square</b> <b>pulse.</b> Using a hyperpolarizing anodal prepulse preceding a <b>square</b> <b>pulse,</b> it was not possible to block nerve fibers in a whole nerve bundle and to obtain reduction of a charge per phase.
