40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate sedimentation impacts on a reservoir as a result of land use during the 2009 - 10 rainfall season using hydrographic surveys and grab sampling methods at Chesa Causeway Dam in the Upper Ruya sub-catchment of Zimbabwe. Sedimentation analysis showed that the sediment specific yields at thedam were 774 t km- 2 yr- 1 using the grab sampling method and 503 t km- 2 yr- 1 obtained from hydrographic survey. The <b>storage</b> <b>ratio</b> for Chesa Causeway suggests that the dam has a very low <b>storage</b> <b>ratio</b> which implies that, at design stage, a substantial amount of available runoff has not been utilized. Projections based on currentsediment loading indicate that dam will be silted up in the next 11 years, with a useful lifespan of 30 years. This could be due to alluvial gold panning activities taking place on the upstream of the dam. The study has established that both hydrographic surveys and the grab sampling methods can be used for estimating sedimentation rates in reservoirs and, hence, facilitate informed decisions for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). The study concluded that the lifespan of reservoirs is strongly linked to upstream landuses...|$|E
30|$|The {{calculated}} gross <b>storage</b> <b>ratio</b> for Malilangwe reservoir {{was greater}} than 0.1 (calculated =  4): according to Khan et al. (2007), a gross <b>storage</b> <b>ratio</b> of greater than 0.1 means the sediment trap efficiency is 100  %. Thus, with a sediment trap efficiency of 100  %, all sediments that enter the reservoir are retained and trapped in the reservoir. A total depth of about 8.6  m or 33.1  % of storage capacity has been lost due to the sediment accumulation in the reservoir over a 48 -year period (1963 – 2011) with the current estimated maximum depth at 15.4  m from a previous of 25.75  m. The Save River catchment in Zimbabwe loses an estimated 2.6  ×  108  m 3  year− 1 of its storage capacity annually (Marshall and Maes 1994). At current sedimentation rates, the reservoir is projected to lose 16  % of its storage capacity in 100  years. With increase in land degradation in the Malilangwe reservoir catchment, the reservoir estimated life span of over 100  years will be drastically reduced unless drastic measures are taken to address the problem. Khan et al. (2007) showed that the bigger the reservoir and catchment, the better is the siltation life. All projections on storage capacity showed that the reservoir will not lose over 50  % of capacity in 100  years.|$|E

This study selected the Danjiangkou Reservoir, which is the water source for the middle route of the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) in China, as a case study, and analyzed the necessity and operational feasibility of early reservoir refill.

The relationships between reservoir yields under certain risk levels, <b>storage</b> <b>ratios</b> and the reliability of inflow, have been well established for Zimbabwe by Mitchell (1987). The deposition of eroded soil sediments in water bodies from either natural or anthropogenic impacts can result {{in the destruction of}} aquatic habitats and a reduction in the diversity and abundance of aquatic life. Diversity and population size of fish species such as Labeo altivelis and benthic macroinvertebrates associated with coarse substrates can be greatly reduced if the substrates are covered with sand and silt. Tomasson and Allanson (1983) showed that the growth rates of Barbus and Labeo sp. in Lake Le Roux, South Africa were greatly reduced when transparency of the water decreased due to increased sediment input in the lake. Moreover, increased turbidity decreases the water’s aesthetic appeal, human enjoyment of lake and reservoir recreational activities and interferes with disinfection of the water prior to it being pumped to the end-users. If the river cross-section is sufficiently reduced by sediment build-up, sedimentation can increase downstream flooding. In addition, some metal ions, pesticides and nutrients may combine with sediment particles and be transported downstream.|$|R

40|$|When {{evaluating}} the energy demand of buildings using stratified {{hot water storage}} tanks in an active demand response context, an accurate but low order storage tank model is required. Accurate modelling of buoyancy effects and mixing inside the storage tank as a result of direct inflows is key to obtain valid results. The use of one-dimensional storage tank models is common practice in building simulations, but as buoyancy and mixing are three-dimensional phenomena they cannot be incorporated directly in such a model and special formulations must be used. This paper presents a novel method for incorporating buoyancy and mixing in one-dimensional stratified storage tank models. The model parameters are derived from a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations and correlated with the appropriate non-dimensional parameters. The model is validated against an independent set of charging and discharging experiments. The model is found to represent buoyancy and mixing in the storage tank in a realistic way and to correspond well to experimental results. To allow researchers to assess the uncertainty on performance indicators in building energy simulations, an effective <b>storage</b> capacity <b>ratio</b> is defined and its variation within the model parameter uncertainty range is calculated and compared to other models.

40|$|A dynamic water {{allocation}} {{framework for}} a multipurpose, single reservoir is formulated to utilize climate information based reservoir inflow forecasts {{to quantify the}} reliability of use for the given demand. Based on the semi-parametric approach of De Souza and Lall [2003], 12 months lead retrospective reservoir inflow forecasts were developed for the period July 1990 -June 2000 for the Oros reservoir utilizing the climatic conditions available up to June of that year. Based on the actual annual demand to be supplied by the Oros reservoir for the JMH system, the utility of climate forecasts for multipurpose water allocation is assessed utilizing the adaptive forecasts developed for the period 1990 - 2000. Since Oros reservoir is a multi-year storage reservoir, the initial storage available in July of every year was adequate enough to supply water for all the uses even under zero inflow assumption thereby reducing the utility of climate forecasts during normal inflow years. On the other hand, climate information based reservoir inflow forecasts is more beneficial in meeting the annual demands of the Oros system for different uses during above-normal and below-normal inflow years than during normal inflow years. Analysis of the results suggests that the utility of climate information based reservoir inflow forecasts is more pronounced for systems with high demand to <b>storage</b> <b>ratio.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Prediction of {{saturated}} area formation {{is important for}} hydrologic modeling of watersheds with shallow, highly pervious soils. This simulation study examines {{the relative importance of}} hillslope properties and rainfall rate on the evolution {{of saturated}} source areas during wetting. The study focuses on homogeneous, nonconvergent hillslope topography with constant slope. The two-dimensional, variably saturated groundwater model VS 2 D [Healy, 1990; Lappala et al. 1993] is used to simulate saturated area formation under the action of steady uniform rainfall. The study methodology systematically varies four hillslope properties, depth to impervious layer, slope length, slope angle, and average saturated hydraulic conductivity, and the rainfall rate. Results indicate that the fraction of the hillslope length that is saturated at equilibrium is a function of a parameter F, which is defined as the rainfall rate multiplied by the slope length, divided by the slope angle, soil thickness, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The temporal evolution of saturated area is analyzed in terms of the equilibrium time. Nonlinearity in the unsaturated zone and differences in hillslope properties result in a nonunique time to equilibrium relation. The time to equilibrium is maximum when factors that tend to cause surface saturation are in approximate balance with those that tend to dissipate surface saturation. The temporal evolution of surface saturation during wetting follows a wide variety of trajectories. Equivalent hillslope soil water <b>storage</b> <b>ratios</b> on slopes with different properties can result {{in a wide range of}} surface saturation conditions.
