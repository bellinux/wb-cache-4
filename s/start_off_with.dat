Unlocking vehicles requires completing goals such as placing within the top three of any two races. If the player has previously won a certain race mission, they can change the race's duration and the weather when replaying it. The Checkpoint mode allows players to also set the frequency of traffic, police cars, and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E

25|$|In Platinum, players control {{either a}} {{male or female}} child {{character}} and <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> one of three Pokémon — Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup — from Professor Rowan. The mascot Pokémon is Giratina, who plays {{a central role in}} the game's plot. While it only had one form in Diamond and Pearl, it is given a new alternate form alongside a new area called the Distortion World, which features altered physics from the normal land of Sinnoh, where the game takes place. The gameplay stays true to traditional Pokémon mechanics. Players explore a large area, which ranges from mountains to bodies of water, grasslands, populated areas, and snowy expanses. Similar to previous titles, players have their Pokémon fight turn-based battles against other Pokémon.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} was sent the government, {{at the time}} Mowinckel's Third Cabinet, with {{a proposal for a}} ten-year concessions using land planes. Routes were to <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a five-month service, and gradually increase to a full-year service from 1940. The company stated that it needed NOK500,000 annually in support from the state and Norway Post for the service. In 1933, the brothers Viggo Widerøe and Arild Widerøe—who would found Widerøe in 1934—also applied for routes in the same areas, but using sea planes on the route from Oslo via Kristiansand and Stavanger to Haugesund. Also Norske Luftruter applied, but a three-year concession was granted to Widerøe. The government stated that no airports had been built yet, and would not be in the immediate future, so it was better to start with sea plane services.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to {{relinquish}} their control of Roma {{as part of a}} debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family, who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The 2010–11 season had once again seen Roma <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against Cagliari, Brescia and a 2–0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the group stages of the Champions League, a match which saw manager Claudio Ranieri openly criticised by his players. However, these were accompanied by victories against Inter and a sensational victory against Bayern Munich in the return fixture, which saw Roma fight back from 0–2 down at half-time to emerge as 3–2 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches, Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker Vincenzo Montella was appointed as caretaker manager {{until the end of the}} season. It was also during this season that Roma icon Francesco Totti scored his 200th Serie A goal against Fiorentina in March 2011, becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.|$|E

25|$|Amerike – The Golden Land {{tells the}} journey of America’s Jewish {{ancestors}} who emigrated from their towns and cities in Europe and Russia (especially the Pale of Settlement) {{to start a new}} life in America. The characters in this story <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a tremendous amount of hope in leaving their homes and starting new lives in NYC. However, their notions of America as a free land are shattered at Ellis Island when they witness families being torn apart to Ellis Island’s selection process. Life turns out to be quite difficult in America, the characters in the show soon discover. Poor wages, long hours, and sweatshop conditions are horrors that tug at the seams of the characters. Events such as the Triangle Factory Fire, Workers Unionization, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, The Great Depression, World War I, and the Holocaust – World War II are telling points of the story in showing these immigrants growth, participation, and contribution to American economy and culture. The story ends on a hopeful and spirited note where survivors of the Holocaust are welcomed into the United States by the immigrants who fought to create a life for themselves there. Told in popular songs of the day, Amerike – The Golden Land is performed in Yiddish with Russian and English supertitles.|$|E

Martin {{emphasizes}} towards the thoughts of a soldier going into battle. The line [...] "If you love me, why'd you let me go?", talks about a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. The song ends with Martin playing the piano and singing, and pleading in nearly spoken-words: [...] "If you love me, won't you let me know?" [...] In live performances of the song, he plays the piano part on his acoustic guitar.|$|E

500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos.

VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's going to look like when it's completed. This project was very experimental right to the very end. The tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we've done and most of what any of us here have seen.

500|$|Unlike other game modes, SSE has a team {{system for}} the {{characters}}, with a limited choice of characters {{at the beginning of}} the mode.

In cooperative multi-player, once one player loses a life, an ally can take his or her place until the number of lives run out.

500|$|... "One More Chance" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of F major, with a basic sequence of Cmaj7–Bm7–Am7–Bm7 as its chord progression, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to B4. The verses <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> F major and then the chorus leans towards D minor, the bridge and the ending sections changes to D major. Louis Virtel from Idolator said on the song [...] " [...] begs for forgiveness, and her only accompaniment is stark acoustic strumming." [...] Madonna utilized her vocal lessons for Evita during the recording of [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". She said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording of Evita." ...|$|E

500|$|Japan— This civilization has the Daimyo and Shogun units. Japanese villagers cannot gather food via herding or hunting, but {{can build}} shrines near huntable and herdable animals {{to gain a}} slow trickle of food, wood, or coin (or {{experience}} once a certain shipment is sent from the Home City). The shrines also act as houses, supporting 10 population units. They have the unique ability to ship most cards twice. Their starting explorers are two Ikko-Ikki archer monks that can be improved with extra attributes (via shipment cards or upgrades at the Monastery). The monks <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> an ability called [...] "Divine Strike" [...] {{which can be used}} to finish off guardians or enemy units with less health. They also begin with a move that temporarily stuns treasure guardians. Japanese monks also have the ability to build shrines, which allows villagers to focus on gathering resources and building other structures. Their Home City is Edo and their leader Tokugawa Ieyasu.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to <b>start</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E
