5|$|The detectives {{are shocked}} {{at the lack of}} homicide-related calls they are {{receiving}} throughout the night. Bolander (Ned Beatty) tries several times throughout the night to call Medical Examiner Blythe (Wendy Hughes) and ask her out on a date, but he cannot build up the courage. With encouragement from Howard (Melissa Leo), he finally asks Blythe out and is shocked when she accepts. Crosetti (Jon Polito) gets agitated when his daughter calls and wants her boyfriend to <b>sleep</b> <b>over.</b> Gee comforts Crosetti and lets him go home to take care of her. Gee finds a baby boy in a small animal carrier-like cage on the bottom floor of the police department. The baby is very popular with the detectives, who take care of him while they wait for social services to arrive. After the social services worker takes the baby, the cleaning lady Loretta Kenyatta (N'Bushe Wright) hysterically screams somebody kidnapped her baby. The detectives get the baby back for her while Bayliss, infatuated with Loretta, listens to her talk about her life.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, the Indian {{village of}} Yaanga was {{relocated}} near the future corner of Commercial and Alameda Streets. In 1845, it was relocated again to present-day Boyle Heights. With {{the coming of}} the Americans, disease took a great toll among Indians. Between 1848 and 1880, the total population of Los Angeles went from 75,050 to 12,500. Self-employed Indians were not allowed to <b>sleep</b> <b>over</b> in the city. They faced increasing competition for jobs as more Mexicans moved into the area and took over the labor force. Those who loitered or were drunk or unemployed were arrested and auctioned off as laborers to those who paid their fines. They were often paid for work with liquor, which only increased their problems.|$|E

He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted [...] "white bastard" [...] at him. Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision.

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1993, it was {{revealed}} that Jackson had children <b>sleep</b> <b>over</b> in his bed with him at his Neverland ranch, a fact which came under much media scrutiny when child sexual abuse allegations were brought against him. Jackson became firm friends with Jordan Chandler and his family after a meeting in May 1992, as he was a fan of Jackson. Their friendship became so close that the National Enquirer ran a featured story with the title [...] "Michael's New Adopted Family", which implied that Jackson had [...] "stolen" [...] the boy from his estranged father, Evan Chandler, a dentist, who was admittedly jealous over Jackson's influence on his son. According to celebrity biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, Chandler asked, [...] "Look, are you having sex with my son?" [...] and after Jackson denied doing so, Chandler's opinion of Jackson changed. [...] Jackson invited Jordan, his stepsister and his mother to visit Neverland on the weekends and they would also take trips to Las Vegas and Florida. These weekend trips began to interfere with Jordan's scheduled visits with his father, with Jordan preferring to visit Neverland. In May 1993, when Jackson and Jordan stayed with Chandler, he urged Jackson {{to spend more time with}} his son at his house and even suggested that Jackson build an addition onto the house so that Jackson could stay there. After the zoning department told Chandler it could not be done, he suggested that Jackson just build him a new home. That same month, Jordan and June flew with Jackson to Monaco for the World Music Awards. According to June's lawyer, Michael Freeman, [...] "Evan began to get jealous of the involvement and felt left out." [...] Upon their return, Chandler was pleased with a five-day visit from Jackson, during which Jackson slept in a room with Jordan and his stepbrother. Chandler claimed this was when his suspicions of sexual misconduct by Jackson began, although he admitted that Jackson and Jordan always had their clothes on when he saw them in bed together and has never claimed to have witnessed any sexual misconduct between the two.|$|E

2500|$|The North Carr Lightship was {{launched}} in 1932 and created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her fog horn being tested while lying ¾ mile off Granton, Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth. As the fog horn had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh could hear it loud and clear and the complaints were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. [...] "Hundreds of city dwellers have had no <b>sleep</b> <b>over</b> three consecutive nights" [...] and [...] "The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as nothing compared with the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering {{of the past three}} nights" [...] were typical statements at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964, Shabalala had {{a series}} of {{recurring}} dreams during his <b>sleep,</b> <b>over</b> a period of six months, featuring a choir singing in perfect harmony. Shabalala described this as a beautiful sound, and one not yet achieved by his group of the time. As a result, he reformed the group, bringing on board newer (younger) relatives but keeping the group name. He strove to teach them the harmonies from his dreams, creating what was to become a signature tune for the group: [...] "Nomathemba" [...] (a girl's name - meaning [...] "hope"). After deciding that this group well replicated the beautiful, soft sounds from his dreams, Shabalala entered the group into isicathamiya competitions, held on Saturday nights in the halls of hostels in Durban and Johannesburg. The group managed to win nearly every competition that was held. As a result, Shabalala decided to change the name of the group to be more descriptive of its talent. The name [...] "Ezimnyama" [...] was replaced by [...] "Ladysmith Black Mambazo".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the bronze}} medal game, Lithuanians faced the Unified Team {{for the third}} time that year, with each team winning once. Captain Valdemaras Chomičius felt that [...] "We lost to them once already, we couldn't let that happen again. The final had to be ours", while Šarūnas Marčiulionis added that [...] "We didn't have any choice, we {{absolutely}} had to win at any cost". Head coach Vladas Garastas briefed the team saying [...] "Men, you're playing for the people of Lithuania. Forget about your personal ambitions. People are watching you, losing <b>sleep</b> <b>over</b> you". Šarūnas Marčiulionis: [...] "Some were listening on radios, others were watching on television. All of Lithuania was stopped. Everyone was watching that game". In a close match, the Lithuanians kept the lead all times for an 82–78 victory, that felt inexpressibly remarkable for a tiny country which regained its independence just two years and was playing the remains of its former colonizer. Marčiulionis played 40 minutes during that match and scored 29 points, while Sabonis added 27. Donnie Nelson described the locker room as [...] "like winning the NBA championship times five". After the bronze medal victory, de jure Head of State Vytautas Landsbergis visited the team at the locker room, and they all sung the national anthem.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of his career the England batting was fragile and Cowdrey never forgot that his wicket was too {{important}} to throw away, sometimes treating bowlers too cautiously for a man of his great talents, John Arlott commenting [...] "Cowdrey could sink into pits of uncertainty when the fire ceased to burn, allowing himself to be dominated by bowlers inferior to him in skill". Cowdrey himself thought that [...] "the proudest thing in my career was that I kept surviving", playing Lindwall and Miller at 21 and Lillee and Thomson at 41, still able to move immaculately into line even though he hadn't played for months. His quick reflexes also made him an outstanding slip, whose 120 catches was a Test record for a fielder. In his youth, Cowdrey was a useful leg-spinner at club level, but only took 63 first-class wickets at a cost of 51.21 apiece. He claimed if Alan Knott hadn't misread a googly he would have picked up a Test wicket, though his son Chris wrote [...] "I can't see Knotty losing <b>sleep</b> <b>over</b> that one". In Cowdrey's last Test at Melbourne the fans famously hung out a banner 'M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN – 6 TOURS', with Cowdrey [...] "wearing a large straw sun-hat ... signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia".|$|E
2500|$|Weltlich's {{next three}} teams posted yearly {{improvements}} in overall records, although the 1983–84 Longhorns {{did so by}} the margin of a single game over the prior year, finishing the season 7–21. Texas managed four wins against Division I competition, with a 62–61 road win over Utah in non-conference play, to end a 21-game road losing streak, and three wins against conference competition—two against Baylor and one over Rice. The Longhorns were also generally more competitive in their many defeats, with their 13 SWC losses coming {{by an average of}} 15.0 points, for a one-third reduction in the average margin of defeat from the previous season. Texas played respectably in two losses to eventual second-consecutive national runner-up Houston, losing by 11 to the No. 7 Cougars in Houston and by the same margin to No. 5 Houston in Austin. After trailing 19th-ranked Arkansas 45–27 at halftime in Austin, Texas narrowed the Razorbacks' lead to 68–66 in the final minute before Arkansas added two final points to secure the win. Nonetheless, the 1983–84 season saw a number of particularly lopsided defeats, with a 103–72 loss to SMU and a 74–47 loss to Texas Tech representing what remain the third- and ninth-worst home losses in program history. As fan criticism of Weltlich began to mount, Dodds professed to be [...] "losing no <b>sleep</b> <b>over</b> basketball at UT" [...] and said, [...] "I don't think there's any question that the direction Bob has taken is the right one.

40|$|International audienceTo {{estimate}} {{trajectories of}} <b>sleep</b> lost <b>over</b> worry {{as a function}} of age, using longitudinal modeling, and compare these trajectories with those for insomnia symptoms. Data from two prospective, occupational cohorts (the Whitehall II and Finnish Public Sector studies) comprising 84, 384 observations from four to eight repeat measurements in 1985 - 2010. There were 16, 408 men and women age 34 - 79 yr. Age-related trajectories of <b>sleep</b> lost <b>over</b> worry and insomnia symptoms (sleep initiation or maintenance problems, nonrefreshing sleep) were estimated using repeated-measures log-binomial regression analysis and generalized estimating equations. These analyses were adjusted for year of birth and time of measurement to minimize confounding by cohort or period effects. The prevalence ratio for insomnia symptoms was higher in older age groups compared with participants age 34 - 45 yr. In contrast, the age-related trajectory of <b>sleep</b> lost <b>over</b> worry included two phases: a period of high prevalence of sleep complaints at age 34 - 60 yr followed by a declining trajectory at older ages. Compared with participants age 34 - 45 yr, prevalence ratios for <b>sleep</b> lost <b>over</b> worry were 0. 63 (0. 49 - 0. 80) and 0. 59 (0. 41 - 0. 84) in the Whitehall II study participants ages 61 - 65 and 71 - 79 years. Corresponding figures were 0. 62 (0. 52 - 0. 75) and 0. 46 (0. 32 - 0. 66) in the Finnish Public Sector study.
