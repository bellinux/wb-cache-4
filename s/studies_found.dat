5|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of prospective <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> insufficient {{evidence to support}} an association between induced or spontaneous abortion and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{three large}} {{randomized}} controlled trials—the Norwegian CaVent trial, the North American ATTRACT trial, and the Dutch CAVA trial—are studying the effectiveness {{and safety of}} catheter-directed thrombolysis. In 2012, two <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> a clinical benefit in taking aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE.|$|E
50|$|One 1994 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that {{wood was}} more likely to retain {{bacterial}} contamination, while another 1994 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> the opposite. In 2002, another <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that pine wood in particular had antibacterial properties, while two other types of wood did not reduce bacteria relative to plastic.|$|R

50|$|A 1980 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that in New York, {{there were}} {{an average of two}} {{additional}} homicides in the month after an execution, consistent with a brutalization effect. A 1994 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> evidence of this effect in Oklahoma, but only with regards to stranger homicides, while a 1998 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> strong evidence to support the hypothesis for total homicides in Oklahoma.|$|R
5|$|Several reviews {{have found}} that the use of AAC does not impede the {{development}} of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact, may result in modest gains being observed. A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change. A descriptive review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) intervention <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that several studies reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer. The smaller fragments were probably destroyed before they even reached the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E
5000|$|A 2017 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that {{exposure}} to lynchings in the post-Reconstruction South [...] "reduced local black voter turnout by roughly 2.5 percentage points." [...] Another 2017 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> supportive evidence of Stewart Tolnay and E. M. Beck's claim that lynchings were [...] "due to economic competition between African American and white cotton workers". The <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that lynchings were associated with greater black out-migration from 1920 to 1930, and higher state-level wages.|$|R
50|$|For {{the overall}} {{graduation}} rate for students entering {{college in the}} United States one <b>study</b> <b>found</b> a value of 56% (Pathways to Prosperity Study), and another <b>study</b> <b>found</b> a value of 54% (American Dream 2.0 Report).|$|R
5000|$|A 1997 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that CAP {{laws were}} {{associated}} with a 23% decrease in accidental shooting deaths among children younger than 15 years old. A 2000 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that Florida's CAP law appeared to have [...] "significantly reduced unintentional firearm deaths to children," [...] but that the similar laws that existed in 14 other states {{did not seem to}} have such an effect. At the time, only three states in the U.S., including Florida, allowed those who violated their state's CAP law to be prosecuted on felony charges. A 2004 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that CAP laws {{were associated with}} a [...] "modest reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years." [...] A 2006 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that states with CAP laws experienced faster declines in accidental child firearm deaths than states without such laws. A 2015 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that these laws have no significant impact on unintentional gun deaths, but that states with such laws had lower rates of youth suicide. Some <b>studies</b> have also <b>found</b> that CAP laws are associated with lower rates of nonfatal gun injuries among {{children under the age of}} 18. In contrast, a 2016 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that these laws were ineffective.|$|R
5|$|During {{and after}} the end of World War II, {{scientists}} working on the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects. Animal <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but the disease is rare in {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This {{has been attributed to}} seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity and temperature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of human subjects, this {{involved}} injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or {{to have a life}} expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium. Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E
50|$|A 2000 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that 42% of UK {{teachers}} experienced occupational stress, {{twice the}} {{figure for the}} average profession. A 2012 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers.|$|R

50|$|In August 2014, {{a market}} {{research}} <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that, {{in comparison to}} other travel websites, Skyscanner tended to have more users aged 16-34. The same <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that 64% {{of those who have}} used Skyscanner trust the platform.|$|R
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that the}} risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> little to no correlation between the two.|$|E
5|$|Psychological <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that BA25 is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression. [...] A {{different}} <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that metabolic hyperactivity in {{this area}} is associated with poor therapeutic response of persons with Major Depressive Disorder to cognitive-behavioral therapy and venlafaxine.|$|R
50|$|A 2015 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{its closest}} {{relatives}} {{to be other}} plovers found in New Zealand, the New Zealand plover or New Zealand dotterel (Charadrius obscurus) and the wrybill (Anarhynchus frontalis), which the <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{to be in the}} Charadrius clade.|$|R
5000|$|With {{respect to}} the Criminal Law Amendment Act, a gun control law passed in Canada in 1977, some <b>studies</b> have <b>found</b> that it was {{ineffective}} at reducing homicide or robbery rates. One <b>study</b> even <b>found</b> that the law may have actually increased robberies involving firearms. A 1993 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that after this law was passed, gun suicides decreased significantly, as did the proportion of suicides committed {{in the country with}} guns. A 2003 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that this law [...] "may have had an impact on suicide rates, even after controls for social variables," [...] while a 2001 study by the same research team concluded that the law [...] "may have had an impact on homicide rates, at least for older victims." [...] A 1994 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that after this law came into force in 1978, suicide rates decreased over time in Ontario, {{and that there was no}} evidence of method substitution. The same <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that [...] "These decreases may be only partly due to the legislation." ...|$|R
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the series' strongest Pokémon, {{it changed}} the way players {{approached}} the games by forcing them to find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo. <b>Studies</b> <b>found</b> the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart and genetic source material, Mew. Reactions to Mewtwo's first anime portrayal have been divided; reviewers such as Daily Record cited it as a cliché villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. <b>Studies</b> <b>found</b> that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit. A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for {{about a quarter of the}} recent reduction in inflation. Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E
50|$|A 2013 Dutch <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that water}} {{containing}} allowable concentrations of imidacloprid had 50% fewer invertebrate species compared with uncontaminated water. A later <b>study</b> <b>found</b> the analysis was confounded with other co-occurring insecticides {{and did not}} show imidacloprid directly affected invertebrate diversity.|$|R
50|$|A 2014 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that peanut {{consumption}} by pregnant women without peanut allergies {{was associated with}} a decreased likelihood that their children would develop peanut allergies. A 2003 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> no link to maternal exposure to peanuts during pregnancy or during breast-feeding.|$|R
5000|$|A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that NAFTA has [...] "almost zero welfare {{impact on}} member and nonmember countries". A 2015 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that Canada's welfare {{decreased}} by 0.06% {{as a result}} of the NAFTA tariff reductions, and that Canada's intra-bloc trade increased by 11%.|$|R
5|$|Some astronomers had {{suggested}} that the impacts might have a noticeable effect on the Io torus, a torus of high-energy particles connecting Jupiter with the highly volcanic moon Io. High resolution spectroscopic <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that variations in the ion density, rotational velocity, and temperatures {{at the time of}} impact and afterwards were within the normal limits.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis. In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
5|$|The tree {{of heaven}} is a very rapidly growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. <b>Studies</b> <b>found</b> that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>study</b> <b>found</b> highly similar results.|$|R
25|$|A 2017 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} Committee's {{decision}} making was mostly unaffected by extra-legal {{factors such as}} nationality, activity/experience, conflict avoidance, and time constraints. The same <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that the Committee's decision making was affected much more by time constraints than that of conventional courts.|$|R
50|$|A 2010 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> little {{difference}} across races {{with regards to}} the rates of adolescent drug dealing. A 2012 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that African American youth were less likely than white youth to use or sell drugs, but more likely to be arrested for doing so.|$|R
