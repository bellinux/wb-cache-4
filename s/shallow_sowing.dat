40|$|Deep sowing (15 cm) on sands in the {{dry season}} is a {{practice}} used in post-rice sowing of legumes without irrigation, designed to increase moisture access for germination, growth and crops yield. However, with such deep sowing {{there can be a}} penalty for emergence and growth if there is abundant water stored in the upper soil profile during the growing season. Hence, {{there is a need to}} define the soil water regimes under which deep sowing is advantageous for different legumes. To investigate the adaptation of legume crop species to deep sowing, we studied their emergence, growth and yield on three deep soils (3 - 16 % clay) with shallow water tables during two years in northeast Thailand. At site 1 and 2, peanut, cowpea, mungbean and soybean were sown shallow (~ 5 cm) or deep (~ 15 cm). At site 3, only cowpea and peanut were shallow or deep sown. Shallow water tables maintained soil water content (0 - 15 cm) above permanent wilting point throughout the growing season. Deep sowing of all legumes delayed emergence by 3 - 7 days at all locations. Shoot dry weight of legumes after deep sowing was mostly similar or lower than weight after <b>shallow</b> <b>sowing.</b> Yield and harvest index of legumes did not differ meaningfully among sowing depths. Therefore, deep sowing was not beneficial for dry season cropping without irrigation when there was a shallow water table and sufficient water for crop growth throughout soil profiles in the growing season. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that shallow rather than deep sowing of legumes was preferred when the soil water content at 0 - 15 -cm depth remained higher than permanent wilting point throughout the growing season due to shallow water table...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed on {{evaluation}} of possibilities using both minimum and conventional soil tillage technologies {{in case of}} maize grain in systems of soil management and of its influence on physical and hydro-physical soil characteristics. Observation was made within stationary field experiment conducted from 2001 on loam Ortic luvisol in maize production region on the plot of agricultural company Agroservis 1. zemedelska Ltd., Visnove. There were evaluated three ways of soil tillage: (1) ploughing to the depth 0, 22 m; shallow soil tillage by discs equipment till the depth 0, 10 [...] 0, 12 m; (3) direct sowing. Observed was influence of different soil tillage on basic physical soil properties, water infiltration, penetrometric soil resistance and on yields of corn maize grown repeatedly on the same place. From the basic physical properties were evaluated bulk density, total porosity, minimum soil air capacity and soil moisture content. The lower intensity of soil tillage was the more statistically significant increase of bulk density and lower total porosity were observed. The highest values of bulk density were observed after direct sowing. Total porosity was the highest in case of ploughing. The lowest minimum soil air capacity was observed after direct sowing. The highest soil moisture content was on variant with direct sowing and the lowest on ploughing variant. Influence of different soil tillage on water infiltration was not (except extremely wet year 2010) statistically significant. Influence of different intensity of soil tillage on water infiltration was different in each year. In dry years (2008 and 2011) was higher speed of infiltration on variants with minimum soil tillage and in extremely wet year 2010 on variant with ploughing. In average was the highest intensity of infiltration on variant with ploughing and the lowest on variant with shallow tillage. Penetrometric resistance of soil was always higher under the treated lay of soil where is made more solid lay. Influence of different soil tillage on maize grain yields was not statistically significant. In average was reached the highest yield after ploughing (10, 76 t. ha- 1), followed by shallow soil tillage (10, 55 t. ha- 1) and lowest yields were reached in case of direct sowing (9, 76 t. ha- 1). Results show in the given conditions on possibility to use <b>shallow</b> <b>sowing</b> for maize grain...|$|E
40|$|On a étudié, en {{conditions}} semi-contrôlées sous serre, {{la croissance}} et le développement de plantules de maïs selon le poids de la semence, la profondeur de semis et la variété (4). Pendant la phase hétérotrophe, la croissance de l’hydride DEA est, à peu de choses près, directement proportionnelle à la quantité de réserves de la graine utilisées depuis la germination, dans un rapport peu variable suivant les conditions (coefficient de variation de 3, 1 %). Les plantules issues de grosses semences présentent une croissance nettement plus rapide, mais une efficience légèrement moindre pour l’utilisation des réserves de la graine. Les stades foliaires ou racinaires sont déterminés par l’âge de la plantule depuis sa germination, indépendamment de la taille de la semence d’origine, et, après l’apparition de la 2 e feuille, indépendamment de la profondeur de semis. Les plantules issues de semis profonds utilisent un peu plus rapidement les réserves de la semence et montrent un taux de croissance supérieur. La fraction des réserves mobilisées jusqu’au passage à l’autotrophie est peu variable, autour de 65 % : les plantules issues de grosses semences débutent donc leur période photosynthétique avec une plus grande quantité de réserves encore disponibles dans la semence et avec un poids supérieur d’organes chlorophylliens. Growth {{and development of}} maize seedlings according to seed weight, depth of sowing and variety (4) were studied in a greenhouse. Up to 240 ° per d, {{the growth of the}} DEA variety is directly proportional to the amount of seed reserves which have been used since germination: the ratio shows little variation according to seed weight and sowing depth (the variation coefficient is 3. 1 %, figs 1 and 2). The slight advantage of seedlings originating from light seeds in relation to the relative amount of reserves which have been utilized during a given period of time (table I) is quite insufficient to counterbalance the much larger absolute amount used from heavy seeds. As a consequence, the seedlings originating from heavy seeds displayed rapid growth (fig 3). We found a genetical variation in the rhythm of seed reserves utilisation as follows: Monarque was more rapid, followed by DEA, F 7 x F 2 then Mohican (table V). These differences have consequences on the rate of growth during the heterotrophic stage, which is higher with Monarque. Unlike the growth, the development (appearance of new organs as leaves or ramifications on the radicle or lateral roots) is independent of the weight of the originating seed. It expresses the physiological age of the seedling, according to the time passed, as the sum of temperature (table II). The ratio of reserves used when a seedling starts an autotrophic life is about 65 %, showing little variation. At that time, seedlings have passed the 3 rd leaf stage, the advent of ramifications on lateral roots, and we observe a temporary decrease in root weight as described by Bourdu and Gregory (1983) (table III). On the deep sowing treatments, the seedlings use seed reserves more rapidly and as a consequence of this, grow faster (table IV). In these situations the emergence is comparatively delayed with shallow sowings, but this difference of stage disappears after the advent of the 1 st leaf. When the ermergence takes place, the seedlings originating from light seeds sowed deeply dispose of only 45 % of maternal reserves (ie 75 mg) in contrast with those from heavy seeds and <b>shallow</b> <b>sowing</b> which still dispose of 71 % (ie 235 mg). In the first situation, the safety margins, in the event of adverse conditions (cold weather, excess of water, coarse seed-bed, surface crust) are restricted. On the other hand, the weight of chlorophyllian organs, when efficient photosynthesis takes place, is much higher in seedlings originating from heavy seeds rather than from light seeds: the initial state of the exponential growth is much better, and, as a consequence, this fact could induce better progress at all stages...|$|E
40|$|Hypocotyl {{length in}} {{groundnut}} {{is a function}} of sowing depth. In field experiments deep sowing increased the mass of hypocotyl but decreased that of roots, pods and haulm. Few nodules were formed on the hypocotyls of plants from <b>shallow</b> <b>sown</b> seeds (4 – 5 cm deep). More hypocotyl nodules occurred on Virginia types when deep sown but the number and activity of nodules on the roots decreased. Nodules on the hypocotyl appeared later and fixed less nitrogen than root nodules. Although hypocotyl nodules fixed nitrogen during the later stages of plant growth, this activity could not compensate for the loss in nitrogenase activity due to deeper sowing. Deeper sowing also resulted in decreased pod yields...|$|R
60|$|At {{the famous}} bridge of Doon, Kyle, the central {{district}} of the shire of Ayr, marches with Carrick, the most southerly. On the Carrick {{side of the}} river rises a hill of somewhat gentle conformation, cleft with <b>shallow</b> dells, and <b>sown</b> here and there with farms and tufts of wood. Inland, it loses itself, joining, I suppose, the great herd of similar hills that occupies the centre of the Lowlands. Towards the sea it swells out the coast-line into a protuberance, like a bay-window in a plan, and is fortified against the surf behind bold crags. This hill is known as the Brown Hill of Carrick, or, more shortly, Brown Carrick.|$|R
40|$|Water {{deficits and}} unusually warm soil {{temperatures}} can adversely affect conventional ridge sown systems. Increasingly serious water and temperature {{issues associated with}} global climate change may be problematic in the future, particularly in semiarid regions. This study explored the soil water and crop yield benefits of switching the sowing location of corn from ridges to furrows. Experiments were conducted over three years. Corn was grown in shallow furrow (SF) and deep furrow (DF) sown treatments until the V 8 stage (eight visible leaf collars). New ridges were then built over the existing furrows. Grain yield {{was found to be}} higher in the SF and DF sown treatments than in a conventional ridge sown treatment (CR), especially in drought years. Switching sowing position from ridge to furrow could increase corn yield, directly, by improving soil moisture early in the growing season and, indirectly, by stimulating the growth of resource-capturing organs (e. g., leaves and roots). This simple and efficient approach to crop production in semiarid climates may be practical for the management of numerous agricultural systems, particularly those that are resource-limited, with greater vulnerability to the effects of global climate change.

2500|$|Two sowing {{methods are}} used for cumin, {{broadcasting}} and line sowing. For broadcast sowing, the field is divided into beds and the seeds are uniformly broadcast in this bed. Afterwards, they are covered with soil using a rake. For line <b>sowing,</b> <b>shallow</b> furrows are prepared with hooks {{at a distance of}} [...] The seeds are then placed in these furrows and covered with soil. Line sowing offers advantages for intercultural operations such as weeding, hoeing, or spraying. The recommended sowing depth is 1–2cm and the recommended sowing density is around 120 plants per square metre. The water requirements of cumin are lower than those of many other species. Despite this, cumin is often irrigated after sowing to be sure that enough moisture is available for seedling development. The amount and frequency of irrigation depends on the climate conditions.|$|R
40|$|On sandy paddy fields, {{key factors}} for {{successful}} crops {{in the dry}} season without irrigation are a shallow water table and practices such as deep seed-placement but only some legume species are adapted to such conditions. To understand the adaptation of legume species to deep seed-placement over shallow water tables, we studied their rooting patterns on two sandy soils. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), mungbean (Vigna radiata), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max) seeds were <b>sown</b> <b>shallow</b> (similar to 5 cm) or deep (similar to 15 cm) in deep sandy soils after harvesting rice in two shallow water table locations in north-east Thailand. The legumes depended mainly on capillary water rising from the water table and none experienced water deficit throughout the growing season. Generally, deeper seed-placement decreased overall root dry weight, but it increased the root surface area to weight ratio. Deep seed-placement promoted a greater fraction of root growth into the subsoil for cowpea (86 - 99 % of total root length), mungbean (61 - 93 % of total root length) and peanut (78 - 98 % of total root length) where the soil contained more water throughout the growing season. Moreover, deep seed-placement at the site with the lower water table promoted deeper penetration of roots of cowpea (similar to 20 cm deeper), mungbean (similar to 20 - 40 cm deeper) and peanut (similar to 20 - 40 cm deeper) which improved water access, especially late {{during the growing season}} when topsoils dried to close to wilting point. Unlike other species, the soybean rooting pattern did not respond much to seed-placement depths, or soil moisture...|$|R
