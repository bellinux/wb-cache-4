5000|$|The Irish Supreme Court {{requested}} that the case be heard urgently, and the ECJ agreed on 4 October to handle the case under an accelerated procedure, with a one-day hearing scheduled for 23 October 2012. Pringle stated that if he won the case, all ESM members would have to cease their membership and terminate the ESM as an intergovernmental organisation. However, on 27 November 2012 the ECJ delivered its judgement, answering all the questions submitted to it in an affirmative manner, and thus rejected Pringle's challenge. [...] The ECJ found that the TFEU amendment did not expand the competence of the EU, and thus {{the use of the}} <b>simplified</b> treaty <b>amendment</b> <b>procedure</b> was legal. In addition, the ruling stated that the ESM treaty did not overrule any existing EU law and thus member states were permitted to join and enact the ESM treaty independent of whether the TFEU amendment had been ratified. It also highlighted that the ESM treaty basically replaced the intergovernmental temporary EFSF and the EU-law enacted EFSM, and that it did not limit the competence of the EU to introduce a similar support mechanism in the future.|$|R

Over time, a strong tradition of direct democracy and majoritarian voting rules has emerged in almost all states.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the set of}} sophisticated voting outcomes under the following two-stage amendment procedure: the set of alternatives is partitioned into two subsets; one subset is voted on via an <b>amendment</b> <b>procedure</b> at the first stage, followed by the remaining subset at the second stage. The surviving alternatives are then paired at the final vote. This procedure is related to that used in congressional decision making when both a bill and a substitute bill are in order {{on the floor and}} hence are open to amendments. It is shown that it is "easier" for alternatives initially considered at the second stage to be the outcome of the voting game than those considered at the first stage. The set of outcomes is contrasted with that generated by the (one-stage) <b>amendment</b> <b>procedure</b> as well as the concept of the uncovered set...|$|R
