When {{spinning}} {{a small amount of}} oil must be added to the fibre. It can be bleached and dyed. It was used for <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bags</b> but is now used for the backing for carpets.

Then we found that the bottom was really a trap door, and under it was a sort of well in which were <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bags.</b> One of the sacks was full of unbroken silver, two others contained silver ingots, things that he had melted down, and there was a large bag full of watches and jewels.

60|$|This Guy {{could well}} understand, for {{although}} the guns {{could not be}} depressed sufficiently to fire down into the tête du pont, the mangonels were hurling stones into it, and the men-at-arms shooting cross-bow quarrels whenever a man showed himself. The rear of the outwork was open and afforded no shelter {{to those who had}} taken possession of it, and already the greater portion had retired {{to the other side of}} the small moat surrounding it, where they lay sheltered by the outwork itself. It was not long before the assailants at the other points, finding that the plan they had formed was defeated by the skill of the archers, poured down in a mass between the two lines of mantlets, each man carrying his burden before him, thus sheltering him to a great extent. Against this method of attack the archers could do little, and now confined themselves to shooting at the men who, having thrown down the fascines or sacks by the edge of the moat, stood for a moment and hesitated before running back to the shelter of the mantlets, and not one in three got off scot-free. Guy on going round the wall found the same state of things at each of the other three points of assault. Numbers of the enemy were falling, but great piles of materials were accumulating at the edge of the moat. After a time a number of knights and men-at-arms, fully protected by armour, came down and began to hurl the <b>sacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bags</b> into the moat, their operations being covered as much as possible by a storm of missiles shot through holes in the mantlets. In a short time Sir Eustace ordered the archers to desist shooting, for they were obliged, in order to aim at those so much below them, to expose a considerable portion of their bodies, and three were killed by the enemy's missiles.|$|E

It was found that the type and intensity of mechanical treatments significantly affect the formation of fibre deformations, and thus the resulting properties of paper. The combination of high-consistency wing defibrator treatment and subsequent low-consistency valley beating provided paper with high elongation potential and good strength properties without impairing the dewatering properties...|$|R

60|$|So {{while the}} q-b stands guard over <b>sack</b> <b>and</b> <b>bag,</b> I {{plunge into the}} fray. It {{literally}} is a fight. Some thirty men all at once want to get at a tiny wicket in a blank wall. There are no queue-rails, there is no order: just a hole in a blank wall, and thirty fellows, mostly military, pressing at it in a mass. But I have done this before. The way is to insert the thin end of oneself, and without any violence, by deadly pressure and pertinacity come at the goal. One hand must be kept fast over the money pocket, and one must be free to clutch the wicket-side when one gets there. And thus one is ground small in those mills of God, Demos struggling for tickets. It isn't very nice--so close, so incomparably crushed. And never for a second must one be off one's guard for one's watch and money and even hanky. When I first came to Italy after the war I was robbed twice in three weeks, floating round in the sweet old innocent confidence in mankind. Since then I have never ceased {{to be on my}} guard. Somehow or other, waking and sleeping one's spirit must be on its guard nowadays. Which is really what I prefer, now I have learnt it. Confidence in the goodness of mankind is a very thin protection indeed. Integer vitae scelerisque purus will do nothing for you when it comes to humanity, however efficacious it may be with lions and wolves. Therefore, tight on my guard, like a screw biting into a bit of wood, I bite my way through that knot of fellows, to the wicket, and shout for two first-class. The clerk inside ignores me for some time, serving soldiers. But if you stand like Doomsday you get your way. Two firsts, says the clerk. Husband and wife, say I, in case there is a two-berth cabin. Jokes behind. But I get my tickets. Impossible to put my hand to my pocket. The tickets cost about a hundred and five francs each. Clutching paper change and the green slips, with a last gasp I get out of the knot. So--we've done it. As I sort my money and stow away, I hear another ask for one first-class. Nothing left, says the clerk. So you see how one must fight.|$|R

40|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, {{a great deal}} of linen was {{produced}} in the American colonies. Virtually every farming family spun and wove linen cloth for its own consumption. The production of linen was the most widespread industrial activity in America during the colonial period. Yet at the same time, large amounts of linen were imported from across the Atlantic into the American colonies. Linen was the most important commodity entering into the American trade. This apparently paradoxical situation reflects the importance in pre-industrial society of the production and consumption of the extensive range of types of fabrics grouped together as 2 ̆ 7 linen 2 ̆ 7. The range of uses of 2 ̆ 7 linen 2 ̆ 7 is greater than for any other type of fabric. Clothing, bedding, the table and other domestic needs required various sorts of linen, and the transport and packaging industries required others - sailcloth, <b>sacking</b> <b>and</b> <b>bagging</b> of all sorts. The range of quality was considerable, from the finest cambrics and lawns and damasks to the coarsest sackcloths. In colonial America there was a sort of dual economy: basic linen needs were provided outside the market by the widespread domestic production of homespun coarse linetv while the market was dominated by a range of better-quality (though still low-priced) linens imported from England, Scotland and Ireland, and imported too from the continent of Europe (especially Germany) via London. The point was well made by Thomas Fitch, a Boston upholsterer, writing in 1726. 2 ̆ 7 Very coarse 3 / 4 Garlets [i. e. linen from Gulik, or Julich] not being serviceable won 2 ̆ 7 t sute our people 1, he wrote, 2 ̆ 7 though we certainly have enough that are poor. Yet they won 2 ̆ 7 t wear Garlets but homespun linens, or rather cotton and linen cloth that is very durable though not so white. Those that buy Garlets therefore are for a sort that will wear and look pretty and so decline buying coarset than [pattern] No. 17722 ̆ 7. (Quoted in Montgomery, 1984, p. 345.)
