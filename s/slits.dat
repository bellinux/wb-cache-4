5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one {{at either end of the}} passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are <b>slits</b> at ground level. <b>Slits</b> on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; <b>slits</b> in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes have genital <b>slits</b> on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary <b>slits,</b> each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the axon guidance proteins <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 co-operate to establish the optic chiasm in its correct position at the ventral diencephalic midline. This is based on the observation that, although both <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 are expressed around the ventral midline, mice defective in either gene alone exhibit few or no axon guidance defects at the optic chiasm whereas embryos lacking both <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 develop a large additional chiasm anterior to the chiasm’s normal position. Here we used steerable-filters to quantify key properties of the population of axons at the chiasm in wild-type, <b>Slit</b> 1 −/−, <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− embryos. Results We applied the steerable-filter algorithm successfully to images of embryonic retinal axons labelled from a single eye shortly after they have crossed the midline. We combined data from multiple embryos of the same genotype and made statistical comparisons of axonal distributions, orientations and curvatures between genotype groups. We compared data from the analysis of axons with data on the expression of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2. The results showed a misorientation and a corresponding anterior shift in the position of many axons at the chiasm of both <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mutants. There were very few axon defects at the chiasm of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− mutants. Conclusions We found defects of the chiasms of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− mutants similar to those reported previously. In addition, we discovered previously unreported defects resulting from loss of <b>Slit</b> 2 alone. This indicates the value of a quantitative approach to complex pathway analysis and shows that <b>Slit</b> 2 can act alone to control aspects of retinal axon routing across the ventral diencephalic midline. </p...|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal <b>slits</b> near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the <b>slits</b> may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E

However, vertebrate <b>Slit</b> genes are also expressed in nonneuronal tissues where their cellular locations and functions are unknown. In this study, we characterized the cellular distribution and processing of mammalian <b>Slit</b> 3 gene product, the least evolutionarily conserved of the vertebrate <b>Slit</b> genes, in kidney epithelial cells, using both cellular fractionation and immunolabeling. <b>Slit</b> 3, but not <b>Slit</b> 2, was predominantly localized within the mitochondria. This localization was confirmed using immunoelectron microscopy in cell lines and in mouse kidney proximal tubule cells. In confluent epithelial monolayers, <b>Slit</b> 3 was also transported to the cell surface. However, we {{found no evidence of}} <b>Slit</b> 3 proteolytic processing similar to that seen for <b>Slit</b> 2. We demonstrated that <b>Slit</b> 3 contains an NH 2 -terminal mitochondrial localization signal that can direct a reporter green fluorescent protein to the mitochondria. The equivalent region from <b>Slit</b> 1 cannot elicit mitochondrial targeting. We conclude that <b>Slit</b> 3 protein is targeted to and localized at two distinct sites within epithelial cells: the mitochondria, and then, in more confluent cells, the cell surface. Targeting to both locations is driven by specific NH 2 -terminal sequences. This is the first examination of <b>Slit</b> protein localization in nonneuronal cells, and this study implies that <b>Slit</b> 3 has potentially unique functions not shared by other <b>Slit</b> proteins...|$|R

Three human <b>Slit</b> gene orthologues have been characterised and recently we reported frequent promoter region hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of <b>SLIT</b> 2 in lung, breast, colorectal and glioma cell lines and primary tumours. Furthermore, re-expression of <b>SLIT</b> 2 inhibited the growth of cancer cell lines so that <b>SLIT</b> 2 appears {{to function as a}} novel tumour suppressor gene (TSG). We analysed the expression of <b>SLIT</b> 3 (5 q 35 – 34) and <b>SLIT</b> 1 (1 q 23. 3 –q 24) genes in 20 normal human tissues.

40|$|Three major axon {{pathways}} {{cross the}} midline of the vertebrate forebrain early in embryonic development: the postoptic commissure (POC), the anterior commissure (AC) and the optic nerve. We {{show that a}} small population of Gfap+ astroglia spans the midline of the zebrafish forebrain in the position of, and prior to, commissural and retinal axon crossing. These glial `bridges 2 ̆ 7 form in regions devoid of the guidance molecules <b>slit</b> 2 and <b>slit</b> 3, although a subset of these glial cells express <b>slit</b> 1 a. We show that Hh signaling is required for commissure formation, glial bridge formation, and the restricted expression of the guidance molecules <b>slit</b> 1 a, <b>slit</b> 2, <b>slit</b> 3 and sema 3 d, but that Hh {{does not appear to}} play a direct role in commissural and retinal axon guidance. Reducing <b>Slit</b> 2 and/or <b>Slit</b> 3 function expanded the glial bridges and caused defasciculation of the POC, consistent with a `channeling 2 ̆ 7 role for these repellent molecules. By contrast, reducing <b>Slit</b> 1 a function led to reduced midline axon crossing, suggesting a distinct role for <b>Slit</b> 1 a in midline axon guidance. Blocking <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3, but not <b>Slit</b> 1 a, function in the Hh pathway mutant yot (gli 2 DR) dramatically rescued POC axon crossing and glial bridge formation at the midline, indicating that expanded <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 repellent function is largely responsible for the lack of midline crossing in these mutants.

40|$|A basic {{conservation}} of cell migration guidance mechanisms in the nervous and immune systems was proposed when <b>Slit,</b> {{known for its}} role in axon guidance, was found to inhibit chemokine-induced leukocyte chemotaxis in vitro. These studies examined the role of <b>Slit</b> 2 in modulating inflammation in vivo. In a rat model of glomerulonephritis, endogenous glomerular <b>Slit</b> 2 expression fell after disease induction, and its inhibition during the early disease period accelerated inflammation. Ex vivo glomerular leukocytes showed decreased chemokine and chemoattractant-induced chemotaxis in response to <b>Slit</b> 2, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for glomerular <b>Slit</b> 2. In contrast {{to the effect of}} inhibition, glomerulonephritis was ameliorated by systemic <b>Slit</b> 2 administration. <b>Slit</b> 2 treatment improved disease histologically and also improved renal function when given early in the disease course. Leukocytes harvested from rats receiving <b>Slit</b> 2 showed decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP) - 1 -mediated migration, consistent with a peripheral <b>Slit</b> 2 effect. In keeping with this functional alteration, <b>Slit</b> 2 -mediated inhibition of RAW 264. 7 cell chemotaxis was associated with decreased levels of active cdc 42 and Rac 1, implicating GTPases in leukocyte <b>Slit</b> 2 signaling. These findings suggest a role for endogenous <b>Slit</b> 2 in the inhibition of chemoattractant-mediated signals, demonstrate a potentially important anti-inflammatory effect for <b>Slit</b> 2 in vivo, and provide further evidence for conserved mechanisms guiding the process of migration in distinct cell types...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slit</b> {{cleavage}} into N-terminal and C-terminal polypeptides {{is essential}} for restricting the range of <b>Slit</b> activity. Although the <b>Slit</b> cleavage site has been characterized previously and is evolutionally conserved, {{the identity of the}} protease that cleaves <b>Slit</b> remains elusive. Our previous analysis indicated that <b>Slit</b> cleavage is essential to immobilize the active Slit-N at the tendon cell surfaces, mediating the arrest of muscle elongation. In an attempt to identify the protease required for <b>Slit</b> cleavage we performed an RNAi-based assay in the ectoderm and followed the process of elongation of the lateral transverse muscles toward tendon cells. The screen led to the identification of the Drosophila homolog of pheromone convertase 2 (PC 2), Amontillado (Amon), as an essential protease for <b>Slit</b> cleavage. Further analysis indicated that <b>Slit</b> mobility on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is slightly up-shifted in amon mutants, and its conventional cleavage into the Slit-N and Slit-C polypeptides is attenuated. Consistent with the requirement for amon to promote <b>Slit</b> cleavage and membrane immobilization of Slit-N, the muscle phenotype of amon mutant embryos was rescued by co-expressing a membrane-bound form of full-length <b>Slit</b> lacking the cleavage site and knocked into the <b>slit</b> locus.
