2500|$|In January 2015, <b>siamang</b> gibbon, Iwani was euthanased due {{to ongoing}} welfare issues. [...] Iwani was handraised {{from the age}} of six weeks, after he was {{rejected}} by his mother, and was frequently agitated due to his inability to adjust to life as a <b>siamang.</b> [...] He was paired with a female mate, Kera, but did not bond with her, and frequently sought human interaction by calling continuously at the viewing windows. [...] A new mate for Kera, a six-year-old male named Intan, arrived from Willowbank Wildlife Park in Christchurch later that month. [...] Intan is the son of Iwani's sister, who was born at Auckland Zoo in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large <b>siamang,</b> but a <b>siamang</b> has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2001, <b>siamang</b> gibbon, Iuri {{gave birth}} to her fifth offspring, a male named Irian. [...] In March 2003, she {{gave birth to}} twins, the first born in Australasia. [...] The female infant, Iberani, was put down in May 2003 after her mother {{attacked}} her and rejected her and her twin brother, Iwani. [...] Iwani was reintroduced to his family in June 2004. [...] He later became the zoo's breeding male after Irian left for Adelaide Zoo in 2006 and his parents, Itam and Iuri left for Hamilton Zoo in 2009. [...] He was paired with a female, Kera, who arrived from Mogo Zoo in October 2009.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Siamangs</b> {{are a very}} {{social species}} of {{primates}} and exhibit a variety of tactile and visual gestures, along with actions and facial expressions to communicate and increase social bonds within their family group. [...] <b>Siamangs</b> are also territorial and interact with other family groups by making loud calls to let other groups know where their territory is. The calls may be asynchronous, where they are not directed at a particular neighboring group, or simultaneous group calls may take place across the territory boundary. In addition, males chase {{each other across the}} boundary.|$|R
40|$|It has {{repeatedly}} been suggested for several duetting bird and primate species that duetting might {{act as a}} reinforcement of the pair bond. Until now, it has apparently not been demonstrated that the premises underlying the pair-bonding hypothesis are met by any duetting species. <b>Siamangs</b> (Hylobates syndactylus) are monogamous apes which produce long and complex duet songs. This study analyses the changes in duet structure in two pairs of <b>siamangs</b> during a forced partner exchange. The duet songs of the <b>siamangs</b> underwent many notable changes during partner exchange. Of 33 different variants of the great call sequence, 29 % in one pair and 21 % in the other were restricted to the rst stage just after the partner exchange. Some of these changes were certainly due to individualistic traits of the new partner, and for some other changes, this possibility cannot be reliably excluded.

6000|$|All {{observers}} {{testify to}} the prodigious volume of voice possessed by these animals. According to the writer whom I have just cited, in one of them, the <b>Siamang,</b> [...] "the voice is grave and penetrating, resembling the sounds goek, goek, goek, goek, goek {{ha ha ha ha}} haaaaa, and may easily be heard at a distance of half a league." [...] While the cry is being uttered, the great membranous bag under the throat which communicates with the organ of voice, the so-called [...] "laryngeal sac," [...] becomes greatly distended, diminishing again when the creature relapses into silence.|$|E

[...] Mr. Waterhouse, an accomplished musician as well as zoologist, says, [...] "The Gibbon's voice is certainly much more powerful than that of any singer I have ever heard." [...] And yet {{it is to be}} recollected that this animal is not half the height of, and far less bulky in proportion than, a man.|$|E
60|$|The Quadrumana or monkey tribe {{form one}} of the most {{characteristic}} features of this region. Twenty-four distinct species are known to inhabit it, and these are distributed with tolerable uniformity over the islands, nine being found in Java, ten in the Malay peninsula, eleven in Sumatra, and thirteen in Borneo. The great man-like Orangutans are found only in Sumatra and Borneo; the curious <b>Siamang</b> (next to them in size) in Sumatra and Malacca; the long-nosed monkey only in Borneo; while every island has representatives of the Gibbons or long-armed apes, and of monkeys.

60|$|The Gibbons {{appear to}} be {{naturally}} very gentle, but there is very good evidence that they will bite severely when irritated--a female 'Hylobates agilis' having so severely lacerated one man with her long canines, that he died; while she had injured others so much that, by way of precaution, these formidable teeth had been filed down; but, if threatened, she would still turn on her keeper. The Gibbons eat insects, but appear generally to avoid animal food. A <b>Siamang,</b> however, was seen by Mr. Bennett to seize and devour greedily a live lizard. They commonly drink by dipping their fingers in the liquid and then licking them. It is asserted that they sleep in a sitting posture.|$|E
60|$|A {{very curious}} ape, the <b>Siamang,</b> was also rather abundant, {{but it is}} much less bold than the monkeys, keeping to the virgin forests and {{avoiding}} villages. This species is allied to the little long-armed apes of the genus Hylobates, but is considerably larger, and differs from them by having the two first fingers of the feet united together, nearly to the end as does its Latin name, Siamanga syndactyla. It moves much more slowly than the active Hylobates, keeping lower down in trees, and not indulging in such tremendous leaps; {{but it is still}} very active, and by means of its immense long arms, five feet six inches across in an adult about three feet high, can swing itself along among the trees at a great rate. I purchased a small one, which had been caught by the natives and tied up so tightly as to hurt it. It was rather savage at first, and tried to bite; but when we had released it and given it two poles under the verandah to hang upon, securing it by a short cord, running along the pole with a ring so that it could move easily, it became more contented, and would swing itself about with great rapidity. It ate almost any kind of fruit and rice, and I was in hopes to have brought it to England, but it died just before I started. It took a dislike to me at first, which I tried to get over by feeding it constantly myself. One day, however, it bit me so sharply while giving it food, that I lost patience and gave it rather a severe beating, which I regretted afterwards, as from that time it disliked me more than ever. It would allow my Malay boys to play with it, and for hours together would swing by its arms from pole to pole and on to the rafters of the verandah, with so much ease and rapidity, that it was a constant source of amusement to us. When I returned to Singapore it attracted great attention, as no one had seen a <b>Siamang</b> alive before, although it is not uncommon {{in some parts of the}} Malay peninsula.|$|E
