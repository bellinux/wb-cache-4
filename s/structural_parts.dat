5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident {{in the use of}} sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden <b>structural</b> <b>parts.</b> The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many <b>structural</b> <b>parts</b> may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E

25|$|Only {{three basic}} colors were used: white, blue and red, {{occasionally}} also black. The crepidoma, columns and architrave were mostly white. Only details, like the horizontally cut grooves {{at the bottom}} of Doric capitals (anuli), or decorative elements of Doric architraves (e.g. taenia and guttae) might be painted in different colours. The frieze was clearly structured by use of colours. In a Doric triglyph frieze, blue triglyphs alternated with red metopes, the latter often serving as a background for individually painted sculptures. Reliefs, ornaments and pedimental sculptures were executed with a wider variety of colours and nuances. Recessed or otherwise shaded elements, like mutules or triglyph slits could be painted black. Paint was mostly applied to parts that were not load-bearing, whereas <b>structural</b> <b>parts</b> like columns or the horizontal elements of architrave and geison were left unpainted (if made of high quality limestone or marble) or covered with a white stucco.|$|E
500|$|Because {{titanium}} alloys have {{high tensile strength}} to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical <b>structural</b> <b>parts,</b> fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|E

Application of this approach to the analysis of a cavity-backed plate assembly shows the improved computational efficiency as compared to classical finite element procedures and illustrates the potential of the hybrid method as a powerful tool for the analysis of coupled structural-acoustic systems. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{structure}} of the Richards building is composed of 1019 pre-stressed concrete columns, beams, trusses and related items that were trucked in from a factory, assembled with a crane like children's blocks, and locked into place with post-tensioning cables running in all three dimensions, something like an old-style toy that is floppy until its parts are pulled together tightly with a string. [...] In line with his belief that structure should be made visible, Kahn exposed these <b>structural</b> <b>parts</b> on the building's exterior and in the laboratory ceilings. [...] For the post-tensioning to be effective, the prefabricated concrete parts had to be precisely dimensioned and perfectly formed. [...] Komendant {{worked closely with the}} manufacturer to ensure that outcome, with the result that the largest offset between any two elements in the finished structure was only 1/16inch (1.6mm). [...] The Architectural Record noted that the precision achieved seemed more typical of cabinet making than concrete construction.|$|E
2500|$|The USAF SR-71 Blackbird {{strategic}} {{reconnaissance aircraft}} made {{frequent use of}} air-to-air refueling. Indeed, design considerations of the aircraft made its mission impossible without aerial refueling. Based at Beale AFB in central California, SR-71s had to be forward deployed to Europe and Japan prior to flying actual reconnaissance missions. These trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights during deployment were impossible without aerial refueling. The SR-71's designers traded takeoff performance for better high-speed, high-altitude performance, necessitating takeoff with less-than-full fuel tanks from even the longest runways. Once airborne, the Blackbird would accelerate to supersonic speed using afterburners to facilitate structural heating and expansion. The magnitude of temperature changes experienced by the SR-71, from parked to its maximum speed, resulted in significant expansion of its <b>structural</b> <b>parts</b> in cruise flight. To allow for the expansion, the Blackbird's parts had to fit loosely when cold, so loosely, in fact, that the Blackbird constantly leaked fuel before heating expanded the airframe enough to seal its fuel tanks. Following the supersonic dash, and to stop the fuel leaks, the SR-71 would then rendezvous with a tanker to fill its now nearly empty tanks before proceeding on its mission. This {{was referred to as}} the LTTR (for [...] "Launch To Tanker Rendezvous") profile. [...] LTTR had the added advantage of providing an operational test of the Blackbird's refueling capability within minutes after takeoff, enabling a Return-To-Launch-Site abort capability if necessary. At its most efficient altitude and speed, the Blackbird was capable of flying for many hours without refueling. The SR-71 used a special fuel, JP-7, with a very high flash point to withstand the extreme skin temperatures generated during Mach 3+ cruise flight. [...] While JP-7 could be used by other aircraft, its burn characteristics posed problems in certain situations (such as high-altitude, emergency engine starts) that made it less than optimal for aircraft other than the SR-71.|$|E
