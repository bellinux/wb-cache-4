40|$|AbstractThis paper explores how the Internet of Things and {{blockchain}} technology can benefit <b>shared</b> <b>economy</b> applications. The {{focus of this}} research is understanding how blockchain can be exploited to create decentralised, <b>shared</b> <b>economy</b> applications that allow people to monetise, securely, their things to create more wealth. <b>Shared</b> <b>economy</b> applications such as Airbnb and Uber are well-known applications, but there are many other opportunities to share in the digital economy. With the recent interest in the Internet of Things and blockchain, the opportunity exists to create a myriad of sharing applications, e. g. peer-to-peer automatic payment mechanisms, foreign exchange platforms, digital rights management and cultural heritage to name but a few. While many types of <b>shared</b> <b>economy</b> scenarios are proliferating, few of them, so far, leverage the Internet of Things and blockchain as technologies to build distributed applications. This paper discusses how we might make use of the Internet of Things and blockchains to create secure <b>shared</b> <b>economy</b> distributed applications.

40|$|In {{periods of}} turbulence, the {{tendency}} to simplify messages and polarise debates is nothing new. In our hyper-mediated world of online technologies, where it seems that even national policy can be forged in the 140 characters of Twitter, {{it is more important}} than ever to retain spaces for in-depth debate of emergent phenomena that have disruptive and transformative potential. In this article, we follow this logic and argue that to fully understand the diverse range of practices and potential consequences of activities uncomfortably corralled under the ambiguous term 'the sharing economy' requires not a simplification of arguments, but an opening out of horizons to explore the many ways in which these phenomena have emerged and are evolving. It is argued that this will require attention to multiple terrains, from diverse intellectual traditions across many disciplines to the thus far largely reactive responses of government and regulation, and from the world of techno-innovation start-ups to the optics of media (including social media) reporting on what it means to 'share' in the 21 st century. Building on this, we make the case for viewing 'the sharing economy' as a matrix of diverse economies with clear links to past practices. We propose that to build a grammar for understanding these diverse <b>sharing</b> <b>economies</b> requires further attention to: (1) The etymology of sharing and sharing economies; (2) The differentiated geographies to which <b>sharing</b> <b>economies</b> contribute; (3) What it means to labour, work and be employed in sharing economies; (4) The role of the state and others in governing, regulating and shaping the organisation and practice of sharing economies; and (5) the impacts of <b>sharing</b> <b>economies.</b> In conclusion, we suggest that while media interest may fade as their presence in everyday lives becomes less novel, understanding <b>sharing</b> <b>economies</b> remains an urgent activity if we are to ensure that the new ways of living and labouring, to which <b>sharing</b> <b>economies</b> are contributing, work to promote sustainable and inclusive development in this world that ultimately we all share...|$|R

40|$|My study explores a {{small but}} {{revealing}} corner of the <b>share</b> <b>economy,</b> where an individual’s private resources are bartered for limited use by others in exchange for compensation. Strip clubs create value for owners by commoditizing sexual labor. Clubs avoid employment in favor of independent contracting with dancers. They pay no wages or benefits; patrons pay dancers with fees and tips. But clubs extract entry fees from dancers who work; require them to rent dressing rooms and stage time; and compel them to share tips with DJs, emcees, house moms, bouncers, and bartenders. My research identified seventy-five federal and state court rulings on wage claims by exotic dancers. In thirty-eight cases, courts ruled that dancers were employees; only three courts ruled that dancers were independent contractors. Courts often awarded dancers minimum wages, overtime, and liquidated damages.

40|$|Recently, within several debates, {{the idea}} of a {{participatory}} economy has been recovered as a viable solution towards labour and firm’s costs flexibility to cope with unemployment and the increasingly competitive economic environment. This paper is an attempt to integrate the main recent models of participatory economy, i. e. Weitzman’s <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> and Meade’s partnership economy. This in order to throw light on some microeconomic conditions which appear to be not thoroughly examined and which could make not smoothly viable the path of a <b>share</b> <b>economy.</b> We introduce workers’ risk aversion in Weitzman’s model showing that with Von Neuman-Morgestern utility, worker’s preference for a share contract rather than a traditional wage one depends on the (mainly subjective) probability of unemployment in the two systems and that a risk premium may emerge which increases marginal cost of labour in a share system. On the other hand the firm would prefer the share solution only if an improvement in its expected revenue occurs as a consequence of it, e. g. through higher labour productivity or lower transaction costs. The increase in expected revenue must be sufficient to finance the risk premium through the whole lenght of the share labour contract. Since this condition could be hard to come true (inreasingly with the degree of participation) and thus Weitzman’s <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> not viable in a risk-aversion world, we argue that Meade’s model (which includes some degree of management sharing) is a good solution to “institutionalise” the risk premium. We show the intrinsic equivalence — with respect to labour compensation — of the two models, a property which allows the integration to solve the risk problem. However a fundamental difference arises within the sphere of property rights, an aspect wich is deepened in the appendix. Finally, using a game-theoretical framework, we analise the strategic aspects of firm’s choice for a participatory or a traditional wage model, obtaining a set of conditions on relative profits and labour demanded which helps to understand when and where a <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> may arise. We conclude stressing that, even if every condition regarding workers’ and firms’ preferences for a share solution were satisfied, a <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> needs the development of some kind of permanent training system, in order to provide workers with indispensable competences (cultural and professional) vitally to the working of a share system where risk were institutionally offset through participation to management as well. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze and compare the <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> and the {{constitutional}} economy approaches. The fact that numerous world-class multinationals have chosen to offer stock options to managers and bonus share incentives to employees denotes a realization that any improvement in the performance of an economy affected by several constraints, as is the case in the European economy, can only be achieved by assigning greater responsibility to managers and employees. Design/methodology/approach – The paper underlines the positive and negative aspects of both approaches with a critical analysis of the theories. The authors' interest in M. L. Weizman's model of the <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> stems from this basic reflection, despite the model's excessive reliance in the capacity of the state to resolve the problems at hand using ordinary legislative instruments. J. M. Buchanan's extremely interesting and indeed fundamental considerations concerning the pressures exerted on institutions by particular or individual interests are virtually overlooked. Findings – The weakness of the <b>share</b> <b>economy</b> approach can be effectively contrasted by integrating it with the constitutional economy approach. A substantial difference between Weitzman's and Buchanan's schemes stems from the reliance, exhibited by the former, on the institutions governing the contracts between individual players. Originality/value – The paper focuses on the analogies between Weitzman's and Buchanan's positions in order to set up a unifying framework for the analysis of workforce and other production inputs of the economical system.
