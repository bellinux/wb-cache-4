In this work a complete study of <b>solar</b> <b>events</b> occurred from January 2003 to December 2005, is considered. This three-years time period characterized by an unexpected activity of the Sun was divided into 27 -day intervals starting from BR 2313 (06. 01. 2003) to 2353 (21. 12. 2005), generating diagrams of the cosmic ray intensity data recorded at the Athens Neutron Monitor Station.

A mapping of all available <b>solar</b> and interplanetary <b>events,</b> such as <b>solar</b> flares with importance M and X, coronal mass ejections (Halo and Partial) was done. As we are going down from the solar maximum to the declining phase of the 23 rd solar cycle, a statistical overview of the corresponding relationship among these phenomena, the significant percentage of the connection of Halo CMEs and solar flares and the respective connection to Forbush decreases on yearly and monthly basis are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: Large <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> (SPEs) {{affect the}} solar-terrestrial space {{environment}} {{and become a}} very important aspect in space weather research. In this work, we statistically investigate 78 <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> of 1996 - 2011 and find that there exists a longitudinally asymmetric distribution of flare sources of the <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> observed near 1 AU, namely, with the same longitude separation between magnetic field line footpoint of observer and flare sources, {{the number of the}} <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> originating from sources located at eastern side of the nominal magnetic footpoint of observer is much larger than that of the <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> originating from sources located at western side. A complete model calculation of solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation in the three-dimensional Parker interplanetary magnetic field is presented to give a numerical explanation for this longitudinally asymmetric distribution phenomenon. We find that the longitudinally asymmetric distribution of <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> results from the east-west azimuthal asymmetry in the topology of the Parker interplanetary magnetic field as well as the effects of perpendicular diffusion on the transport of SEPs in the heliosphere. Our results would be valuable in understanding the solar-terrestrial relations and useful in space weather forecasting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{considers}} whether spikes in nitrate in snow sampled at Summit, Greenland, from August 2000 to August 2002 {{are related}} to <b>solar</b> proton <b>events.</b> After identifying tropospheric sources of nitrate {{on the basis of}} correlations with sulfate, ammonium, sodium, and calcium, we use the three-dimensional global Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to examine unaccounted for nitrate spikes. Model calculations confirm that <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> significantly impact HOx, NOx, and O 3 levels in the mesosphere and stratosphere during the weeks and months following the major 9 November 2000 <b>solar</b> proton <b>event.</b> However, <b>solar</b> proton <b>event</b> (SPE) -enhanced NOy calculated within the atmospheric column is too small to account for the observed nitrate peaks in surface snow. Instead, our WACCM results suggest that nitrate spikes not readily accounted for by measurement correlations are likely of anthropogenic origin. These results, consistent with other recent studies, imply that nitrate spikes in ice cores are not suitable proxies for individual SPEs and motivate the need to identify alternative proxies. Key Points A global model simulates nitrate deposition from <b>solar</b> proton <b>events</b> Soluble ion correlations in Summit snow identify tropospheric sources of nitrate Nitrate ions in snow are found not to be a good proxy for <b>solar</b> proton <b>events...</b>|$|R
