40|$|Abstract: The natural {{immune system}} (NIS) protects the body against {{unwanted}} foreign material (non-self cells) that could damage the body (self cells). The NIS can be modeled into an artificial immune system (AIS) to detect any non-self patterns in a non-biological environment. Detectors in the NIS can change from their initial mature <b>status</b> to <b>memory</b> <b>status</b> detectors or to annihilated <b>status.</b> A <b>memory</b> detector is a detector that frequently detects non-self cells {{and is a}} general detector for a subset of non-self cells. The NIS uses these memory detectors in a faster response to non-self cells. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the genetic artificial immune system (GAIS) which evolves these non-self detectors and determine their state using a life counter function. Only detectors with mature or <b>memory</b> <b>status</b> are used to detect non-self. Thus, the number of detectors is dynamically determined by the life counter function.

Retrospectively, we examined the role of explicit, intentional retrieval strategies in priming. We constructed our task by taking factors into account that were known to complicate the measurement of significant and valid priming effects. Within our sample of 170 cognitively healthy elderly persons of 55 - 94 years old, we found no effects on priming of age, gender, education, intelligence, cognitive <b>status,</b> <b>memory</b> complaints, or depressive symptoms. Participants that subsequent to task administration reported awareness of the study-test relationship obtained higher priming scores.

[...] Boston UniversityBackground: Impairment in {{instrumental}} {{activities of}} daily living (IADL) begins as individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) transition to Alzheimer‟s disease (AD) dementia. IADL impairment in AD dementia has been associated with inferior parietal, inferior temporal, and superior occipital hypometabolism using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between regional cerebral FDG metabolism and IADL cross-sectionally and longitudinally in clinically normal (CN) elderly, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects. Methods: Four hundred and two subjects (104 CN, 203 MCI, 95 AD dementia) participating in the Alzheimer‟s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative at academic centers across North America underwent clinical assessments every 6 to 12 months for up to 3 years and FDG-PET at their baseline visits. The subjective informant-based Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was used to assess IADL. Data reduction analyses were first conducted to reduce 35 FDG regions to 6 regions that significantly associated with total FAQ score after adjusting for multiple tests. These 6 FDG regions were then entered into a general linear model with backward elimination (p< 0. 05) assessing their cross-sectional relation to baseline FAQ and a mixed random and fixed coefficient linear longitudinal regression model assessing their relation to FAQ over time. Analyses included the following covariates: diagnosis, demographics, Apolipoprotein E 4 (ApoE 4) carrier <b>status,</b> <b>memory</b> and executive function, and behavioral factors. Results: The cross-sectional analysis showed that middle frontal (p= 0. 003) and orbitofrontal hypometabolism (p= 0. 009) were significantly associated with greater IADL impairment. Additionally, the interaction of diagnosis with posterior cingulate (p< 0. 0001) and with parahippocampal hypometabolism (p= 0. 0008) showed a steeper decline in IADL performance as FDG metabolism decreased for the AD dementia group relative to the MCI group, and the MCI group relative to the CN group. The longitudinal analysis showed that baseline middle frontal (p= 0. 0005) and posterior cingulate hypometabolism (p= 0. 004) were significantly associated with greater rate of increase in IADL impairment over time. Conclusions: These results suggest that frontal and medial parietal synaptic dysfunction relates to functional decline at baseline and over time across the AD spectrum independent of demographics, APOE 4 carrier <b>status,</b> <b>memory</b> and executive function performance, and behavioral factors...|$|E

Low iron status {{may be associated}} with negative brain and cognitive performance outcomes that persist after iron repletion, but results are mixed. Research is needed to combine measures of iron status, brain function, and cognitive performance in early infancy. Objectives: To determine whether, in infants aged 4 - 6 months: 1) there is an association between low iron status and brain responses to a memory task; 2) low iron status is associated with memory performance; and 3) brain function mediates the hypothesized relationship between iron <b>status</b> and <b>memory</b> performance. Methods: We measured iron status, brain function with event-related potentials (ERP) during a memory task, and memory performance in 4 - 6 month old infants. Results: Serum ferritin (sFt), but not hemoglobin was associated with an attenuated ERP response to novel versus familiar stimuli. Estimated body iron and sFt were associated with novelty preference by trial (%Novtrl) after removing inattentive trials, and the association between sFt and %Novtrl was stronger in infants with low iron stores (sFt < 45. 0 [MICRO SIGN]g/L). The data did not support our hypothesis that brain function mediates the relationship between iron <b>status</b> and <b>memory</b> performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mobile {{applications}} {{are becoming increasingly}} ubiquitous and provide ever richer functionality on mobile devices. At the same time, such devices often enjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and desktops to commercial clouds. Despite increasing usage of mobile computing; using its full potential is difficult due to its inherent problems such as limited resource. Cloud computing can address these problems by executing mobile applications on resource providers external to the mobile device. The foundation of cloud computing is the delivery of services, software and processing capacity over the Internet, reducing cost, increasing storage, automating systems, decoupling of service delivery from underlying technology, and providing flexibility and mobility of information In this paper, we developed an architecture that uses cloud to do computations that consume resources badly on mobiles. It aims at finding the right spots in an application automatically where the execution can be partitioned and migrated to the cloud. Thus, an elastic application can augment the capabilities of a mobile device including computation power, storage, and network bandwidth, with the light of dynamic execution configuration according to device‟s <b>status</b> <b>memory,</b> and battery level. We demonstrate results of the proposed application model using data collected from one of our elastic application. ...|$|E

Objective: To compare change over time in general cognitive <b>status,</b> <b>memory</b> test performance, psychiatric symptoms, neurological signs, and functional abilities in patients with probable DLB and probable Alzheimer disease (AD). Design: Twenty-eight patients who met diagnostic criteria for DLB were recruited into the study from 3 sites. Patients with AD (n = 55) were selected from a larger cohort and matched 2 to 1 to the patients with DLB on age and baseline global cognitive status. Patients were followed up at 6 -month intervals for an average of 6. 2 visits and assessed at each visit with tests of global cognitive functioning and verbal learning and memory and measures of psychiatric, neurological, and functional status. Results: At the baseline evaluation, patients with DLB performed more poorly on a measure of constructional praxis and all measures of functional status. They also had more severe psychiatric symptoms and neurological signs than the AD group. Despite these initial differences, generalized estimating equations applied to regression analyses with repeated measures determined that the only difference between the 2 groups in change in cognitive test performance was on a measure of recognition memory; patients with AD declined, while patients with DLB remained relatively stable. Patients with DLB had relatively stable behavioral symptoms and visual illusions, whereas patients with AD had a significant increase in these symptoms over time. Neurological and functional changes over time were similar in the 2 groups. Conclusions: Both baseline and longitudinal differences between patients with DLB and patients with AD were noted; these have implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis takes a biographical {{approach}} to the West African collections at the Manchester Museum, unravelling the historical trajectories these objects have taken through time and space. At {{the heart of this}} study are the questions of how and why objects travelled {{from one side of the}} Atlantic Ocean to the other. I will also examine the ways they have subsequently been used (or disused), interpreted and understood. Despite a 'culture of amnesia' (Huyssen 1995) which has meant that the majority of these objects have, until now, remained under researched in the museum stores, this thesis shows how objects in the West African collections at the Manchester Museum have dynamic and pertinent stories to tell. Most of Europe's museums and galleries were established during the nineteenth century. As such the life-histories of many of the non-Western objects in these museum collections relate to histories of colonialism and its legacy. Although some museums are beginning to examine these connections in their recently curated displays, many other institutions have avoided tackling these subjects and the questions that they raise. Objects and their meanings exist on various levels, pointing to the specific as well as to the wider contexts in which they were produced, consumed and re-articulated. In addition to this, the meanings of objects are not fixed but shift and accrue over time. Through an interrogation of their materiality, museum objects enable us to unlock these complex, interconnected and often overlooked histories. Integral to these nuances of meaning are the themes of identity, <b>status,</b> <b>memory</b> and hybridity. By piecing together the fragmented archival information which exists about the West African collections at the Manchester Museum, via the use of a database compiled by the author, it is possible to consider the ways in which these themes are linked to and resonate through, objects. Crucial to this thesis is the consideration not only of the stories which objects tell, but also the possibilities for their present and future display that these shared narratives raise. Through a series of case studies this study examines how processes connected to colonialism, trade, industry and empire effected the production of, and interactions with, material culture in specific and tangible ways. As these case studies bring to light, there is much potential to utilise a biographical {{approach to}} incorporate new perspectives, shared histories and contemporary meanings relating to these objects into museum displays. Objects actively shape the interactions which take place through and around them. In the last two chapters of this thesis I use the idea of the contact zone (Pratt 1992, Clifford 1997) to demonstrate how the West African collections at the Manchester Museum can be used to facilitate ongoing relationships within the museum today. As I assess in the conclusion, the milieu of critical self-evaluation in which this thesis is located and the growing interest in the meanings of the museum objects, is gradually being reflected in museum practice through its displays as well as its rhetoric. Within this context this thesis shows how, through a biographical approach to objects and by drawing on the contact zone perspective, the museum environment can act as a dialogic arena in which complex meanings and histories can be investigated and debated. 9 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Our {{aim was to}} investigate <b>memory</b> <b>status</b> in cirrhotic patients with and without clinically overt HE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two cirrhotic patients (10 female and 22 male) aged 49 +/- 17 years and 20 healthy subjects (six female and 14 male) aged 46 +/- 12 years {{were included in the}} study. <b>Memory</b> <b>status</b> was defined by Wechsler Memory Scale, verbal memory process and complex memory process tests. RESULTS: Grade- 1 HE was detected in 7 (22 %) patients with cirrhosis. We detected 36 to 92 % decrement in various memory tests in cirrhotic patients without HE as compared to healthy subjects. The scores for all psychometric testing results were significantly lower in cirrhotic patients without HE as compared to healthy subjects. We detected 42. 9 to 100 % decrement in various memory tests in cirrhotic patients with HE than cirrhotic patients without HE.

Objectives: (1) To describe a two-step population screening for identifying adults with MCI {{from the general}} population for research purposes, by questionnaire and telephone; (2) to compare screening by telephone (method 1) to a subsequent face-to-face assessment (method 2). Methods: In method 1, subjects with memory complaints were identified {{from the general population}} (n = 5491) by a postal questionnaire. Subsequently, cognitive <b>status</b> and <b>memory</b> were assessed in a telephone interview using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and the Ten Word Learning Test. Next, subjects with MCI according to method 1 were subjected to a face-to-face assessment for method 2, in which cognitive <b>status</b> and <b>memory</b> were assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Results: Two hundred and twenty-seven subjects completed both the telephone interview and the face-to-face assessment. Ninety-three subjects (41 %) had MCI according to both methods. Seven subjects (3 %) failed to meet MCI criteria according to method two because of an MMSE score < 24; 127 subjects (56 %) failed because of normal AVLT scores. Conclusion: (1) The two-step population screening was able to detect a considerable number of MCI-subjects in the general population; (2) agreement between both methods was moderate. Therefore, the method of recruiting subjects for (epidemiological) studies has to be taken into consideration when interpreting results of these studies.

A central processor unit coordinates all communications between the consoles and the lower level distributed processing power, and continuously updates a central memory which contains the whole machine <b>status.</b> This <b>memory</b> constitutes the machine database prototype. A simple message passing scheme built on a system of mailboxes takes advantage of high speed busses and of Fiber Optic interfaces. Macintosh II personal computers are used as consoles. The lower levels are all built using the VME standard. I. DAΦNE The DAΦNE accelerator complex [1] of the INFN Frascati National Laboratories consists of a two ring colliding beam Φ-Factory and of a 510 MeV e+/e- injector for topping-up...|$|R
