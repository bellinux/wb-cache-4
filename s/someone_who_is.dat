Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{certain that}} God does not exist, {{someone who has}} {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

5|$|Moncoutié all but {{clinched}} his mountains classification triumph {{on stage}} 15. While he finished nine minutes behind Cobo on Angliru, {{he won the}} day's second climb to score ten mountain points and increase his lead over Montaguti to 22 points. He scored his final mountain classification points on stage 17, ending {{with a total of}} 63. Montaguti nearly reclaimed the jersey on stage 18, when he made a breakaway and Moncoutié did not. Fortunately for Moncoutié, teammate Sijmens had made the escape group and kept Montaguti from maximum points on four of the five climbs. Given that riders who are not involved in a classification nor have teammates that are will generally not ride against <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is,</b> Sijmens' presence in this breakway was effectively the only way Moncoutié could have retained the jersey. Moncoutié continued to lead Montaguti, by a score of 63-56. Neither rider scored again, and Moncoutié won his fourth consecutive mountains title, a first in Vuelta history. He was the team's best overall finisher as well, but was not any real threat, coming in 37th overall at a deficit of over an hour to Cobo. Taaramäe, for his part, did not complete the Vuelta, abandoning on stage 17.|$|E
