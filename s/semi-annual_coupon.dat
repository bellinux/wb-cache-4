Initially only tax-exempt pension funds were allowed to hold these bonds. The UK has issued around 20 index-linked bonds since then. Like conventional gilts, index-linked gilts pay coupons which are initially set in line with market interest rates. (Recently, real market interest yields for many (at times, all) index-linked gilts have been negative; but the coupons for new issues have been constrained to be at least +0.125%.)
