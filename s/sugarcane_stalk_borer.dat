40|$|At low {{doses of}} {{radiation}} F 1 sterility of the <b>sugarcane</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> Eldana saccharina can be attained. This {{bodes well for}} the progression of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) against this economically important pest. The mating behaviour of E. saccharina was investigated in still-air cage trials using video technology to determine whether mass-rearing and irradiation of adult moths altered their performance in lek formation and mating success compared to their wild counterparts. Mating frequency, calling frequency, mating duration, onset of mating and onset of calling were used to make comparisons and assessments in the bioassay. Results from this study indicated that males irradiated at 150 Gy are as competitive as wild males in mating behaviour. Mating combinations comprising both labreared male and female moths had higher mating frequencies than those comprising wild moths. There {{were no significant differences}} in mating performance between moths irradiated at 150 Gy and those irradiated at 200 Gy. Positive results from these trials indicate potential for the development of an effective commercial SIT approach in the integrated pest management programme against E. saccharina...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sugarcane</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> Eldana saccharina is {{the most}} {{injurious}} pest in the Zimbabwe sugar industry. With its increasing establishment and population build-up in the fields it was found necessary to conduct investigations into assessing current damage patterns and possible host plant mechanisms to add on to current management practices. The study was therefore aimed at variation in damage among sugarcane varieties and investigating morphological and biochemical traits associated with damage at the Zimbabwe Sugar Association Experiment Station. Rind total phenolics, condensed tannins, cane juice quality, root primordia diameter, primordia counts and pith expression were investigated for their association to damage. Damage {{was found to be}} highest in varieties ZN 1 L, ZN 4 and ZN 2 E while varieties CP 72 - 2086 and N 14 had the least damage. Percentage Tunnel length bored ranged between 1. 9 - 19. 6 %, % Stalk length red 4. 6 - 33. 4 % and % Internodes bored between 6. 9 - 32. 2 %. Of all the stalk characteristics assessed only cane juice purity was found to have a significant negative association with all damage parameters. ERC % cane was found to be associated only with % Internodes bored (r=- 0. 571, p< 0. 01) and not with % Stalk length red and % Tunnel length bored.

40|$|The <b>sugarcane</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borers,</b> Sesamia spp. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are {{the most}} {{destructive}} sugarcane insect pests in Iran. The efficiency of Telenomus busseolae Gahan (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) used alone or in combination with silicon fertilization was investigated for controlling the <b>sugarcane</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> under field conditions. The treatments were: a combination of silicon plus multiple releases of 2, 500 T. busseolae, and multiple releases of 5, 000, 2, 500 and 1, 250 T. busseolae alone. Plots receiving no soil amendment or parasites were included as the controls. Three weeks after the first application of each treatment, 100 shoots were selected randomly from each plot {{and the percentage of}} dead heart was determined. Then, three months after the first application of parasites, the percentage of stalks damaged, the percentage of internodes bored, and the level of parasitism were determined. Finally, at harvest the percentage of stalks damaged, the percentage of internodes bored, and sugarcane quality characteristics were determined. Results indicated that the efficiency of parasitism increased when combined with an application of silicon fertilizer. The release of 2, 500 T. busseolae followed by an application of silicon fertilizer decreased dead hearts to 4 %, while 12 % dead hearts was observed in the control plots. For the combination treatment, the percentages of stalk damage were 1. 5 % and 17. 2 %, at 3 weeks and 3 months after time release, respectively. However, the percentages of stalk damage were 35. 2 % and 51 % when no treatment was applied. Cane quality was significantly higher with the application of silicon fertilizer plus the release of 2, 500 T. busseolae, followed by releasing 5, 000 Hymenoptera. The level of parasitism was also greater when parasites were released in combination with an application of silicon. We conclude that biological control by egg parasitoids can be enhanced with concurrent applications of silicon fertilizer as a soil amendment and thereby creating a more robust, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program of <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> in Iranian <b>sugarcane</b> fields...|$|R
30|$|It {{is thought}} that the highly {{effective}} plant biomass degrading capacity found in intestines of many insect herbivores constitutes {{one of the most}} efficient naturally occurring bioreactors and could provide an important and interesting biotechnology source of microorganisms and enzymes for cellulose degradation (Sun and Scharf 2010). The <b>sugarcane</b> <b>stalks</b> <b>borer</b> Diatraea saccharalis is the major sugarcane pest in Argentina causing considerable damage to infested plants, which facilitates secondary fungal and/or bacterial infections, resulting in important economic losses to producers. Due to the high and rapid sugarcane feeding capacity of larvae of this species, we hypothesized that larvae only fed on sugarcane, could have developed a consortium community of symbiotic-bacteria possessing an enzyme arsenal which efficiently degrade sugarcane plant tissue. Supporting this theory are recently published studies where a comparison among gut microbiota from Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera species, show correlation between the cellulolytic enzyme activities in the insect gut with the lignocellulosic biomass composition in the food consumed by the insect (Shi et al. 2011; Cardoso et al. 2012). These results suggest that larvae fed on a specific plant species develops or carries symbiotic bacteria possessing a highly efficient enzyme arsenal that allows the insect to rapidly process a specific plant biomass. Thus, we wanted to isolate cellulolytic bacteria from larvae feeding on sugarcane in order to explore their potential as a source of enzymes for efficient sugarcane biomass degradation that could be employed in second generation bioethanol production or other biomass treatments.|$|R
40|$|The South African sugar {{industry}} {{is one of}} the world’s leading <b>sugarcane</b> producers. The <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> Eldana saccharina has for many years been the most destructive pest in the South African {{sugar industry}} and is the most important factor limiting sugarcane productivity. The pest has been monitored using a traditional visual approach whereby a representative sample of stalks is taken from a field and split longitudinally to assess damage and count the number of E. saccharina. This approach is time-consuming, labour intensive and sometimes biased as, in some instances, only easily accessible areas are surveyed. To investigate a more economical but equally sensitive survey methodology, this paper aims at determining the potential use of hyperspectral remote sensing (spectroradiometry) for identifying sugarcane infested by E. saccharina. A hand-held ASD (Field Spec ® 3) spectroradiometer was used to take leaf spectral measurements of sugarcane plants from a potted-plant trial taking place under shade house conditions. In this trial, nitrogen and silicon fertiliser applications as well as varieties used were known. In addition, watering regimes and artificial infestation of E. saccharina were carefully controlled. Results illustrated that severe E. saccharina infestatio...|$|R

40|$|Maize is {{the staple}} food crop and {{source of income}} for {{majority}} of the Kenyan population and many sub-Saharan African countries. The increasing Kenyan population demands an increase in maize production if intermittent food deficits have to be averted. Since the introduction of improved maize varieties in mid- 1960, the start of Green Revolution period, maize yields increased drastically up to 1970 s and started declining from 1980 s to-date. The key contributory factors are nutrient mining, sub-optimal input use and insect pest damage. Of the insect pests, <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> is of economic importance. Currently, KARI and CIMMYT are developing maize varieties that are tolerant to <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> damage. In order to evaluate the potential impact of these interventions economics of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> control at farm level was evaluated. Surveys complemented with on-farm trials were executed in six major maize growing zones of Kenya. Farmers were randomly selected and a sample-frame established after which a total of 1854 households were randomly selected using random sampling technique. Each household was interviewed using structured questionnaire. Data on method of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> control and the type insecticides used was collected. Partial budget and economic surplus models were used. The results indicated that very few farmers control <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> in maize despite significant <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> losses of about 15 %. Therefore if Bt maize is introduced in Kenya it is likely to reduce these losses.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> (Papaipema nebris (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)) injury, imposed at corn-leaf stages 1 through 7, on visible injury, stalk elongation, and grain yield were {{evaluated}} in a three-year study. Tunneling by <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> in seven-leaf corn {{was confined to}} the lower nine internodes. A fifth-instar <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> that survives to pupation {{would be expected to}} produce a tunnel 15. 8 cm long. Although tunneling shortens internodes at and above the tunnel, yield loss varied by year. A six-class scale was developed to evaluate injury. The average injury rating for a plot declined 0. 332 ± 0. 033 points per leaf stage. In years of adequate rainfall, yields declined linearly as plants were attacked later in development. Injury profiles were developed to describe feeding injury. Plot yield losses seem to be moderated by the ability of uninfested or slightly injured plants to compensate for severe <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> injury. Regression models were developed to predict plot yield and individual plant yield. Models for individual plant yield were combined with injury profiles to predict grain yield as a function of percentage of plants injured and corn development stage. Economic injury levels and economic thresholds were determined and a management program was presented. In a second study, degree-day models were used to time insecticide applications (permethrin) to egg hatch and larval movement. Although applications at egg hatch significantly reduced <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> density in grass terraces by 54 - 85 %, applications timed with movement were more effective in reducing severe damage to corn.

We examine if smallholder farmers that adopted insect-resistant (Bt) varieties of white maize benefited from planting Bt over the last three seasons. Commercial farmers are known to benefit from planting Bt maize in high <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> or corn borer infestation years, but when planted in locations or years when <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> are not a problem, Bt will usually not be profitable because of higher seed costs. In the first two production seasons, small farmers enjoyed higher yields with Bt maize than with conventional hybrid varieties despite lower-than-normal (yet still significant) <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> pressure and less-than-ideal maize production conditions. Yield is expressed according to grain per kilogram of seed planted, as seeding rates per land area differ drastically between small-scale farmers. The value of the yield benefit depended on how the farmer utilized the additional grain, with the highest valued use being home grinding and consumption substituting for more expensive store purchases.

Certain genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produce toxins that specifically target lepidopteran insects, of which E. saccharina is one. In an attempt to confer resistance to this pest, a genetic construct containing a shortened version of a suitable wild-type Bt insecticidal gene was inserted into cultivar NCo 310 embryogenic callus by particle bombardment.

However, further analysis revealed that the gene produced transcripts (mRNA) in only 80 % of these transgenic plants. More striking was the observation {{that only a few}} full length transcripts, necessary for the synthesis of the insecticidal protein, were produced in all cases. Poor expression of the toxin in these plants was confirmed during eldanaresistance pot trials, where none of the lines displayed resistance to infestation by the insect.
