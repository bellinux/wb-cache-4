40|$|Abstract: From {{an article}} {{published}} by our group by Medeiros et al, we discuss and review {{the literature on the}} role of <b>serum</b> specific anti-ascaris <b>IgE</b> in patients with respiratory allergies living in coun-tries where helminthic infestations are common. Medeiros et al conducted a study using 101 patients aged 12 to 21 years with respiratory allergy. Median IgE level was 660 IU/mL. <b>Serum</b> spe-cific anti-ascaris <b>IgE</b> was positive in 73 % (74 / 101) of the individu-als, but parasitological stool examination yielded positive results in only 33. 7 % (34 / 101). The correlation coefficient between <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> level and <b>serum</b> specific anti-ascaris <b>IgE</b> was 0. 52 (P 0. 001) and this effect occurred regardless of eosinophil count and of the presence of intestinal helminthic infection. In patients with respiratory allergy with very high <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> levels, in whom the past or present history of parasitic infection is a possible explanation, the presence of <b>serum</b> specific anti-ascaris <b>IgE</b> was common and should be better evaluated in allergic patients from Ascaris lumbricoides endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Omalizumab, a {{monoclonal}} anti-IgE antibody, {{is currently}} indicated {{for the treatment}} of moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. To measure active IgE levels in sera from patients treated with omalizu-mab, the IgE subfraction in complex with omalizumab should be eliminated from total IgE, and free IgE levels can then be determined. With the aim of therapeutic monitoring for anti-IgE therapy, we developed a new ELISA for free IgE. Methods: We used recombinant human soluble FcεRIα as a capture antigen and a biotinylated polyclonal anti-IgE antibody for detection. Using the newly developed ELISA, we measured the <b>serum</b> free <b>IgE</b> levels weekly in four asthmatic patients after their first omalizumab injection. We also measured the <b>serum</b> free <b>IgE</b> levels in 54 patients treated with omalizumab for over 4 weeks. Results: This assay was technically robust, the mean recovery rate in serum was 93. 16 % ± 5. 34 %. For all pa-tients, omalizumab treatment significantly reduced <b>serum</b> free <b>IgE</b> levels prior to the second omalizumab injec-tion. To maintain the benefit of omalizumab, <b>serum</b> free <b>IgE</b> concentrations should be 50 ngml. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the measurement of free IgE levels using our newly developed ELISA would be useful for monitoring <b>serum</b> free <b>IgE</b> levels during omalizumab therapy...|$|R
25|$|<b>Serum</b> <b>IgE</b> {{can be used}} {{to guide}} {{treatment}}, and levels are checked every 6–8 week after steroid treatment commences, followed by every 8 weeks for one year.

25|$|Serum {{blood tests}} are an {{important}} marker of disease severity, and are also useful for the primary diagnosis of ABPA. When <b>serum</b> <b>IgE</b> is normal (and patients are not being treated by glucocorticoid medications), ABPA is excluded {{as the cause of}} symptoms. A raised IgE increases suspicion, though there is no universally accepted cut-off value. Values can be stated in international units (IU/mL) or ng/mL, where 1 IU is equal to 2.4ng/mL. Since studies began documenting IgE levels in ABPA during the 1970s, various cut-offs between 833–1000 IU/mL have been employed to both exclude ABPA and to warrant further serological testing. Current consensus is that a cut-off of 1000 IU/mL should be employed, as lower values are encountered in SAFS and asthmatic sensitization.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Differential {{diagnosis}} of allergic conjunctivitis or dry eye is sometimes {{very difficult to}} diagnose by symptoms and clinical examination alone, especially in older patients. It was hypothesised that clinically allergic patients who were <b>serum</b> antigen specific <b>IgE</b> negative were candidates for dry eye. METHODS: Sixty patients were studied prospectively who were clinically diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis by their itchy sensation and papilla formation of conjunctiva. They consisted of 30 <b>serum</b> antigen specific <b>IgE</b> positive and 30 IgE negative patients, with {{no significant differences in}} age. Dry eye examination and <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> were performed on these two groups. RESULTS: No significant differences were seen between the two groups with regard to age (p = 0. 76) and sex ratio. The antibody negative group had lower Schirmer's test scores (p = 0. 002), lower tear clearance (p = 0. 0001), lower tear function index (p = 0. 0001), and lower <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> (p = 0. 04) than the antibody positive group. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the evaluation of <b>serum</b> antigen specific <b>IgE</b> and tear dynamics are important for the differential {{diagnosis of}} patients with allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye.

40|$|Background: <b>Serum</b> {{specific}} <b>IgE</b> or skin prick {{tests are}} less useful at levels below accepted decision points. Objectives: We sought {{to develop and}} validate a model to predict food challenge outcome by using routinely collected data in a diverse sample of children considered suitable for food challenge. Methods: The proto-algorithm was generated by using a limited data set from 1 service (phase 1). We retrospectively applied, evaluated, and modified the initial model by using an extended data set in another center (phase 2). Finally, we prospectively validated the model in a blind study in a further group of children undergoing food challenge for peanut, milk, or egg in the second center (phase 3). Allergen-specific models were developed for peanut, egg, and milk. Results: Phase 1 (N = 429) identified 5 clinical factors associated with diagnosis of food allergy by food challenge. In phase 2 (N = 289), we examined the predictive ability of 6 clinical factors: skin prick test, <b>serum</b> specific <b>IgE,</b> total <b>IgE</b> minus <b>serum</b> specific <b>IgE,</b> symptoms, sex, and age. In phase 3 (N = 70), 97 % of cases were accurately predicted as positive and 94 % as negative. Our model showed an advantage in clinical prediction compared with <b>serum</b> specific <b>IgE</b> only, skin prick test only, and <b>serum</b> specific <b>IgE</b> and skin prick test (92 % accuracy vs 57 %, and 81 %, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings have implications for the improved delivery of food allergy–related health care, enhanced food allergy–related quality of life, and economized use of health service resources by decreasing the number of food challenges performed. <br/...|$|R

Three hundred children below the age of fifteen years meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled for the study. <b>Serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> levels and absolute eosinophils count were done in all patients. Data was collected and tabulated. Chi-square was applied to test the association of the variables using SPSS and p-value of < 0. 05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: Out of 300 patients, 27 (9 %) had raised both <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> and absolute eosinophils count, 146 (48. 67 %) had raised <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> alone, 40 (13. 3 %) had raised absolute eosinophils count alone. Both IgE plus absolute eosinophilic count, total IgE alone and absolute eosinophilic count alone are not {{significantly related to the}} child sex with (P-values 0. 759, 0. 742, 0. 699) respectively, however all are related significantly to the child age (P-values < 0. 004, < 0. 001, < 0. 012) respectively. All are not related significantly to systemic allergies except the significant relation between the absolute eosinophils count with atopic dermatitis (P-value < 0. 031) Conclusion: <b>Serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> level and absolute eosinophils count, total IgE alone and absolute eosinophils count alone are not a good predictor of allergy in children except that the absolute eosinophils count can be considered as a strong predictor of atopic dermatitis in children.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of retinol-binding protein (RBP) 4 in childhood asthma and its association with atopy markers, pulmonary function, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in relation to obesity. We studied 160 children between the ages 6 to 10 yr, including 122 asthmatics and 38 controls. The body mass index, pulmonary function tests, and methacholine challenge tests were measured on the same day. Total eosinophil count, <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE,</b> <b>serum</b> eosinophil cationic protein, and serum RBP 4 were measured in all subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Eotaxin (chemokine, CC motif, ligand; CCL 11) is {{a potent}} {{eosinophil}} chemoattractant strongly implicated in the pathobiology of asthma. Genetic variation at the CCL 11 locus has been correlated with <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE,</b> blood eosinophil counts, and circulating eotaxin protein levels in several case-control asthma studies. Family-based association studies of CCL 11 genetic variants have not been reported to date. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 9 common CCL 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nuclear families ascertained through patients with asthma participating in the Childhood Asthma Management Program study. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed by using minisequencing and probe hybridization platforms. Family-based association analysis for asthma and 4 asthma-related intermediate quantitative phenotypes was performed by using FBAT. RESULTS: One SNP, - 384 A>G, was associated with asthma among African American families (P =. 01). CCL 11 SNPs and haplotypes were not associated with asthma among white or Hispanic families. Two low-frequency alleles in strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium, - 426 C and IVS 2 + 199 A, were associated with lower <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> levels (P =. 0006 and P =. 009, respectively) in white families, whereas 2 more common variants, - 576 C and g. 4438 C, were associated with higher IgE levels in African American families (P =. 01 -. 04). Haplotype analysis in the white cohort provided additional evidence of association with <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE,</b> implicating 2 haplotypes. No single SNP or haplotype associations were observed with blood eosinophil levels, FEV(1), or airway responsiveness.

However, we observed a significant association between <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> levels and genetic markers at this locus both in 14 Japanese atopic families and in 120 unrelated Japanese subjects. We detected eight alleles at the D 11 S 97 locus and eight alleles in the CA/GT repeat region in the fifth intron of the Fc epsilon RI beta gene. A significantly increased frequency of the D 11 S 97 /PstI 0. 96 kb allele was observed in the chromosomes of the subjects with high <b>serum</b> total <b>IgE</b> levels both in the family study (p < 0. 001) and in the population study (p < 0. 05).
