Recent developments include several tailored products {{that focus on the}} key needs of the Irish aquaculture sector. In this article, an overview of the products and services derived from the models are presented. The authors give an overview of a shellfish model developed in-house and that was designed to predict the growth, the physiological interactions with the ecosystem, and the level of coliform contamination of the blue mussel. As such, this model is applicable in studies on the carrying capacity of embayments, assessment of the impacts of pollution on aquaculture grounds, and the determination of <b>shellfish</b> <b>water</b> classes. Further services include the assimilation of the model-predicted shelf water movement into a new harmful algal bloom alert system used to inform end users of potential toxic shellfish events and high biomass blooms that include fish-killing species. Models are also used to identify potential sites for offshore aquaculture, to inform studies of potential cross-contamination in farms from the dispersal of planktonic sea lice larvae and other pathogens that can infect finfish, and to provide modelled products that underpin the assessment and advisory services on the sustainable exploitation of the resources of marine fisheries.

40|$|Changes in {{rainfall}} patterns {{associated with}} climate change {{can affect the}} operation of a combined sewer system, with the potential increase in rainfall amount. This could lead to excessive spill frequencies and could also introduce hazardous substances into the receiving waters, which, in turn, would {{have an impact on}} the quality of shellfish and bathing waters. This paper quantifies the spilling volume, duration and frequency of 19 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) to receiving waters under two climate change scenarios, the high (A 1 FI), and the low emissions (B 1) scenarios, simulated by three global climate models (GCMs), for a study catchment in northwest England. The future rainfall is downscaled, using climatic variables from HadCM 3, CSIRO and CGCM 2 GCMs, with the use of a hybrid generalized linear–artificial neural network model. The results from the model simulation for the future in 2080 showed an annual increase of 37 % in total spill volume, 32 % in total spill duration, and 12 % in spill frequency for the <b>shellfish</b> <b>water</b> limiting requirements. These results were obtained, under the high emissions scenario, as projected by the HadCM 3 as maximum. Nevertheless, the catchment drainage system is projected to cope with the future conditions in 2080 by all three GCMs. The results also indicate that under scenario B 1, a significant drop was projected by CSIRO, which in the worst case could reach up to 50 % in spill volume, 39 % in spill duration and 25 % in spill frequency. The results further show that, during the bathing season, a substantial drop is expected in the CSO spill drivers, as predicted by all GCMs under both scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Abstract―Due to the {{determination}} of the pollution status of fresh resources in the Egyptian territorial waters is very important for public health; this study was carried out to reveal the levels of heavy metals in the shellfish and their environment and its relation to the highly developed industrial activities in those areas. A total of 100 shellfish samples from the Rosetta, Edku, El-Maadiya, Abo-Kir and El-Max coasts [10 crustaceans (shrimp) and 10 mollusks (oysters) ] were randomly collected from each coast. Additionally, 10 samples from both the water and the sediment were collected from each coast. Each collected sample was analyzed for cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc residues using a Perkin Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The results showed that the levels of heavy metals were higher in the water and sediment from Abo-Kir. The heavy metal levels decreased successively for the Rosetta, Edku, El-Maadiya, and El-Max coasts, and the concentrations of heavy metals, except copper and zinc, in shellfish exhibited the same pattern. For the concentration of heavy metals in shellfish tissue, the highest was zinc and the concentrations decreased successively for copper, lead, chromium and cadmium for all coasts, except the Abo-Kir coast, where the chromium level was highest and the other metals decreased successively for zinc, copper, lead and cadmium. In Rosetta, chromium was higher only in the mollusks, while the level of this metal was lower in the crustaceans; this trend was observed at the Edku, El-Maadiya and El-Max coasts as well. Herein, we discuss the importance of such contamination for public health and the sources of shellfish contamination with heavy metals. We suggest measures to minimize and prevent these pollutants in the aquatic environment and, furthermore, how to protect humans from excessive intake.

Environmental Protection Agency’s National Estuary Program, {{which is}} a joint local/state/federal program {{established}} under the Clean Water Act with the goal of protecting and enhancing nationally significant estuarine resources. The NHEP is funded by the EPA and is administered by the University of New Hampshire. The NHEP’s Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for New Hampshire’s estuaries was completed in 2000 and implementation is ongoing. The Management Plan outlines key issues related to management of New Hampshire 2 ̆ 7 s estuaries and proposes strategies (Action Plans) that are expected to preserve, protect, and enhance the State 2 ̆ 7 s estuarine resources. The NHEP 2 ̆ 7 s priorities were established by local stakeholders and include water quality improvements, shellfish resources, land protection, and habitat restoration. Projects addressing these priorities are undertaken throughout NH 2 ̆ 7 s coastal watershed, which includes 42 communities. Every three years, the NHEP prepares a State of the Estuaries report with information on the status and trends of a select group of environmental indicators from the coastal watershed and estuaries. The report provides the NHEP, state natural resource managers, local officials, conservation organizations, and the public with information on the effects of management actions and decisions. Prior to developing each State of the Estuaries report, the NHEP publishes four technical data reports (“indicator reports”) that illustrate the status and trends of the complete collection of indicators tracked by the NHEP. Each report focuses on a different suite of indicators: <b>Shellfish,</b> <b>Water</b> Quality, Land Use and Development, and Critical Habitats and Species. All of the indicators are presented to the NHEP Technical Advisory Committee, which selects a subset of indicators to be presented to the NHEP Management Committee and {{to be included in the}} State of the Estuaries report. The Management Committee reviews the indicators and finalizes the list to be included in the report. Between 10 and 20 indicators are included in each State of the Estuaries report. The 2006 Critical Habitats and Species Indicator Report is the second NHEP indicator report on this subject. Data from this report will be used in the 2006 State of the Estuaries report. The following sections contain the most recent data for the 10 habitat and species indicators tracked by the NHEP. In some cases the NHEP funds data collection and monitoring activities; however data for the majority of indicators are provided by other organizations with monitoring programs. The details of the monitoring programs and performance criteria for the indicators are listed in the NHEP Monitoring Plan (NHEP, 2004). The results and interpretations for the indicators presented in this report have been peer reviewed by the NHEP Technical Advisory Committee and other experts in relevant fields.

40|$|In North Carolina, {{more than}} 100, 000 acres of <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> {{have been closed}} to shellfishing, many since the Clean Water Act {{was put in place}} in 1972. These waters are {{considered}} impaired because of levels of fecal coliform bacteria in excess of a set water quality standard. By law, the state must develop a TMDL, or total maximum daily load, for each impaired water body. 	In North Carolina, only one TMDL for fecal coliform in <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> has been developed in the State, and it has not been implemented. North Carolina does not offer any guidelines for implementing these TMDLs. The purpose of this project was to use case study TMDLs for nonpoint sources of fecal coliform in <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> to see how they have been implemented and what North Carolina could learn from this. Land use was analyzed for coastal North Carolina counties, and the counties were categorized based on those land uses as forest, agriculture, or developed. Two case study TMDLs were selected for each category. After reading each case study, the TMDL contact for the state was interviewed about implementation of the case study and general guidelines for implementation in the state. Though some of these case studies were approved as early as 2004, none have been implemented. In addition, each state had different methods for dealing with TMDL implementation. Other means of improving water quality before TMDL development were also investigated. These included different types of best management practices, action by stakeholders, and watershed management plans. Any of these could be used to prevent water quality impairment or to improve degraded water quality. Actions can be taken on state and local levels to improve water quality in closed <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> in North Carolina. Locally, sources of fecal coliform should be identified so appropriate best management practices can be selected and implemented.

Under EU regulation this risk to consumers {{is controlled by}} determining the sanitary quality of bivalve shellfish production areas based on the concentration of Escherichia coli present in shellfish flesh. The authors present a modelling approach to simulate an uptake of E. coli from seawater and subsequent depuration by Mytilus edulis. The model that dynamically predicts E. coli concentration in the mussel tissue is embedded within a 3 -D numerical modelling system comprising hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, shellfish ecophysiological and the newly proposed microbial modules. The microbial module has two state variables, namely, the concentrations of E. coli in water and in the mussel tissue. Novel formulations to calculate the filtration rates by mussels and the resulting uptake of bacteria are proposed; these rates are updated at every computational time step. Concentrations of E. coli in seawater are also updated accordingly {{taking into account the}} amounts ingested by mussels. The model has been applied to Bantry Bay in the south-west of Ireland. The results indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the official classification of <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> in the bay based on monthly sampling at several stations. The predicted filtration rates and ratios of E. coli in water and mussels also compare well with the literature. The model thus forms a tool that may be used to assist in the classification of <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> at much greater spatial and temporal detail than that offered by a field monitoring programme. Moreover, it can also aid in designing an efficient monitoring programme. The model can also be utilised to determine the contribution of individual point sources of pollution on the microbial loading in mussels and, when incorporated into an operational framework, it can provide a short-term forecasting of microbial contamination in a shellfishery.

40|$|A {{method of}} reverse {{transcription}} (RT) and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) {{for the detection of}} Norwalk virus in human stools was developed. A cationic detergent, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, was found to effectively remove from stool extracts factors that inhibit the RT-PCR assay. The specificities of the tests were shown by hybridization of the amplified DNA with Norwalk virus-specific cDNA probes and a consistent correlation between virus detection in stools and infection of volunteers. RT-PCR detected virus in stool samples diluted 10 (- 4) and was about 100 times more sensitive than dot blot hybridization. In serial stool samples collected before and at different times after inoculation of 10 volunteers with Norwalk virus, 37 of 55 were positive by RT-PCR, but only 27 were positive by dot blot hybridization (chi 2 = 22. 96; P less than 0. 001). Further application of this method should allow detection of Norwalk virus in food or environmental samples such as <b>shellfish</b> and <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{water quality}} deteriorations in river and estuarine waters are a global issue. Particularly, {{the water quality}} {{impairment}} due to contamination of Faecal Bacteria Indicator, such as E. coli and Faecal Coliform in river channel, estuary bathing and <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> are of special interests due to potential risks to human health. These indicators are important in water quality assessment outlined in both EU Water Framework Directive and US Clear Water Act. The {{hypothesis of the study}} is that the global climate change and intensive farming would cause severe deterioration to faecal coliform levels in these water bodies. Approaches to quantify these impacts are carried out with numerically modelling through catchment model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and hydrodynamic model DIVAST with the focus in the coastal catchment of river Frome and Piddle connected to a natural harbour in Dorset, southern England. Firstly, the SWAT model is employed to assess the catchment flow regime and set up the baseline condition of river flow in both hourly and daily time step.

40|$|The cool, clean {{waters of}} Puget Sound provide {{some of the}} finest {{shellfish}} habitat in the world, contributing to Washington’s position as the nation’s leading producer of farmed bivalve shellfish. The region has established a strong record for restoring polluted <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters,</b> upgrading 8, 000 more commercial shellfish acres than were downgraded over the past ten years. While these efforts are essential and must continue, they also reveal important lessons and warning signs for future efforts. Pollution problems are surfacing in more areas, are increasingly complex and costly to resolve, and are exacerbated by landscape changes caused by population growth and development. These trends require more far-sighted strategies that shift emphasis away from symptoms and short-term fixes to lasting protection of water quality and watershed functions. New research underscores the need for better land use planning, watershed management and public education that promotes suitable land uses and infrastructure; preserves natural land cover and hydrologic systems; minimizes connectivity between pollution sources and receiving waters; strengthens practices to prevent pollution; establishes indicators and methods to measure landscape changes and cumulative impacts; and helps citizens and elected officials make better decisions to safeguard shellfish growing areas...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In October 1987, a {{red tide}} due to P. brevis {{affected}} the North Carolina coast {{for the first}} time. The purpose of our study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), an illness caused by eating shellfish contaminated with the neurotoxins of P. brevis. METHODS: Active surveillance was established for cases of NSP. A descriptive study of the NSP cases was then completed. RESULTS: Forty-eight persons, who had eaten oysters at 20 meals, met the case definition. A variety of gastrointestinal tract and neurological symptoms were reported. The illnesses were generally mild and of short duration, {{and there were no}} deaths. Forty-one (85 percent) affected persons lived in five communities located within a 70 -kilometer area along the coast. Cases occurred from October 27 to December 9; 27 (56 percent) of the cases occurred before the first closure of affected <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> on November 2. There was {{a significant increase in the}} illness attack rate with an increase in the number of oysters eaten. CONCLUSIONS: Routine monitoring of coastal waters for P. brevis is needed to facilitate earlier recognition of red tides, closure of affected areas, and education of the public before substantial exposure to contaminated shellfish occurs...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of highly pathogenic Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in <b>shellfish,</b> upstream <b>waters</b> and sediment from coastal shellfish sites was evaluated using the ISO/TS- 13136 method. Shellfish (oysters, mussels and cockles), {{water and sediment}} samples were collected monthly {{over a period of}} 1 year. The method used real-time PCR detection of stx 1, stx 2 and eae genes and genetic markers corresponding to the five major serogroups (O 157, O 26, O 103, O 111 and O 145) on enrichment broths and the identification of STEC when these genes and markers were detected. stx genes were detected in the broth of 33 % of shellfish batches (n = 126), 91 % of water samples (n = 117) and 28 % of sediment (n = 39). One stx 1 +, eae+ O 26 :H 11 strain was isolated from a shellfish batch, and O 26 :H 11, O 145 :H 28 and O 103 :H 2 strains without the stx gene (n = 9) were isolated from <b>shellfish</b> and <b>waters.</b> In conclusion, this study shows the suitability of the ISO/TS- 13136 method to assess the {{presence of}} highly pathogenic E. coli strains in shellfish farming areas.
