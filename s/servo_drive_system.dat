The crane should move the load {{as fast as possible}} without causing any excessive movement at the final position. However, most of the common gantry crane results in a swing motion when payload is suddenly stopped after a fast motion. The swing motion can be reduced but will be time consuming i. e. reduce the facility availability as well as productivity. Moreover, the gantry crane needs a skilful operator to control manually based on his or her experiences to stop the swing immediately at the right position. Furthermore to unload, the operator has to wait the load stop from swinging. The failure of controlling crane also might cause accident and may harm people and surrounding.

40|$|Servo systems play an {{important}} role in industrial automation. A servo system denotes a closed loop controlled system capable of tracking required demands. One way of achieving high performance <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> is to apply the closed loop control of an a. c. permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). PMSM is a type of machine which rotates once three-phase a. c. voltages are supplied. The usage of permanent magnet materials contributes to the high efficiency of PMSM, and makes it a popular type of machine in industrial applications. However, the interaction between the permanent magnets and the machine stator would generate torque ripple and consequently unsmooth speed. Therefore, torque ripple of PMSM need to be considered carefully in the control of such servo systems. An innovative control scheme combining an enhanced high bandwidth deadbeat current controller and a fractional delay variable frequency angle-based repetitive controller, is developed in this work in order to minimize torque ripple. For the purpose of accurately modelling the cogging torque and flux harmonics in PMSM, a lookup table embedded PMSM model is also proposed.

Kenjiro Takayanagi, Chief Engineer of NHK’s experimental television station and called “the father of Japanese television”, was especially helpful in rapidly developing the pulse-forming and timing circuits, {{as well as the}} receiver display. In early September 1941, the prototype set was first tested; it detected a single bomber at 97 km and a flight of aircraft at 145 km. The system, Japan’s first full Radio Range Finder (RRF - radar), was designated Mark 1 Model 1. Contracts were given to three firms for serial production; NEC built the transmitters and pulse modulators, Japan Victor the receivers and associated displays, and Fuji Electrical the antennas and their <b>servo</b> <b>drives.</b> The <b>system</b> operated at 3.0 m (100 MHz) with a peak-power of 40 kW. Dipole arrays with matte+-type reflectors were used in separate antennas for transmitting and receiving.|$|R
