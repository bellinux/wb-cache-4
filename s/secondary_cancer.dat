25|$|Ovarian cancer {{can also}} be a <b>secondary</b> <b>cancer,</b> the result of {{metastasis}} from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body. About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers. Common primary cancers are breast cancer, colon cancer, appendiceal cancer, and stomach cancer (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called Krukenberg tumors). Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells. Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.|$|E
25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) {{and have an}} antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of <b>secondary</b> <b>cancer</b> induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E

50|$|Another risk of {{treatment}} is that, {{in addition to}} being genotoxic, many of the drugs are also mutagenic and cytotoxic. So the effects of these drugs are not limited to just DNA damage.

This machine was later used at St Bartholomew's Hospital, in London, from 1983 to 1993. Mallard and his team are credited for technological advances that led to the widespread introduction of MRI.|$|E

50|$|Stochastic effects do {{not have}} a {{threshold}} of irradiation, are coincidental, and cannot be avoided. They can be divided into somatic and genetic effects. Among the somatic effects, <b>secondary</b> <b>cancer</b> is the most important. It develops because radiation causes DNA mutations directly and indirectly. Direct effects are those caused by ionizing particles and rays themselves, while the indirect effects are those that are caused by free radicals, generated especially in water radiolysis and oxygen radiolysis. The genetic effects confer the predisposition of radiosensitivity to the offspring. The process is not well understood yet.|$|E

50|$|NM is a <b>secondary</b> <b>cancer</b> {{meaning that}} it is the result of {{neoplastic}} cells that have metastasized from a primary cancer site. These cancers develop an enzyme that is able to break down blood vessels at a microscopic level. These cells enter the blood vessels and travel across the body. Once the brain is reached, they break down the Blood-Brain Barrier to enter the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). There the cancerous cells seed and disseminate into the leptomeninges which are composed of the arachnoid and the pia. The CSF continues to carry neoplastic cells through the brain tracts and spreads the cancerous cells.|$|E

30|$|The {{most common}} {{clinical}} signs of retinoblastoma are leukocoria (white pupil, 60 %) and strabismus (misaligned eyes, 20 %) [71]. Upon initial diagnosis of retinoblastoma, rapid identification {{of whether it}} is a germline RB 1 mutation, sporadic RB 1 mutation or a RB 1 +/+ MYCNA is necessary for correct treatment, as well as risk assessment for patents and their families [12]. Patients with heritable retinoblastoma or heterozygous carriers have an increased risk of developing secondary tumors such as osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and malignant melanomas [72]. They should therefore undergo regular follow-ups throughout their lifetime, and if possible, avoid all radiation (including X-ray, CT scan and external beam) to minimize the lifetime risk of developing <b>secondary</b> <b>cancers.</b> Furthermore, survivors of a bilateral retinoblastoma with an inherited germline retinoblastoma have a slightly higher risk of <b>secondary</b> <b>cancers</b> compared with those with a de novo germline RB 1 mutation [73]. Patients with a familial RB 1 mutation should be offered preimplantation genetic diagnosis to avoid passing on the mutation to the next generation [74].|$|R
