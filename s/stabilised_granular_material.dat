40|$|Lightly stabilised {{granular}} {{materials with}} cementitious binders are generally characterised by their stiffness modulus and this paper examines {{the use of}} monotonic and cyclic load indirect diametrical tensile (IDT) testing to determine the stiffness characteristics of these materials. The experimental programme included the determination of density, IDT strength and static and dynamic moduli from monotonic and cyclic load IDT testing for a typical freshly quarried aggregate granular base material stabilised {{by the addition of}} 3 - 5 % slag-lime slow-setting binder under a narrow range of moisture variations. The IDT tests were conducted on 28 days cured samples prepared by gyratory compaction. Details of an IDT testing arrangement with internal displacement measurement for performing cyclic load testing to obtain reliable data are also discussed. This study indicates that cyclic load IDT testing could be used reliably for determining the dynamic stiffness modulus of a lightly <b>stabilised</b> <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> with a newly proposed equation...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of lightly stabilised granular base materials are considerably affected by in-situ environmental {{conditions such as}} freeze-thaw (f-t), wet-dry (w-t) actions and changes in moisture content. Unlike cemented materials, durability studies related to lightly stabilised granular materials are very limited and their durability against these environmental variables are unknown. The existing laboratory tests which are relevant for assessing durability of stabilised soils are not well received by the pavement engineers as they have testing procedures which is subjective and requires time that is longer than the acceptable time frame. The main objectives of this research are to assess the durability of lightly stabilised granular materials using different laboratory experiments focussing on various {{mechanical properties}} and to determine the suitable test method and testing protocols. Specimens of two granular base parent materials stabilised with varying binder contents were subjected to different environmental actions and tested to obtain various mechanical properties. Laboratory tests such as unconfined compressive strength (UCS), repeated load triaxial (RLT), flexural beam test and vacuum saturation test (VST) {{were included in the}} testing program. Furthermore, non-destructive tube suction test (TST) was also added because of its potential acceptability. Along with the assessment of durability, permanent deformation (PD) characterisation of lightly stabilised granular base materials was also investigated using RLT and accelerated pavement model (APM) tests. The shakedown theory was mainly used to classify the material responses obtained from the RLT and to determine limits classifying different range of responses. A finite element (FE) analysis was used to back-calculate the moduli of stabilised base and subgrade materials of the APM test and its PD was analysed with RLT tests to form a relationship between these two tests and to develop equations to predict the PD of PM for different stress combinations. In first set of durability study, two granular materials, Canberra materials (CM) and Queensland materials (QM), stabilised with 1. 5 % of cement-flyash (CF) were chosen for the experiments. Standard UCS cylindrical specimens moulded with different moisture contents were used to investigate four testing procedures such as UCS after 7 -day, 12 f-t cycles, vacuum saturation and TST. UCS measured after 12 f-t cycles directly related to f-t durability tests whereas the other three tests were added to the testing programs due to their acceptability in predicting the durability of the stabilised materials. F-t durability test showed that the specimens remained integrated after 12 f-t cycles and showing resistivity against f-t cycles with no visible fissures or cracks on them. However, comparison with 7 -day UCS revealed that the 12 f-t cycles deteriorated the material’s UCS. Another series of specimens tested for UCS after subjecting them to vacuum and saturation also lasted the entire testing program without showing any disintegration. The regression analysis showed that the outcomes from 7 -day UCS, f-t durability test and VST produced better correlation among them and replacing f-t durability test with either VST or 7 -day UCS is viable for evaluating f-t durability of lightly stabilised granular materials. However, the dielectric values (DVs) measured using TST did not relate well with the UCS obtained from these tests and further study is required before TST is acceptable as a potential test to evaluate f-t durability of lightly stabilised materials. Despite its limited ability to assess the durability of the lightly <b>stabilised</b> <b>granular</b> <b>material,</b> TST revealed outcomes that gave more insight about the materials behaviour. The DVs showed dependency to moulding moisture content and binder content in which decrease in moisture content resulted in decrease in DVs and increasing binder content showed reduction in DVs. UCS of lightly <b>stabilised</b> <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> after TST showed that the DVs are not very well related to UCS, but the trend depicted that the material with lower DVs tend to show higher UCS. This research showed that the use of quality porous disk and having smooth top surface of the specimen are essential for obtaining reliable results from TST. In the next series of tests, different factors that could influence the laboratory f-t durability tests were investigated using UCS, repeated load triaxial (RLT) and flexural beam tests. This is to obtain the best combinations of variables {{that could be used to}} assess the f-t durability of lightly stabilised granular base materials. In the RLT test, resilient moduli (Mr) and permanent deformation (PD) were determined to evaluate the resilient and permanent deformation behaviour of specimens subjected to f-t cycles. Parent granular material, method of curing, curing time (or age), binder content, f-t testing procedure and number of f-t cycles were selected as variables. UCS and RLT tests showed that, irrespective of the testing procedure or variables, lightly stabilised material performed well against destructive f-t actions. However it was found that there were two factors that needed attention in the selection of a better laboratory f-t durability test; one is number of days of curing and the other is the moisture content. The UCS and RLT tests revealed that the curing age has an influence on the properties obtained after f-t cycles. To avoid strength gain during the f-t cycles, a better approach is to cure in an accelerated environment. Supplying moisture during the thawing phase was found to be important to replicate the field condition and to observe the adverse f-t effects within a reasonable amount of time. Compared with resilient modulus, PD from RLT test clearly identified the f-t effects when the specimens were subjected to higher deviatoric stresses. F-t durability study performed on flexural properties of specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % and 3 % of CF showed that f-t actions deteriorated the tensile capacity, considerably higher than other properties, of the material. Similar to f-t test durability study, the w-d durability study was performed using UCS, RLT and flexural test. All three tests performed on QM specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % CF showed heavy deterioration after few w-d cycles and not a single specimen lasted 12 w-d cycles. However, increasing the CF binder content to 3 % produced enough resistance to w-d actions and UCS after 12 w-d cycles was significantly higher than the 7 -day UCS of the same material not subjected to w-d cycles. Due to the high temperature in the drying phase of a w-d cycle, the strength gain due to accelerated cementitious and pozzalanic reaction was evident particularly in specimens cured for less number of days. Therefore, it was possible to notice strength gain instead of loss in the first few w-d cycles. Furthermore, similar to the outcome of f-t durability test, the MoR and SSM were found to be more vulnerable to w-d cycles than other properties with single w-d cycle causing significant reduction in tensile capacity of QM specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % of CF. Characterising the PD behaviour using RLT test was performed on CM stabilised with 0. 5 % and 1. 5 % of CF and cured for 7 days. Specimens stabilised with 0. 5 % of CF were tested for moisture contents of 8 % and 6. 5 % for four and three different confining pressures respectively and three moisture contents of 8 %, 6. 5 % and 5 % were selected for specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % of CF binder at one confining pressure of 50 kPa. The PD behaviour from each stress sequences were classified based on the accumulated permanent strain from 3000 to 5000 load cycles into range A, B or C shakedown behaviour. Based on this classification, shakedown limit calculations were performed to obtain plastic creep line (PCL) and plastic shakedown line (PSL). The established shakedown limit equations can be used to predict the material’s performance for given stress combinations while considering the impact of moisture content. Furthermore, log and power based permanent deformation prediction models were developed to relate permanent strain with number of loading cycles. These two equations were fitted with the experimental data to obtain the regression coefficients and the log model showed better fit to the experimental data than the power model. The regression coefficients were further analysed to obtain their dependency on stress values and an equation was established to predict the PD in terms of bulk stress and confining stress. Finally, APM testing was performed on a pavement model constructed in a cylindrical tank having 600 mm of subgrade and 150 mm of lightly stabilised base. The model pavement was instrumented with linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs), moisture probes (MPs) and earth pressure cells (EPCs) for measuring vertical deformations, moisture and pressures respectively. The measurement from MPs showed that soil-specific calibration is essential to improve the accuracy of the measurements and MP 306 moisture sensors can be used for continuous moisture measurement. The obtained deformations data were used to back calculate the moduli of both subgrade and base using a FE model developed in ABAQUS. Vertical and horizontal pressure distributions of experimental and finite element model showed that EPCs can be used to measure pressures to a reasonable accuracy. The permanent deformation (PD) measurement showed that the rut depth measured in the subgrade was found to be approximately three times that of the lightly stabilised granular base of the pavement. The study also emphasizes the need to characterise the deformation behaviour for every stress sequence to avoid continuing the test for higher number of load cycles which would reveal very little about the material’s behaviour. Finally, using RLT test data and FE analysis, a model in terms of bulk-stress was developed for predicting the accumulated permanent deformation of pavements for different combinations of stresses...|$|E

40|$|Finite element models, which {{employ the}} Drucker-Prager yield criterion, have been {{developed}} to simulate the static contact statuses between conical silos and <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> in 3 forms: the near contact, the sliding contact and the sticking contact. Contact conditions are established when 2 separated surfaces touch at normal direction while maintaining tangential relative movement. In general physical meaning, the surfaces in contact status have the following characteristics: 1) No penetration between each other; 2) The normal pressure and the tangent friction force may be transferred during contact; 3) Generally the normal pulling force cannot be transferred when surface separation occurs. Due to the symmetric property of conical structures, simplified two-dimensional contacting simulations are carried out in this paper, nonlinear finite element software ANSYS is used and the contacting surfaces between <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and conical silos are defined with rigid-to-flexible surface-to-surface contact pair. The target surfaces of conical silos are modeled with TARGE 169 element and the contact surfaces of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> are modeled with CONTA 171 element. During finite element analysis, conical silos and <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> are meshed with two-dimensional solid element, PLANE 42. The static contact statuses are investigated with conical silos containing different <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> The silo geometries vary at a dip angle of 20 °, 33. 7 ° and 45 °. Sunflower seeds, corn, coal, rounded gravel and wheat are selected as the <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> Results show that the mechanical properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> (including bulk density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, dilation angle, internal friction angle, cohesion) and silo designs (especially dip angle) have significant effects on the contact statuses at the interface between conical silos and granular materials: 1) For various <b>granular</b> <b>material,</b> 3 contact statuses, i. e. the form of near contact, sliding contact and sticking contact, can be found between <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and conical silo walls; 2) The contact statuses between conical silos and <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> do not depend on (or not mainly depend on) any mechanical property of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> The contact statuses are a combined effect of all mechanical properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> Those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with very small dilation angle may have the near contact statuses. Those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with higher cohesive force usually present a smaller sticking contact area, and those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with higher elastic modulus and bulk density usually present a larger sticking contact area than those with opposite material properties; 3) With the decreasing of conical silo depth, the near contact area disappears, the sliding contact area decreases and the sticking contact area increases. 4) Under the sliding contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the relative motion between contact surfaces. Under the sticking contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the elastic deformation because of the contact. The greater the sticking contact area, the more difficultly the silo discharges. The greater the sliding contact area, the more seriously the silo internal surfaces could be damaged.

When the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is dense, the observed particle-particle dissipation rate decreases to as little as 2 / 5 of the theoretical prediction. We observe that the rate of energy input is the weight of the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> times an average vibration velocity times a function of the ratio of particle to vibration velocity. `Particle-wall' dissipation has been neglected in all theories up to now, but can play an important role when the <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> is dilute.

Previous simulations and experiments have shown that E ~ V^delta, with delta= 2 for dilute <b>granular</b> <b>material,</b> and delta ~ 1. 5 for dense <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> We relate this change in exponent to the departure of particle-particle dissipation from its theoretical value.

40|$|We have {{attempted}} a multiscale quantification {{of the internal}} structure of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> The internal structure of <b>granular</b> <b>materials,</b> i. e., the geometrical information on granular particles and their spatial arrangement, was described mathematically on the particle scale using Voronoi-Delaunay tessellations. These tessellations were further modified into two cell systems: a solid cell system and a void cell system, with the internal supporting structure properly reflected. By doing so, the two cell systems were geometrically and physically significant. Taking solid/void cells as the microscopic basic elements, the behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> was expressed as the volumetric average of the microcell behavior. Macroscopically, the internal structure could be characterized by the statistical measures from the geometry of the microcells. Our approach was used to investigate the anisotropic behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> A study on the void cells explains how the spatial arrangement affects the strength and dilatancy of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> A new anisotropic fabric tensor was defined based on the void cell anisotropy. The correlation between the anisotropic fabric tensor and the macro behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> was verified with numerical simulations. The {{results showed that the}} new material anisotropic tensor is a more effective definition than the existing ones based on particle orientations and contact normals...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at three length scales. At the smallest length scale, the grain-scale, we study inter-particle forces and "force chains". Inter-particle forces are the natural building blocks of constitutive laws for <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> Force chains are a key signature of the heterogeneity of granular systems. Despite their fundamental importance for calibrating grain-scale numerical models and elucidating constitutive laws, inter-particle forces have not been fully quantified in natural <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> We present a numerical force inference technique for determining inter-particle forces from experimental data and apply the technique to two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems under quasi-static and dynamic load. These experiments validate the technique and {{provide insight into the}} quasi-static and dynamic behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> At a larger length scale, the mesoscale, we study the emergent frictional behavior of a collection of grains. Properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at this intermediate scale are crucial inputs for macro-scale continuum models. We derive friction laws for <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at the mesoscale by applying averaging techniques to grain-scale quantities. These laws portray the nature of steady-state frictional strength as a competition between steady-state dilation and grain-scale dissipation rates. The laws also directly link the rate of dilation to the non-steady-state frictional strength. At the macro-scale, we investigate continuum modeling techniques capable of simulating the distinct solid-like, liquid-like, and gas-like behaviors exhibited by <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> in a single computational domain. We propose a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with a viscoplastic constitutive law. The constitutive law uses a rate-dependent and dilation-dependent friction law. We provide a theoretical basis for a dilation-dependent friction law using similar analysis to that performed at the mesoscale. We provide several qualitative and quantitative validations of the technique and discuss ongoing work aiming to couple the granular flow with gas and fluid flows. </p...|$|R
40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{results for the}} penetration of a solid sphere when released onto wet sand. We show, by measuring the final penetration depth, that the cohesion induced by the water can result in either a deeper or shallower penetration for a given release height compared to dry <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> Thus the presence of water can either lubricate or stiffen the <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> By assuming the shear rate {{is proportional to the}} impact velocity and using the depth-averaged stopping force in calculating the shear stress, we derive effective viscosities for the wet <b>granular</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
50|$|A powder is a dry, bulk solid {{composed}} {{of a large number}} of very fine particles that may flow freely when shaken or tilted. Powders are a special sub-class of <b>granular</b> <b>materials,</b> although the terms powder and granular are sometimes used to distinguish separate classes of material. In particular, powders refer to those <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> that have the finer grain sizes, and that therefore have a greater tendency to form clumps when flowing. Granulars refers to the coarser <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> that do not tend to form clumps except when wet.|$|R

The mechanism responsible for the instability is the strain softening exhibited by humid <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> above a typical strain. The present short article gives the opportunity to review the potential physical origin of the cohesion in <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and, then, to discuss one experimental example which points out the fundamental role played by the clustering in the mechanical response of the cohesive materials...|$|R

In recent years, the advancing computer technology {{makes it possible to}} model complicate behaviour under different loadings. In this review paper, major advances and researches in the field of providing conceptual model for behaviour of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> have been reviewed. The reviewers have tried to categorise the researches in term of their approach to modelling the mechanical behaviour of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> and then identify the gaps to provide ground for the future researches...|$|R
