40|$|Turbulent flows play a {{dominant}} role in most technical applications, {{for instance in}} the automobile industry or in aviation. Therefore, the correct prediction of these flows {{is a very important}} task. The numerical simulation of three-dimensional time-depended and chaotic turbulent flows requires a very high computational effort, what remains an essential problem for the simulation of such flows despite the increasing computational power. On this account the hybrid models for the numerical simulation of turbulent flows were developed. These techniques combine advantages of established turbulent basic models, such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) models and direct numerical simulation (DNS), with the goal to produce the correct results with reduced computational effort. The focus of the present study lies in the investigation of a relatively new hybrid modeling technique, the so-called very large eddy simulation (VLES) strategy, firstly on <b>stationary</b> <b>grids</b> and afterwards on moving grids. This investigation requires an extension of the turbulence modeling part in the in-house code FASTEST, from the Institute of Numerical Methods in Mechanical Engineering at the TU Darmstadt, with the k-ε, k-ω and ζ-f VLES models. To ensure the correct performance of the VLES model, the verification of these RANS methods with the method of manufactured solution was realized. After the verification procedure, the newly implemented VLES models were systematically validated on <b>stationary</b> <b>grids.</b> Three different flow configurations were selected to demonstrate the ability of the VLES approach to predict different types of turbulent flows, which occur most frequently in technical applications: a channel flow, a flow with massive separations and a flow over a bluff body. The k −ε and ζ −f VLES methods have shown reasonably good agreement with the reference data for all three test cases. The k − ω VLES model yielded very good results for the cylinder flow and for the two-dimensional periodic hills flow, while in the prediction of the fully developed turbulent channel flow this method demonstrated weaknesses. To improve the results of the k − ω VLES model, this method was modified by means of the introduction of a new filter width, the so-called IDDES, in the formulation of the VLES model. This modification leads to a significant improvement of the results already on a quite coarse grid. After the validation on <b>stationary</b> <b>grids</b> the VLES method was investigated on moving grids. Therefore two test cases were calculated: a flow over a forced oscillating circular cylinder and a flow over a tandem of an oscillating and a static asymmetric airfoil. The VLES method demonstrated the ability to simulate turbulent flows with strongly moving structures. The character of investigated flows was captured very well for both test cases. The last step was an investigation of the VLES approach {{in the context of a}} fluid-structure coupling, where the high computational costs play an essential role. To this end, two FSI test cases were investigated. In both cases, the VLES method demonstrated the capability to capture a variety of turbulent structures in these configurations. Other parameters available from the reference experimental data are captured very well by the VLES model. In summary, the ability of the VLES model to predict different kinds of turbulent flows correctly was demonstrated by means of different test cases on stationary as well on moving grids. For all simulations, a relatively coarse grid, in comparison to this required for the correct LES calculation, was applied. The application of this hybrid turbulence model is very promising because of its capability to predict flows with mild and massive separations more accurately than RANS methods and due to the reduced computational effort in comparison to LES approaches...|$|R

40|$|A {{thresher}} {{was developed}} for threshing, separating, and cleaning millet seeds. The major components of the machine include threshing, separation and cleaning units. The threshing operation is achieved by rotational motion of a cylinder fitted with beater pegs above a <b>stationary</b> <b>grid</b> which results in {{the removal of the}} seeds from the panicles and their separation from the bulk of the straw. After being beating out, the grains fall through a concave grid into the cleaning unit which consists of two sieves that undergo reciprocating motion. Whilst the grains are moving over these sieves, a constant blast of air is being sent through them which blow out materials that are lighter than the grain. The machine was designed to be powered by a 5 hp electric motor. It was tested to thresh, separate and clean the millet seeds. The results showed that the machine had the highest threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 63. 2 and 62. 7 %, respectively, when pearl millet panicles were processed at 13 % moisture content and at an 800 rpm threshing cylinder speed. The lowest threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 40. 68 and 50 %, respectively, were obtained when the pearl millet panicle was processed at 17 % moisture content and a 600 rpm threshing cylinder speed, and at 17 % moisture content and 700 rpm. Thus, the optimum operating parameters of the machine were 13 % moisture content (wet basis) of pearl millet panicles and 800 rpm threshing drum speed. The successful development of this machine is expected to reduce drudgery associated with the traditional method of threshing millet and therefore increase productivity of farmers...|$|E

The relative errors are analyzed quantitatively due to the variation of thickness or pitching angles of the airfoils for steady cases. Compared to a similar approximate boundary condition method on pure Cartesian grids, the present method on body-fitted grids eliminates the thickness limitation and the singularity at the leading edge of a round-nosed airfoil.

40|$|The fluid-structure {{interaction}} (FSI) phenomena {{are relevant}} {{in a significant}} number of naturally occurring as well as industrial applications. Simulations of FSI have gained noteworthy attention with rapid advancements of computational technology in the last decade. Efficiency and accuracy of these simulations are still a concern, specially with a turbulent flow, the challenge is compounded by an additional computational cost for a turbulence modeling approach. Partitioned coupling approaches owing to software modularity and reusability are favored by engineers to solve FSI problems. The turbulence in flow is simulated through models with varying levels of complexity and computational requirements. In industrial applications, the use of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modeling of turbulence is dominant, whereas turbulence resolving approaches like Large-Eddy simulation (LES) are still not considered feasible due to computational requirements. To get as much accuracy by using as least as possible computer resources, a reasonable compromise are hybrid RANS-LES of turbulence, which {{are becoming more and more}} frequent. The goal of this work is to enable efficient and reliable simulations of FSI in turbulent flow. To this end, validation studies of three different turbulence modeling approaches available in the in-house flow solver FASTEST are performed. The structural subproblem in the coupling environment is solved with the Finite Element Method based code FEAP, while the data transfer and interpolation on non-matching grid interfaces can be handled with MpCCI or preCICE. For this work, the turbulence modeling approaches in FASTEST are extended with an implementation of the Wall Adapting Local Eddy (WALE) viscosity model for LES, and a validation study of the model is performed for a two dimensional periodic hill flow test case. An economical method based on a Poisson equation for the calculation of the nearest wall distance is also implemented, which is required by some turbulence models. The accuracy of the method is assessed with two computations on <b>stationary</b> <b>grids.</b> In turbulent flow simulations with moving grids, the height of cells on a wall changes and it can make a wall treatment approach unsuitable. This issue is addressed with an implementation of wall boundary conditions that work regardless of the first cell position in a boundary layer.

A test of the method with an FSI test case showed satisfactory results. Validation studies of a RANS and a hybrid RANS-LES approach are performed with simulations of two FSI test cases.

INTROD~JCTION One of the classic examples of hydrodynamic instability is the mixing of two fluids that takes place if a heavy fluid initially lies above a lighter one in a gravitational field. The first to investigate this problem was Lord Rayleigh [43], who late {{in the last century}} considered the linear stability problem for inviscid fluids with various stratification profiles, including sharply stratified fluids.

This observation made controlled laboratory experiments possible, and at Taylor’s suggestion D. J. Lewis [29] performed several such experiments, confirming Taylor’s and Rayleigh’s theoretical predictions for the linear stage and shedding some light on the large amplitude evolution. Several investigators have since repeated Lewis ’ experiments using devices ranging from rubber bands (Emmons, Chang, and Watson [IX]) to rocket motors (Read [742]) to produce rhe desired acceleration.

40|$|The {{coherent}} and quasicoherent methods for signal receiving require phase auto-tuning frequency as obligate component which forms the reference {{signal from the}} received oscillation. To receive discrete information a system needs clock, word and frame synchronization. The important task of synchronization, which is to form reference oscillation at the receiving side of wireless connection, {{in most of the}} cases, becomes complicated due to influence of noise, which distorts the received signal, and in some cases due to random character of the signal itself. Such events entail fluctuational phase deviation, which is formed by reference oscillation synchronization system. The effectiveness of data transmission lowers consequently because of losses in transmission of data required for not only synchronization but also for the signal search time and transition onto monitoring mode for all synchronization systems of the receiver. This raises the question of improving synchronization system especially in case of using in communication systems frequency, phase and quadrature methods of manipulation. Thus, improving effectiveness of signal processing in satellite telecommunication is obviously necessary especially for its part which relates to providing its noise resistance in conditions of noise and hindrance. This objective has been achieved through development of methods and means for optimization of filtering devices and semigraphical interpretation of clock synchronization systems on the base of stochastic models what determines relevance of the subject.

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{resampling}} binaryimage {{data from a}} rectangular grid to a regular hexagonal grid and an associated tree-structured pixel-indexing scheme keyed {{to the level of}} resolution have been devised. This scheme could be utilized in conjunction with appropriate image-data-processing algorithms to enable automated retrieval and/or recognition of images. For some purposes, this scheme is superior to a prior scheme that relies on rectangular pixels: one example of such a purpose is recognition of fingerprints, which can be approximated more closely by use of line segments along hexagonal axes than by line segments along rectangular axes. This scheme could also be combined with algorithms for query-image-based retrieval of images via the Internet. A binary image on a rectangular grid is generated by raster scanning or by sampling on a <b>stationary</b> <b>grid</b> of rectangular pixels. In either case, each pixel (each cell in the rectangular grid) is denoted as either bright or dark, depending on whether the light level in the pixel is above or below a prescribed threshold. The binary data on such an image are stored in a matrix form that lends itself readily to searches of line segments aligned with either or both of the perpendicular coordinate axes. The first step in resampling onto a regular hexagonal grid is to make the resolution of the hexagonal grid fine enough to capture all the binaryimage detail from the rectangular grid. In practice, this amounts to choosing a hexagonal-cell width equal to or {{less than a third of}} the rectangular- cell width. Once the data have been resampled onto the hexagonal grid, the image can readily be checked for line segments aligned with the hexagonal coordinate axes, which typically lie at angles of 30 deg, 90 deg, and 150 deg with respect to say, the horizontal rectangular coordinate axis. Optionally, one can then rotate the rectangular image by 90 deg, then again sample onto the hexagonal grid and check for line segments at angles of 0 deg, 60 deg, and 120 deg to the original horizontal coordinate axis. The net result is that one has checked for line segments at angular intervals of 30 deg. For even finer angular resolution, one could, for example, then rotate the rectangular-grid image +/- 45 deg before sampling to perform checking for line segments at angular intervals of 15 deg...|$|E
40|$|The absence (or reduction) of gravity, {{can lead}} to major changes in boiling heat transfer. On Earth, {{convection}} has a major effect on the heat distribution ahead of an evaporation front, and buoyancy determines {{the motion of the}} growing bubbles. In microgravity, convection and buoyancy are absent or greatly reduced and the dynamics of the growing vapor bubbles can change in a fundamental way. In particular, the lack of redistribution of heat {{can lead to}} a large superheat and explosive growth of bubbles once they form. While considerable efforts have been devoted to examining boiling experimentally, including the effect of microgravity, theoretical and computational work have been limited. Here, the growth of boiling bubbles is studied by direct numerical simulations where the flow field is fully resolved and the effects of inertia, viscosity, surface deformation, heat conduction and convection, as well as the phase change, are fully accounted for. Boiling involves both fluid flow and heat transfer and thus requires the solution of the Navier-Stokes and the energy equations. The numerical method is based on writing one set of governing transport equations which is valid in both the liquid and vapor phases. This local, single-field formulation incorporates the effect of the interface in the governing equations as source terms acting only at the interface. These sources account for surface tension and latent heat in the equations for conservation of momentum and energy as well as mass transfer across the interface due to phase change. The single-field formulation naturally incorporates the correct mass, momentum and energy balances across the interface. Integration of the conservation equations across the interface directly yields the jump conditions derived in the local instant formulation for two-phase systems. In the numerical implementation, the conservation equations for the whole computational domain (both vapor and liquid) are solved using a <b>stationary</b> <b>grid</b> and the phase boundary is followed by a moving unstructured two-dimensional grid. While two-dimensional simulations have been used for preliminary studies and to examine the resolution requirement, the focus is on fully three-dimensional simulations. The numerical methodology, including the parallelization and grid refinement strategy is discussed, and preliminary results shown. For buoyancy driven flow, the heat transfer is in good agreement with experimental correlations. The changes when gravity is turned off and/or fluid shear is added are discussed, as well as the difference between simulations of a layer freely releasing bubbles versus simulations using only one wavelength initial perturbation. Figure 1 shows {{the early stages of the}} formation of a three-dimensional bubble from a thin vapor layer. The boundary conditions are periodic in the x and y direction, the bottom is a hot and the top allows a free outflow. The jagged edge of the surface close to the bottom of the computational domain is due to some of the surface elements being on the other side of the domain and some elements not plotted by our plotting routine. In the second figure, we show the temperature distribution through two perpendicular planes...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase flows {{are marked}} by the {{presence}} of interfacial dynamics, steep jump in fluid-properties across the interface and moving boundaries between different phases and materials. Presence of moving boundaries and nonlinear coupling of phases across interface makes three-dimensional numerical simulations a difficult and expensive task. The presented work uses a continuous interface combining marker points on a <b>stationary</b> Eulerian <b>grid.</b> For an efficient computation an adaptive Cartesian grid is used to resolve local length scales of the flow. The interface location and flow solution are used as the adaptation criteria. The multiphase-interface is tracked using unstructured surface grid representation. A volume preserving interface reorganization procedure has been developed to maintain the desired interface surface grid resolution. Also, a momentum-source computation technique improving the performance of immersed boundary treatment in the governing field equation has been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} used to analyze the effect that vortices, shed from one flapping foil, have on the thrust of another flapping foil placed directly downstream. The simulations attempt to model the dorsal-tail fin interaction observed in a live bluegill sunfish by Drucker & Lauder 4 - 6 using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The simulations have been carried out using a Cartesian grid method that allows us to simulate flows with complex moving boundaries on <b>stationary</b> Cartesian <b>grids.</b> The simulations indicate that vortex shedding from the upstream dorsal fin is indeed capable of increasing the thrust of the tail fin significantly. However, this thrust augmentation is found to be quite sensitive to the phase relationship between the two flapping fins. The numerical simulations allows us to examine the underlying physical mechanism for this thrust augmentation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Euler and boundary-layer method capable of unsteady flow and aeroelastic simulations. An integral boundary-layer solver is {{coupled with an}} Euler solver in a “semi-inverse ” manner. For the inviscid part, approximate wall boundary-conditions are implemented on non-moving mean chord positions, whereas the full nonlinear Euler equation is solved {{in the field for}} accurate resolution of shock waves and vorticity. <b>Stationary</b> Cartesian <b>grids</b> are used for both steady and unsteady calculations. An integral boundary-layer method using Green’s lag equation is coupled with the outer inviscid flow. Results of steady and unsteady calculations by this interactive boundary-layer method are presented and compared with experimental data. Flutter-boundary predictions for the 2 D Isogai wing model are provided and compared with results using the Euler solver without the boundary-layer corrections and also thin-layer Navier-Stokes results. It shows that viscous effects are significant for this case. I...|$|R
40|$|When {{the spatial}} {{location}} area increases becoming extremely large, {{it is very}} difficult, if not possible, to evaluate the covariance matrix determined by the set of location distance even for <b>gridded</b> <b>stationary</b> Gaussian process. To alleviate the numerical challenges, we construct a nonparametric estimator called periodogram of spatial version to represent the sample property in frequency domain, because periodogram requires less computational operation by fast Fourier transform algorithm. Under some regularity conditions on the process, we investigate the asymptotic unbiasedness property of periodogram as estimator of the spectral density function and achieve the convergence rate...|$|R
