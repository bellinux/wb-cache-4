50|$|Selcall (Selective Calling) transmits a {{burst of}} five in-band audio tones to {{initiate}} the conversation. This feature is common in European systems. In a <b>simplex</b> <b>system,</b> the 5-tone just opens {{the speaker of the}} desired partner. In a repeater system, another CTCSS or tone-burst or 5-tone is needed to activate the company's repeater, depending on the systems design. If the called radio is within reach of the sender, it answers the incoming call with its stored receipt tone. Sometimes systems using Selcall are referred to as CCIR or ZVEI, specific tone encoding schemes used in Selcall systems. On the continent, people use the ZVEI scheme while in Great-Britain the CCIR is very common.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} alternative architectural {{considerations for}} {{instrumentation and control}} (I&C) systems in high-reliability applications to support remote, autonomous, inaccessible nuclear reactors, such as a space nuclear power plant (SNPP) for mission electrical power and space exploration propulsion. This work supported the pre-conceptual design of the reactor control system for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission. Long-term continuous operation without intermediate maintenance cycles forces consideration of alternatives to commonly used active, N-multiple redundancy techniques for high-availability systems. Long space missions, where mission duration can exceed the 50 % reliability limit of constituent components, can make active, N-multiple redundant systems less reliable than <b>simplex</b> <b>systems.</b> To extend a control system lifetime beyond the 50 % reliability limits requires incorporation of passive redundancy of functions. Time-dependent availability requirements must be factored into the use of combinations of active and passive redundancy techniques for different mission phases. Over {{the course of a}} 12 to 20 -year mission, reactor control, power conversion, and thermal management system components may fail, and the I&C system must react and adjust to accommodate these failures and protect nonfailed components to continue the mission. This requires architectural considerations to accommodate partial system failures and to adapt to multiple control schemes according to the state of nonfailed components without going through a complete shutdown and restart cycle. Relevant SNPP I&C architecture examples provide insights into real-time fault tolerance and long-term reliability an...|$|R

Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), which is a 3 -tuple version of NMR, is widely preferred for mission-control space, military, and aerospace, and safety-critical nuclear, power, medical, and industrial control and automation systems.

40|$|The {{benchmark}} for the reliability quality of networks depends {{mainly on the}} accuracy and comprehensiveness of the reliability parameters. Downtime prediction of a communication system is crucial {{for the quality of}} service (QoS) offered to the end-user. Markov model enables analytical calculation of average single figure cumulative downtime over one year. The single average approach, generally, does not adequately describe the wide range of service performance that is likely to be experienced in communications systems due to the random nature of the failure. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to add downtime distribution obtained from network availability models to predict the expected cumulative downtime and other performance parameters among a large number of system populations. The distribution approach provides more comprehensive information about the behavior of the individual systems. Laplace-Stieltjes transform enables analytical solutions for simple network architectures, i. e. the <b>simplex</b> <b>system</b> and the parallel system. This paper uses simulations to determine reliability parameters for complex architecture such as the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) backbone planned for next-generation Internet.

40|$|For {{digital system}} designs, triple modular {{redundancy}} (TMR), {{which is a}} 3 -tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves two-times duplication of the <b>simplex</b> <b>system</b> hardware, with a majority voter ensuring correctness provided at least {{two out of three}} copies of the system remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation. Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime, simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32 / 28 nm CMOS process...|$|E
