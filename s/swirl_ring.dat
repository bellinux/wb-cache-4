Hot primary air for drying and coaltransport enters the windbox plenum underneath the grinding table and flows upward through a <b>swirl</b> <b>ring</b> having multiple sloped nozzles surrounding the grinding table. The air mixes with anddries coal in the grinding zone and carries pulverized coal particles upward into a classifier.|$|E

40|$|The Lagrangian approach, {{adopted in}} vortex methods for {{incompressible}} Euler flows, is reconsidered {{here as the}} most appropriate technique to track the dynamical evolution of organized vorticity structures in free space. We analyze in this paper a specific initial condition, the <b>swirling</b> <b>ring</b> with azimuthal perturbations, from which originate vortex dynamics events leading to a localized but strong vorticity intensification. The aim is to understand the possible development of a finite time singularity, {{in the context of}} inviscid flows, and its relevance for the study of intermittency, {{as one of the most}} challenging aspects of turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Long, straight, anti-parallel vortex tubes, with {{balanced}} profiles {{and a local}} perturbation, are simulated {{using the}} Navier-Stokes equations and evolve into a chain of spiral vortex rings with the characteristics of three-dimensional turbulence. This includes evidence of a cascade of energy to high wavenumbers, {{the formation of a}} k − 5 / 3 inertial subrange and a new hierarchy of rescaled vorticity moments where, against expectations, the lower-order moments bound the higher-order moments. This order holds for all times even as the individual moments fluctuate significantly and could explain the observation that ratios converge faster than the individual moments in very high Reynolds number forced turbulence simulations. The transformation of the original pair of vortices into turbulent <b>swirling</b> vortex <b>rings</b> is outlined by describing first the twists and turns of the first two reconnection steps in detail, next how these create the first set of vortex rings, and finally the formation of the additional reconnections and stretched, <b>swirling</b> <b>rings</b> that lead to turbulence. The k − 5 / 3 spectrum is interpreted in terms of a model of stretched, spiral vortices similar to those seen in these simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{induced by}} {{the inclusion of a}} swirl component in a vortex ring have yet to be fully described. The development of a region of negatively signed vorticity at the leading edge of a vortex core has been observed for <b>swirling</b> <b>rings</b> in both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments, by various authors. In this paper, a spectral element method is used to solve the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for <b>swirling</b> vortex <b>rings</b> with a Gaussian initial condition. A Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is shown to develop within the negative vorticity region at {{the leading edge of the}} rings. Vortex rings with ratios varying between 0. 2 and 0. 5 are considered, with swirl magnitudes from 0. 0 to 0. 5. The initial circulation Reynolds numbers for all cases is 10 000. A cut-off shear Reynolds number has been defined, above which vortex rings of negative vorticity are formed by the instability, and subsequently ejected from the system. Shear layers weaker than this threshold fail to produce the secondary rings. The strain rate within the original core is shown to fluctuate during the ejection process, due to the superposition of the strain fields present in the system. The results of this study allow predictions of Gaussian ring behaviour to be made given a set of initial conditions...|$|R

50|$|Cold-core {{rings are}} {{a type of}} oceanic eddy, which are {{characterized}} as unstable, time-dependent swirling ‘cells’ that separate from their respective ocean current and move into water bodies with different physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Their size can range from 1 mm to over 10,000 km in diameter with depths over 5 km. Cold-core rings {{are the product of}} warm water currents wrapping around a colder water mass as it breaks away from its respective current. The direction an eddy swirls can be categorized as either cyclonic or anticyclonic depending on the hemisphere. A counterclockwise movement of water in the Northern hemispheres is cyclonic, but the same counterclockwise movement is anticyclonic in the Southern hemisphere (Yasuda, 2000). Although eddies have large amounts of kinetic energy, their rotation is relatively quick to diminish in relation to the amount of viscous friction in water. They typically last for a few weeks to a year. The nature of eddies are such that the center of the eddy, the outer <b>swirling</b> <b>ring,</b> and the surrounding waters are well stratified and all maintain their distinct properties throughout the eddy’s short time-scale.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{solutions}} of the Bragg-Hawthorne equations we discuss the helicity of thin toroidal vortices with the swirl - the orbital motion along the torus diretrix. It is shown that relationship of the helicity with circulations along the small and large linked circles - directrix and generatrix of the torus - depends on distribution of the azimuthal velocity {{in the core of}} the <b>swirling</b> vortex <b>ring.</b> In the case of non-homogeneous swirl this relationship differs from the well-known Moffat relationship - the doubled product of such circulations multiplied by the number of links. The results can be applied to vortices in planetary atmospheres and to vortex movements in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The arena hosted its final event on Tuesday, 28 October 1958. It was a sentimental occasion and promoter Jack Solomons headlined with a world-class lightweight fight between Dave Charnley and Carlos Ortiz (who was to go on to become world champion). This is how The Times reported it: After 22 years Harringay Arena is closing. This evening we shall hear this great hall echo to cheers and see cigarette smoke <b>swirl</b> around the <b>ring</b> for the last time.

500|$|The video {{starts with}} [...] "Let Me Talk to You" [...] as the {{background}} is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / Just to say how much you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a <b>ring</b> <b>swirling</b> into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|R
