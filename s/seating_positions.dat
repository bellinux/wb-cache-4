At least some Belgian B.E.2cs were similarly modified, at least one even being fitted with a Scarff ring over the rear cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The stadium has an {{asymmetrical}} appearance {{from the}} air and from some angles from ground level, due to the discrepancy in height between the sides and ends of the ground. The height difference between the Leazes/Milburn complex and the East/Gallowgate stands allows views of the city centre from many <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> inside the ground. Further expansion of the Gallowgate End could potentially produce a more balanced horseshoe arrangement of equal height stands, {{similar to that of}} Celtic Park.|$|E
25|$|A couch, bench, {{or other}} {{arrangement}} of seats {{next to each}} other may have armrest at the sides or arm rests in between. The latter may be provided for comfort, but also for privacy (e.g., in public transport and other public places), and in some park benches, to prevent homeless people from lying down or sleeping on the bench. Arm rests reduce both desired and undesired proximity between people seated side by side. A loveseat in particular, has no armrest in between two <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> on handrim biomechanics. Thirteen experienced users propelled a wheelchair over a smooth level floor at a self-selected speed. Kinetic and temporal-distance data were collected {{with the use of}} an instrumented rim and a motion analysis system. A custom-designed axle was used to change the <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> We used repeated measures analysis of variance to evaluate if differences existed in the temporal-distance and kinetic data with change in <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Results showed that a shorter distance between the axle and shoulder (low seat height) improved the push time and push angle temporal variables (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Tangential force output did not change with <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Axial and radial forces were highest in the lowest <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 001).

25|$|The {{downside}} {{of the new}} units was the more restricted view through the windows. The Mark 3 bodyshell has a much higher window sill level than the first generation DMUs and moreover the alignment of the windows with the <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> is poor, a problem common to much Mk 3 derived stock. The view is especially poor for passengers seated nearest to the doors, whose view is obscured by the pockets into which the doors slide when opened, or {{at the ends of}} the vehicle. Also unlike the first generation DMUs, the rear of the driver's cab was not glazed, so passengers in the front seats no longer had a view of the track ahead, which was regretted both by railfans and children.|$|E
25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b> A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; StabiliTrak electronic {{stability control system}} with brake assist; tire-pressure monitoring system; and 8 total airbags: dual-stage frontal, side-impact and knee for driver and front passenger, and roof-rail side-impact for front and rear outboard <b>seating</b> <b>positions,</b> with a passenger sensing system. There is also available an optional emergency assistance system. A safety cage, built with high-strength and ultra high-strength steel, surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact {{in the event of}} a crash.

Door hinges and latches in harmony with door structure and its steel reinforcements to keep doors closed during an impact. The 2011 Chevrolet Volt was named [...] "Top Safety Pick" [...] by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Volt received the top ratings of [...] "Good" [...] for front, side, and rear impact crash tests, and also on rollover protection. All injury measurements except one were rated good, indicating a low risk of significant injuries in crashes according to the scale of severity employed in the IIHS’s testing.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 190s, after the warlord Sun Ce had conquered {{lands in the}} Wu region and {{established}} his domain there, he invited scholars such as Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong and Qin Song to discuss with him on how {{to bring peace to}} the Han Empire. Lu Ji was among the scholars. As their <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> were determined by their ages, Lu Ji took the furthest seat because he was the youngest. When they were talking about using military force to bring about peace, Lu Ji raised his voice and said, [...] "In the past, when Guan Yiwu served as a chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi, the Duke was able to unite the various lords under his control and bring order to the Empire without resorting to military force. Confucius once said, 'If remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so.' Those who are present at this discussion speak of only using military force, and nothing about promoting civil culture and virtue. I, Ji, may be young and ignorant, but I don't feel at ease (after hearing what you've said)." [...] Zhang Zhao and the others were very surprised by Lu Ji's response.|$|E

This randomised, cross over study compared oxygenation in the supine position with that in the 45 ° <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> in 40 young, healthy volunteers.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} recovery protocols on heart rate recovery (HRR) trend through fitted heart rate (HR) decay curves were assessed. Twenty one trained male athletes and 19 sedentary male students performed a submaximal cycle exercise test on four occasions followed by 5 min: 1) inactive {{recovery in the}} upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 2) active (cycling) recovery in the upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 3) supine position, and 4) supine position with elevated legs. The HRR was assessed as {{the difference between the}} peak exercise HR and the HR recorded following 60 seconds of recovery (HRR 60). Additionally the time constant decay was obtained by fitting the 5 minute post-exercise HRR into a first-order exponential curve. Within- subject differences of HRR 60 for all recovery protocols in both groups were significant (p 0. 05). Values of HRR 60 were larger in the group of athletes for all conditions (p 0. 05). Between group difference was found for active recovery in the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and the supine position with elevated legs (p < 0. 05). We conclude that the supine position with or without elevated legs accelerated HRR compared with the two <b>seated</b> <b>positions.</b> Active recovery in the <b>seated</b> upright <b>position</b> was associated with slower HRR compared with inactive recovery in the same position.
