5000|$|The Hamilton College Spectator, known {{simply as}} The Spectator or the <b>Spec</b> <b>on</b> campus, is Hamilton College's primary weekly news publication. It is {{distributed}} in the campus dining halls, mail center, and library. The Spectator covers campus, local, and national news as well as Hamilton sports and campus life. The paper can be found online. [...] The earliest Hamilton College literary magazine, The Talisman, appeared between 1832 and 1834. Another student publication, The Radiator, which The Spectator marks as its origin, appeared in 1848. A weekly publication, The Radiator described itself as, “A Weekly Miscellany of General Literature, Science, and Foreign and Domestic Intelligence.” The publication was {{a collection of short}} stories, historical sketches, poetry and news excerpts gathered from both foreign and domestic news outlets. The College yearbook, The Hamiltonian was first published in 1858. The literary journal, The Hamilton Literary Monthly, began publication in 1866. The Campus, which was published between 1866 and 1870, was succeeded in 1899 by another campus newspaper, Hamilton Life. In 1942, Hamilton Life was succeeded by Hamiltonews, and in 1947, Hamiltonews became The Spectator.|$|E
50|$|For any system, one of {{the first}} tasks of {{reliability}} engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall availability needs and, more importantly, derived from proper design failure analysis or preliminary prototype test results. Clear requirements (able to designed to) should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items / constructions / interfaces / systems. Setting only availability, reliability, testability, or maintainability targets (e.g., max. failure rates) is not appropriate. This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering. Reliability requirements address the system itself, including test and assessment requirements, and associated tasks and documentation. Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications, test plans, and contract statements. Creation of proper lower-level requirements is critical.Provision of only quantitative minimum targets (e.g., MTBF values or failure rates) is not sufficient for different reasons. One reason is that a full validation (related to correctness and verifiability in time) of a quantitative reliability allocation (requirement <b>spec)</b> <b>on</b> lower levels for complex systems can (often) not be made as a consequence of (1) the fact that the requirements are probabilistic, (2) the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements, and because (3) reliability is a function of time, and accurate estimates of a (probabilistic) reliability number per item are available only very late in the project, sometimes even after many years of in-service use. Compare this problem with the continuous (re-)balancing of, for example, lower-level-system mass requirements in the development of an aircraft, which is already often a big undertaking. Notice that in this case masses do only differ in terms of only some %, are not a function of time, the data is non-probabilistic and available already in CAD models. In case of reliability, the levels of unreliability (failure rates) may change with factors of decades (multiples of 10) as result of very minor deviations in design, process, or anything else. The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase. This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful, practical, valid manner that does not result in massive over- or under-specification. A pragmatic approach is therefore needed—for example: the use of general levels / classes of quantitative requirements depending only on severity of failure effects. Also, the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement. (Quantitative) reliability parameters—in terms of MTBF—are by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{intercalation}} cathodes for {{lithium batteries}} store charge in redox reactions {{associated with the}} transition metal cations, e. g. Mn 3 +/ 4 + in LiMn 2 O 4, and this limits the energy storage of Li-ion batteries. Compounds such as Li[Li 0. 2 Ni 0. 2 Mn 0. 6]O 2 exhibit a capacity to store charge {{in excess of the}} transition metal redox reactions. The additional capacity occurs at and above 4. 5 V vs. Li + /Li. The capacity at 4. 5 V is dominated by oxidation of the O 2 -anions accounting for ~ 0. 43 e -/formula unit, with an additional 0. 06 e -/formula unit being associated with O loss from the lattice. In contrast, the capacity above 4. 5 V, is mainly O loss, ~ 0. 08 e -/formula. The O redox reaction involves the formation of localized hole states on O during charge, which are located on O coordinated by (Mn 4 + /Li +). The results have been obtained by combining operando electrochemical mass <b>spec</b> <b>on</b> 18 O labelled Li[Li 0. 2 Ni 0. 2 Mn 0. 6]O 2 with XANES, soft X-ray spectroscopy, Resonant Inelastic X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|Energy is an {{increasingly}} important consideration in memory system design. Although caches can save energy in several ways, such as by decreasing execution time and {{reducing the number of}} main memory accesses, they also suffer from known inefficiencies: the last-level cache (LLC) tends to have a high miss ratio while simultaneously storing many blocks that are never referenced after being written back to LLC. These blocks contribute to dynamic energy while simultaneously causing cache pollution. Because these blocks are not referenced before they are evicted, we can write them directly to memory rather than to the LLC. To do so, we must predict which blocks will not be referenced. Previous approaches rely on additional state at the LLC and/or extra communication. We show that by predicting working set size per program counter (PC), we can decide which blocks have low probability of being referenced. Our approach makes the prediction based solely on the address stream as seen by the level-one data cache (L 1 D) and thus avoids storing or communicating PC values between levels of the cache hierarchy. We require no modifications to the LLC. We adapt Flajolet and Martin?s probabilistic counting to keep the state small: two additional bits per L 1 D block, with an additional 6 KB prediction table. This approach yields a large reduction in number of LLC writebacks: 25 % fewer for <b>SPEC</b> <b>on</b> average, 80 % fewer for graph 500, and 67 % fewer for an in-memory hash table...|$|E
