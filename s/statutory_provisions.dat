Benjamin More, a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, argued that the repeal of <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted the repeal act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office.|$|E
5|$|Section 207 {{repealed}} obsolete {{limitations on}} wastage in the Mint's operations, but directed that administrative regulations be developed on the subject, {{which could be}} more easily changed.

Section 209 rephrased <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> allowing the Treasury to sell silver at a price not less than $1.292929 per ounce, and allowed it to sell silver to other government departments for less. Section 210 repealed the 1933 provision regarding the legal tender status of coins.The law prior to 1965 made it a felony to forge silver coins; this was amended by section 211 to forbid the counterfeiting of coins with denomination greater than five cents. Section 212 made using coins as security for loans a misdemeanor if the secretary hasemade a proclamation in the Federal Register proscribing their use as collateral.|$|E

However, a statutory provision which merely permits, but does not compel the public authority to breach the expectation will not necessarily justify any such breach.|$|E

25|$|A ban on {{discrimination}} {{was included}} in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure. Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.|$|E
25|$|Under the Ohio {{election}} laws a {{new political}} party seeking ballot position in presidential elections must obtain petitions signed by qualified electors totaling 15% {{of the number of}} ballots cast in the last gubernatorial election and must file these petitions early in February of the election year. These requirements and other restrictive <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> virtually preclude a new party's qualifying for ballot position and no provision exists for independent candidates doing so. The Republican and Democratic Parties may retain their ballot positions by polling 10% of the votes in the last gubernatorial election and need not obtain signature petitions. The Ohio American Independent Party (an appellant in No. 543), was formed in January 1968, and during the next six months by securing over 450,000 signatures exceeded the 15% requirement but was denied ballot position because the February deadline had expired. The Socialist Labor Party (an appellant in No. 544), an old party with a small membership, could not meet the 15% requirement. Both Parties brought actions challenging the Ohio election laws as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Justice Chan {{relied on}} a United Kingdom case, Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976), to {{ascertain}} the law with regard to this ground of judicial review. In this case, the House of Lords held that <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> which are framed to include the word satisfaction may exclude judicial review on matters of pure judgment by the decision-maker, but judicial review will not be excluded in all cases. Lord Wilberforce held that when the judgment {{is dependent on the}} existence of relevant facts, the court has to ascertain if the facts truly exist and if they have been properly taken into account, although the evaluation of the facts is for the decision-maker alone. If these requirements are not met, an aggrieved person is entitled to challenge the decision, and the court can intervene {{on the grounds that the}} decision-maker acted outside its powers, outside the purpose of the legislation empowering it, unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact. Lord Diplock mentioned it was also necessary to consider if the decision-maker had taken into consideration only matters which he ought to have considered.|$|E
25|$|Early English {{common law}} had, in many instances, imposed {{liability}} {{on those who}} had caused harm regardless of wrongful intent or negligence. Trespass was considered a remedy for all tortious wrongs, and sometimes used as a synonym for torts generally. Over the centuries, however, judges focused more on the intent and negligence behind the actions than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves, leading to the development of negligence and nuisance and the further development of trespass. At the time of Rylands, the previous case relied upon was Vaughan v Menlove, decided in the Court of Common Pleas in 1837. The case had almost identical facts to Rylands, but strict liability was never even considered. The case is instead thought of {{as one of the best}} attempts of early 19th Century English judges to build up the law of negligence. The outcome of Rylands meant that judges would again impose strict liability on defendants who accumulated dangerous things on their land without any need to prove negligence or wrongful intent. The decision won support for bringing the law relating to private reservoirs up to standard with the law relating to public reservoirs, which contained similar <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> thanks to a pair of private Acts of Parliament passed in 1853 and 1864.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the changes}} made was {{replacing}} the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of due process in accordance with the rule of law the <b>statutory</b> <b>provisions</b> for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between interpreting legislation in a way which “promotes the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights” as required by s 39(2) of the Constitution and the process of reading words into or severing them from a <b>statutory</b> <b>provision</b> which is a remedial measure under s 172(1)(b), following upon a declaration of constitutional invalidity under s 172(1)(a) .... The first process, being an interpretative one, is limited to what the text is reasonably capable of meaning. The latter can only take place after the <b>statutory</b> <b>provision</b> in question, notwithstanding the application of all legitimate interpretative aids, is found to be constitutionally invalid.|$|R
