40|$|This paper {{refers to}} Digital Storytelling as an {{alternative}} tool enhancing children's way of expression in kindergarten classroom. Storytelling is a global culture depicting the way people live, feel and interact in life. Especially in early childhood storytelling springs naturally in children's play helping them to exercise {{a great variety of}} skills. Nowadays, advances in technology offer the opportunity to create a new form of storytelling, namely digital storytelling. The idea of creating a digital story is based on processes similar to those used in traditional stories. On the other hand the story is supplemented with various types of multimedia content. Meaningful integration of technology into kindergarten gives children the opportunity to create their own digital stories and thanks to multimedia technology children are enabled to become co-authors in the story writing process. In this paper a teaching experiment {{that took place in the}} kindergarten of an urban area in Greece on February 2012 is described. The teaching experiment lasted three weeks. We present the attempt of creating an educational framework in which the children were given the opportunity to combine various elements and Information Computer Technology tools, in order to express themselves and give birth to a digital story. It was found that children were engaged to the whole process, <b>showed</b> <b>responsibility,</b> self-confidence and they also exercised cooperation skills...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test whether {{volunteer}} tourism organisations are prepared to learn from feedback on the quality of their responsibility communications, and consider whether analysis and communication of results can influence market improvement. Design/methodology/approach – A purposive sample of five influential website pages of eight volunteer tourism organisations are scored across 19 responsible voluntourism criteria, and compared against the results of two years previously. Findings – The authors report mixed results on how communicating results has encouraged change and industry improvement in responsibility, based on previous research that <b>showed</b> <b>responsibility</b> to be communicated inconsistently at best, potentially greenwashing at worst, across organisations, product types and responsible values. Research limitations/implications – The paper applies sustainability marketing literature to explain the changes in responsibility communication performance using an innovative tool to benchmark and audit responsibility in online marketing content and providing insight into how best practice marketing necessitates responsible operations. This paper considers whether and how, when presented with evidence, organisations choose to improve for a more responsible voluntourism offer. Originality/value – The paper is original in providing a practical, industry-informed analysis of the reasons why volunteer operators communicate in the way they do, and the ability to influence their communications to be more reliable, in the context of increased criticism for shallow volunteering. This experiment allows industry associations and lobby groups to influence industry practice based on the evidence that improved communications are possible when specific, tailored advice is provided...|$|E

Having regular activity of Tadarus in public school attracts many attentions to study it in greater depth. By employing naturalistic qualitative approach, this research was aimed to reveal the background and implementation of Tadarus and its effectiveness as a mean of students’ morals building. The results showed that, firstly Tadarus was held regularly every morning about 15 minutes before the first period. The school principal {{was in charge of}} the activity, while the religion teacher functioned as a coordinator to run the program helped by all teachers of SMP N 8 Yogyakarta. Secondly, Tadarus al - Qur`an was proven effective to build students’ morals. The effectiveness could be seen from several aspects, such as: 1) aspect of the duty and function, in which the teacher had taken the roles as a supervisor and guide on the process of activities, in other hand, students <b>showed</b> <b>responsibility</b> to carry out the activities seriously, 2) planning/ program, Tadarus became an integral part of school activities that had been well-prepared and organized systematically, 3) provisions/rules, it had been conducted by using well-organized techniques, and 4) aspect of goals, the ultimate objective of Tadarus had been achieved that was equipping students with a commendable character and far from despicable character...|$|E

40|$|In public discourses {{on climate}} change and the future, {{children}} are often included {{as a metaphor for}} “future citizens”, the ones that will take the consequences for consumption and lifestyles of today. At the same time the discourse define them as excluded from the category “citizens of today”, since they lack experience, knowledge and responsibility. The question is, how do children themselves use their experiences and knowledge to handle the climate change issue and how do they express responsibility for their lifestyles and actions? In this study, 9 - 10 year olds in Sweden discuss issues about carbon dioxide reduction. We analyses how they use different discursive repertoires to legitimise or question their ‘normal’ everyday lifestyles. Conversations from 25 groups of children were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded. Six repertoires were identified: Everyday life; Self Interest; Environment; Science and Technology; Society; Justice. The everyday life repertoire was for example used when they related to the image of ‘normal’ lifestyle. Science and technological solutions were often suggested as ‘magic bullets’ to maintain or improve these. Arguments related to environment were commonly superior to other. Findings show that the children were able to negotiate real-world science of the kind used by engaged citizens, and able to discursively handle this complex issue. When the repertoires became in conflict, the children had to ‘renegotiate’ their own identities, and <b>showed</b> <b>responsibility</b> to change their lives. They positioned themselves as active contributors to society, using scientific ideas, among others, to understand the problems that affected their normal everyday lives...|$|E

5000|$|EFD is a used {{modeling}} {{technique for}} {{the representation of}} enterprise functions and corresponding interactions. Different business processes can be modeled in these representations {{through the use of}} [...] "function modules" [...] and triggers. A starting business process delivers different inputs to different functions. A process flowing through all the functions and sub-functions creates multiple outputs. Enterprise function diagrams hereby give a very easy-to-use and detailed representation about a business process and corresponding functions, inputs, outputs and triggers.In this way EFD has many similarities with IDEF0 diagrams, which also represent in a hierarchical way business processes as a combination of functions and triggers. Difference is that an EFD places the business functions in an organization hierarchical perspective, which outlines the downstream of certain processes in the organization. On the contrary, IDEF0 diagrams <b>show</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of certain business functions through the use of arrows. Also, IDEF0 has a clear representation of inputs and outputs of every (sub)function.|$|R

Collectivist societies will have more emotional dependence on members in their organizations; when in equilibrium an organization is expected to <b>show</b> <b>responsibility</b> to members. Extreme individualism {{is seen in the}} US. In fact, collectivism in the US is seen as [...] "bad". Other cultures and societies than the US will therefore seek to resolve social and organizational problems in ways different from American ways. Hofstede says that a capitalist market economy fosters individualism and competition, and depends on it, but individualism is also related {{to the development of the}} middle class. Some people and cultures might have both high individualism and high collectivism. For example, someone who highly values duty to his or her group does not necessarily give a low priority to personal freedom and self-sufficiency.|$|R

Within gambling, addiction has become a growing problem, affecting both the gambling business {{as well as the}} individuals. This situation forces companies to balance their profit with responsible action in order to prevent gambling addiction. This thesis examines why and how gambling companies differ in their methods to help players avoid addiction in order to establish a sustainable society. A multiple case-study has been carried out, where three gambling companies have been examined and analyzed. The companies are Svenska Spel, Norsk Tipping and Unibet. The survey is based on interviews with representatives from the companies working in the departments of Responsible gambling or CSR. The conclusions of this study show that gambling companies can profit both economically and establish good will, if they <b>show</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Gambling companies differ in how they handle addiction, mainly because of diffuse concepts as CSR and Responsible Gambling. If gambling companies cooperate actively between themselves as well as with research of addiction, a balanced, sustainable society may be reached. Discussions of solving the problem of gambling addiction can preferably continue in order to reach a sustainable society...|$|R
