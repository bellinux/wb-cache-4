25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to {{how difficult it}} is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a <b>sleeping</b> <b>state,</b> and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E
25|$|Humans possess both {{slow wave}} and REM sleep, in both phases both {{eyes are closed}} and both hemispheres of the brain involved. Sleep has also been {{recorded}} in mammals other than humans. One interesting study showed that echidnas possess only slow wave sleep (non-REM). This {{seems to indicate that}} REM sleep appeared in evolution only after therians. But this has later been contested by studies that claim that sleep in echidna combines both modes into a single <b>sleeping</b> <b>state.</b> Other studies have shown a peculiar form of sleep in odontocetes (like dolphins and porpoises). This is called the unihemispherical slow wave sleep (USWS). At any time during this sleep mode, the EEG of one brain hemisphere indicates sleep while that of the other is equivalent to wakefulness. In some cases, the corresponding eye is open. This might allow the animal to reduce predator risk and sleep while swimming in water, though the animal may also be capable of sleeping at rest.|$|E

Without inquiring further into this latter part of the subject--a very curious and interesting part of it--let us take the theory, roughly and generally, as I have just stated it, and apply it at once to the dream now under consideration." [...] He took up the written paper from the table, and dropped the formal tone (as of a lecturer addressing an audience) into which he had insensibly fallen.

50|$|Cortical theta rhythms {{observed}} in human scalp EEG {{are a different}} phenomenon, with no clear relationship to the hippocampus.

40|$|Brain {{computational}} challenges vary between behavioral states. Engaged animals react {{according to}} incoming sensory information, while in relaxed and <b>sleeping</b> <b>states</b> {{consolidation of the}} learned information is believed to take place. Different states are characterized by different forms of cortical activity. We study a possible neuronal mechanism for generating these diverse dynamics and suggest their possible functional significance. Previous studies demonstrated that brief synchronized increase in a neural firing (Population Spikes) can be generated in homogenous recurrent neural networks with short-term synaptic depression. Here we consider more realistic networks with clustered architecture. We show {{that the level of}} synchronization in neural activity can be controlled smoothly by network parameters. The network shifts from asynchronous activity to a regime in which clusters synchronized separately, then, the synchronization between the clusters increases gradually to fully synchronized state. We examine the effects of different synchrony levels on the transmission of information by the network. We find that the regime of intermediate synchronization is preferential for the flow of information between sparsely connected areas. Based on these results, we suggest that the regime of intermediate synchronization corresponds to engaged behavioral state of the animal, while global synchronization is exhibited during relaxed and <b>sleeping</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

Sleep not simply as a resting state, but a state that involves intense brain activity.The first year of life is a time of substantial change in the development of both the human brain and sleep. The relationship between the two is vital, as the control of sleep and the sleep-wake cycle are regulated by the CNS.|$|E
50|$|The text posits {{the same}} four states of {{consciousness}} or avasthas as found in Mandukya Upanishad and Buddhist texts. It defines the four states as Jāgraṭa (waking state), Svapna (dreaming state), Sushupṭi (dreamless <b>sleeping</b> <b>state),</b> and Turiya (pure consciousness). The text then attempts to link its physiology theory to explain these four {{states of consciousness}} as follows: in the Jāgraṭa state the 14 organs of the body which come into play are five organs of sense, five organs of action, and the four internal organs. Svapna or dreaming state shuts off all ten external organs, and only the four internal organs are operative states the Upanishad. In Sushupṭi, everything is silent, except chiṭṭa or mind only. Ṭuriya avastha is exclusively about jiva (life force, soul immersed in itself).|$|E
