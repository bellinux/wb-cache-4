50|$|A <b>sherry</b> <b>glass</b> is drinkware {{generally}} {{used for}} serving aromatic alcoholic beverages, such as sherry, port, aperitifs, and liqueurs, and layered shooters. The copita, with its aroma-enhancing narrow taper, {{is a type}} of <b>sherry</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pineau des Charentes {{should be}} served chilled (8-10 °C) in a tulip-shaped glass {{such as a}} <b>sherry</b> <b>glass.</b> The taper {{of this type of}} glass better enhances the aroma of the wine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{schooner}} {{is a type}} {{of glass}} for serving drinks. In Britain it is a large <b>sherry</b> <b>glass</b> (also known as a Sheila Glass), in Australia, it is a name for a particular glass size, used for any type of beer.|$|E
2500|$|Shooters can be shaken, stirred, blended, layered, {{or simply}} poured. Shot <b>glasses</b> or <b>sherry</b> <b>glasses</b> are the usual drinkware in which {{shooters}} are served. They are most commonly served at bars, and some bartenders {{have their own}} [...] "signature" [...] shooter.|$|R
50|$|Thousands {{of items}} {{eventually}} were brought up, ranging from 19th-century cut-crystal <b>sherry</b> <b>glasses,</b> white porcelain plates, beer mugs, and terracotta containers (once holding mineral water from Germany) to exquisite glassware, cups, glass containers, and multi-faceted cruet bottles. Wine and champagne bottles, crates of goods (from axe handles to doorknobs), tinctures of medicine, port holes—among many goods and objects—were discovered.|$|R
60|$|A wood {{fire was}} burning brightly on the hearth, {{for the evening}} was chilly, and some <b>sherry</b> and <b>glasses</b> stood upon the table.|$|R
5000|$|That night saw {{the credits}} roll {{in silence for}} the very first time (something that would later become the norm {{whenever}} a character was [...] "killed-off"), with the rooftop scene replaced by a close of the snug table which contained a <b>sherry</b> <b>glass,</b> a passport and Martha's famous NHS spectacles.|$|E
50|$|Glass {{selection}} is important when tasting whisky seriously. The least appropriate {{is the traditional}} tumbler due to its large mouth, allowing the dissipation of the fumes and the grip which encourages unwanted warming of the liquid. The generally accepted industry standard for whisky tasting glasses is tulip-shaped with a stem, such as a <b>sherry</b> <b>glass</b> or copita. Another popular glass is the Glencairn whisky glass. Other specifically manufactured tasting glasses include a lid to retain the aromas.|$|E
50|$|Sherry is {{traditionally}} drunk from a copita (also {{referred to as}} a catavino, a special tulip-shaped <b>sherry</b> <b>glass.</b> Sampling wine directly from a sherry butt may be performed with characteristic flourish by a venenciador, named after the special cup (the venencia) traditionally made of silver and fastened to a long whale whisker handle. The cup, narrow enough to pass though the bung hole, withdraws a measure of sherry which is then ceremoniously poured from head height into a copita held in the other hand.|$|E
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy <b>glasses,</b> madeira <b>glasses,</b> <b>sherry</b> <b>glasses,</b> hock glasses, and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock glasses were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|R
40|$|From the Pearse Collection: {{photograph}} {{depicting a}} variety of richly engraved 18 th century glass housed at Groote Schuur. It includes a wine <b>glass,</b> port or <b>sherry</b> <b>glasses,</b> beakers and a decanter. It is uncertain whether the engraving is wheel or diamond-point engraving. The wineglass in the centre has a flared trumpet bowl, and its stem has an inverted baluster above {{what appears to be}} a folded foot. Photograph probably considered for prof. Geoffrey Pearse's book "Eighteenth Century Furniture in South Africa", but never included. Canoscan 8000 f scanner used, file scanned in at 72 DPI, edited using Photoshop v 7.

6000|$|... "There's {{nothing in}} it. I {{looked at it}} before," [...] said Lestrade. [...] "'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., {{cocktail}} 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., <b>glass</b> <b>sherry,</b> 8d.' I see nothing in that." ...|$|R
5000|$|B-52s {{are usually}} {{served in a}} shot glass or <b>sherry</b> <b>glass,</b> {{although}} a heatproof glass is required when a [...] "flaming B-52" [...] is served. First, a coffee liqueur, such as Tia Maria or Kahlúa, is poured into the glass. Next, Bailey's Irish Cream is poured very slowly {{over the back of}} a cold bar spoon, taking care to avoid disturbing the lower layer as the second liquor is poured on top. Just as carefully, Grand Marnier is poured atop the Irish Cream using the bar spoon.|$|E
50|$|In Britain, a {{schooner}} {{is a large}} <b>sherry</b> <b>glass.</b> Sherry {{is traditionally}} served {{in one of two}} measures, based on how they were served in naval days. There was a clipper, the smaller measure, or a schooner, the larger measure, named after the sort of ships that brought sherry over from Spain. The schooner name was more particular to Bristol, to where most sherry was imported, stored and bottled. It is usually served on its own. Also since 2011 beer and cider is permitted to be sold in 2/3 pint (379ml) glasses erroneously known by some as 'schooners' but not defined as such in UK legislation.|$|E
5000|$|Kleinman {{tries to}} get Irmy {{a place to stay}} by asking his fiancée, but she refuses to let them in. At a pier, they look out at the night and the feeling is very romantic, until the vigilante mob ambushes them. It turns out that {{everyone}} has a [...] "plan." [...] Then, Spiro the Clairvoyant, a man who smells people like a psychic bloodhound, starts to sniff Kleinman. He says that Kleinman [...] "has something in his pocket," [...] and the <b>sherry</b> <b>glass</b> is revealed. Angry and believing he is the killer, the mob prepares to lynch him. Kleinman blows pepper in their faces and escapes. He tries to find a safe haven in the house of his first ex-fiancée, Alma (Julie Kavner), whom he left standing at the altar while he had a dalliance with her sister. He apologizes, but she throws him out, shouting [...] "Get out and die!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Post's {{first book}} was {{published}} during Prohibition, and she noted, [...] "A water glass standing alone at each place makes such a meager and untrimmed looking table that most people put {{on at least two}} wine <b>glasses,</b> <b>sherry</b> and champagne, or claret and sherry, and pour something pinkish or yellowish into them. ... Those few who still have cellars, serve wines exactly as they used to, white wine, claret, sherry and Burgundy warm, champagne ice cold; and after dinner, green mint poured over crushed ice in little glasses, and other liqueurs of room temperature." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cockey {{had been}} so mild before the pint of <b>sherry</b> and the <b>glass</b> of toddy, that Mr. Gilmore was {{somewhat}} dismayed by the change. Mr. Cockey, however, in his altered aspect seemed {{to be so much}} the less gracious, that Gilmore left him and strolled out into the town. He climbed up the hill and walked round the church {{and looked up at the}} windows of Miss Marrable's house, of which he had learned the site; but he had no adventure, saw nothing that interested him, and at half-past nine took himself wearily to bed.|$|R
60|$|We blessed {{ourselves}} and came away. In {{the little room}} downstairs we found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these {{on the table and}} invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister's bidding, she filled out the <b>sherry</b> into the <b>glasses</b> and passed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all gazed at the empty fireplace.|$|R

500|$|This highly nuanced {{and largely}} {{theatrical}} letter was unsigned, {{but she had}} included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems. He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the <b>sherry</b> in the <b>glass</b> that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not [...] "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her [...] "not to read them– because he fears they joggle the Mind".|$|R
60|$|When {{all this}} had been {{arranged}} to his mind, Mr. Cranley chose another orange, filled a wineglass with the liquid in the phial, and then drew off a quantity in the little syringe. Then he very delicately and carefully punctured the skin {{of one of the}} oranges, and injected into the fruit the contents of the syringe. This operation he elaborately completed in the case of each of the six chosen oranges, and then tenderly polished their coats with a portion of the skin of the fruit he had eaten. That portion of the skin he consumed to dust in the fire; and, observing that a strong odor remained in the room, he deliberately turned on the unlighted gas for a few minutes. After this he opened the window, sealed his own seal in red wax on paper a great many times, finally burning the collection, and lit a large cigar, which he smoked through with every appearance of enjoyment. While engaged on this portion of his task, he helped himself frequently to <b>sherry</b> from the <b>glass,</b> first carefully rinsed, into which he had poured the liquid from the now unlabelled phial. Lastly he put the phial in his pocket with the little syringe, stored the six oranges, wrapped in delicate paper, within the basket, and closed the window.|$|R
