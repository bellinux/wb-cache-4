25|$|At 10.50am, {{commander}} Kölle {{decided to}} make an emergency landing on a reclaimed island near Laragne Buech, north of Sisteron {{in the region of}} Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in south-eastern France as he knew he couldn't keep his ship in the air much longer. The commander steered his ship into the dry bed of a river, but the zeppelin bounced up again, losing one of her propellers on impact. The commander ordered the crew to jump from the ship before it crashed on the hillside next to the river, but not all the crew had abandoned LZ 85 before she crashed into the hillside. The ship came to rest on the hill almost undamaged and the commander and remaining crew abandoned LZ 85 and set the ship ablaze with a <b>signal</b> <b>pistol</b> before anyone could stop him, despite the efforts of Madame Dupont, a local farmer's wife. After burning the aircraft, the crew of 17 men along with the first officer and commander Kölle were taken into custody as prisoners of war.|$|E

50|$|C Force never {{received}} its vehicles as the US merchant ship San Jose carrying them was, at {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War, diverted to Manila, in the Philippine Islands, {{at the request of the}} US Government. The Royal Rifles had served only in the Dominion of Newfoundland and Saint John, New Brunswick, prior to posting to Hong Kong and the Winnipeg Grenadiers had been deployed to Jamaica. Few Canadian soldiers had field experience, but were near fully equipped, except for having only two anti-tank rifles and no ammunition for 2-inch and 3-inch mortars or for <b>signal</b> <b>pistols,</b> deficiencies which the British undertook to remedy in Hong Kong, although not at once.|$|R
50|$|The raft {{provided}} by the aircraft was his only form of shelter for the next 10 days. Several times, Franz unsuccessfully attempted {{to attract the attention}} of various tankers and passing aircraft by firing his <b>signal</b> <b>pistol.</b> In order to escape the heat he would usually swim in the water during midday.|$|E
50|$|The former spectroscopic {{laboratory}} of the McClean telescope was {{converted into a}} museum in 1987, retaining the original 19th-century fittings. The building still contains the original hydraulic apparatus for raising the observing floor and a darkroom which contains specimens of darkroom equipment taken from various domes after photography went out of use. Items on display include telescope models, measuring machines, altazimuth instruments by Dollond (1820) and Bamberg (ca 1900), calculating machines, early office equipment, early electronic devices, lenses from early telescopes including the photographic telescopes of Gill, a clockwork telescope drive, a <b>signal</b> <b>pistol,</b> chemistry equipment etc.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} several minutes, tragedy would claim all 51 crewmen except for one, Machon. He and a boatswain's mate decided to attempt to open the torpedo loading hatch rather than die from the gas. Because his crewmate had no snorkel, he let him go first and quickly followed. After exiting the boat, his crewmate got {{confused}} with the direction {{to the surface and}} swam horizontally, only to lose himself between the hull and the superstructure. Upon reaching the surface, Machon swam around for roughly 1.5 hours unsuccessfully looking for his partner until an inflated life-jacket was dropped to him from a circling airplane from the 99th bombing squadron. This was soon followed by a drop of a thermos outfitted with water, a <b>signal</b> <b>pistol,</b> paddles and about 200 ft of rope.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Dunblane massacre, the {{government}} passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997, defining [...] "short firearms" [...] as Section 5 Prohibited Weapons, which effectively banned private possession of handguns almost completely. Exceptions to the ban include muzzle-loading guns, pistols of historic interest (such as pistols used in notable crimes, rare prototypes, unusual serial numbers, guns forming {{part of a}} collection), guns used for starting sporting events, <b>signal</b> <b>pistols,</b> pistols that are of particular aesthetic interest (such as engraved or jewelled guns) and shot pistols for pest control. Under certain circumstances, individuals may be issued a PPW (Personal Protection Weapon) licence. Even the UK's Olympic shooters fell under this ban; shooters could only train in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or outside the UK (in Switzerland, in practice). Prior to the 2012 London Olympics, British Shooting negotiated {{an agreement with the}} Home Office to issue Section 5 Permits to a limited number of nominated elite athletes, allowing them to keep pistols and train on the UK Mainland at nominated [...] "Section 5 Ranges". This agreement was renewed following the Olympics and Section 5 Permits remain on issue for eligible members of the GB Squad.|$|R
60|$|Lister {{went across}} to the major, who at once consented to give the <b>signal.</b> The <b>pistols</b> were then loaded, the ground measured, and the {{principals}} placed in position. The major took two pistols--one loaded with ball, the other with powder only, and then placed himself some ten paces {{on one side of}} the line of fire.|$|R
5000|$|The older type of Very pistol, {{typical of}} the type used in the Second World War, are of one inch bore (26.5mm), now known as 'Calibre 4' for <b>signal</b> <b>pistols.</b> These are still {{available}} and more recent longer barrel models can also fire parachute flares. Many newer models fire smaller 12-gauge flares. In countries where possession of firearms is strictly controlled, such as the United Kingdom, the use of Very pistols as emergency equipment on boats is less common than, for example, the United States. In such locations, distress flares are more commonly fired from single-shot tube devices which are then disposed of after use. These devices are fired by twisting or striking a pad on one end, but the contents are otherwise similar to a round from a flare gun, although the flares themselves are much larger and can burn brighter for longer.. In the Russian Federation, which also has strict controls on firearms, a special tube-shaped flare launching device called a [...] "Hunter's Signal" [...] (Сигнал Охотника) is available. This is reusable but is deliberately designed {{in a way to}} avoid resemblance to a gun.|$|R

50|$|A blank {{is a type}} of {{cartridge}} for {{a firearm}} that contains gunpowder but no bullet or shot. Blanks use paper or plastic wadding to seal gunpowder into the cartridge. When fired, the blank makes a flash and an explosive sound (report), the wadding is propelled from the barrel of the gun, and the firearm's action cycles. Blanks are often used for simulation (such as in historical reenactments, theatre and movie special effects), training, for <b>signaling</b> (see starting <b>pistol),</b> and cowboy mounted shooting. Blank cartridges differ from dummy cartridges, which are used for training or function testing firearms; these contain no primer or gunpowder, and are inert.|$|R
5000|$|The buoys were {{of square}} or {{hexagonal}} construction {{and had a}} floor space of about 43 square feet with an 8-foot cabin rising above the float. On the upper deck of this cabin, there was an oval turret 6 feet high with a signal mast carrying a wireless antenna. Tube railings to which the distressed flyers could cling ran along the outer circumference below and above the water line. A ladder {{led up to the}} turret, in which there was a door opening into the cabin below.A 320-foot red and yellow striped rope anchored the buoy at a fixed location, but allowed a limited drift, thereby indicating the direction of the current to aircraft in distress. The buoy was painted light yellow above the water line, and red crosses against white oval backgrounds were painted {{on each side of the}} turret.The cabin accommodated four persons comfortably for several days, and in an emergency, the crews of several aircraft could be taken care of. It was electrically lit by storage batteries, but in case of a breakdown kerosene lamps or other lighting devices were provided. There were two double-deck beds and adequate cupboard space for first-aid equipment, dry clothing and shoes, emergency rations, and a water supply. Hot food could be prepared on an alcohol stove. Cognac to relieve chill and cigarettes to quiet the nerves were also provided. Games, stationery, playing cards, etc. afforded diversion until rescue was effected. Depleted supplies were always immediately replaced upon the arrival of the rescue ship. A tubular lifeboat was available for transferring the downed aviators from the buoy to the ship.Signalling was accomplished by hoisting a black anchor ball and a yellow and red striped flag on the mast during the day. At night, red and white lights in the turret indicated that rescued men were on board. A white anchor light on the mast was visible for 3,000 feet or more. SOS signals giving the location of the buoy were automatically sent out by an emergency wireless transmitter. <b>Signal</b> <b>pistols</b> with red and white lights, white-light parachute flares, or a smoke, distress-signalling apparatus completed the signalling equipment. Other equipment included plugs to stop up bullet holes in the walls of the cabin and a pump for the expulsion of seepage.|$|R
25|$|On June 2, the Union columns {{set off to}} {{converge}} on Philippi. After an overnight march in rainy weather, both arrived at Philippi before dawn the following morning. Morris had planned a predawn assault to be <b>signaled</b> by a <b>pistol</b> shot. The green Confederate volunteers had failed to establish picket lines for perimeter security, choosing instead to escape the cold rain and stay inside their tents. A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her pistol at them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely.|$|R
5000|$|The {{provisions}} of the Firearms Acts 1968 to 1997 {{do not apply to}} any antique firearm held as a curiosity or ornament. The word 'antique' is not defined in the Act, but it is suggested that the categories below should be used as a guide in deciding whether a particular firearm might be considered an 'antique' for these purposes.Part I: Old weapons which should benefit from exemption as antiques under section 58 (2) of the Firearms Act 1968a) All muzzle-loading firearms;b) Breech-loading firearms capable of discharging a rim-fire cartridge other than 4mm, 5mm, [...]22" [...] or [...]23" [...] (or their metric equivalents), 6mm or 9mm rimfire;c) Breech-loading firearms using ignition systems other than rimfire and centrefire (These include pin-fire and needle-fire ignition systems, as well as the more obscure lip fire, cup-primed, teat fire and base fire systems);d) Breech-loading centre-fire arms originally chambered for one of the obsolete cartridges listed in Annex B and which retain their original chambering;e) Vintage (pre 1939) rifles, shotguns and punt guns chambered for the following cartridges expressed in imperial measurements: 32 bore, 24 bore, 14 bore, 10 bore (⅝" [...] and 2⅞" [...] only), 8 bore, 4 bore, 3 bore, 2 bore, 1⅛ bore, 1¼ bore and 1½ bore, and vintage punt guns and shotguns with bores of 10 or greater.Note (i) - The exemption does not apply to ammunition, and the possession of live ammunition suitable for use with an otherwise antique firearm will normally indicate that the firearm is not possessed as a curio or ornament.Note (ii) - The exemption does not apply to firearms of modern manufacture which otherwise conform to the description above. Fully working modern firing replicas of muzzle-loading and breech-loading firearms, for example those used to fire blanks by historical re-enactment societies but capable of firing live ammunition, must be held on certificate. For these purposes, 'modern manufacture' should be taken to mean manufacture after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.Old weapons which should not benefit from the exemption as antiques under section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968NB: This list is not exhaustive and there may be other types and calibres of firearms that should be considered 'modern' rather than 'antique'.a) Shotguns and smooth-bored guns, including shot pistols, chambered for standard shotgun cartridges, [...]22 inch, [...]23 inch, 6mm and 9mm rim-fire cartridges;).b) Rifles and handguns chambered for 4mm, 5mm, [...]22 inch, [...]23 inch, 6mm or 9mm rim-fire ammunition;c) Revolvers, single-shot pistols and self-loading pistols which are chambered for, and will accept, popular centre-fire cartridges of the type [...]25, [...]32, [...]38, [...]380, [...]44, [...]450, [...]455 and [...]476 inch, or their metric equivalents including 6.35, 7.62, 7.63, 7.65 , 8 and 9mm, unless otherwise specified;d) Modern reproduction firearms or old firearms which have been modified to allow the use of shotgun cartridges or cartridges not listed in Annex B;e) Extensively modified weapons (e.g. Sawn off shotguns);f) Very <b>signalling</b> <b>pistols</b> chambered for 1 and 1½ inch cartridges or 26.5/27mm cartridges;g) Pump-action and self-loading centre fire rifles, except that examples originally chambered for one of the obsolete cartridges listed at Annex B and retaining that original chambering, may benefit from exemption as antiques under section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended) ...|$|R
60|$|The Montauk carried three boats; the launch, a large, safe, and well-constructed craft, {{which stood}} in the usual chucks between the {{foremast}} and mainmast; a jolly-boat, and a cutter. It was next to impossible to get the first into the water, deprived as the ship was of its mainmast; but the other hanging at davits, one on each quarter, were easily lowered. The packets seldom carry any arms beyond a light gun to fire <b>signals</b> with, the <b>pistols</b> of the master, and perhaps a fowling-piece or two. Luckily the passengers were better provided: all the gentlemen had pistols, Mr. Monday and Mr. Dodge excepted, if indeed they properly belonged to this category, as Captain Truck would say, {{and most of them}} had also fowling-pieces. Although a careful examination of the coast with the glasses offered no signs of the presence of any danger from enemies, these arms were carefully collected, loaded, and deposited in the boats, in order to be prepared for the worst. Provisions and water were also provided, and the party were about to proceed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{successful}} {{production of}} four four-pound cannons and two short howitzers on October 27, 1853 is date of foundation of Zastava Arms in Kragujevac. Between 1856 an 1860, the facilities in Kragujevac received many upgrades to its manufacturing system, eventually allowing {{the plant to}} produce weapons with full parts interchangeability. In 1878, {{one of the main}} priorities became the modernization of armaments. Serbian rifle „Piboduša“ Model 1870 Peabody became obsolete with their large 14,9mm caliber. After a research project and a competitive tender in 1879, a new model rifle was chosen as the replacement. The first domestic-made repeating rifle, a derivative of the Mauser Model 1871 bolt-action rifle, was designed in 1880 by Kosta Milovanović and was named Mauzer Milovanović M. 1880, known as [...] "Mauser-Koka" [...] or [...] "Koka's Rifle", after its designer. The weapon was first manufactured in Germany and was called the Mauser-Milovanović M1878/80, cal. 10,15mm.In 1924 and 1925, the Ministry of the Interior signed contracts with FN Herstal, Belgium which allowed the production of M24 series bolt-action rifles chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser. Factory for production of rifles and infantry ammunition was also built. The factory for production of infantry ammunition started to work on March 22, 1928 and the factory for production of rifles and ammunition was put to operation on October 15 (75th anniversary of first casting of cannons in Kragujevac). During 1930, the factory started the production of <b>signal</b> <b>pistols</b> 26 mm M 1929 on the basis of Czechoslovakian licence. In July 1936, the factory got a licence from the Czechoslovakian Zbrojovka Brno to produce light machineguns 7,9 mm M 1937. [...] Zastava Arms was heavily damaged during World War II. When Kragujevac was liberated on October 21, 1944, the weapons factory was put back into working order within months and production began shortly after, with the 9mm M 1944 B2 submachine gun developed during the same year. The next postwar production rifle was the 7.92×57mm Mauser Model 1948 on the basis of Model 24. The production of air rifles and sporting rifles on the basis of rifle M48 started in 1953. In 1954 the Zastava started the production of shotguns and small bore rifles, as well as machine gun 7,9 mm M42 ¨Sarac¨. Batch production of semi-automatic rifle PAP M59 7.62×39mm started in 1964. In the 1964, the factory started the development of automatic rifle, of Kalashnikov system, which was named M67 in 1967. On the basis of rifle M67, the factory developed automatic rifle in caliber 7.62×39mm, which was named Zastava M70 in the following year. Yugoslav People's Army included assault rifle M70 in calibre 7.62×39mm into its armament in 1970. Small arms derivatives of the M70 produced rifles chambered in Western bloc ammunition such as 7.62×51mm NATO and 5.56×45mm NATO. In 1988, the factory developed a compact design pistol in 9 mm Parabellum model M88. In the 1980s, the plant for action of machine guns M84, M86 in 7.62×54mmR and heavy machine gun in 12.7 NSV M87 was set to operation as well. In July 1989 Zastava started the development of the double-action pistol in calibre 9mm PARA CZ 99. In 1992, the factory finished the development and testing and started batch production of 7.62 mm submachine gun M92, based on submachine gun M85. Using the Mauser mechanism, the factory developed 12.7 mm long range rifle Black Arrow M93. During the Yugoslav Wars of 1991 to 1995, the United Nations placed economic sanctions on the import and export of weapons from Yugoslavia, production slowed as a result. In 1999 the factory was damaged by NATO bombing. In 2005 Zastava Arms underwent restructuring. The same year, a memorandum of understanding was signed with Remington Arms to export hunting and sporting guns to the United States, Canada and Mexico.|$|R
