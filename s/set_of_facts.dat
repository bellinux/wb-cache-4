5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E

The join <b>of</b> two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> E 1 and E 2, {{is defined}} as the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> all <b>facts</b> that are implied {{independently}} by both E 1 and E 2. Congruence closure is a widely used representation for <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> equational <b>facts</b> in the theory of uninterpreted function symbols (UFS). We present an optimal join algorithm for special classes of the theory of UFS using the abstract congruence closure framework. Several known join algorithms, which work on a strict subclass, can be cast as specific instantiations of our generic procedure. We demonstrate the limitations of any approach for computing joins that is based on the use of congruence closure. We also mention some interesting open problems in this area. ...|$|R

25|$|Knowledge Representation (KR) {{research}} involves {{analysis of}} how to reason accurately and effectively {{and how best to}} use a set of symbols to represent a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> within a knowledge domain. A symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable inferences about elements in the KR to create new KR sentences. Logic is used to supply formal semantics of how reasoning functions should be applied to the symbols in the KR system. Logic is also used to define how operators can process and reshape the knowledge. Examples of operators and operations include, negation, conjunction, adverbs, adjectives, quantifiers and modal operators. The logic is interpretation theory. These elements—symbols, operators, and interpretation theory—are what give sequences of symbols meaning within a KR.|$|E
25|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the {{legislature}} has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example). Nonetheless, as a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.|$|E

Claiming that the NFA was resisting structural changes that BK was making in regards to pricing, hours and its new gift card program, CEO John Chindsey claimed [...] "many instances of the NFA's non-cooperation and affirmative disruption of efforts to improve the Burger King system" [...] were the reason for the break. The company also announced that it would be diverting a $1million (USD) NFA advertising subsidy into the company's own advertising fund. In a response, the NFA chairman Daniel Fitzpatrick responded in a letter to Burger King's parent stating that [...] "to sever relations with the... NFA is extremely regrettable" [...] and based on [...] "an erroneous <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> innuendo and rumor" [...] claimed that the company owed the NFA $1.7million in total subsidy funds. The two sides settled their differences in April 2006 when Burger King agreed to pay the disputed subsidy funds to the group.

2500|$|Anscombe also {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash {{at the time that he}} gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts xyz can generally be said to entail the fact A relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso [...] "under normal circumstances", for [...] "one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been." [...] A set facts xyz... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> ABC... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in John Searle's philosophy of speech acts and institutional reality.|$|E

2500|$|The Law Commission Report on Partial Defences to Murder (2004), {{rejects the}} notion of {{creating}} a mitigatory defence to cover the use of excessive force in self-defence but accepts that the [...] "all or nothing" [...] effect of self-defence can produce unsatisfactory results {{in the case of}} murder. A battered woman, partner in a same-sex relationship or abused child using excessive force because he or she is physically at a disadvantage and not under imminent attack, would be denied a defence. It was always possible that the same <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> could be interpreted as either self-defence or provocation where there was a loss of control resulting in death. Thus, the Commission recommends a redefinition of provocation to cover situations where a person acts lethally out of fear. This reflects the present view of psychiatrists that most people act in violent situations with a combination of fear and anger in their minds, and to separate the two emotions is not legally constructive.|$|E

2500|$|Because, for Kennedy, {{the text}} of the statute was not clearly {{susceptible}} to two different interpretations, {{there was no need to}} invoke the principle of constitutional avoidance as the majority did. [...] In any event, the constitutional rule the Court articulated could too easily be circumvented, simply by rewriting the statute using slightly different words. [...] The requirements imposed by the Sixth Amendment should not depend on the vagaries of Congress's choice of words when it drafts a statute. [...] And if that should be so, the Court should more clearly spell out what words and phrases Congress should use in order to trigger certain constitutional protections. [...] Furthermore, Kennedy saw no difference of constitutional significance between recidivism, which the Court had already held was excluded from the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> to which the jury-trial requirement applies, and [...] "serious bodily injury"; the mere [...] "tradition" [...] of doing so might justify this difference, if it were more clear that the carjacking statute were consistent with that tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Juries {{are often}} {{justified}} because they leaven the law with community norms. A jury trial verdict {{in a case}} is binding only in that case, {{and is not a}} legally binding precedent in other cases. [...] For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence. [...] Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony {{in exactly the same way}} twice, so this would be difficult to prove. [...] It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts.</b> [...] However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as [...] "jury nullification of law" [...] or simply jury nullification. When there is no jury ("bench trial"), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.|$|E
2500|$|UK and EU law divide {{discrimination}} into {{direct and}} indirect forms. Direct discrimination means treating a person, because of a [...] "protected characteristic", less favourably than a comparable person who has {{a different type of}} gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. This is an objective test, so the employer's motives are irrelevant. Even if employers have [...] "positive" [...] motives, for instance to help underprivileged groups, discrimination is still unlawful in principle. The claimant's trait merely has to be the reason for the unfavourable treatment. An appropriate comparator is one who is the same in all respects except for the relevant trait, which is claimed as the ground for discrimination. For instance in Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary a chief inspector claimed that she was dismissed because the police force was sexist, and pointed to male chief inspectors who had not been treated unfavourably. The House of Lords overturned a Tribunal finding of sex discrimination because colleagues had complained about how Ms Shamoon had performed appraisals, and her chosen comparators had not received complaints. Generally there is, however, no need to point to an actual comparator, so a claimant can allege they were treated less favourably than a hypothetical person would have been, who is the same except for the protected characteristic. The burden of proof is explicitly regulated so that claimants merely need to show a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> from which a reasonable tribunal could conclude there was discrimination, and need not show an intention to discriminate. Because the law aims to eliminate the mindset and culture of discrimination, it is irrelevant whether the person who was targeted was themselves a person with a protected characteristic, so that people who associate with or are perceived to possess a protected characteristic are protected too. In Coleman v Attridge Law a lady with a disabled child was abused by her employer for taking time off to care for the child. Even though Ms Coleman was not disabled, she could claim disability discrimination. And in English v Sanderson Blinds Ltd, a man who was from Brighton and went to boarding school was teased for being gay. Even though he was married with children, he successfully claimed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. An instruction by an employer to discriminate against customers or anyone else also violates the law.|$|E
