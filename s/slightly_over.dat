5|$|After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became {{essentially}} built out, {{growth in}} the area shifted to suburbs to the west.

5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic industry that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been <b>slightly</b> <b>over</b> 10billion Francs.|$|E
5|$|Shatner's cut ran <b>slightly</b> <b>over</b> {{two hours}} (not {{including}} end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long.

Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E

With a regular army of only <b>slightly</b> <b>over</b> seven thousand men {{at the start of the}} war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E
