500|$|AIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had {{originally}} contributed their {{portion of the}} budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality. Nicholson told Louis Heyward, [...] "It {{is one of the}} best we have gotten from England. Everybody thinks this is about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years." [...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in him. I was <b>surprised</b> <b>how</b> terrifying Vincent was in that... I hadn't expected it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. Nobody told me about it. I was <b>surprised</b> <b>how</b> close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year.

It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

She was also on hand as President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act, and lunched privately with Michelle Obama. Reagan revealed {{in an interview with}} Vanity Fair that Michelle Obama had telephoned her for advice on living and entertaining in the White House. Following the death of Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009, she said she was [...] "terribly saddened...

500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author.

[...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain moments I feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions.

Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes <b>surprised</b> <b>how</b> close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy."

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be <b>surprised</b> <b>how</b> little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E

The movie was one of the highest budget Danish films of all time largely due to its extravagant costumes and was well received by critics. Mikkelsen said of his role, [...] "I was <b>surprised</b> <b>how</b> emotional I got reading this, especially for a period drama. And it was full of dilemma – he's full of love for both the king and the queen, but then he remains political, starts spinning his tunnel vision, {{and all of a sudden}} he's doing the exact same things he hated all the other courtiers for doing, and I thought that was interesting, and very human." ...|$|E
