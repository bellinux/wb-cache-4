This notional set of verbs {{is not a}} class in any grammatical sense; C&B verbs are formally undistinguishable from many other transitive state-change verbs. But they nicely reveal the characteristic specificity of Tzeltal verb semantics: C&B actions are finely differentiated according to the spatial and textural properties of the theme object, with no <b>superordinate</b> <b>term</b> meaning 'either cut in general' or 'break in general'.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} about the {{crimes committed by}} Argentina’s last military dictatorship and whether these deserve the legal qualification of crimes against humanity or “genocide. ” This question has consequences which go beyond the field of law and affect society and collective psychology through the reconstruction of historical memory. From this perspective, this paper argues that the definition of Genocide set forth in international law is directly applicable in Argentine national law. It also examines the different problems {{with the use of}} this term. Finally, it aims to reconstruct the figure of Genocide from the original interpretation of the works of Raphael Lemkin, and establish the “national” group as the <b>superordinate</b> <b>term</b> and ‘ethnic’, ‘racial’ and ‘religious’ groups as cohyponyms, where “national” group includes and goes beyond the other three groups, and authorizes the inclusion of groups not explicitly covered by the 1948 Convention...|$|E
40|$|A {{central issue}} posited {{by those who}} have studied {{agreement}} with coordinate nouns is that the individual conjuncts have different agreement features from the coordinate phrase (Dalrymple and Kaplan, 2000). This thesis explores agreement in MG coordinate nouns within the constraint-based framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar. It investigates predicate-argument and head-modifier agreement with coordinate nouns and agreement with disjunctively conjoined nouns. In predicate-argument agreement, the syntactic and semantic (Corbett, 1991; Wechsler, 2009; Sadler, 2006) agreement principles occur crosslinguistically. I argue that a referen-tial principle also exists, motivated by a Contextually Introduced Referent implied in the sentence. CIR is the <b>superordinate</b> <b>term</b> of the coordinate nouns and the predicative adjec-tive/participle copies its agreement features. Thus, I propose an LFG syntactic account for referential agreement. In head-modifier agreement, MG modifiers behave different from the definite determiner. I argue that a shared modifier shows concord agreement, it scopes over coordinate nouns and occurs with the joint and split interpretations. A shared deter...|$|E

The first experiment, a lexical decision task with taxonomic terms serving as no-go trials, revealed {{no differences in}} ERP waveforms to basic level as compared to <b>superordinate</b> <b>terms.</b> The second experiment, a modified oddball paradigm, revealed a consistent pattern of ERP differences: Superordinate deviants elicited a prolonged early positivity as compared to standard items, possibly a P 3 a component, while basic level deviants elicited an enlarged N 400 compared to standard items. Additionally, taxonomic items presented only once in a recognition test elicited different ERPs depending on their respective taxonomic level. Moreover, study- as well as recognition-ERP patterns differed depending on whether Subjects were confronted with basic level <b>terms</b> or with <b>superordinates</b> as standards.

40|$|Constructivist {{theories}} of emotion must explain recent empirical findings of strong similarity {{in the structure}} of emotion space across dissimilar cultures. We believe similarity may emerge from shared cognitive processes and resource constraints operating on a domain named using the <b>superordinate</b> <b>term</b> “emotion. ” Without that term, no coherent domain is formed. Within a category of emotion terms, cultural differences may be revealed best by subordinate terms conveying contextualized information that varies with culture. We compared consensus and the structure of the emotion meaning space for monolingual and bilingual Vietnamese and English speakers in the USA and Saigon, Vietnam. Subjects made triad similarity judgments among 15 emotion terms, replicating previous studies of Chinese and Japanese. Our Vietnamese speakers produced strong differences only for two subordinate-level terms, “shame ” and “anguish. ” Bilingual speakers produced judgments more similar to native English when responding in English and more similar to monolingual Vietnamese when responding in Vietnamese, suggesting flexible mapping. The Interpoint Distance Model (developed by Jameson and D’Andrade for color categorization) was applied to explain cross-cultural similarities and differences in emotion categorization and naming...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to show the {{positive}} effects of categorical organization on verbal working memory (WM), in a modified version of a double task, such as the Listening Span Test (LST) (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980). Two experiments were performed comparing sentences with the typical definitional format (i. e., <b>superordinate</b> <b>term,</b> copula, and specification) to sentences simply describing objects or events. The results of the two experiments, with participants from children aged 6 to adults, revealed that word recall was better in Categorical sentences than in Descriptive sentences and are interpreted in terms of retrieval facilitation, due to pre-existing organization in semantic memory, at least from the age of 8 onwards. Recall performance was also better with sentences giving True statements than those giving False statements. Furthermore, Categorical False sentences are more effective in enhancing recall than Descriptive False sentences since they violate well-established semantic expectations. Such variables were also found to act among participants with a lowerWM span, by this confirming that pre-existing organized information may compensate for less efficient WM...|$|E

The theoretical introduction also constitutes of a section focused on administrative punishment and the principles that may have an impact on it to the extent of judicial punishment.

50|$|As is {{the case}} with overextension, parents can {{contribute}} to a child’s prolonged underextension of words. When speaking to their children, parents may not give every instance of a category of objects its correct name, especially in unusual situations, triggering word errors. In a study by Thomas G. White, preschool children ages 3 to 5 did not apply labels (e.g., food) to category instances that were rated as atypical by adults. The study also showed that mothers used <b>superordinate</b> <b>terms</b> much less in atypical instances than typical instances. This suggests that the labels children hear their parents apply may affect underextension. However, as children grow older, their vocabularies grow and instances of underextension decline.|$|R

We concentrate on the cognitive factor of informativeness; namely, that a novel combination should convey its meaning unambiguously.

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between cohesion and coherence? Researchers in the field of Applied Linguistics have traditionally attempted to list and define the cohesive devices in English which provide the basis for coherent text. Schema theoreticians, on the other hand, have argued that coherence is primary, that readers look for coherence given their existing schemata and extra-linguistic knowledge of the world and only then do they recognise cohesion. This paper looks at these two approaches {{in the light of the}} conflict which has grown up around {{the relationship}} between the concepts of cohesion and coherence and suggests that the positions taken are the result of a theoretically different starting point. If the researcher is primarily interested in linguistic analysis then s/he will begin with cohesion whereas, if human psychology in the reading process is the main focus then it will be more natural to look at coherence. However, it seems to be at least intuitively obvious that both the text itself and the reader have a part to play in the reading process, that reading is simultaneously data-driven and concept-driven. It is suggested that these two approaches would benefit from being a part of a larger theory of the reading process. In this context the work of Ruqaiya Hasan is reviewed as the most thorough attempt to provide a theory of text which accounts for both cohesion and coherence. Secondly, data are presented which suggest that a theory which integrates cohesion and coherence is necessary. Two studies are reported: an informal classroom experiment on the influence of pronominal refer-ence on comprehension and an analysis of the results of a test designed to examine the relationships between theoretical constructs hypothesised to constitute (at least part of) the <b>superordinate</b> <b>term</b> "reading comprehension"...|$|E
40|$|Incompatibility (or co-hyponymy) is {{the most}} general type of {{semantic}} relation between lexical items, the meaning of which entails exclusion. Such items fall under a <b>superordinate</b> <b>term</b> or concept and denote sets which have no members in common (e. g. animal: dog-cat-mouse-lion-sheep; example from Cruse 2004). Traditionally, these have been of interest to lexical semanticists for {{the description of the}} structure of the lexicon. However, incompatibility is not just a relation that signifies a difference of meaning. This paper is a critical corpus-assisted re-evaluation of the phenomenon of incompatibility which argues that the relation in question sometimes also functions as a discourse marker. Incompatibles indicate recurrent intertextual patterns. This holds particularly true for socially or politically controversial lexical items such as Flexibilität (flexibility), Mobilität (mobility) or Globalisierung (globalisation). Corpus investigations of such words have revealed that among other semantically related terms, incompatibles have a crucial discourse focussing function. For the German lexical item Globalisierung, I will show how its lexical usage can be studied through a corpus-driven analysis of corresponding incompatibles. Incompatible terms are not contingent co-words but often occur in close contextual proximity and participate in regular syntagmatic structures (e. g. Globalisierung und Rationalisierung; Globalisierung und Modernisierung; Neoliberalismus, Globalisierung und Kapitalismus). Hence, these are easily extracted by conducting a computational collocation analysis. Such significant collocates provide a good insight into the discursive and thematic contexts of the search word. Following Teubert (2004), I will demonstrate how the meaning of such lexical items is constituted in discourse and how the examination of these particular collocates reveals their senseconstructing function and their pragmatic-discursive force. I will provide a brief discussion of the methodology used for such analyses, and I will explain why the complex semantic-pragmatic and thematic-communicative patterns implied in sets of incompatibles should be given a stronger emphasis in lexicography. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} characterization of the lexical-semantic phenomena of hypernymy and synonymy when treated as relations between meaning established by words in written textuality. Synonymy and hypernymy are defined, respectively, as relations of equivalence and of inclusion. In order to consider two words synonyms, the following criteria must be observed: the equivalence of meaning, and the referential identity. Hypernymy, on the other hand, {{is closely related to}} the processes of categorization: the more <b>superordinate</b> <b>term,</b> broader from the referential point of view (fruit, animal, furniture), is given the name of hypernym; the more specific element is given the name of hyponym (pear, cat, table). The relation between hypernym and hyponym is characterized by specific properties, such as transitivity and unilateral implication. Our purpose is to test the defined criteria for synonymy, and the properties that can be applied to relations of hypernymy in the treatment of isolated words, for words employed in a specific context, in order to verify how these relations are mantained. To perform our analyses, texts were selected from digital and printed versions of scientific magazines with national circulation; through the corpus, the main characteristics of these phenomena in textual context are analyzed. The methodological framework on which these analyses are built is that of Componential Semantics, in which the meaning of a word can be described in minimal traits of significance. We believe that the relations of hypernymy and synonymy, on the sentence/text level, can be explained via erasure and highlight of these traits, in accordance to the meaning that the context establishes for these words. This way, we observe that, in certain lexical substitutions for the hypernyms, a relation of synonymy is established, and not one of hyponymy/hypernymy anymore. Both words are used, in this case, to reference the same entity, and are both equivalent in meaning. This research was subsidized by FAPESP/CAPES. Esta pesquisa investiga como se caracterizam os fenômenos semântico-lexicais de hiperonímia e sinonímia quando tratados como relações entre sentidos estabelecidos pelas palavras na textualidade escrita. A sinonímia e a hiperonímia são definidas, respectivamente como relações de equivalência e inclusão. Para considerarmos duas palavras sinônimas, os seguintes critérios precisam ser observados: a equivalência de sentido e a identidade referencial. Já a hiperonímia está intimamente relacionada aos processos de categorização, sendo que se dá o nome de hiperônimo ao termo mais superordenado, mais abrangente sob o ponto de vista referencial (fruta, animal, móvel), e dá-se o nome de hipônimo (pera, gato, mesa) ao elemento mais específico. A relação entre hiperônimo e hipônimo é caracterizada por propriedades específicas como a transitividade e a implicação unilateral. Temos como propósito testar os critérios definidos para a sinonímia e as propriedades que se aplicam às relações hiperonímicas no tratamento de palavras isoladas, em palavras empregadas em um contexto escrito específico, a fim de verificar como essas relações mantêm-se. Para empreender nossas análises, selecionamos textos de versões digitais e impressas de revistas de circulação nacional do gênero divulgação científica, bem como, através desse corpus, analisamos as principais características desses fenômenos no âmbito textual. A base metodológica sobre a qual construiremos nossas análises é a Semântica Componencial, cujo entendimento nos diz que o significado de uma palavra pode ser descrito em traços mínimos de significação. Acreditamos que as relações de hiperonímia e sinonímia, no nível sentencial/textual, podem ser explicadas através do apagamento e realçamento desses traços, de acordo com os sentidos estabelecidos pelo contexto às palavras em questão. Dessa forma, observamos que, em determinadas substituições lexicais por hiperônimos, temos uma relação de sinonímia estabelecida e não mais de hipônimo/hiperônimo. Ambos os termos, nesse caso, são utilizados para fazer referência a uma mesma entidade, e são equivalentes em sentido. Esta pesquisa teve o apoio financeiro da FAPESC/CAPES...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Whereas most {{previous}} {{findings suggest that}} mem-ory may become more abstract over time, so that memory for gist outlasts verbatim memory, there are findings suggesting that abstract information may sometimes be instantiated in more specific terms. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that retained information tends to converge at an intermediate level of abstractness—the basic level. In two experiments, we found bidirectional, symmetrical shifts in the memory for story material: Participants presented with either subordinate terms (e. g., sports car) or <b>superordinate</b> <b>terms</b> (e. g., vehicle) tended to falsely report basic-level terms (e. g., car) instead. This pattern emerged for both recall and recognition memory tests, at both immediate and delayed testing, and under free and forced reporting.

Changes in the social world result in changes in the communicative practice as well. However, a systematic comparision of text-types across cultures and across ideological boundaries reveals both differences in the textual macro- and superstructures and overlapping as well as universal features, probably related to functional aspects (discourse of power).

40|$|Everything {{around us}} is {{immersed}} in culture. Culture does not only entail values, norms and lifestyle patterns as merely symbolical or ideological entities specific {{to a particular}} society, but it also comprises artifacts, i. e. material goods produced by its members (Giddens 1994). Avid readers of genre fiction stemming from various countries and cultures have certainly come across such entities: they are usually names, objects or phenomena rooted in the source culture. Swedish popular fiction, for instance, opens a gateway to the world where many implicit and explicit references to Swedish culture are to be found. But how does one recognize what might be perceived as typical of a particular foreign culture? The {{answer to that question}} is relatively simple: an item could be considered culture-specific when it is brought into contact with another culture (cf. Franco Aixelá 1996). How these items are rendered in translation appears to be one of the greatest challenges literary translators may face in their professional careers. As intercultural mediators, translators play an indispensable role in constructing cultural identities since they are largely responsible for how the source culture is depicted in the target text. Hence, it is essential to examine items representative of a specific source culture in translations intended for other cultural markets. The primary objective of this study was to investigate potential similarities and differences in how culture-specific items were rendered in the English and Croatian translations of Jens Lapidus’ breakout novel Snabba Cash, as well as to identify the translation techniques and strategies employed. Although the topic of CSIs in general has hitherto been addressed by many influential scholars (Ivir 1987, Florin 1993, Franco Aixelá 1996, Pedersen 2007 etc.), there are very few relevant studies dealing with culture-specific items in translation from Swedish into English and/or Croatian (Grundler 2012, Takáč 2015). Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to contribute to this area of translation studies by offering fresh and helpful insights that could be used in further research of the phenomenon. Given that the novel about Stockholm’s underworld garnered great attention in Sweden, achieving remarkable success on the market, which swiftly turned Lapidus into a bestselling author on the well-established Swedish crime fiction scene, the choice of Snabba Cash as the primary research material is not particularly surprising. Although usually perceived as “low-brow” and “market-oriented” (Storm 2016 : 10), meaning they appeal to the widest range of consumers as they are produced, sold and translated very quickly and cheaply, crime novels make a vast majority of today’s translation production and, as such, may reveal more about the decision-making process than translations of “high-brow” literature (ibid.). Praised by critics, Lapidus’ approach to writing crime fiction differs from the traditional Swedish one: he portrays the world of criminals, gangs, and brats from their own perspectives, describing them as whole individuals made of flesh and blood. Three life stories are intertwined in the novel. Johan Westlund, a. k. a. JW, a student of economics, earns money by driving an illegal taxicab and selling cocaine in order to climb the social ladder and sneak into Stockholm’s upper-class social circles. Drug dealer Jorge Salinas Barrio, originally from Chile, is on the run from both the police and the Serbian mafia. Having escaped from the Österåker prison, his mind is set on fleeing the country as soon as possible. Lastly, Mrado Slovovic, a Serbian hatchet man, manages his boss Radovan’s money laundering business, while fantasizing about a good life for his daughter Lovisa and himself. What connects these three life stories to one another is, of course, a burning desire to earn easy money. Linguistically, this novel is even more enthralling, as Lapidus allows for a clash of different languages and writing styles: Rinkebysvenska vs. legal Swedish, journalistic writing vs. economics jargon (Lundberg 2006). In Snabba Cash, the dialogues between characters who come from an immigrant background are partially written in förortssvenska, a multiethnic variety of Swedish, which illustrates the darker side of Swedish society more realistically. Consequently, this study, though to a lesser extent, also provides preliminary findings on how various lexical, syntactic and pragmatic features characteristic of this specific linguistic variety can be transferred into English and Croatian. Widely spoken in the immigrant suburbs of large cities such as Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö, it clearly represents the values promoted by Sweden as a multicultural country, which makes the variety “equally Swedish” as any other culture-specific item. As suggested by Ulla-Britt Kotsinas (2005), it has never been easier to move long distances. We live in an era of globalization where state boundaries have been redrawn and large groups of people have been displaced. While many have abandoned their homelands for political and/or economic reasons, others have moved to new countries to seek adventures. As early as in the 1960 s, the first large wave of immigrants from Greece, Turkey, and the former Yugoslavia arrived in Sweden to enter the labor market. At first, they lived in industrial towns, but soon they moved to cities, eventually settling in the so-called “concrete ghettos”, i. e. suburban areas surrounding Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö built during the miljonprogrammet (“The Million Program”), a public housing program implemented in Sweden between 1965 and 1974. People from all corners of the world eventually came to live there. In the 1980 s, it became obvious that many young people who grew up in the immigrant, predominantly western, suburbs of Stockholm spoke a different variety of Swedish. Consequently, many people concluded that they did not speak “properly”, referring to the variety as “broken Swedish”. The suburban youth, however, took pride in how they spoke and named the variety rinkebysvenska after Rinkeby, a district in western Stockholm with a high concentration of people of immigrant ancestry, boasting about how broad their vocabulary was, as it comprised lexemes from many immigrant languages. Since the large-scale immigration into the Stockholm area during the 1970 s and 1980 s, other popular terms with geographical connotations, such as rosengårdska (Malmö) and gårdstenska (Gothenburg) have come into use. In addition, even terms carrying social connotations have emerged, e. g. miljonsvenska after miljonprogrammet, betongsvenska as a reference to the aforementioned “concrete ghettos” or blattesvenska, where blatte is used pejoratively to describe dark-skinned immigrants. In this respect, förortssvenska can be seen as a borderline case between a dialect and a sociolect. But there is a third possibility: the variety can be classified as a multiethnic socio-dialect (Bijvoet and Fraurud 2006), or a multiethnolect (Quist 2009). The reasoning behind such a terminology is clear: a multiethnolect denotes a linguistic variety that stems from a multiethnic community where speakers have many different native languages, but share one common, contact language. In the case of förortssvenska, this contact language is naturally a variety of Swedish that takes on the characteristics of the speakers’ native languages. The multiethnolect is distinguishable from the standard variety of Swedish with regard to several aspects such as phonology (pronunciation, word boundaries, prosodic features, and vowel length), morphosyntax (concord, the use of prepositions, word order), lexis (förortsslang) and pragmatics (discourse particles). As for culture-specific items, the research questions asked in the beginning were as follows: 1) What culture-specific items can be found in the novel and its translations into English and Croatian? 2) How did the translators render these culture-specific items in their respective translations? 3) Are there any substantial differences between the English and Croatian translations? 4) Which global translation strategies can be established in the translations? In accordance with previous research (Grundler 2012, Takáč 2015) and my own assumptions regarding culture-specific items in translations of popular literature, the following four hypotheses were formed: 1) Both the target culture and the target language influence how culture-specific items are rendered in translation. 2) How culture-specific items are rendered in translation depends on their type. 3) With respect to culture-specific items, the English translation is predominantly exoticized. 4) The Croatian translation is more educational than the novel’s English translation. The primary material for the analysis included the Swedish original, Snabba Cash (2006) and its respective translations into English, entitled Easy Money, and Croatian, under the name Laka lova. The novel was first translated for the American market in 2011 by Astri von Arbin Ahlander. The version examined in this paper is a mere republication of the American translation that was put on the British market in 2012 by the well-known publisher Pan Books. The Croatian publishing company V. B. Z. d. o. o. launched the novel in Danilo Brozović’s translation onto the Croatian market that same year. As the main objective of this study was to conduct an in-depth, comparative analysis of the novel and its respective translations into English and Croatian with a special emphasis on culture-specific items, I decided to look at the first hundred pages of the Swedish original, where many items surfaced for the first time. However, it seemed too demanding to carry out an analysis of all culture-specific items, as such approach would suggest going beyond the usual scope of a diploma thesis. The study was conducted in several steps. In the first step, the focus was laid on text analysis, which means that all the culture-specific items encountered in the first hundred pages were properly marked. Secondly, the items in the original were compared with their respective renditions into English and Croatian. For this purpose, two bilingual parallel corpora were formed. While the first corpus comprised data on the Swedish-English language pair, the second corpus was composed of data on the Swedish-Croatian language pair. During the analysis, the two corpora were edited, supplemented with necessary information and codified with respect to the following two categories: translation technique and global translation strategy. It is vital to distinguish between these two notions. While translation techniques refer to “the various kinds of relationship observable between source text segments and target text segments, translation strategies “could be conscious or automatized” and denote “cognitive routes which lead to problem-solving and are concerned, therefore, with the translation process” (Marco 2009 : 73, qtd. in Veselica Majhut 2012 : 31). In order to map these items, Newmark’s model (1988 : 95, 215) was used. As the model, unfortunately, did not meet the requirements for this research, it was crucial to modify it. Consequently, the culture-specific items were counted and divided into six categories: geographical names; names of institutions, companies, organizations and other business activities; names of people; mass media; food and drinks; and other. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the Swedish-English and the Swedish-Croatian corpora differ in the total number of recorded culture-specific items for various reasons. As already stated, an item becomes culture-specific when it is exposed to another, foreign culture. Looking at examples from the novel, such as kilometer or kilogram, which are only deemed culture-specific in relation to the American, and not Croatian, culture, the discrepancies in the overall count appear even more justifiable. However, another aspect should be taken into consideration. Due to the inconsistencies in the rendering of culture-specific items in the novel, I decided to note, and subsequently count, every occurrence of a culture-specific item rendered differently as a separate item. The collected culture-specific items were then analyzed qualitatively in light of the taxonomies of translation techniques as suggested by Pedersen (2007) and Franco Aixelá (1996). The taxonomies were slightly altered on the basis of the analyzed material. Therefore, the classification applied in this study includes ten translation techniques: complete retention, adapted retention, direct translation, generalization by a <b>superordinate</b> <b>term,</b> generalization by paraphrase, omission, replacement with a source culture item, replacement with a transcultural item, replacement with a target culture item and combination. Moreover, all translation techniques contributed to one of the four global translation strategies (Veselica Majhut 2012, Pavlović 2015) : exoticization, neutralization, education and assimilation. While exoticization implies a more source-culture oriented target text, assimilation entails a more target-culture oriented target text. Neutralization means that cultural specificity is neutralized and/or deleted in the target text. Finally, education is a global strategy revealing the degree of informativity in the target text (Pavlović 2015 : 86 - 87). It should also be noted that some of the techniques such as direct translation or combination contributed to different translation strategies depending on the context. The quantitative analysis produced interesting results. The overall distribution of culture-specific items, as well as the findings regarding the techniques and strategies dominant in each category, are presented comparatively, followed by a general overview of the translation techniques and strategies employed in the two translations. The main findings of this study should be brought to light with regard to the formulated research questions and hypotheses. The first question concerns culture-specific items that can be found in the novel and its translations into English and Croatian. As mentioned previously, the culture-specific items were grouped into the same six categories in both corpora, but their total amounts vary for the above-mentioned reasons: while the Swedish-English corpus comprises 218 culture-specific items, the Swedish-Croatian corpus contains 222 culture-specific items. The second and the third questions can be answered simultaneously. The rendering of culture-specific items in the two translations differs from category to category. Although the proposed taxonomy involves ten different translation techniques, only nine of them were detected in the English translation, as no items were replaced with other source-culture items. On the other hand, all of them were applied in the Croatian translation of the novel. What is more, the most frequently used translation technique in the English translation is complete retention (91 occurrences, 41. 28...|$|E

The aim {{of this article is to}} present a new lexicographic approach to the study of synopsis articles against the background of a planned trilingual dictionary. It will be shown that synopsis articles have a more general use than its restricted application in LSP dictionaries. In fact, the focus will not be on the treatment of technical or scientific vocabulary but rather on cultural terms. This article also raises among other things, questions about the purpose of the planned dictionary, its target users, different types of microstructures as well as different data categories to be included in synopsis articles.

As coletas de dados foram feitas com aplicação de entrevistas estruturadas diretas e pessoais e semi-estruturadas em estudo de grupo e turnês-guiadas. A partir da análise dos termos, foi possível reconhecer características de nomeação relacionadas à morfologia (58 %), à ecologia (29 %) e à cultura (13 %). Também foi possível evidenciar que há termos superordenados (genéricos) que relacionam por inclusão hierárquica os subordinativos (específicos), indicando uma categorização e subcategorização em ordem descendente. Isto está de acordo com o modelo berliniano que nomeia de lexema primário e secundário, respectivamente. Estas análises contribuem para uma melhor compreensão do conhecimento tradicional do povo Baniwa. The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} the naming terminology {{given to the}} palms (Arecaceae) by the Baniwa Indians of the indigenous community of Tunuí Cachoeira, in the Upper Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil, {{in order to obtain}} the translation and/or the meaning of the words. Data collection was achieved through the use of direct structured and semi-structured personal interviews, group study, and guided site-visits (to the plants in question). In analyzing the terms, it was possible to recognize naming characteristics tied to morphology (58 %), ecology (29 %) and culture (13 %). It also was possible to demonstrate that there are <b>superordinate</b> <b>terms</b> (generics) that connect by hierarchical inclusion the subordinate categories (specifics), indicating a categorization and subcategorization in descending order. This is in accord with the Berlinian model which names the primary lexeme and secondary lexeme, respectively. These analyses contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the traditional knowledge of the Baniwa people...|$|R
40|$|Attribute listing is {{a common}} method of {{exploring}} the nature of natural categories. In this article, the content of listed attributes were examined. One hundred and twenty-six categories were used; 11 artifacts and 7 natural kind <b>superordinate</b> category <b>terms,</b> and 108 basic level category terms. (From each of superordinate category, 6 basic level categories were used.) Forty-four subjects listed attributes for each item. Listed attributes were classified into 8 categories; visual, audio, perceputual (non visual-audio), functionaluse, ability-state, source, part, and categorical attributes. The number of listed attributes of each attribute categories were compared by naturalness (artifacts or natural kinds) and by level of categories (basic level or superordinate level). The result mainly indicated that basic level categories elicit more visual and part attributes than superordinate categories, and natural kinds elicit more visual, perceptual, part and categorical attributes than artifacts...|$|R

40|$|A {{superordinate}} identity encompassing `us 2 ̆ 7 and `them 2 ̆ 7 {{under the}} umbrella of `we 2 ̆ 7 improves intergroup relations and bolsters support for the political system. But given humans 2 ̆ 7 innate preference for the familiar and their subconscious, cognitive biases against anything different, why would anyone identify with the superordinate group in the first place? I argue that personality is an important determinant of identification. Chapter 2 reviews existing literature on political-territorial identity alternatives, superordinate identification, and personality. It then justifies theoretical expectations regarding when and how the `Big Five 2 ̆ 7 personality traits should operate for one 2 ̆ 7 s sense of self. Chapter 3 underscores the importance of studying the determinants of superordinate identification by demonstrating its effect on outgroup attitudes. Using cross-national Eurobarometer data from all 27 European Union (EU) member states, I find those identifying as European are significantly more friendly towards immigrants [...] an effect that is amplified under conditions of cross-cutting cleavages and where country length of EU membership is greatest. Chapter 4 tests the basic relationship between personality and identification using original survey data from the United Kingdom, where EU integration has increased the salience and feasibility of the superordinate `European 2 ̆ 7 identity option in addition to a subordinate national one. As predicted, openness and extraversion increase identification with Europe while agreeableness decreases it. This suggests certain predispositions prompt some to be more open than others to seeing themselves in <b>superordinate</b> <b>terms.</b> Chapter 5 delves into deeper tests of personality 2 ̆ 7 s causal impact. I find that risk aversion, objective political knowledge, and ideology mediate much of personality 2 ̆ 7 s effect. No moderating effect emerges between the Big Five traits and the perceived influence of EU institutions, suggesting that the EU is capable of increasing superordinate identification equally across all personality types. Chapter 6 offers concluding remarks and extensions for future work. Altogether, my results speak to the general psychological processes underlying superordinate political-territorial identification. A major implication is that some individuals inherently experience cognitive difficulty extending their sense of self because particular traits [...] which develop early in life and persist relatively unchanged over time [...] may affect {{the extent to which a}} superordinate identity is perceived to conflict with preexisting attachments...|$|R
40|$|The <b>terms</b> <b>superordinate,</b> hyponym, and {{subordinate}} designate {{the hierarchical}} taxonomic relationship of words. They also represent categories and concepts. This relationship {{is a subject}} of interest for anthropology, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, linguistic semantics, and cognitive linguistics. Taxonomic hierarchies are essentially classificatory systems, and {{they are supposed to}} reflect the way that speakers of a language categorize the world of experience. A well-formed taxonomy offers an orderly and efficient set of categories at different levels of specificity (Cruse 2000 : 180). However, the terms and levels of taxonomic hierarchy used in each discipline vary. This makes it difficult to carry out cross-disciplinary readings on the hierarchical taxonomy of words or categories, which act as an interface in these cognitive-based cross-disciplinary ventures. Not only words— terms and concepts differ but often the nature of the problem is compounded as some terms refer to differing word classes, categories and concepts at the same time. Moreover, the lexical relationship of terms among these lexical hierarchies is far from clear. As a result two lines of thinking can be drawn from the literature: (1) technical terms coined for the hierarchical relationship of words are conflicting and do not reflect reality or environment, and (2) the relationship among these hierarchies of word levels and the underlying principles followed to explain them are uncertain except that of inclusion. 1...|$|R

In those countries where SOEs have dominated all or most sectors o f the formal economy, comprehensive privatisation programmes are regarded (particularly by the World Bank and the IMF) as being o f crucial importance for the future development o f a strong private sector which, in many respects, has become the <b>superordinate</b> medium-long <b>term</b> objective o f adjustment programmes everywhere in Africa. Privatisation is also justified {{on the grounds that}} SOEs are invariably inefficient and, without decisive interventions, {{will continue to be a}} massive drain on extremely limited public resources (see World Bank, 1995). The article is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the sources and types o f data that were included in the survey. Section 3 presents an overview o f the number, value, type, and ownership characteristics o f privatisations between 1980 and 1995 disaggregated by country and main economic sector. Sections 4 and 5 then discusses how the design and implementation o f privatisation programmes in SSA have been affected by a number o f key political and economic factors. Section 6 reviews the limited evidence that is available on the performance of privatised SOEs. Finally, section 7 considers the prospects for privatisation in SSA during the next five years. Data from five main sources were utilised for the survey, (i) The Candoy-Sekse and Sader data bases for the periods 1980 - 1987 and 1988 - 1992 respectively, (ii) Unpublished data from the World Bank that partially updates the Sader data base up to and including 1995. (iii) Reports and other documentation produced by government commissions, committees and units that have been specially established, often with technical assistance from the World Bank and other donors, to design and implement privatisation programmes in SSA. Basic information on all transactions was obtained from almost all countries that have had active privatisation programmes during the 1990 s, including Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. 4 (iv) Information provided by country desk officers for SSA, and staff o f the Private Sector Department at the World Bank; and (v) A variety o f other publications including the local and international business media.

40|$|Languages {{differ in}} how events are described, but {{little is known}} about how {{semantics}} interacts with online event processing. This study targets this question examining placement events in Swedish. Swedish has three obligatory placement verbs for events where objects have support from below: sätta ’set’, ställa ’stand’, and lägga ’lay’. Swedish lacks a <b>superordinate</b> general <b>term</b> like English put (Gullberg & Burenhult, 2011). For every placement event the verb choice depends on object properties, and the direction of the object’s extension from the ground. We use event-related potentials (ERPs) and appropriateness ratings of verb usage to investigate the interaction between verb semantics and event properties. Typically violations of semantic congruency positively affect the amplitude of the N 400 (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). Studies also report a centro-parietal positivity (P 600) when real-world knowledge is violated and verbs are incongruous to preceding contexts (Kuperberg, 2007, for a review). Previous ERP studies of visually presented images or movies of actions and events have reported an N 400 followed by a P 600 when the function of an object is violated (e. g., using a screwdriver as a key, Bach, et al., 2009; Balconi & Caldiroli, 2011). Method: Native speakers (N = 24, 18 - 35 years) watched still images of placement events followed by sentences visually presented word by word. Sentences described the depicted events while ERPs were recorded and time-locked to the placement verbs. Participants also did an appropriateness rating offline. Object properties (Base/Without base), symmetry (Sym/Asym), and orientation from the ground (Vertical/Horizontal) were varied and sentences with the three different placement verbs were combined with each image in a cross-subject design. Results: Base was important for appropriateness ratings of verb usage with symmetric objects while orientation was important for asymmetric objects. In contrast, there were no ERP effects to base (Base/Without) for symmetric objects. Asymmetric-base objects showed increased N 400 s and P 600 s with verbs incongruent with the depicted events (orientation, e. g., ‘lay’ with vertical glass). Asymmetric-Without base elicited an increased P 600 when verbs were incongruent to depicted events when horizontally oriented (e. g., ‘set’ with horizontal avocado), but an increased N 400 when verbs were incongruent to the atypical vertical placement of the objects (e. g., ‘lay’ with a vertical avocado). Discussion: Results showed an increased amplitude of both ERP effects (N 400 /P 600) when placement verbs were incongruent with typical placement scenarios of objects that in the real-world are placed vertically or horizontally (Asymmetric-Base, e. g., a candle; cf. Bach et al., 2009). However, for objects without a base the anterior negativity was increased with a mismatch between the verb and the presented images (the depicted events), while the P 600 increased for mismatches between the verb and typical real-world events. These results suggest the anterior N 400 and the P 600 indeed index different relationships with event processing as previously suggested for images (Sitnikova, et al., 2008). Our results agree with previous studies suggesting that the processing of verb meaning in language cannot be separated from knowledge of object handling in the real world (cf., Van Berkum, et al., 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PsychologyLester C. LoschkyWhile {{watching}} a film, the viewer begins to construct mental representations of it, which are called events. During {{the opening scene}} of a film, the viewer is presented with two distinct pieces of {{information that can be}} used to construct the event, namely the setting and an action by the main character. But, which of these two constructs are first cognitively represented by the viewer? Experiment 1 examined the time-course of basic level action categorization with superordinate and basic level scene categorization using masking. The results indicated that categorization occurred in a course-to-fine manner, inconsistent with Rosch et al. ’s (1976) basic level theory. Interestingly, basic level action categorization performance did not reach ceiling when it was processed for a 367 ms SOA, suggesting that additional scene information and processing time were required. Thus, Experiment 2 examined scene and action categorization performance over multiple fixations, and the scene information that was fixated for each categorization task. Both superordinate and basic level scene categorization required only a single fixation to reach ceiling performance, inconsistent with basic level primacy, whereas basic level action categorization took two to three fixations, and led to more object fixations than in either scene categorization task. Eye movements showed evidence of a person bias across all three categorization tasks. Additionally, the categorization task did produce differences in the scene information that was fixated (Yarbus, 1967). However, could basic level theory still be correct when subjects are given a different task? When the same scene images were named, basic level action terms were used more often than basic level scene category <b>terms,</b> while <b>superordinate</b> level action <b>terms</b> were used relatively less often, and superordinate level scene category terms were hardly ever used. This shows that linguistic categorization (naming) is sensitive to informative, middle-level categories, whereas early perceptual categorization makes use of coarse high level distinctions. Additionally, the early perceptual advantage for scene categorization over basic level action categorization suggests that the scene category is the first construct that is used to represent events in scene images, and maybe even events in visual narratives like film...|$|R
