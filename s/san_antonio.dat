5|$|SH151 {{begins at}} Loop1604, the outer loop around <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> {{on the west}} side of <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> and from there follows a southeastern path through the western part of the city. The highway {{provides}} access to the SeaWorld <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> theme park as well as industry along its corridor to include Chase, Hyatt Hill Country Resort, World Savings, Philips semiconductor, the National Security Agency campus, QVC, American Funds, Maxim Integrated Products, and the Northwest Vista College, as well as the nearby Southwest Research Institute.

Over 230Indians lived at the mission initially, but within two years they were forced to move to a less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio.
