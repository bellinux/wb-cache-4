25|$|This {{increased}} {{fee for the}} 2010 World Cup tournament broadcast rights {{resulted in}} the Singapore TV operators passing on the cost to their subscribers, which were then charged a <b>special</b> <b>fee</b> of S$94 (US$68) in addition to existing contracts, to watch the tournament's games. This high additional fee was the most expensive in the region, and angered Singapore football fans. Singapore was more expensive when compared to {{countries in the region}} that will either be broadcasting the matches free of charge, {{as in the case of}} Indonesia and Thailand; or at significantly lower viewing fees, at US$21 in Malaysia and US$38 in Hong Kong. This fee is also almost four times the S$25 (US$18) <b>special</b> <b>fee</b> that Starhub charged its subscribers for viewing the 2006 World Cup finals matches in Germany. As a result, many fans decided to protest against the increased fees with a mass boycott of the 2010 World Cup broadcast service by both operators.|$|E
