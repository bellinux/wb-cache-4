5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E

The melting of polar ice caps {{is a growing}} concern that can <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> decrease oceanic alkalinity. If the ice were to melt, then the overall volume of the ocean would increase. Because alkalinity is a concentration value (mol/L), increasing the volume would theoretically <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> decrease AT.

40|$|The {{current study}} is a {{discourse}} analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with a sample (N = 10) of transsexual-identified participants at various stages of transitioning. Gendered objects <b>served</b> <b>to</b> support cross-sex gender identities in talk about early childhood. Personal accounts of sexuality <b>served</b> <b>to</b> construct sample members as the sex that they identified with. In turn, gendered objects and sexuality both <b>served</b> <b>to</b> support the biological aetiology of transsexualism through positioning sex hormones as active objects in both accounts. Constructions of genital significance showed diversity. While some constructed genitals as possessing an essential meaning, others attempted to divest these traditional signifiers of masculinity and femininity of their shared cultural meanings, <b>serving</b> <b>to</b> de-reify gender essentialism...|$|R
