5|$|Lame duck {{incumbent}} president Bill Clinton was a Democrat, {{and the field}} for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States.

5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both <b>Steve</b> <b>Forbes</b> and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with <b>Steve</b> <b>Forbes</b> as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

500|$|The Economists Free Exchange blog {{argued that}} Cowen [...] "undersold" [...] recent {{innovations}} in digital technologies and that society {{was still in}} the process of re-organising itself around them. A growth spurt should be expected but this could take anything from years to decades, it warned. Furthermore, there are particularly large gains to be had in the area [...] "cognition-augmenting innovations (as opposed to labor-augmenting innovations)". Writing in <b>Forbes,</b> <b>Steve</b> Denning described Cowen's [...] "low-hanging fruit theory" [...] as [...] "folkloric nonsense". The world of 1953, when Denning was young, is inconceivable to a young person today, he wrote, adding that the qualification [...] "apart from the Internet" [...] is equivalent to saying [...] "apart from the wheel" [...] when discussing transport. The Financial Times reviewer recognized that Cowen, a prominent blogger, [...] "is no Luddite...he thinks life is more fun and interesting with the internet around". He argued that most economists do not look at consumer technology to find the internet's effect on productivity but rather organizations: super-efficient retailers such as Wal-mart and Tesco have already incorporated it into their logistics. Furthermore, the pace of change means it could be a generation at least before we see the full implementation. Timothy Noah seizes upon Cowen's [...] "concession" [...] that the internet could well increase scientific output by allowing better communication between scientists in remote places. Just as Davis and Wessel incorrectly predicted a coming boom in middle class incomes due to computers, Cowen [...] "seems equally wrong to suggest that computer technology is not on the verge of doing so." ...|$|R

2500|$|Flying an American flag {{upside down}} is not {{necessarily}} meant as political protest.
