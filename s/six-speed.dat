5|$|The {{fundamental}} underpinnings {{are based}} on the mainstream VE Commodore models of the same years. The car is powered by GM's 6.2-litre LS3 V8 engine, with a maximum power output of 442 PS (325kW). Buyers have the option of a <b>six-speed</b> manual transmission or <b>six-speed</b> automatic transmission; the manual is capable of reaching 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.5 seconds and the automatic is capable of 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.6 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{released}} the Mk II (BA II) Falcon in October 2004 to maintain sales interest until the 2005 {{introduction of the}} BF update. Modifications included some cosmetic changes and a new <b>six-speed</b> Tremec T56 manual transmission replacing the five-speed on XR6 Turbo and XR8 models.|$|E
5|$|Introduced a new <b>six-speed</b> {{automatic}} transmission and revised styling. The powerplant {{remained the same}} as before. Exterior changes included restyled front and rear fascias, light-emitting diode (LED) taillights, and different wheels.|$|E
5|$|The BT49 was {{initially}} fitted {{with the same}} gearbox the team had been using since 1977: a <b>six-speed</b> unit designed by Brabham using internal components from Hewland and a casing cast by Alfa Romeo.|$|E
5|$|The GT, GT-P and Pursuit {{received}} a new stripe package with bonnet decals, a <b>six-speed</b> Tremec T56 manual and the GT-P received 19-inch five-spoke alloy wheels. FPV also released the Super Pursuit, {{which was a}} Pursuit ute with GT-P extras.|$|E
5|$|Building on the Omega, the SV6 is {{equipped}} with the more powerful High Output variant of the Alloytec V6 engine, coupled to a <b>six-speed</b> manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the launch Omega, came standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black centre console and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|In Indonesia, the Camry {{is offered}} with two engines, the four-cylinder mated to a {{five-speed}} automatic transmission. This engine is offered in G and V trims. The other engine is the V6 engine mated to a <b>six-speed</b> automatic transmission. This engine is only {{offered in the}} top-of-the-line Q trim. The Camry has enjoyed success in Indonesia, being the best selling car in its class. The 2.4 V and 3.5 Q models have been used extensively by the Indonesian government, owning thousands of Camrys in their fleet.|$|E
5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a <b>six-speed</b> gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and <b>six-speed</b> automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or <b>six-speed</b> manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E
5|$|Further {{complicating the}} sales {{situation}} was the announcement by JaguarSport of a road-going {{version of the}} Jaguar XJR-9, {{the last of the}} racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine. The Jaguar XJR-15 was developed by TWR and styled by Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar, and featured the V12 engine {{and a host of other}} technologies not adopted for the XJ220, including carbon fibre construction and the option of a <b>six-speed</b> racing gearbox. It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale; only 50 were built, each with a list price of £600,000 ($1 million) in 1990. It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road-legal vehicle. About half were built as road-going variants, which added £55,000 to the list price.|$|E
25|$|The base L only {{offers a}} <b>six-speed</b> manual transmission, while the Premier, {{on the other}} end of the spectrum, offers only a <b>six-speed</b> {{automatic}} transmission. The LS and LT trim levels offer either a <b>six-speed</b> manual transmission, or a <b>six-speed</b> automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|The V8 Vantage retailed for £79,000, US$110,000, or €104,000 in 2006, Aston Martin {{planned to}} build up to 3,000 per year. Included was a <b>six-speed</b> manual {{transmission}} and leather-upholstery for the seats, dash, steering-wheel, and shift-knob. A <b>six-speed</b> sequential manual transmission, similar to those produced by Ferrari and Lamborghini, called Sportshift was introduced later as an option.|$|E
25|$|The gearbox {{built by}} Aisin is a <b>six-speed</b> {{automated}} sequential gearbox (electrohydraulic transmission) operated with paddle-shifters.|$|E
25|$|Routing {{the power}} are 3.73 gears and new half shafts, both from Ford Performance. Making the smoke are Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires wrapped around {{staggered}} 20-inch WELD Racing Super Snake wheels. Also, {{for the first}} time, the Super Snake will be available with either a <b>six-speed</b> manual or <b>six-speed</b> automatic transmission. Under hood options include an upgraded intercooler and cooling kits for the differential and transmission.|$|E

All three engines are coupled to a five-speed manual or optional <b>six-speed</b> automatic transmission featuring Active Select. When the Cruze launched in the United States in 2010, a new 1.4-liter Family 0 turbocharged gasoline engine was introduced. North American models fitted with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine have also been upgraded to a standard <b>six-speed</b> manual.|$|E
25|$|A new {{diesel-powered}} Cruze will {{be available}} in 2017. It will have the 1.6L turbodiesel also found in the 2018 Equinox, paired to either a nine-speed automatic or <b>six-speed</b> manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited edition}} model {{was created in}} 1996, called the NISMO 400R, that {{produced}} 400hp (298kW) from a road-tuned version of Nissan's Le Mans engine. A stronger <b>six-speed</b> Getrag gearbox was used.|$|E

25|$|Powertrain {{options for}} the Camry XV40 {{comprised}} both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and automatic transmissions. The entry-level engine was a 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE four-cylinder in front-wheel drive configuration available with manual and automatic transmissions, both five-speed units. For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted.
