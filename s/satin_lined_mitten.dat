She dyed her red hair black, and painted her face. Then she put on a gorgeous robe of lilac <b>satin</b> <b>lined</b> with blue, and a yellow petticoat trimmed with violet ribbons, and because she had heard that queens always rode into their new dominions, she ordered a horse to be made ready for her to ride.|$|R
5000|$|Fighter pilots, {{who often}} had heated cockpits, could wear the A-2 into combat more easily.

Some jackets (famously, those from the China Burma India Theater, and of the Flying Tigers) had a [...] "Blood chit" [...] sewn on the lining or outer back, printed on cloth, which promised certain rewards to civilians who aided a downed airman. In certain ETO units and possibly elsewhere a prerogative of the fighter ace was a red <b>satin</b> <b>lining</b> which was added on confirmation of his fifth aerial kill.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{wanting to}} be an Old Regime monarch, Napoleon explained: [...] "To be a king is to inherit old ideas and genealogy. I don't want to descend from anyone."

The number of onlookers, as estimated by Wairy, was between four and five thousand, many of whom had held their places all night, through intermittent showers that cleared in the morning.|$|R
5000|$|In a few years, Thimister had {{designed}} an entire mélange of haute couture and luxury prêt-a-porter pieces. In January 2010, after being invited by the Fédération française de la couture, his return show {{was met with}} resounding success and received much praise from {{the press and the}} industry. The collection, termed [...] "1915: Bloodshed and Opulence" [...] an anti-war collection, was a medley of recycled military jackets and canvas tents, and elegant couture finishing of silk, crepe and <b>satin</b> <b>lining.</b> [...] "I’m convinced that all of today’s problems are the conclusion of that period", claimed Thimister in an interview with Style.com, [...] "I am recycling some of my favorite fabrics, like imperial satin and wool blends".

50|$|The deerstalker is {{most often}} made of cloth, often a light or heavy wool tweed, {{although}} deerstalkers made of suede, white cotton duck and even denim are not unknown. The cap is made of six (or eight) triangular panels with rounded sides which are sewn together. If {{the sides of the}} panels are cut in a way giving them slightly rounded shoulders midway, the crown will become more squared and flatter rather than hemispherical. The cap may be deep or shallow, barely touching the tops of the ears, according to the whim of the hatter. Either way it is usually lined with an inner cap of satin, polished cotton or similar lining fabrics. Occasionally one can find a deerstalker with a lightly quilted <b>satin</b> <b>lining.</b> The deerstalker's main features are a pair of bills or visors worn in front and rear. These are usually stiffened with pasteboard, cardboard or layers of heavy canvas.|$|R
5000|$|The cloak {{was entirely}} hand made, and sewn {{with a long}} needle. Four yards of heavy black cloth (melton) went into the making and the {{trimmings}} included <b>satin</b> for <b>lining,</b> jet and beaded braid. Fastened by a single hook and eye near the neck, {{the folds of the}} garment were relieved by a pair of mock pockets faced with jet, which covered the hand slits.|$|R

40|$|Yellow flowered coat in Persian {{style with}} orange <b>satin</b> <b>lining.</b> Detail of fabric inset below. Lene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, {{daughter}} of the painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s she became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo. She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. Due {{to the rise of}} the Nazis she settled in Mallorca in 1932, and later Ibiza. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. She continued to exhibit successfully around the world, and in 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory. Digital imag...|$|R
50|$|After the funeral, Paul drinks {{heavily and}} behaves aggressively with Eliot, {{who seems to}} taunt him and {{encourage}} him to see for himself that Anna is really dead, telling him {{there is not much}} time. Meanwhile Anna is shown awakening to the sound of earth being shoveled onto her coffin. She cries out and desperately scratches the <b>satin</b> <b>lining</b> of her coffin lid. Driving under the influence of alcohol, Paul rushes to the cemetery. They are shown embracing and Anna tells Paul she has always loved him. Paul asks what the odd sound is that he hears, and Anna explains it is the sound of Eliot's gloves and scissors on the table as he prepares Paul's body. A moment later, he finds himself in the funeral parlour with Eliot standing over him preparing his body as he did Anna's. Eliot tells him that he never made it to the cemetery due to a car accident which killed him. Paul protests that he is alive until the moment Eliot inserts a trocar deep into his torso.|$|R

60|$|As I {{stood beside}} them, too much vexed at the childish part I {{was made to}} play to derive much {{information}} from the valuable arguments of Mr. Crossbite, I observed a rather elderly man, who stood with his eyes firmly bent on my father, as if he only waited an end of the business {{in which he was}} engaged, to address him. There was something, I thought, in the gentleman's appearance which commanded attention. Yet his dress was not in the present taste, and though it had once been magnificent, was now antiquated and unfashionable. His coat was of branched velvet, with a <b>satin</b> <b>lining,</b> a waistcoat of violet-coloured silk, much embroidered; his breeches the same stuff as the coat. He wore square-toed shoes, with foretops, as they are called; and his silk stockings were rolled up over his knee, as you may have seen in pictures, and here and there on some of those originals who seem to pique themselves on dressing after the mode of Methuselah. A CHAPEAU BRAS and sword necessarily completed his equipment, which, though out of date, showed that it belonged to a man of distinction.|$|R
