C 14 -labeled compounds were administered to wheat shoots and their incorporation into lignin and into hydroxycinnamic acids was measured. Labeled CO 2, phenylalanine or tyrosine were incorporated more readily into the insoluble derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids than into ethanol-soluble derivatives whereas the reverse was true for labeled precursors such as cinnamic and the hydroxycinnamic acids. Time-course studies with 14 CO 2 suggested the sequence: CO 2 -> aromatic amino acids -> ethanol-insoluble derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids -> lignin.

The cytokinome evaluation before and after treatment revealed that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α decreased after the treatment, suggesting a potential anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effect of this extract. Moreover, the metabolome evaluation by 1 H-NMR evidenced that the polyphenols extracted from chestnut shell (PECS) treatment affected the levels of some amino acids and other metabolites.

Bordô (Ives). Total sugar content, pH, and total acidity were analyzed in red wine samples from 2007 and 2008 vintages following official methods of analysis. Moreover, total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin contents were analyzed by colorimetric methodologies and the antioxidant activity was determined using the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical methodology. Phenolic compounds were identified by high performance liquid chromatography. The total phenolic content of wine samples presented concentrations varying between 1582. 35 and 2896. 08 mg gallic acid.

40|$|Laboratory and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate the phytotoxic effect of black mustard extracts and root exudates on two crops: Trifolium alexandrinum and Triticum aestivum, and two weeds: Phalaris paradoxa and Sisymbrium irio. The seeds were treated with aqueous and ethanolic extracts and chloroform for eight days, or subjected to root exudates of just harvested mustard in a greenhouse for five weeks. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify phytotoxins from plant tissues. Seed germination of P. paradoxa was reduced with the lowest concentration of the different extracts. However, the aqueous extract at 4 % completely curtailed the germination of all the target species. In general, plant extracts had a concentration-dependent reduction of seedling growth of the target species. However, the ethanolic extract, at the lowest concentration, has stimulated the shoot length of both T. alexandrinum and T. aestivum, and the root length of the former. Mustard root exudates inhibited emergence and growth of the target species throughout the experiment.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of phenolic acids on cell membrane permeability of lactic acid bacteria from wine. Several phenolic acids were tested for their effects on the cell membrane of Oenococcus oeni and Lactobacillus hilgardii by measuring potassium and phosphate efflux, proton influx and by assessing culture viability employing a fluorescence technique based on membrane integrity. The experimental results indicate that hydroxycinnamic acids (p-coumaric, caffeic and ferulic acids) induce greater ion leakages and higher proton influx than hydroxybenzoic acids (p-hydroxibenzoic, protocatechuic, gallic, vanillic, and <b>syringic</b> <b>acids).</b> Among the hydroxycinnamic acids, p-coumaric acid showed the strongest effect. Moreover, the exposure of cells to phenolic acids caused a significant decrease in cell culture viability, as measured by the fluorescence assay, in both tested strains. The results agree with previous results obtained in growth experiments with the same strains. Generally, phenolic acids increased the cell membrane permeability in lactic acid bacteria from wine.

The chromatographic data were interpreted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA model with three principal components (PC 1 -PC 2 -PC 3) fitted well with 12 examined plant samples, allowing their division into groups according to their origin.
