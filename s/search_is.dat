5|$|Linear <b>search</b> <b>is</b> {{a simple}} search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search {{can be done}} on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary <b>search</b> <b>is</b> faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
5|$|Now Am = T, the <b>search</b> <b>is</b> done; return m.|$|E
50|$|<b>Searching</b> <b>was</b> a racehorse. <b>Searching</b> <b>was</b> {{inducted}} into the Hall of Fame in 1978, five years after her death.|$|R
50|$|Certain limited <b>searches</b> <b>are</b> {{also allowed}} during an investigatory stop or {{incident}} to an arrest. These <b>searches</b> <b>are</b> called refined <b>searches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because these <b>searches</b> <b>are</b> highly {{invasive}} {{and greatly}} compromise an individual’s right of privacy, {{the legality of}} visual and manual body cavity <b>searches</b> <b>is</b> frequently contested.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} to turn up in a Google <b>search</b> <b>is</b> a 2007 article in the British newspaper The Guardian.|$|E
5|$|For {{implementing}} associative arrays, hash tables, a {{data structure}} that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, {{as the only}} information given on a failed <b>search</b> <b>is</b> that the target is not present in any record. Binary <b>search</b> <b>is</b> ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{interpolation}} <b>search</b> <b>is</b> {{slower than}} binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Although its time complexity grows {{more slowly than}} binary search, this only compensates for the extra computation for large arrays.|$|E
40|$|The {{result of}} two {{searches}} for infrared counterparts of Gamma-ray Bursters (GRB's) is reported. The first <b>search</b> <b>was</b> made {{using data from}} the Infrared Astronomy Satellite and covered 23 positions. The second <b>search</b> <b>was</b> made with the Kitt Peak 1. 5 m telescope and covered 3 positions. In neither of these two <b>searches</b> <b>was</b> any infrared candidate detected...|$|R
30|$|Two <b>search</b> {{strategies}} <b>were</b> employed, {{inspired by}} the traversing order of breadth-first and depth-first search strategies, respectively. Breadth-first <b>search</b> <b>was</b> performed within a set of predefined published conference proceedings and journals in a specified time period, but only the first level of the <b>search</b> tree <b>was</b> considered for reviewing. Depth-first <b>search</b> <b>was</b> performed by using a search engine to find papers given a set of keywords. A subsequent <b>search</b> <b>was</b> then performed by using the references of those papers as a starting point. This process was repeated until a maximum depth of 3 was reached.|$|R
50|$|Warrantless <b>searches</b> <b>are</b> <b>searches</b> and {{seizures}} conducted without search warrants.|$|R
5|$|The key {{difference}} between QA technology and document <b>search</b> <b>is</b> that document search takes a keyword query and returns {{a list of}} documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.|$|E
5|$|To find {{a maximum}} clique, one can {{systematically}} inspect all subsets, but {{this sort of}} brute-force <b>search</b> <b>is</b> too time-consuming to be practical for networks comprising {{more than a few}} dozen vertices.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{are thrilled}} {{to hear that}} a film version of their {{favorite}} comic book series, Radioactive Man, is in production. Rainier Wolfcastle, {{the star of the}} McBain films, is chosen to play Radioactive Man, and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children, the production moves to their town. A <b>search</b> <b>is</b> launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected for being an inch too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.|$|E

5000|$|The Google President, Eric Schmidt, {{stated that}} Google Images <b>search</b> <b>was</b> created {{because of the}} desire to view Jennifer Lopez in her exotic green Versace dress. In 2000, Google <b>Search</b> results <b>were</b> limited to simple pages of text with links, but the {{developers}} worked on developing this further, realising that an image <b>search</b> <b>was</b> required to answer [...] "the most popular search query" [...] they had seen to date: Jennifer Lopez's green dress. As a result of this, Google Image <b>Search</b> <b>was</b> born.|$|R
25|$|<b>Search</b> folders, which <b>are</b> saved <b>searches,</b> have <b>been</b> updated {{to include}} RSS feeds as well. <b>Search</b> folders can <b>be</b> created with a {{specific}} search criteria, specifying the subject, type and other attributes of the information being searched. When a <b>search</b> folder <b>is</b> opened, all matching items for the <b>search</b> <b>are</b> automatically retrieved and grouped up.|$|R
5|$|Fibonacci <b>search</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval {{in which the}} maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their <b>search</b> <b>is</b> guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the <b>search</b> <b>is</b> split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
30|$|Then, the {{databases}} for the <b>search</b> <b>were</b> defined. Papers <b>were</b> <b>searched</b> automatically {{in three}} databases: ACM, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct. Also, papers <b>were</b> <b>searched</b> {{in the main}} Brazilian Conference related to Informatics in Education, the Brazilian Symposium on Informatics in Education, SBIE. This <b>search</b> <b>was</b> performed manually in the Google Scholar platform using our search string.|$|R
50|$|A massive <b>search</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} to find McNaughton {{as thousands of}} volunteers led by the armed forces searched the area where Adrien had gone missing. While extensive <b>searching</b> <b>was</b> conducted, no clues to his whereabouts was found.|$|R
30|$|In June 2015, a PubMed <b>search</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} by TW {{looking for all}} available articles; no limitation on the publication date <b>was</b> imposed. The <b>search</b> <b>was</b> modified by CW, BA, ES and KAG so that 24 more articles were identified.|$|R
5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary <b>search</b> <b>is</b> expected {{to be carried out}} using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so the <b>search</b> <b>is</b> narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that someone close to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) {{but they are not}} the culprits. They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a conversation about her father.|$|E
