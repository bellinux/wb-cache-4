[...] After that he was engaged for a 10-week stint on NBC’s The <b>Standard</b> <b>Hour.</b> [...] It was during these {{programs}} that Gorin met the composer Albert Hay Malotte. [...] As a result, Gorin was the first to perform Malotte’s famous setting of “The Lord’s Prayer”. [...] It was to become Gorin’s most popular number on radio, on television and in concerts.

2500|$|In 1915, Alfred Hertz succeeded Hadley. [...] Hertz {{helped to}} refine the {{orchestra}} and arranged for the Victor Talking Machine Company to record it at their new studio in Oakland in early 1925. [...] Hertz also led the orchestra during a number of radio broadcasts, including on The <b>Standard</b> <b>Hour,</b> a weekly concert series sponsored by Standard Oil of California. The series began in 1926 when the orchestra faced bankruptcy; Standard Oil of California paid the orchestra's debts and in return was given broadcast rights to that year's concert series. The first broadcast aired on the NBC Pacific Network, on October 24, 1926. and the broadcasts continued for more than 30 years.|$|E

[...] Monteux's first released album with the orchestra was of the Symphony in D Minor by César Franck (the first recorded was Maurice Ravel's La Valse); his last was of Siegfried Idyll by Richard Wagner and Death and Transfiguration by Richard Strauss. [...] Some of the recordings have been re-released on LPs and compact discs, as well as internationally via the Pierre Monteux Edition from RCA. A substantial selection of Monteux's live broadcasts on The <b>Standard</b> <b>Hour</b> have been released by the Music & Arts label.|$|E
40|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>hours,</b> a major {{component}} of total work hours, vary considerably across Europe. Many countries lowered their <b>standard</b> work <b>hours</b> during the 1980 s and 1990 s, attempting to boost employment by splitting up a fixed number of worker-hours among more workers. Germany has seen a partial reversal of the trend as several companies increased their <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> to reduce their labor costs in the early 2000 s. The employment effect of increased <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> depends on the time horizon examined, how wages respond, whether employees collected overtime pay before the change, and the productivity of hours worked, among other factors...|$|R

Whilst this might directly lead to a substitution of workers by hours, {{there may also be}} a positive employment effect due to reduced costs.

For a panel of German plants (2001 - 2006), we analyse the effect of increased <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> on employment. Using difference-in-difference methods we find that, consistent with theory, overtime plants showed a significant positive employment response, whilst for standard-time plants there is no difference at all between plants which increased <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> and those which did not...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{international}} trade, {{investment and}} migration affect establishment-level <b>standard</b> weekly <b>hours</b> in Europe. These aspects of globalization have offsetting implications {{that make it}} unclear whether they spur, reduce or have little effect on <b>standard</b> <b>hours.</b> To explore these possibilities, the paper analyses a survey of establishments in 18 European countries. The analysis reveals significant diversity in how different ‘facets' of globalization affect weekly hours. Establishments in sectors facing more international trade and investment have neither shorter nor longer work weeks. But those in net import-competing sectors and having more foreign-born employees tend to have higher <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> than other enterprises. Finally, collective bargaining over hours may mediate the effects of globalization, particularly trade: establishments without collective-bargaining agreements increase <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> in response to trade, while those establishments with such agreements {{are less likely to}} respond in this way...|$|R

40|$|Pro-labor {{groups in}} Hong Kong have been campaigning for a <b>standard</b> working <b>hours</b> law in Hong Kong.

Labor representatives even walked away from the Labour Advisory Board because they said neither the government nor the employer representatives had shown willingness to contemplate legislating <b>standard</b> working <b>hours</b> across the board. I am disappointed that labor groups appear to be more interested in money than in health issues and that they are reluctant to contemplate anything other than what they put on the table. It is true Hong Kong’s working hours are rather long, and that long working hours can harm people’s health and family life. But <b>standard</b> working <b>hours</b> legislation, without a ceiling on the hours worked, will not help. Health and family life may still give way to earnings. This will defeat the purpose of the legislation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> on the {{hourly wage rate}} is {{important}} in assessing whether work-sharing {{is likely to be}} a successful policy. Furthermore, it determines whether unions have achieved their goal of keeping the monthly income of employees constant after a cut in <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> (income compensation) or whether employees experience reductions in monthly income (income sharing). However, the <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> elasticity of the hourly wage rate has rarely been estimated. This study reports evidence for Germany, 1995 - 99, using the IAB Establishment Panel. The results imply income compensation for plants with a bargaining agreement, but income sharing for plants without a bargaining agreement. No evidence is found for the Calmfors and Driffill hypothesis that postulates that wage demands are more moderate if unions operate at the firm level than if bargaining takes place at the industry level.

40|$|Starting in 1985, (West) German unions {{began to}} reduce <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> on an {{industry}} by industry basis, {{in an attempt}} to lower unemployment. Whether work-sharing works - whether employment rises when hours per worker are reduced - is theoretically ambiguous. I test this using both individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and industry data to exploit the cross-section and time-series hours variation. For the 1984 - 1989 period I find that, in response to a one <b>hour</b> fall in <b>standard</b> <b>hours,</b> employment rose by 0. 3 - 0. 7 %, but that total hours worked fell 2 - 3 %, implying possible output losses. As a group workers were better off, however, as the wage bill rose. The employment growth implied by the mean <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> decline, at most 1. 1 %, was not enough to bring German employment growth close to the U. S. rate. Results for the 1990 - 94 period were more pessimistic. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{transformation}} {{of what had}} become a universal 40 <b>hour</b> <b>standard</b> work week in Germany began in 1985 with reductions negotiated in the metal-working and printing sectors. These reductions have continued through 1995, and were followed by reductions in other sectors. The union campaign aimed to increase employment through work-sharing, and is being emulated in the United States with the launch of a reduced hours campaign by the AFL-CIO. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I find that increased overtime or reduced short time was little used to offset the reduction in standard hours: a one <b>hour</b> reduction in <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> appears to have translated into a reduction in actual hours worked of between 0. 85 and 1 hour for workers in manufacturing. One might expect this to {{have resulted in a}} loss of earnings for workers in affected industries. However, I substantiate the union claim of full wage compensation : reductions in <b>standard</b> <b>hours</b> were accompanied by a relative rise in the hourly straight-time wage of 2 - 3 % for each <b>hour</b> fall in <b>standard</b> <b>hours,</b> enough to keep monthly earnings the same as in unaffected industries. ...|$|R
