40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects and kink-wave propagation in <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> Compared to the two dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> the proposed model regards <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The dynamical characteristics of the <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} presents {{research work}} on the bond behaviour of in concrete embedded one-layered round strand ropes 6 x 19 Standard. The essay reports about experimental tests and theoretical modeling of the embedded <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The investigation on the bond of embedded <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is based on already available knowledge about pure <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and the bond behaviour of conventional types of reinforcement. The affinity of bond behaviour of reinforcing steel bar and prestressing strands are used {{to develop a new}} material model. Experimental tests are the base of modeling. Global bond behaviour was analysed by RILEM-pull-out tests. The tests studied the influence of concrete strength, rope geometry and bond length. Thereby the usual setup was modified to account for the special properties of the ropes. Another testing series showed the material behaviour of the cement paste penetrated <b>wire</b> <b>rope.</b> It‚Äòs possible to describe the strain behaviour of the rope along its embedded length based on these tests. The developed bond model describes bond behaviour {{as a function of the}} bond stress-slip relation. This function depends on concrete strength and the rope geometry. The nonlinear material behaviour of the ‚Äúconcrete <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> ‚Äù is formulated by its tangent modulus of elasticity. Furthermore a specified secant modulus of the ‚Äúconcrete wire rope‚Äú can be used in case of low stresses. Calculation and analysing of bond behaviour along a defined embedding length by adapted differential equations are possible. The analysing by FEM is getting feasible as well. ...|$|R
