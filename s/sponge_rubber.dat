Nevertheless, they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce thermodynamic efficiency.

A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{increase}} the glue {{will give a}} rubber {{is dependent on the}} <b>sponge.</b> Softer <b>sponged</b> <b>rubber,</b> e.g. Yasaka's MarkV 30, Butterfly's Bryce FX, Joola's Samba, will absorb the glue more readily and therefore have a bigger dome when they expand, leading to a greater effect, with harder sponges e.g. Most Chinese rubbers, Butterfly's Bryce Hard, expanding less leading to a slightly lesser effect.|$|R
50|$|Speed glue {{needs to}} be reapplied several times to have an optimal effect. The nature of speed glue is very unpredictable, so several coats are {{needed to make the}} bounce of the paddle more predictable. When {{professionals}} are seen applying speed glue to their paddles before a tournament, they have applied speed glue to it several times before that time. Softer <b>sponge</b> <b>rubbers</b> will gain a larger performance boost from speed glue than harder rubbers. The use of speed glue will, over time, degrade the quality of the rubber so persistent use will mean the rubbers will need to be replaced sooner.|$|R

25|$|Another study {{concluded}} that fouling degrades performance over time, and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer, over time a tougher layer formed {{that could not be}} removed through simple brushing. The study passed <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls through the system. It concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity. The microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment (i.e. brushing became necessary more often) replicating the results of a previous study. The increased growth rate after subsequent cleanings appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony.|$|E
25|$|Schneider sold four C15S {{and eight}} C17S howitzers to Finland during the 1920s, known in Finland as the 152 H/15 and 155 H/17. These were rebarreled in Finland's {{standard}} 152mm although they retained their original breeches, {{which meant that}} the H/15 used Russian-style cartridge cases and the H/17 used bagged powder. The H/15 had steel-rimmed wooden wheels that were suitable only for horse-traction, but these were later replaced by wheels with <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> tires more suitable for motor traction. They were used for training during peacetime. During the Winter War the H/15s served with the 3rd Separate Heavy Artillery Battery while the H/17s were assigned to Heavy Artillery Battalion 3. During the Continuation War they saw combat with Heavy Artillery Battalions 24 and 25 as well as Field Artillery Regiment 3. They were retired {{after the end of}} World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was a {{relative}} modern design {{compared to other}} Japanese Second World war designs, being relatively light and easy to handle. As with many Japanese designs, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a kneeling or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. The carriage appears to have adopted a number of design features from the Soviet ZIK 45 mm anti-tank gun, a number of examples of which were captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939. It used a semi-automatic breech block with a horizontal sliding wedge. When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected, and upon loading a fresh shell, the breech block closed automatically. A hydrospring recoil mechanism was housed under the barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel disc wheels fitted with <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> filled tires.|$|E

[...] "Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made". King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter.

He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber.</b> Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well.

50|$|In {{the on-line}} process, the {{cleaning}} body {{moves through the}} tubes with the conveying medium and cleans them by means of its oversize compared to the tube diameter. In the range of diameters of up to 50 mm these cleaning bodies consist of <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber,</b> in larger diameters up {{to the size of}} oil pipelines {{it is a matter of}} scrapers or so-called pigs. <b>Sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls are applied mainly for cooling water, like sea, river, or cooling tower water. For the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, specially adapted cleaning bodies are imaginable but the conveying media flows are so weak that off-line processes are employed in most cases. Given the fact that the cleaning bodies are not allowed to remain in the conveying medium they have to be collected after passing through the tubes. In the case of <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls this is done through special strainer sections; for scrapers or pigs an outward transfer station is provided. According to the Taprogge process, the <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls are re-injected upstream of the system to be cleaned by a corresponding ball recirculating unit whereas the scraper or pig is mostly taken out by hand and re-injected into another collector. <b>Sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls therefore safeguard a continuous cleaning while the scraper or pig system is discontinuous.|$|E

Hardbat rackets use short outward [...] "pips" [...] with no sponge, resulting in decreased speeds and reduced spin compared to rackets using <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber.</b> This results in slower shots, and a more strategic game rather than the fast paced, heavy topspin attacking style that dominates regular table tennis.|$|E

40|$|Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF) {{is popular}} sensing material {{because of its}} unique piezoelectric characteristics. In this work an impact sensor was prepared from a sandwiched structure PVDF film, and the related detection circuits were presented. The dependence of the PVDF sensors’ response on the elasticity of the supporting materials was examined and discussed. Here two response indexes were discussed, which were the peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) and the recovery time. Firstly, falling impact experiments were executed on desk-supported PVDF sensors (100 mm PVDF film) using free falls of different weights from different heights. Then the same shock experiments were repeated on the same sensor, but changing the backstops to a <b>sponge</b> and <b>rubber,</b> respectively. On the desk, the values of Vpp were bigger than when the other two backstops were used; but the changes of the impact energy could not be reflected by the PVDF sensor when it {{was supported by a}} hard material. It was found that the biggest sensitivity of the voltage response (about 96. 62 V/J) was obtained by the sponge-supported sensor; for the same sensor, when it was supported by rubber, the slope was 82. 26 V/J. Moreover, the recovery time for the desk-supported sensor was almost constant, varying from 0. 15 to 0. 18 s, while for the same sensor supported by <b>sponge</b> or <b>rubber,</b> its recovery time changed with the shifting of the impact energy in the range of 0. 02 ~ 0. 36 s, but no pattern could be found in the recovery-time characteristics...|$|R

50|$|The BA-3 is {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the BA-6; the BA-3 retained door {{in the rear of the}} hull that was not present in the BA-6. More important improvement of BA-6 were the new GK tires, filled with <b>sponge</b> (porous <b>rubber),</b> and thus much less vulnerable to small-caliber fire. On the downside, the tires reduced both the speed and range of the vehicle, despite it had a somewhat thinned armor. BA-3/6 cars were superseded by BA-10 model. All cars of this series were very heavily armed for the era; they could knock out other vehicles with ease, including tanks. However, their thin armor made them vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and small caliber cannon fire.|$|R

The research aims to develop a face surrogate made of sandwich of rigid foam and rubber sheets to represent human facial bone under blunt impact. The facial surrogate will serve as an important test device for further development of facial-impact protection for cyclist.
