500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{explained}} that the cast listing for the episode, along with [...] "Patient X" [...] was [...] "longer than most cast lists you'll ever see on a TV series". In order {{to allow for the}} increased expenses of hiring additional actors, Carter and the producers of the series talked Fox into allowing the episodes to be slightly more expensive because they would lead into the soon-to-be-released X-Files movie. Carter explained, [...] "we convinced them to spend the extra money to do this extra special work because it was all leading up to [...] when the X-Files movie would be released." [...] In addition, the child he gave the message to was a young boy and the son of production manager J.P. Finn. Rob Bowman originally intended to direct the episode but, due to reshoots, he was unable to do it, resulting in Carter directing. Bowman later recounted, [...] "I was supposed to direct 'The Red and the Black' [...] but we were prepping for the reshoots [...] so I couldn't do it. [...] Chris had to direct this episode. He was <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> me." [...] When filming the scene where Mulder and Scully go to a medic station, Carter made homage to the medical drama ER, filming it entirely with a Steadicam.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas quickly had {{to adjust}} to Knight's disciplinarian style. At the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico Knight got <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> Thomas he {{threatened}} {{to put him on}} a plane home. Knight recalled yelling at the freshman-to-be, [...] "You ought to go to DePaul, Isiah, because you sure as hell aren't going to be an Indiana player playing like that." [...] Prior to the start of his freshman year, the 1979–80 season, Knight became so upset with Thomas that he kicked him out of a practice. According to Thomas, Knight was making a point that no player, no [...] "matter how talented, is bigger than Knight's philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noriko calmly accepts this {{sexual content}} when couched in the [...] "archaic" [...] form of Noh drama, {{but when she}} sees her father nod politely to the {{attractive}} widow, Mrs. Miwa, who {{is also in the}} audience, [...] "that strikes Noriko as outrageous and outraging. Had this woman and her father arranged to meet at this play about sexuality? Is this remarriage 'filthy' like [...] remarriage? She feels both angry and despairing. She is <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> her father that, quite uncharacteristically, she angrily walks away from him after they leave the theater." [...] Holland thus sees one of the film's main themes as [...] "the pushing of traditional and inhibited Noriko into marriage." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Ty Cobb {{took over}} from Hughie Jennings {{as manager of}} the Tigers. Bush became {{involved}} in repeated arguments with Cobb's [...] "first lieutenant", Dan Howley. The Detroit Free Press wrote that Howley [...] "never is quite so contented" [...] as he is when arguing with Bush and added: [...] "Bush would fight {{at the drop of}} a hat for Dan, yet the midget never gets nearly <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> anyone as he does when Howley, with deliberate intent, corners Donie somewhere and starts a debate[...] [...] [...] Often Donie becomes so enraged that he pulls his cap off his head and throwing it off the door of the hotel lobby or in the turf of the ball field, stamps on it in his hysteria." [...] For the first half of the season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.|$|E
2500|$|The Redskins {{played in}} the NFL Championship one more time before a quarter-century drought that did not end until the 1972 season. With former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Dudley DeGroot as their new head coach, the Redskins went 8–2 during the 1945 season. One {{of the most impressive}} performances came from Sammy Baugh, who had a completion percentage of [...]703. They ended the season by losing to the Cleveland Rams in the 1945 NFL Championship Game on December 16, 1945, 15–14. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a safety that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the end zone, quarterback Sammy Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post (which at the time was on the goal line instead of {{at the back of the}} end zone) and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2–0 lead. It was that safety that proved to be the margin of victory. Owner Marshall was <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> the outcome that he became a major force in passing the following major rule change after the season: A forward pass that strikes the goal posts is automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the [...] "Baugh/Marshall Rule".|$|E

2500|$|Antwon Tanner portrays Antwon [...] "Skills" [...] Taylor, one of Lucas' oldest {{friends and}} another of those who played at the Rivercourt as children. Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told that once we got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so I thought maybe that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, <b>so</b> I ain't <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> it.

We didn't know anything. Then {{all of a sudden it}} was out in the open and {{everyone}} was talking about it, but when he first told me about it I didn't understand. I didn't know. And then all of a sudden my friend was ill and ill and ill and then...It was so hard. I was so angry and every night I would sing my guts out, but you'd open your eyes after and it was the same. But sometimes, in a lot of ways, it was healing." ...|$|R
2500|$|Billingsley, however, {{questioned}} her character's {{reactions to the}} Cleaver children's misbehavior, basing her concern on personal experience {{as the mother of}} two sons. As the co-producer Joseph Connelly explained, [...] "In scenes where she's <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> the boys, she's always coming over to us with the script and objecting. 'I don't see why June is <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> over what Beaver's done. I certainly wouldn't be.' As a result, many of Beaver's crimes have been rewritten into something really heinous like lying about them, in order to give his mother a strong motive for blowing her lady-like stack." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, the {{two couples}} lived {{on for a}} year or two ordinarily enough, till the time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to their {{respective}} spouses, as is the rule of married life; and the two cousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made 'em <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have married straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had fallen in love. 'Twas Tony's party that had done it, plain enough, and they half wished they had never gone there. James, being a quiet, fireside, perusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his wife, who loved riding and driving and out--door jaunts to a degree; while Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very domestic wife, who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs, scarcely ever wished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.|$|E

"Poor Louise {{was taken}} all aback by this, {{but she knew}} well that Tim {{was a man who}} never {{threatened}} in jest, an' moreover she wasn't quite sure o' the young clerk; so she agreed, an' Tim went off to settle with her father about the weddin'. Well, the day came, an' Tim, with a lot o' his comrades, mounted their horses, and rode off to the bride's house, which was a mile or two up the river out of the town. Just as they were startin', Tim's horse gave a plunge that well-nigh pitched him over its head, an' Tim came down on him with a cut o' his heavy whip that sounded like a pistol-shot. The beast was <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> this that it gave a kind o' squeal an' another plunge that burst the girth, Tim brought the whip down on its flank again, which made it shoot forward like an arrow out of a bow, leavin' poor Tim on the ground. So slick did it fly away that it didn't even throw him on his back, but let him fall sittin'-wise, saddle and all, plump on the spot where he sprang from. Tim scratched his head an' grinned like a half-worried rattlesnake as his comrades almost rolled off their saddles with laughin'. But it was no laughin' job, for poor Tim's leg was doubled under him an' broken across at the thigh. It was long before he was able to go about again, and when he did recover he found that Louise and the young clerk were spliced an' away to Kentucky." ...|$|E
