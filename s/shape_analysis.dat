40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to bridge <b>shape</b> {{sensitivity}} <b>analysis</b> and configurational mechanics by means of a widespread use of the shape derivative concept. This technique will be applied as a systematic procedure to obtain the Eshelbyâ€™s energy momentum tensor associated to the problem under consideration. In order to highlight special features of this procedure and without loss of generality, we focus our attention in the application of <b>shape</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> to the problem of twisted straight bars within the framework of linear elasticity. Kinematic and static variational formulations as well as the direct method of sensitivity analysis are used to perform shape derivatives of both models. Integral expressions of first and second order shape derivatives of the total potential energy and the complementary potential energy with respect to an arbitrary transverse cross-section shape change, are achieved. These integral expressions put in evidence the relationship between <b>shape</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> and the first and second order Eshelbyâ€™s energy momentum tensors. Also, the null divergence property of these tensors is easily proved by comparing, in each case, the domain and boundary integral shape derivative arrived at. Finally, an example with a known exact solution, corresponding to an elastic bar with elliptical transverse cross-section submitted to twist, is presented in order to illustrate the usefulness of these tensors to compute the corresponding shape derivatives...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{review of}} results on first order shape-topological differentiability of energy functionals {{for a class}} of variational inequalities of {{elliptic}} type is presented. The velocity method in <b>shape</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> for solutions of elliptic unilateral problems is established in the monograph (SokoÅ‚owski and ZolÃ©sio, Introduction to Shape Optimization: <b>Shape</b> Sensitivity <b>Analysis,</b> Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg/New York, 1992). The shape and material derivatives of solutions to frictionless contact problems in solid mechanics are obtained. In this way the shape gradients of the associated integral functionals are derived {{within the framework of}} nonsmooth analysis. In the case of the energy type functionals classical differentiability results can be obtained, because the shape differentiability of solutions is not required to obtain the shape gradient of the shape functional (SokoÅ‚owski and ZolÃ©sio, Introduction to Shape Optimization: <b>Shape</b> Sensitivity <b>Analysis,</b> Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg/New York, 1992). Therefore, for cracks the strong continuity of solutions with respect to boundary variations is sufficient in order to obtain first order shape differentiability of the associated energy functional. This simple observation which is used in SokoÅ‚owski and ZolÃ©sio (Introduction to Shape Optimization: <b>Shape</b> Sensitivity <b>Analysis,</b> Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg/New York, 1992) for the shape differentiability of multiple eigenvalues is further applied in Khludnev and SokoÅ‚owski (Eur.

A domain decomposition technique in shape-topology sensitivity analysis for problems with unilateral constraints on the crack faces (lips) is presented for the shape functionals. We introduce the Griffith shape functional as the distributed shape derivative of the elastic energy evaluated in a domain with a crack, with respect to the crack length. We are interested in the dependence of this functional on domain perturbations far from the crack. As a result, the directional shape and topological derivatives of the nonsmooth Griffith shape functional are obtained with respect to boundary variations of an inclusion...|$|R
