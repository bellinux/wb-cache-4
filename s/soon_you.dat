500|$|Wish You Were Here is Floyd's {{second album}} with a {{conceptual}} theme written entirely by Roger Waters. [...] It reflects his {{feeling that the}} camaraderie that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. [...] The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced {{him to leave the}} group seven years earlier. [...] Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as [...] "Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun" [...] and [...] "You reached for the secret too <b>soon,</b> <b>you</b> cried for the moon".|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{started the}} season with a 27–20 home win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out {{training}} camp and the preseason in a contract dispute, linebacker Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble. The Giants' defense forced three turnovers and held the Eagles to 83 rushing yards. The Giants' offense scored three touchdowns in a 13-minute span in the third and early fourth quarters, but head coach Bill Parcells felt the offensive performance was lackluster overall: [...] "Our runners didn't run the way we wanted them to. They were a little impatient. There were five or six vivid examples of cutting back too <b>soon.</b> <b>You</b> just have to give the play a chance and let it go where it's supposed to." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first wave}} of punk rock was aggressively modern, {{distancing}} itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock. According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone, [...] "In its initial form, a lot of [...] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, {{what happens is that}} people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away. <b>Soon</b> <b>you</b> had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll." [...] John Holmstrom, founding editor of Punk magazine, recalls feeling [...] "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [...] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music." [...] In critic Robert Christgau's description, [...] "It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} 23 September that Graves and Clinton learned that the French fleet in the Chesapeake {{numbered}} 36 ships. This news came from a dispatch sneaked out by Cornwallis on the 17 September, accompanied by a plea for help: [...] "If you cannot relieve me very <b>soon,</b> <b>you</b> {{must be prepared to}} hear the worst." [...] After effecting repairs in New York, Admiral Graves sailed from New York on 19 October with 25 ships of the line and transports carrying 7,000 troops to relieve Cornwallis. It was two days after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. General Washington acknowledged to de Grasse the importance of his role in the victory: [...] "You will have observed that, whatever efforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest." [...] The eventual surrender of Cornwallis led to peace two years later and British recognition of the independent United States of America.|$|E
500|$|On September 6, General Clinton wrote {{a letter}} to Cornwallis, telling him to expect reinforcements. [...] Received by Cornwallis on September 14, this letter may have been {{instrumental}} in the decision by Cornwallis to remain at Yorktown and not try to fight his way out, despite the urging of Banastre Tarleton to break out against the comparatively weak Lafayette. [...] The British military leadership in New York held a council on September 17 in which they agreed that Cornwallis could not be reinforced until they had regained control of the Chesapeake. [...] Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis [...] "dangling in the wind." [...] One day earlier, Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help: [...] "I am of the opinion that you can do me no effectual service but by coming directly to this place." [...] Before dispatching the letter on the 17th, Cornwallis added, [...] "If you cannot relieve me very <b>soon,</b> <b>you</b> must prepare to hear the worst".|$|E

2500|$|The first certain act {{recorded}} for Odoacer was {{shortly before he}} arrived in Italy. Eugippius, in his Life of Saint Severinus, records how a group of barbarians {{on their way to}} Italy had stopped to pay their respect to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time [...] "a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes", learned from Severinus that he would one day become famous. When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: [...] "Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; <b>soon</b> <b>you</b> will make rich gifts to many." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Saddington {{provided}} three {{tracks for}} the album, Women 'n Blues, with other tracks by Kate Dunbar, Sally King, Jeannie Lewis and Margret RoadKnight. In August 2012 Saddington appeared on celebrity musician quiz show, RocKwiz, on SBS-TV, where she performed Simone's [...] "Backlash Blues". In December that year she recalled her career [...] "I'm not into legacies ... I usually {{get a job}} once in a blue moon ... I guess it is by choice in a way. But {{at the same time}} I have always thought I {{would have liked to have}} earned a living at it". She believed that Krishna Consciousness had [...] "saved my life", reviewing her life as a heavy drinker [...] "I honestly think if I had gone on with that, it would have ended up like Janis Joplin.
