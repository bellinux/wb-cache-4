5|$|Love Kraft is {{the seventh}} studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, {{released}} on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album {{was recorded in}} Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and {{was something of a}} departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a <b>sex</b> <b>shop,</b> Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.|$|E

25|$|In France, {{the sale}} of {{products}} containing butyl nitrite has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers. In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs. After litigation by <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> owners, this extension was quashed by the Council of State {{on the grounds that}} the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} multiple {{references to}} popular culture. The song Quagmire sings in the <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> {{is a part}} of [...] "Make 'Em Laugh" [...] from the 1952 musical film Singin' in the Rain. The erotic book Peter buys at the <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> is Much Ado About Humping, a parody of the William Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing. The four porn books shown on screen are references to works of literature: Angela's Asses to Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, Catcher in the Eye to Catcher in the Rye by J. D.

500|$|The Magic Wand {{received}} the nickname [...] "the Cadillac of vibrators" [...] from the <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> Good Vibrations. Boutique erotica store Babeland founders Rachel Venning and Claire Cavanah called the massager the Rolls-Royce of vibrators in their 2003 book Sex Toys 101; this characterization was echoed by authors Anne Hooper and Philip Hodson, and physician Michael L. Krychman. Venning and Cavanah {{observed that the}} device alleviated discomfort from menstrual cramps. They recommended the Magic Wand to new users of vibrators who asked for a suggestion for a starter device. Cavanah observed that the Magic Wand was unique among vibrators for its success through word-of-mouth marketing.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the turn}} of the year, the band members {{attended}} a special private screening of a new film, Rude Boy; part fiction, part rockumentary, it {{tells the story of a}} Clash fan who leaves his job in a Soho <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> to become a roadie for the group.

On 27 February 1980, it premiered at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won an honourable mention.|$|E
500|$|Hitachi {{executives}} assisted {{financing the}} production of chocolates {{in the shape of}} the massager in 1992, in honor of the 15-year anniversary of the <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> Good Vibrations. Subsequently, the company asserted in 1999 its sole intended use was for health care purposes. Hitachi had a conflict with its U.S. distributor in 2000 and briefly stopped selling the device until it reached a new deal with distributor Vibratex. The Magic Wand sold out after being featured in a 2002 episode of Sex and the City. Hitachi decided to cease production of the device in 2013 because of concerns about having the company name attached to a sex toy. Vibratex persuaded the company to continue manufacturing it under the name [...] "Original Magic Wand", omitting the Hitachi name. In 2014, the company used the name [...] "Magic Wand Original".|$|E
5000|$|In London, {{there are}} few boroughs that have {{licensed}} <b>sex</b> <b>shops.</b> In the district of Soho within the City of Westminster a handful of <b>sex</b> <b>shops</b> were opened by Carl Slack in the early 1960s, and by the mid-seventies the number had grown to 59. Some had nominally [...] "secret" [...] backrooms selling hardcore photographs and novels, including Olympia Press editions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Soho {{residents}} were {{troubled by the}} growing sex industry. Between 1965 and 1982, the number of <b>sex</b> <b>shops</b> had doubled from thirty one to sixty five. In 1982 Porter became Chairman of the General Purposes Committee and set to work in alleviating the issue. Porter and her aides soon proceeded with a fact-finding mission. The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 stipulated that Westminster could shut down any pornographer that did not hold a licence. Porter soon decided {{that the number of}} <b>sex</b> <b>shops</b> in Soho would be limited to twenty. The legislation also ensured that any successful applicants would require a minimum of 6 months residency in the UK as well as a clean police record. It was also legislated that <b>sex</b> <b>shops</b> would have to conceal their practice with blinds. Other measures included the requirement of business owners to keep a register of their staff. By February 1983, just thirteen <b>sex</b> <b>shops</b> remained in Soho.|$|R
50|$|The {{licensing}} or {{closing of}} unlicensed <b>sex</b> <b>shops,</b> along with cultural {{changes such as}} the substantial relaxation of general censorship and the ready availability of non-commercial sex, have reduced the red-light district of Soho to just a small area. The borough has fifteen licensed <b>sex</b> <b>shops</b> and several remaining unlicensed ones. Islington and Camden each have multiple sex shops; the former also has three pornographic cinemas.|$|R
500|$|Peter, Joe, and Cleveland {{accompany}} Quagmire to a <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> called Pornoslavia. Peter buys {{an erotic}} book entitled Much Ado About Humping and finds it disappointing. Peter writes {{a letter to}} the author including an example of what he would consider a better writing style for an erotic novel, which impresses his friends when he reads it to them. Encouraged by their enthusiasm, Peter decides to write his own erotic novel, which is received well by all who read it. The novels he authors are converted into audio books read by Betty White, and [...] "published" [...] by Peter's father-in-law, Carter Pewterschmidt, who only gave Peter $5 for photocopies. While listening to one of Peter's audio books, an aroused driver tries to take off his shirt while driving and crashes his car into the Kool-Aid Man's house. The man sues Carter, who is liable as the publisher. Carter immediately loses his fortune. Blaming Peter for his penniless state, Carter arrives at the Griffin house intending to shoot Peter. Lois persuades Carter to spare him, and Peter agrees to let Carter live with them until he has income.|$|E
500|$|The Magic Wand {{has been}} a bestseller at the <b>sex</b> <b>shop</b> Good Vibrations since it opened in 1977. The shop marketed the magic wand to women as an {{effective}} means of stimulating the clitoris. The device became an enduring bestseller in adult sex toy shops in the United States. It has become known colloquially among women as [...] "Big Buzzy", and is also simply referred to as [...] "The Hitachi". During the 1980s, the device was advertised in the back pages of Mother Jones magazine. It became popular with women and was featured {{on the cover of the}} book Good Vibrations: The New Complete Guide to Vibrators (1976) by Joani Blank. The Magic Wand features on the covers of the 1989 and 1998 editions of the book. In 1992 for the 15th anniversary of the opening of Good Vibrations, the sex store managers arranged to have chocolates manufactured in the shape of the Magic Wand. Sales staff from the corporate headquarters of Hitachi company contributed finances towards the creation of the chocolates in the shape of their massager. The Hitachi executives additionally purchased 500 of the massager-shaped chocolates which were given out at the company's sales conference that year.|$|E

But, a chance invitation and visit to a Tupperware party at an East London flat in 1981 changed everything– Jacqueline saw the potential of selling sexy lingerie and sex toys to women {{in the privacy of}} their own homes. Jacqueline launched the Ann Summers Party Plan– a home marketing plan for sex toys, with a strict [...] "no men allowed" [...] policy. This type of party, which provides women with a forum to meet and talk about sex (and other matters), became so popular that such parties are now regarded as part of British popular culture; this format also provides the company with a convenient way of circumventing legal restrictions about displaying sex toys for sale.|$|E
