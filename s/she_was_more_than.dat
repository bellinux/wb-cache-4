Despite media reports that Moynahan and Brady have an acrimonious relationship, it was revealed that the two have maintained a civil relationship since the birth of their son.|$|E

25|$|She {{was smaller}} than Naseby (later renamed Royal Charles), but she was in regular service during the three Anglo-Dutch Wars, {{surviving}} the Raid on the Medway in 1667 by being at Portsmouth at the time. She underwent a second rebuild in 1685 at Chatham Dockyard, relaunching as a first rate of 100 guns, before {{taking part in the}} outset of the War of the Grand Alliance against Louis XIV of France. For the first time she ventured into the Irish Sea, and later participated in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690) and the Battle of La Hougue, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> fifty years old. In that period she was the first ship in history that flew royals above her topgallant sails and a topgallant sail on the jigger-mast.|$|E

The ship's crew consisted of 28 officers and 826 enlisted men. Her design was based on that of the Tsesarevich, modified to suit Russian machinery.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld {{demanded that}} her books be printed in large type with wide margins, so that {{children}} could easily read them; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> likely the [...] "originator" [...] of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and [...] "almost certainly [...] popularizer". In her history of children's literature in The Guardian of Education (1802–1806), Sarah Trimmer noted these innovations, {{as well as}} the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words. While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.|$|E
500|$|During the localization, Bateman had to {{keep track}} of the {{numerous}} plot points throughout the game, as the script had not been written in chronological order due to the numerous endings. Localizing the game took roughly two months. Another big challenge was getting the localization done in time: Nobara Nakayama, the game's translator, worked on it for 30 days, and the editing process took two months. Because of this, Bateman had to do most of the work [...] "on the fly". Nakayama had started playing the game prior to starting work on the localization, but did not finish playing it until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> halfway through translating it; after learning that the plot hinged on a Japanese pun, they had to halt the localization, discuss it with Uchikoshi, come up with a solution, and go through the whole game to make sure that it still made sense.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{requested}} that the executor of his will, nephew William L. Coolidge, use most of Wilson's estate to ensure that Wilson's mother in law was cared for, and that Eva receive an education and financial support. [...] Wilson had given Coolidge verbal instructions and letters {{in addition to his}} will, and the situation became complicated because Wilson's death occurred before he had incorporated these additional instructions into his will. [...] Coolidge acted as a trustee for Eva, and by 1889, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 21 years old, she claimed she was entitled to the remainder of Wilson's estate. [...] Other Wilson family members disagreed; because of the complexity of the details, Coolidge petitioned the Massachusetts courts for guidance. [...] The courts found in favor of Eva, by then married and known as Eva Carpenter, and she received the bulk of the residue of the estate.|$|E
500|$|Halfway {{through the}} casting process, Cardiac Arrest actress Helen Baxendale became available. BAFTA Scotland award-nominated Baxendale {{was seen as}} a coup, though she was {{hesitant}} to audition as she believed that she could not do comedy. Harries persuaded her that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> qualified, citing her comedic performance in Cardiac Arrest. She was cast as Rachel on the basis of her chemistry at the audition with Nesbitt. Fay Ripley assumed that she would be reading for the role of Rachel, and was surprised to be auditioning for Jenny. Many of the actresses seen for the part were [...] "finger-wagging" [...] and [...] "predictable", an approach Ripley did not take. Raised in Surrey, Ripley had to adopt a Manchester accent for the part. She [...] "managed to bodge together a sort of Manchester accent" [...] for the audition, assuming that she would not get the part. When she was cast, she worked on improving the accent by spending time talking to local people.|$|E

"Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E

Only the old Wäinämöinen, handed over to Estonia in 1922, came close with an overall length of , beam of [...] and displacement of 3,619 tons. Her bow, which had slightly rounder lines than the previous Finnish icebreakers, had a stem angle of 23–25 degrees and her hull, protected by an ice belt up to [...] thick, was divided into eight compartments by watertight transverse bulkheads. With a crew of 47, Jääkarhu had the largest crew among the Finnish steam-powered icebreakers even though she required less stokers than the older icebreakers due to her oil-fired boilers.|$|E

The second game took around three months to translate and four months to edit. A big challenge in localizing it was catching the several subtle hints to the game's ending that appear throughout the story. Unlike the previous two Zero Escape titles, a North American version of the third game was produced alongside the Japanese version.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrical use of {{the word}} midons, {{borrowed}} from Guilhem de Poitou, allowed troubadours to address multiple listeners—the lords, men, and women of the court alike. A sort of hermaphroditic code word, or senhan, scholar Meg Bogin writes, the multiple meanings behind this term allowed a covert form of flattery: [...] "By refusing to disclose his lady's name, the troubadour permitted every woman in the audience, notably the patron's wife, to think that it was she; then, besides making her the object of a secret passion—it was always covert romance—by making her his lord he flashed her an aggrandized image of herself: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 'just' a woman; she was a man." [...] These points of multiple meaning and ambiguity facilitated a [...] "coquetry of class", allowing the male troubadours to use the images of women as a means to gain social status with other men, but simultaneously, Bogin suggests, voiced deeper longings for the audience: [...] "In this way, the sexual expressed the social and the social the sexual; and in the poetry of courtly love the static hierarchy of feudalism was uprooted and transformed to express a world of motion and transformation." ...|$|E
