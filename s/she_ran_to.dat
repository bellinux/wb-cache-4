25|$|Katie Starks {{was born}} September 25, 1909 in Redwater, Texas. Katie was 36 {{at the time}} of the attack. She was married to Virgil Starks and lived at their {{farmhouse}} of five years on 500 acres of farmland off Highway 67 East almost 10 miles northeast of Texarkana. Her sister, Mrs. Allen, lived directly across the street from her. She was the daughter of Jim Strickland. She and Virgil went to school together growing up because their parents lived on neighboring farms in Red Springs, Texas. A friend had stated that she and Virgil were two of the best people he had ever known. After discovering her husband dead, <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> telephone police. She rung the phone twice when she was shot two times in the face. One bullet went through the right cheek beside the nose, emerging behind the left ear, and the other went in her lower jaw below the lip, breaking her jaw and splintering several teeth before lodging under her tongue. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> a neighbor's house who then took her to the hospital where she recovered.|$|E

Moore noticed her father was different {{when she was in}} elementary school. Their house bordered an apple orchard, and her dad killed stray cats and gophers that wandered nearby. One day she watched, horrified, as he hung stray kittens from the family's clothesline. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> get her mother, and when they returned, the kittens lay on the ground dead. He had watched and laughed as the kittens clawed each other to escape, then he killed them.|$|E
500|$|The main {{set list}} for the {{residency}} included songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. The show began with Gaga appearing {{on top of the}} platforms and danced towards her piano to perform an acoustic version of [...] "Born This Way", before proceeding to dance on the rafters with her backup troupe to [...] "Black Jesus + Amen Fashion" [...] in her purple leotard and jacket. A costume change ensued and Gaga performed [...] "Monster" [...] wearing a crimson leather body suit and roses atop her head. She played the rose-adorned keytar and gradually segued into [...] "Bad Romance". Middle of the performance, <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the left of the stage to climb a ladder to the mezannine floors, where she sang the final chorus and [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] followed with energetic dance moves.|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps as <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the microphone.|$|E

500|$|The {{family had}} been briefly {{separated}} in April 1918 when the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and Maria to Yekaterinburg. Alexei and the three other young women remained behind because Alexei had suffered another attack of hemophilia. The Empress chose Maria to accompany her because [...] "Olga's spirits were too low" [...] and level-headed Tatiana was needed {{to take care of}} Alexei. In May 1918 the remaining children and servants boarded the ship Rus that ferried them from Tobolsk to Yekaterinburg. Aboard ship, Olga was distressed when she saw one of the guards slip from a ladder and injure his foot. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the man and explained that she had been a nurse during the war and wanted to look at his foot. He refused her offer of treatment. All through the afternoon, Olga fretted over the guard, whom she called [...] "her poor fellow." [...] At Tobolsk Olga and her sisters had sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from the Bolsheviks, since Alexandra had written to warn them that upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, she, Nicholas and Maria had been aggressively searched and belongings confiscated.|$|E

Davis felt concerned because he was wielding in his hand some kind of [...] "dark object". <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street. Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to another}} tradition, the devil {{appeared}} to Cain and instructed {{him how to}} exact revenge on Abel.

Eve {{did not know what}} murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, [...] "Woe to you! What is murder?". [...] "He [...] does not eat. He does not drink.

However, she could not speak because she could not stop wailing. Since then, women wail brokenheartedly when a loved one dies. A different tradition narrates that while Cain was quarreling with Abel, the devil killed an animal with a stone in Cain's sight to show him how to murder Abel.|$|E
2500|$|On March 31, Selena woke {{up early}} to meet Saldivar {{at the motel}} where she was staying.

When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As she turned to leave, Saldivar reached into her handbag, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 [...]38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour.|$|E

2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed in her nightgown, she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair. She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head. When she realized he was dead, <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> the phone to call police.|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
