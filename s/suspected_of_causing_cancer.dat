40|$|This {{meeting of}} the President's Cancer Panel was {{designed}} to provide an overview <b>of</b> known and <b>suspect</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> and to indicate those that might be considered avoidable. Two complex concepts are inherent in this charge: cause and avoidability. Risk factors for cancer are designated as causal when the evidence from observational and laboratory research is judged sufficient in relation to criteria for causality; {{the extent to which}} cancers of specific sites can be avoided is best estimated by the attributable risk statistic, which incorporates both the exposure pattern and the relative risk for the cancer-causing agent. A research agenda on avoidable <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> should then address both the risks associated with the agents that <b>cause</b> <b>cancer</b> and the pattern of exposure to the agents. Presentations at the meeting highlighted gaps in the evidence on the risks associated with various known and potential <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> and on the patterns of exposure across the diverse groups within the population. In spite of these gaps, presenters emphasized that the evidence is already sufficient to justify intervention for many agents and that action need not be delayed for the well-characterized <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> In addition to research recommendations offered by presenters for specific causal agents, the scientific basis for cancer prevention might be generally strengthened by new research strategies directed at developing new tools for exposure assessment, for investigating the risks of mixtures, and for population surveillance. - Environ Health Perspect 103 (Suppl 8) : 307 - 311 (1995) Key words: cancer etiology, cancer control, risk assessment, epidemiolog...|$|R
40|$|Background There {{are many}} proven and <b>suspected</b> {{occupational}} <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> lung <b>cancer,</b> which will become relatively more important over time, as smoking prevalence decreases. Methods We interviewed 457 cases aged 20 – 75 years notified to theNewZealandCancer Registry during 2007 – 2008, and 792 population controls. We collected information on demographic details, potential confounders, and employment history. Associations were estimated using logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, smoking, and socio-economic status. Results Among occupations of a priori interest, elevated odds ratios (ORs) were observed for sawmill, wood panel and related wood-processing plant operators (OR 4. 63; 95 % CI 1. 05 – 20. 29), butchers (OR 8. 77, 95 % CI 1. 06 – 72. 55), rubber and plastics products machine operators (4. 27; 1. 16 – 15. 66), heavy truck drivers (2. 24; 1. 19 – 4. 21) andworkers in petroleum, coal, chemical and associated product manufacturing (1. 80; 1. 11 – 2. 90); non-significantly elevated risks were also observed for loggers (4. 67; 0. 81 – 27. 03), welders and flame-cutters (2. 50; 0. 86 – 7. 25), pressers (5. 74; 0. 96 – 34. 42), and electric and electronic equipment assemblers (3. 61; 0. 96 – 13. 57).

40|$|Among the <b>suspected</b> {{bacterial}} <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> H. pylori is {{the agent}} more consistently linked to malignancy. After its discovery in 1983 and the later confirmation {{as the leading}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> chronic gastritis, several studies were performed to prove an association between H. pylori infection and gastric carcinoma. The epidemiological data have been so strong that in 1994 the International Association for Research on Cancer stated that "there was sufficient evidence" to classify H. pylori as a group I carcinogen in humans. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the link between H. pylori infection and gastric carcinoma remain still to be elucidated. The natural history of H. pylori infection shows that, although roughly half of the world's human population bears the organism, {{only a minority of}} individuals develop clinically important outcomes (e. g. peptic ulcer, lymphoproliferative diseases, atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinoma) : host's genetic make-up, duration of infection, diet and differences between H. pylori strains have been proposed as factors potentially able to influence the outcomes in different individuals. The damaging agents by which H. pylori could promote gastric carcinogenesis are produced either by the organism or {{as a consequence of the}} host inflammatory response to the infection. Gastric mucosal chronic damage may, therefore, lead to changes in the pattern of epithelial cell kinetic (increase in cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis) in gastric glands which may induce DNA injury with irreversible genetic lesions. Finally, a direct association between H. pylori infection and the induction of gastric carcinoma has been recently demonstrated in an animal model, giving further credence to the role of this organism in gastric carcinogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{ionizing}} radiation (IR) results in {{various types of}} DNA damage and is a <b>suspected</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> lung <b>cancer.</b> An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP 53, CCND 1, and CDKN 2 A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i. e., CCND 1 G 870 A, CDKN 2 A Ala(148) Thr, TP 53 Arg(72) Pro, and 16 -bp repeat in intron 3) and {{that the effect of}} X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2, 238 cases and 2, 289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP 53 intron 3 16 -bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1. 99; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1. 27 - 3. 13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2. 98; 95 % CI, 1. 29 - 6. 87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP 53 intron 3 16 -bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5. 69; 95 % CI, 1. 33 - 24. 3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND 1 G 870 A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND 1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1. 16; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 1. 27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1. 29; 95 % CI, 1. 12 - 1. 49) among subjects with A/A genotype.

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of "human" and "probable human" carcinogens as categorized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer have been identified through observations in workers. The excess cancer risk has often been quite high. Most substances known to cause cancer in humans are now known to cause cancer in animals. In the past two decades, {{an increasing number of}} substances first shown to cause cancer in animals are now known to cause or are highly <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> <b>causing</b> <b>cancer</b> in humans (and quite often in workers). The observations necessitate the use of rodent cancer test results for identifying and regulating potential environmental carcinogens. The role of cell proliferation (CP) in the carcinogenic response is important from a regulatory view in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evidence. If CP influences the carcinogenic response, the use of such data to modify dose response in the low-dose range is another factor that needs to be considered. Presentations at this symposium, however, indicate that CP data at the present time should not be incorporated into cancer risk assessments. More simple concepts that affect quantitative dose response and that may result in an artificially low estimated risk but could be adjusted for in the bioassay protocol have usually been ignored. A balanced approach would be to incorporate all known factors that influence quantitative estimates of cancer risk when conducting animal cancer bioassays and extrapolating those results to humans...|$|E

40|$|Flowers are {{susceptible}} to many pests and diseases. Therefore, they can be sprayed several times during their growth considering that no MRL are set for flow-ers. High levels of pesticide residues potentially expose daily the florists who han-dle cut flowers and possibly could endanger their health. A study was carried out to evaluate the risk for florists exposed to fungicide residues during normal profes-sional tasks. Cotton gloves were distributed to 20 florists (two pairs to each florist) and worn during two consecutive half days during normal professional tasks (from min 2 hours to max 3 hours/day) to measure their potential dermal exposure (PDE). Samples were analyzed with a multi-residue (QuEChERS) method validated by a laboratory accredited for pesticide residues and {{with a combination of}} gas and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. It appears from the results that a total of 54 fungicides with different toxicity classes were detected on cotton gloves. An average of 15. 53 mg/kg fungicide residues per glove sample was meas-ured. Six of 54 are <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> <b>causing</b> <b>cancer</b> after prolonged or repeated expo-sure. Boscalid was both the active substance for which the highest maximum and average concentrations (26. 21 and 3. 47 mg/kg, respectively).

As a consequence, this study leads to conclude that Belgian florists, who worked for several years and handled a large number of flowers contaminated by high concentrations of pesti-cide residues, are exposed daily with a potential effect on their health. This sug-gests that safety standards should be set for residue levels on cut flowers. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{carried out}} a study at a fire service {{training}} facility to assess exposures to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons. The purpose was to learn whether these substances pass through the skin of firefighters wearing full ensembles. Some PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons are known or <b>suspected</b> <b>of</b> <b>causing</b> <b>cancer.</b> The study consisted of two rounds (1 year apart). In each round, five firefighters fought a controlled structure burn once a day for 3 days. Firefighters wore new or freshly laundered turnout gear each day and wore self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). The burns {{took place in a}} timber-framed structure or a metal container; interior walls were covered with drywall. The rooms were set up with typical family room furniture. The burns lasted an average of 22 minutes. Firefighters' activities included an average of 11 minutes watching the fire build, 3. 5 minutes knocking down the fire, and 7. 5 minutes doing overhaul. We collected air, breath, urine, and wipe samples of the skin (forearms, hands, neck, face, and scrotum) throughout the day. We analyzed the samples for PAHs and aromatic hydrocarbons in the air, PAHs on firefighters' skin before and after firefighting, and PAHs and aromatic hydrocarbons in firefighters' blood and urine before and after firefighting. The air samples showed that all the burns released PAHs into the air. The PAH levels were the same or higher than levels reported in other firefighting studies. The levels of PAHs in air during five burns were higher than the occupational exposure limit. The air levels decreased after knockdown but remained above the occupational exposure limit during overhaul. Firefighters do not always wear SCBA during overhaul. The biological monitoring showed that (1) the PAH levels on fire fighters' necks (least protected body area) were higher right after the burns than before (PAHs were not found on other areas of fire fighters' skin), (2) levels of PAHs excreted in urine 3 hours after firefighting were higher than those excreted just before or just after firefighting, and (3) benzene was the main aromatic hydrocarbon measured in fire fighters' breath at levels that were higher just after firefighting than just before (we detected no benzene in urine after firefighting). HHE investigators determined that the levels of PAHs and benzene in firefighters' bodies were similar to levels in occupational groups with low exposures to these compounds. PAHs and benzene likely entered their bodies through their skin because most fire fighters wore properly working SCBA. The following recommendations were provided: (1) maintain and routinely test SCBA to ensure proper function, (2) require firefighters to wear full protective ensembles, including SCBA, during knockdown and overhaul for all fire responses, (3) provide firefighters with long hoods that are unlikely to come untucked, (4) provide as much natural ventilation as possible to burned structures before starting investigations, (5) take off gear before entering a rehab area; remove SCBA and hood last, (6) store gear {{on the outside of the}} apparatus when riding back to the station, and (7) wash hands immediately and shower as soon as possible after a fire response.
