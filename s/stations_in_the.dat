5|$|In fall 2011, the District Department of Transportation {{announced}} plans to add 32 stations and expand 18 existing ones by year's end, Bikeshare <b>Stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District|url=http://ddot.dc.gov/DC/DDOT/About+DDOT/News+Room/ci.DDOT+Announces+32+New+Captial+Bikeshare+Stations+in+the+District.print|publisher=DC DOT|accessdate=March 27, 2011|date=Ca. October 20, 2011}} then add 50 more in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer {{noted that the}} <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expansions were spaced further apart than the <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original service area, which would make the Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Jordanhill {{is to be}} rebuilt, one of six new <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west of Scotland, {{according}} to an announcement made on 19 May 2006 by SPT chief executive Ron Culley.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} many nearby Washington Metro rail <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> neighborhoods that border Landover, {{including}} the Addison Road Blue Line <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bordering town of Seat Pleasant, the Cheverly Orange Line <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bordering town of Cheverely, the Capital Heights Blue Line <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bordering town of Capital Heights, the Largo Blue Line <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bordering unincorporated area of Largo, and the Deanwood Orange Line <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia. Most of the above listed stations are within five Metro stops or less from the National Capital Building's Metro stop (Capital South Metro <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia).|$|R
5|$|Once {{the line}} started full operation, {{construction}} of extensions to the Bloor–Danforth line began. The extensions to Islington <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west and Warden <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east opened simultaneously on May 11, 1968. On November 21, 1980, {{the line was}} extended to the current terminal stations of Kipling <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west and Kennedy <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
50|$|Plans {{call for}} Confederation Line to span from Tunney's Pasture <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west to Blair <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east, a {{distance}} of 12.5 km including a 2.5 km tunnel running under Queen Street <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central business district. The line will connect to the existing Bus Rapid Transitway at Tunney’s Pasture <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west and Blair <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east, and to the O-Train Trillium Line at Bayview station.|$|R

50|$|AbukumaExpress {{operates}} the Abukuma Express Line, which runs 54.9 km from Fukushima <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south to Tsukinoki <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|R
50|$|It was <b>the</b> westernmost <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MTR system {{until the}} opening of <b>the</b> Airport <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> 1998. It was also <b>the</b> northernmost <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MTR system until the MTR-KCR merger.|$|R
50|$|Bay <b>Station</b> {{was opened}} <b>in</b> 1966 {{as part of}} the {{original}} segment of the Bloor-Danforth line, from Keele <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west to Woodbine <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Terminal 4, all <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airport are freestanding structures, connected to their respective terminal buildings by an aerial walkway. Terminal 4 opened in 2013 with the station inside the terminal building itself.|$|E
5|$|Youngstown {{is served}} by 37 {{different}} radio <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area making it the 119th largest radio market in the United States. Stations include 17 on the AM band and 20 on the FM band.

5|$|As {{a part of}} the Red Line Northwest Extension, Porter was {{included}} as one of the stations involved in the Arts on the Line program, devised to bring art into the MBTA's subway <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program {{of its kind in the}} United States and became the model for similar drives for art across the country.|$|E
50|$|Higashichichibu has no {{passenger}} rail service. The nearest station is Yorii <b>Station,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighboring town of Yorii or Ogawamachi <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Ogawa.|$|R

5|$|As the VOR {{system was}} phased {{in around the}} world, the LFR was {{gradually}} phased out, mostly disappearing by the 1970s. There are no remaining operational LFR facilities today. At its maximum deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|Biofuel {{emphasis}} in Germany is on biodiesel, and no specific incentives {{have been granted}} for E85 flex-fuel cars, however there is complete exemption of taxes on all biofuels {{while there is a}} normal tax of €0.65 per liter of petroleum fuels. The distribution of E85 began in 2005, and with 219 stations as of September 2008, Germany ranks second after Sweden with the most E85 fueling <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EU.|$|E
50|$|T3a connects Boulevard Victor - Pont du Garigliano RER <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{western part}} of the 15th {{arrondissement}} with Porte de Vincennes metro <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th arrondissement.|$|R

50|$|Sasebo Station is <b>the</b> westernmost <b>station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> JR {{passenger}} train system {{and is about}} two hours by train from Hakata <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Fukuoka (via the Midori line) and about two hours from Nagasaki <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Nagasaki. Across the street from Sasebo Station is the Sasebo Bus Center, which provides connecting service to many local destinations.|$|R
5|$|Broad Channel is a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people not paying their fare) {{making it one of the}} least used <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad Channel is the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays it has on average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only transfer point between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E
5|$|Capital Bikeshare {{has grown}} steadily, which has driven {{demand for more}} {{stations}} and bikes. Transportation agencies in each jurisdiction select {{the location of the}} rental stations, as well as the number of bike docks, depending on planners' estimates of local demand. Most of the system's users live in or near the city center; <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorer eastern portion of the city are comparatively underused.|$|E
5|$|Coquitlam {{contracts}} out its {{police service}} to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, with the main police station adjacent to City Hall at Coquitlam Town Centre and community police <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Austin Heights and Burquitlam areas. The Coquitlam RCMP detachment also serves the municipalities of Anmore, Belcarra, and Port Coquitlam.|$|E
5000|$|King City {{station has}} weekday service {{consisting}} of 5 trains southbound to Union <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, and 7 trains returning northbound to Allandale Waterfront GO <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon.|$|R

50|$|Sasebo Station {{is about}} two hours by train from Hakata <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Fukuoka (via the Midori line) and about two hours from Nagasaki <b>Station</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Nagasaki.|$|R
5|$|Deptford {{railway station}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{suburban}} <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, being built (c.1836-38) as part of the first suburban service (the London and Greenwich Railway), between London Bridge and Greenwich. Close to Deptford Creek is a Victorian pumping station built in 1864, part of the massive London sewerage system designed by civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it mainly serves Aqueduct Racetrack, the station is not well-used {{compared}} to other <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. During the 1970s ridership at the station declined, from 1.1 million passengers in 1975 to 573,000 in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
