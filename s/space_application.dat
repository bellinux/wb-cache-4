2500|$|By the 1960s, {{solar cells}} were (and still are) the {{main power source}} for most Earth {{orbiting}} satellites {{and a number of}} probes into the solar system, since they offered the best power-to-weight ratio. However, this success was possible because in the <b>space</b> <b>application,</b> power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the National Science Foundation [...] "Research Applied to National Needs" [...] program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.|$|E
