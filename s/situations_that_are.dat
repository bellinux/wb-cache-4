5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

25|$|Although legally {{allowed to}} leave, {{economic}} and social issues have kept many people in <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> defined as slavery. In addition, even when freed, discrimination and political power is wielded over ex-slaves in many instances. Democratization in the 1990s did not necessarily entail emancipation and there are examples of former masters pressuring and forcing ex-slaves {{to vote for the}} candidates they prefer; however, there have also been examples of resistance to this pressure.|$|E

25|$|Colditz (2005) was a mini-series on ITV1, {{based on}} Henry Chancellor's book Colditz: The Definitive History, {{directed}} by Stuart Orme. This tale {{is much more}} fictional than its predecessors, with fictional characters and <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> merely based on real people and events. It features Jason Priestley (Beverly Hills, 90210) as Rhett Barker, James Fox as Lt. Col. Jimmy Fordham, Damian Lewis (Band of Brothers) as Lt. Nicholas McGrade, Tom Hardy (Black Hawk Down) as Lt. Jack Rose, Sophia Myles (Thunderbirds) as Lizzie Carter, Guy Henry as Capt. Sawyer and Timothy West as Warren.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Kafkaesque" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} concepts and situations reminiscent of his work, particularly [...] (The Trial) and [...] "Die Verwandlung" [...] (The Metamorphosis). Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.|$|E
500|$|... "Ironic" [...] is a 1996 song by Canadian -American singer Alanis Morissette. It was {{released}} in February 1996 as the third single from her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill (1995). It was written by Morissette and Glen Ballard, and was produced by him. [...] "Ironic" [...] is a song written in the key of B major, and includes a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. The lyrics present several <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> described as [...] "ironic"; {{this has led to}} debate as to whether any of these actually match the accepted meaning of irony. However, some have argued that it does match what is known as situational irony.|$|E

500|$|Studies on {{mathematical}} development starting {{around the}} 1980s have exploited {{the phenomenon of}} habituation: infants look longer at <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unexpected. A seminal experiment by Karen Wynn in 1992 involving Mickey Mouse dolls manipulated behind a screen demonstrated that five-month-old infants expect [...] to be 2, and they are comparatively surprised when a physical situation seems to imply that [...] is either 1 or 3. This finding has since been affirmed {{by a variety of}} laboratories using different methodologies. Another 1992 experiment with older toddlers, between 18 and 35months, exploited their development of motor control by allowing them to retrieve ping-pong balls from a box; the youngest responded well for small numbers, while older subjects were able to compute sums up to 5.|$|E
500|$|With its {{pioneering}} use {{of themes}} of scientific ambition and discovery, A Trip to the Moon is sometimes {{described as the}} first science fiction film. A Short History of Film argues that it codified [...] "many of the basic generic <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> still used in science fiction films today". However, several other genre designations are possible; Méliès himself advertised the film as a pièce à grand spectacle, a term referring to a type of spectacular Parisian stage extravaganza popularized by Jules Verne and Adolphe d'Ennery {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century. Richard Abel describes the film as belonging to the féerie genre, as does Frank Kessler. It can also be described simply as a trick film, a catch-all term for the popular early film genre of innovative, special-effects-filled shorts—a genre Méliès himself had codified and popularized in his earlier works.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. J. Hoberman, author of Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds, writes that the Lower East Side had reached a total population of 540,000 and the world [...] "ghetto" [...] became a buzzword. Other 1910 films on the subject included Yankee's The Ghetto Seamstress and D. W. Griffith's A Child of the Ghetto. Patricia Erens, author of The Jew in American Cinema says these films highlight the hard-working Jewess in melodramatic <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> only resolved with improbable solutions. The setting for the film included scenes in Manhattan's Chinatown and was advertised as [...] "a study of settlement conditions in the great East Side of New York City. It was produced right {{in the heart of}} the ghetto to assure a faithful presentation of East Side localities and life. Representatives of all races and nationalities pass through the picture, from the slow-stepping Russian to the gliding Chinee." [...] Some of the details of the production were recorded due to the flaws in the depicting a sweatshop and the fact the Hebrew characters are not recognizable as Hebrews.|$|E

2500|$|There are social, legal, logistical, and {{political}} {{barriers to the}} actual implementation {{of many of the}} reforms in the new Mudawana. The top-down nature of the reforms has resulted in many members of the judicial system simply ignoring the new laws’ provisions. Other problems with the judicial system include a lack of training among the judiciary and provisions of the law that allow individual judges to consult principles of Shari'a in <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not covered by the Mudawana.

Zero-g is subtly different from the complete absence of gravity, something which is impossible due {{to the presence of}} gravity everywhere in the universe.

Microgravity (or µg) is used to refer to <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> substantially weightless but where g-force stresses within objects due to tidal effects, as discussed above, are around a millionth of that at the Earth's surface.|$|E

[...] Trial runs are conducted to test the procedures' effectiveness and viability. The readiness of an organization in this regard can be assessed by examining and testing procedures for reasonableness, making inquiries on personnel, and conducting outside research. There are Chapters of DRIE that [...] are a not for profit organisation that assist practitioners, to guide their organisations, through the best practices of concerns companies raise at their seminars. These cover all areas of Disaster recovery planning.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} show, host J. D. Roth and {{the players}} {{sometimes}} discuss the interpersonal drama occurring among the teams. Roth has said that many participants have become close friends while the series was being shot, learning tolerance for people who were different from themselves. However, the Boston Globe reported that there was friction among the players on Endurance: High Sierras following the controversial break-up of teams. Finnegan's mother said, [...] "There was definitely some nastiness", complaining that the producers and writers, [...] "deliberately put the kids in <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> designed to increase the drama and tension". But, Taylor Sico-McNulty, another Endurance: High Sierras contestant from Massachusetts and Finnegan's partner, said that when she returned home following the show's California taping, she [...] "really missed seeing all the other kids in the cast every day", adding {{that a number of}} player reunions have since been held.|$|E
