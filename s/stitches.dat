40|$|Panorama <b>stitching</b> {{increases}} {{the field of}} view in an image by assembling multiple views together. Traditional <b>stitching</b> techniques are proven to be effective only when dealing with parallax-free monocular images. Many challenges that remain unsolved in the <b>stitching</b> research area include how to <b>stitch</b> monocular images with large parallax, how to <b>stitch</b> stereoscopic images to maintain their stereoscopic consistency and original disparity distribution, and how to create panoramic videos with temporally coherent content. To provide more powerful <b>stitching</b> techniques with more universality, we first develop a parallax-tolerant image <b>stitching</b> technique. With the help of it, we then effectively extend the <b>stitching</b> techniques into the stereoscopic image and the video domain to assist users easily making stereoscopic panoramas and video panoramas. In this dissertation, we first introduce a parallax-tolerant <b>stitching</b> method, which is a local <b>stitching</b> method to <b>stitch</b> monocular images with large parallax. This method is based on the observation that input images {{do not need to be}} perfectly aligned over the whole overlapping region for <b>stitching.</b> Instead, they only need to be aligned in a way that there exists a local region where they can be seamlessly blended together. We develop a randomized algorithm to search for a local homography, which, combined with content-preserving warping, allows for optimal <b>stitching.</b> Our experiments show that our method can effectively <b>stitch</b> images with large parallax that are difficult for existing methods. After studying the problem of regular 2 D image <b>stitching,</b> we continue to research 3 D image <b>stitching</b> in this dissertation. In particular, we develop a technique for <b>stitching</b> stereoscopic panoramas from stereo images casually taken using a stereo camera. Stereoscopic image <b>stitching</b> needs to address three challenges: how to deal with parallax, how to <b>stitch</b> the left- and right-view panorama consistently, and how to take care of disparity during <b>stitching.</b> We address these challenges by first <b>stitching</b> the left images with the parallax-tolerant image <b>stitching</b> method to create an artifact-free left view panorama, then <b>stitching</b> the disparity maps with disparity optimization, finally warping and <b>stitching</b> the right images according to the <b>stitched</b> disparity map and the left view panorama. Experiment results show that our technique allows for easy production of high quality stereoscopic panoramas that deliver a pleasant stereoscopic 3 D viewing experience. With the 3 D image <b>stitching</b> problem addressed, we further study a more complex and challenging task of video <b>stitching.</b> We contribute two video <b>stitching</b> techniques, namely the motion map guided video <b>stitching</b> and the feature trajectory guided video <b>stitching.</b> Our techniques <b>stitch</b> pre-synchronized videos captured from a fixed or hand-held camera array which contains multiple cameras with fixed inter-camera configurations. One unique challenge for video <b>stitching</b> is how to maintain temporal coherence. To address this problem, we propose to consistently <b>stitch</b> frames with the guidance of the target camera motion path. In particular, we develop two techniques using dense motion maps and sparse motion vectors to compute the target camera motion path. Afterwards, we warp and <b>stitch</b> frames according to the target camera motion path to create panoramic videos with temporal coherence. Experiments show that our methods can improve the overall panoramic video <b>stitching</b> quality compared with existing methods...|$|R
