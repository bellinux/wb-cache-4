40|$|Mining {{subsidence}} {{is a well}} recognized {{problem in}} many countries. Particularly {{in the recent years}} with increasing demand for energy and resources, mining activities have been extended to a limit where previously being regarded as no-mining zones. It is important to understand the mechanism involved in the substratum movement induced by underground mining. One of the key parameters in subsidence analysis and prediction has been the angle of draw which defines the limit of the subsidence affecting the surface. Most of the traditional empirical subsidence models are reliant on the value of angle of draw. In this paper numerical modeling techniques were used to study the mechanism of substratum movements and the associated <b>subsidence</b> <b>limit</b> at ground surface. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of overburden stiffness and the extraction seam dip angle on the values of angle of draw. The analytical results are discussed in the context of observational data worldwide...|$|E
40|$|The Wadden Sea is {{a shallow}} tidal sea {{in the north}} of the Netherlands where gas {{production}} is ongoing since 1986. Due to the sensitive nature of this area, gas extraction induced subsidence must remain within the "effective subsidence capacity" for the two tidal basins (Pinkegat and Zoutkamperlaag) affected. We present a probabilistic method to monitor the "effective subsidence capacity" and ensure that subsidence is below the long term (18. 6 years) volumetric rate for relative sea level rise that can be accommodated by the tidal basins without environmental harm. The role of sedimentation volume rate, relative sea level rise and subsidence volume rate due to gas depletion are taken into account including their uncertainties. The probability of exceeding the acceptable <b>subsidence</b> <b>limit</b> for the period 2012 to 2050 is 2. 8 % for the tidal basin called Zoutkamperlaag and 1 % for the tidal basin of Pinkegat for climate scenarios that fit the current relative sea level rise observations on the Dutch coast. The values are shown to be dominated by the effect of relative sea level rise, and not due to subsidence induced by gas depletion in the Wadden Sea. To current knowledge no harm is done to nature.

40|$|Introduction: Subsidence {{is not the}} {{consequence}} of a single loading event. More specifically, subsidence may be interpreted as the continuous sinking due to continuous loading. As such, a single static load may not be appropriate. Few studies involving cage subsidence have employed continuous cyclic loading. The goal {{of this study was}} to address the mechanical subsidence performance via prediction of the final subsidence depth and the rate of subsidence. It is hypothesized that those spacer designs, which engage the stronger vertebral body periphery, enable endplate stress distribution through increased contact area, and reduced stress concentrations would display more favorable performance characteristics with respect to subsidence. Materials and Methods: Three intervertebral spacer designs were evaluated; threaded titanium, endplate-sparing titanium, and Polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Devices were randomly but equally assigned to porcine L 4 and L 5 vertebral bodies with endplates prepared as per recommended surgical procedure. Specimens were loaded from – 50 N to – 350 N at 1 Hz for 600 cycles with continuous load versus deformation acquired at cycle 10 and at 25 cycle intervals thereafter. For each cycle interval, the net deformation between the maximum and minimal applied load (or subsidence) was computed. The deformation for all six samples of each design were averaged across each cycle interval and subjected to a nonlinear exponential analysis. More specifically, the subsidence is represented by the independent variable Y. Initial subsidence is calculated at the 10 th loading cycle and was represented by the variable Y 0. From the subsidence versus cycle data, the rate of subsidence (K) was determined as well as the plateau, or asymptotic limit, of the subsidence. All parameters were compared using a one way ANOVA with a Tukey posthoc test for determination of statistical difference (α 3 ̆c 0. 05) between designs. Results and Discussion: All implants displayed an exponential relationship with respect to the number of applied cycles. Significant differences among all three designs were determined for initial subsidence Y 0 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and <b>subsidence</b> <b>limit</b> (plateau) (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). For both parameters, the endplate-sparing titanium device displayed the least subsidence when compared with the other designs. The subsidence rate K displayed a statistically reduced rate for the endplate-sparing titanium device when compared with the threaded or PEEK designs. (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Clinically, such a condition results in a slow and gradual settling of the titanium implant upon the endplate surface. The PEEK implant displayed a more rapid and greater subsidence than either the endplate-sparing or threaded titanium designs. Conclusions: Under continuous loading, an endplate-sparing titanium device displayed significantly reduced initial and final subsidence and subsidence rate when compared with threaded and PEEK designs. The clinical implication of these results is that implant material modulus is not the sole determinant for subsidence.

During {{the first half}} of September 16, several F0 tornadoes touched down across the Southeast. By the afternoon, downstream <b>subsidence</b> <b>limited</b> thunderstorm activity; however, as the day wore on, sufficient warm, moist air from the Gulf Stream and breaks in cloud cover allowed for CAPE values to rise. Extensive convective banding to the north and east of the storm continued to encounter extreme levels of helicity.

A review of the occurrence and development of land subsidence in Xi’an in past 50 years is given in this article. The characteristics of land subsidence in Xi'an were analyzed from time-space distribution, the development of subsidence center and its relationship with the withdrawal of groundwater. The development and characteristics of land subsidence indicate that the withdrawal of groundwater especially the confined groundwater is the major cause of land subsidence in Xi’an.

Our results show that a constant subsidence rate accurately reproduces the observed geometries, whereas a varying subsidence rate reproduces them only if the acceleration of <b>subsidence</b> is <b>limited.</b> At this time-scale, a third-order eustatic curve is also reappraised: a higher resolution curve (built using δ 18 O measurements) gives a more realistic restitution of our stratigraphic markers.

40|$|This work explores {{in detail}} {{synoptic}} and mesoscale features of Hurricane Catarina during its life cycle from a decaying baroclinic wave to a tropical depression that underwent tropical transition (TT) {{and finally to}} a Category 2 hurricane at landfall over Santa Catarina State coast, southern Brazil. This unique system caused 11 deaths mostly off the Brazilian coast and an estimated half billion dollars in damage {{in a matter of}} a few hours on 28 March 2004. Although the closest meteorological station available was tens of kilometres away from the eye, in situ meteorological measurements provided by a work-team sent to the area where the eye made landfall unequivocally reproduces the tropical signature with category 2 strength, adding to previous analysis where this data was not available. Further analyses are based mostly on remote sensing data available at the time of the event. A classic dipole blocking set synoptic conditions for Hurricane Catarina to develop, dynamically contributing to the low wind shear observed. On the other hand, on its westward transit, large scale <b>subsidence</b> <b>limited</b> its strength and vertical development. Catarina had relatively cool SST conditions, but this was mitigated by favourable air-sea fluxes leading to latent heat release-driven processes during the mature phase. The ocean`s dynamic topography also suggested the presence of nearby warm core rings which may have facilitated the transition and post-transition intensification. Since there were no records of such a system at least in the past 30 years and given that SSTs were generally below 26 degrees C and vertical shear was usually strong, despite all satellite data available, the system was initially classified as an extratropical cyclone. Here we hypothesise that this categorization was based oil inadequate regional scale model outputs which did not account for the importance of the latent heat fluxes over the ocean. Hurricane Catarina represents a dramatic event on weather systems in South America. It has attracted attention worldwide and poses questions as whether or not it is a symptom of global warming.

40|$|The Vera Basin {{is used as}} a {{case study}} to examine the {{structural}} evolution and sedimentary response of a basin undergoing uplift and inversion during the Plio-Pleistocene. Particular emphasis is placed on the drainage evolution during that period. Located within the Internal zone of the Betic Cordilleras, the Vera Basin is defined within a large left-lateral shear zone and has evolved as a reponse to isostatic uplift from nappe emplacemem during the Oligocene, and by regional compressive tectonics. Since basin formation during the Seravallian, sedimentary fill has been dominantly marine. During the Plio-Pleistocene a switch from marine to continental conditions occurred. These sediments (Cuevas, Espiritu Santo and Salmcr 6 n Formations) represent the final stages of basin fill and form the focus of this study. The Cuevas Formation represents an early Pliocene marine transgression within the Vera Basin. Early sedimentation infilled a pronounced submarine topography produced by a rapid laie Miocene fall in sca-Icvel. A broad, shallow shelf platform area existed which opened out to the Pliocene Mediterranean Sea towards the east. Along the northern and western basin margins, wave dominated shorelines were formed. Structural activity was confined to low amounts of basin <b>subsidence</b> and <b>limited</b> left lateral strike-slip movement along the Palomares Fault Zone.

Nearly half of all soil and building movements occurred prior to installation of the first tie-back, even when conservative practices were applied.

40|$|Because of {{the deep}} glacial incision, the Lower Tagus Valley hosts a {{sedimentary}} record since ∼ 20 000 cal BP, making this a unique site along the European Atlantic margin with respect to palaeogeographic and sea level changes. Based on nine cross-sections and 55 radiocarbon dates together with a newly created relative sea level curve, we constructed five palaeogeographic maps of the infill of the Lower Tagus Valley since ∼ 20 000 cal BP. We illustrate that relative sea level rise and fluvial sediment supply were the prime forcing factors determining the depositional history and palaeogeographic changes. Around 20 000 cal BP a deeply incised braided river existed, which was directly connected to the ocean across the narrow continental shelf. After that (∼ 12 000 cal BP) the gradually moister and warmer climate caused a change to a single-channel river. During the following period (12 000 - 7000 cal BP) relative sea level rise resulted in a transgression in the Lower Tagus Valley {{and the establishment of}} extensive tidal environments. After relative sea level rise had ended (∼ 7000 cal BP) the valley was progressively filled by a fluvial wedge and tidally influenced bayhead delta. Since ∼ 1000 cal BP the valley-fill history was dominated by increased sediment input due to human-induced degradation of catchment slopes. Generally, climate was of subordinate importance during the entire studied period, merely causing a single-channel river resulting from the change from the cold Heinrich event 1 to the temperate Bölling-Allerød interstadial. Despite the tectonic activity in the region, neotectonic uplift or <b>subsidence</b> was <b>limited,</b> as supported by the horizontal relative sea level curve since ∼ 7000 cal BP. Neotectonics played a minor role due to the large distance from the Fennoscandian ice sheet and the narrow continental shelf, which prohibited strong glacio- and hydro-isostatic movements. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the first times after its completion (1606) the structure has exhibited evidences of instability, due to foundation subsiding and/or seismic activity. Structural and geotechnical countermeasures have been undertaken on the Tempio and its surroundings from the 17 th century until recent times. Until now a truly satisfactory analysis of the overall deformation and attitude of the building has not been performed, since the existing surveys record the overhangs of the pillars, the crack pattern or the <b>subsidence</b> over <b>limited</b> time spans. Describing the attitude of the whole church is in fact a complex operation due to the architectural character of the building, consisting of four apses (three polygonal and one semicircular) covered with half domes, which surround the central area with the large dome.

40|$|The time of {{deposition}} of the Pretoria Group between 2. 32 and 2. 06 Ga on South Africa’s Kaapvaal Craton {{was characterized by}} the first major increase in atmospheric oxygen. It was accompanied by the extrusion of significant thicknesses of volcanic deposits, namely the Bushy Bend lavas of the Timeball Hill Formation, the Hekpoort Formation and the Machadodorp Volcanic Member of the Silverton Formation, marking the three major volcanic events within the Transvaal Supergroup which {{are thought to be}} precursors to the succeeding Bushveld Complex magmatism. The Bushy Bend Lava Member of the Timeball Hill Formation is characterized by subaqueous basaltic-andesitic fissure eruptions with fumarolic activity and probably minor subaerial explosive eruptions in the hinterland of the Transvaal Supergroup basin. The subaerial volcanism of the Hekpoort Formation appears to have been dominated by fissure eruptions with a preponderance of lava flows and locally important pyroclastic material. Intermittent hiatuses in volcanism were marked by local lacustrine shale deposition. Finally, the Machadodorp Lava Member can be interpreted as the deposits of several seamounts aligned along a fissure, probably within an extensional environment. The geodynamic control inferred for the evolution of the Pretoria Group basin encompasses two cycles of prerift uplift, subsequent mechanical rifting and long lived thermal <b>subsidence.</b> The <b>limited</b> extent of the Bushy Bend lavas in the south of the Pretoria Group depository attest to the likelihood that volcanism accompanying the first rifting event was short-lived. In contrast, the second rifting cycle postulated for the Pretoria Group basin has a strong association with widespread and large scale volcanism of the Hekpoort-Ongeluk flood basalts, which may have been plume-related.

40|$|The {{stress on}} water supply systems is {{increasing}}, among others due to pollution, increasing demands, source depletion and climate change. More sustainable solutions {{with respect to}} water supply will decrease the stress. Rainwater harvesting {{can be one of}} these sustainable solutions. Depending on the characteristics of the rainwater harvesting system it can increase water availability and limit urban flooding and erosion by water retention. Furthermore it can <b>limit</b> <b>subsidence</b> by <b>limiting</b> groundwater extraction or by increasing infiltration. Finally rainwater is a relatively clean and free water source. This research investigates the possibilities for domestic rainwater harvesting in an off-grid urban area in Serang (Indonesia). Current water infrastructure in this area is found insufficient. Technical, economical, legal, social and cultural aspects are tackled in this research. This is done by conducting semi-structured interviews, creating a conceptual model of a rainwater harvesting system, and by doing water quality measurements, cost calculations and literature research. While rainwater harvesting is not preferred socially, use is accepted in the case study area. Also, no relevant restrictions are present regarding rainwater use on national level. In the analysed existing rainwater harvesting tanks the water quality meet the WHO guidelines for all measured parameters, except microbial contamination. Suggested treatment steps include first flush, cloth filtration and boiling. Boiling is solely required for potable purposes and first flush water can be used for low end purposes. Furthermore, closed tanks or small fish can prevent mosquitos. Risk groups, including young children, elderly, people with weakened immune systems or skin injuries should be careful with the use rainwater. Depending on the roof size, tank size and operating scenario a certain tap flow can be expected from a rainwater harvesting system. It is found that for a tank of 2 m 3 and a roof of 100 m 2 an average tap flow of between 116 and 186 liter/day can be expected. This tank size has the lowest water price per cubic meter (between 0. 40 - 1. 11 euro per m 3), in case a realistic roof size is connected. Payback periods were found to vary largely depending on the assumption regarding the fresh water requirement, and the operating scenario. Payback periods are around 2 and 8 years in case a fresh water need of 80 and 20 liter a family a day is taken into account. Payback periods decrease for larger fresh water needs, {{due to the fact that}} more of the expensive bottled water is replaced. In this case yearly savings based on investment increases. This research shows that rainwater harvesting is a suitable technique for the improvement of both quality and quantity of the water supply in Serang. Focus can be on the awareness, acceptance and knowledge of the population. Small changes can improve the operation of existing systems. Systems should be closed, contain overflow, tap and first flush. Harvest can increase largely by connecting the entire roof, and by considering the operating scenario carefully. Governmental institutions could help the local population with these improvements and by water quality measurements. Scientific research can focus on the remaining health risk related to rainwater use, methods for quality control of systems, constructions to bridge the large investment costs or improvements of the conceptual model used.

40|$|In the Canadian Western Boreal Plain (WBP), {{wetlands}} (ponds and peatlands) comprise up to 50 % of {{the landscape}} and represent unique habitat where summer precipitation is often outpaced by evapotranspiration and hillslope groundwater position does not follow topography.

This paper quantifies the amount and effect of seasonal subsidence in a riparian peatland in the Utikuma Lake region in north-central Alberta, Canada. Results demonstrate that the deep and poorly decomposed peat deposits are resistant to compression, and that thick (and persistent) ground frost hinders pore collapse (shrinkage) above the water table until late summer when the ground has thawed.

The ability to predict surface subsidence is important for mine planning, operational hazard assessment and evaluation of environmental and socio-economic impacts. Owing to problems of scale and lack of access, the fundamental understanding of the complex rock mass response leading to <b>subsidence</b> is <b>limited</b> as are current subsidence prediction capabilities. Through the use of an integrated FEM/DEM-DFN modelling technique this thesis presents a new approach to simulation of block caving induced surface subsidence allowing physically realistic simulation of subsidence development from caving initiation to final subsidence deformation. As part of the current research, a fundamental issue in modelling, the selection of representative equivalent continuum rock mass modelling parameters, is investigated and a procedure for calibration of modelling parameters devised. Utilizing a series of conceptual numerical experiments our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and the role of the factors controlling block caving subsidence development is investigated. Valuable insights gained from this work are summarized in a preliminary subsidence classification and an influence assessment matrix of the governing factors. These are intended as an aid to engineering judgment for decision makers at the pre-feasibility and mine design stages. This study also addresses one of the most challenging problems in mining rock engineering - the interaction between block cave mining and a large overlying open pit, focusing on caving induced step-path failure initialization. Using a novel approach to modelling data analysis a clear link between caving propagation, step-path failure development within the slope, and the resultant surface subsidence is established. In addition, FEM/DEM-DFN modelling is applied to the preliminary analysis of the block caving triggered slope failure at Palabora open pit. This research represents a valuable contribution to block caving geomechanics and is a major step forward in the understanding of complex block caving subsidence phenomena, paving the way to more reliable assessment of caving induced subsidence deformations...|$|R

This has been linked to enhanced ozone photochemical production and subsidence under cloud-free anticyclonic conditions. The Eastern Mediterranean region has among the highest levels of background tropospheric ozone around the globe and it can be considered as a global air pollution hotspot. A 12 yr climatological analysis (1998 – 2009) of free tropospheric ozone was carried out over the region based on ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA-interim reanalysis data and simulations with the EMAC (ECHAM 5 -MESSy for Atmospheric Chemistry) atmospheric chemistry climate model. EMAC is nudged towards the ECMWF analysis data and includes a stratospheric ozone tracer. A characteristic summertime pool with high ozone concentrations is found in the middle troposphere over the Eastern Mediterranean/Middle East (EMME) by ERA-interim ozone data, which is supported by Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) satellite ozone data and simulations with EMAC. The enhanced ozone over the EMME is a robust feature, propagating down to lower free tropospheric levels. The investigation of ozone in relation to potential vorticity and water vapour and the stratospheric ozone tracer indicates that the dominant mechanism causing the free tropospheric ozone pool is downward transport from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere associated with the enhanced <b>subsidence</b> and the <b>limited</b> outflow transport that dominates the summertime EMME circulation.

40|$|The Albertine Graben is a Tertiary intra-continental rift that {{developed}} on the Precambrian orogenic belt of the African Craton. It forms the northern {{termination of the}} Western arm of the East African Rift System (EARS) (Figure 1). It stretches from the border between Uganda and Sudan in the north, to Lake Edward in the south. The available geological and geophysical data indicate that rifting could have been initiated during the late Oligocene or Early Miocene. The tectonic evolution of the Albertine Graben is little understood. It does not fit well with traditional models of rifted continental basins defined by discrete basin bounding faults opposed by a low gradient flexural margin especially over Lake Albert. Similar amounts of displacement on the eastern border faults and western border faults produce nearly a full graben structure that gently dips towards the west, in contrast to half graben structures of the Tanganyika and Malawi rifts. The available geological and geophysical data indicate that the Albertine Graben has gone through extensional and compressional episodes resulting {{in a variety of}} structures. Deformation and prevalence of flower structures in the shallow sedimentary sections in some basins in the graben indicate that the neo-tectonic processes are compressional.

Indirect {{decompression}} of {{the neural}} structures through interbody distraction and fusion in the lumbar spine is feasible, but cage <b>subsidence</b> may <b>limit</b> {{maintenance of the}} initial decompression. the influence of interbody cage size on subsidence and symptoms in minimally invasive lateral interbody fusion is heretofore unreported. the authors report the rate of cage subsidence after lateral interbody fusion, examine the clinical effects, and present a subsidence classification scale. Methods. the study was performed as an institutional review board approved prospective, nonrandomized, comparative, single-center radiographic and clinical evaluation. Stand-alone short-segment (1 - or 2 -level) lateral lumbar interbody fusion was investigated with 12 months of postoperative follow-up. Two groups were compared. Forty-six patients underwent treatment at 61 lumbar levels with standard interbody cages (18 mm anterior/posterior dimension), and 28 patients underwent treatment at 37 lumbar levels with wide cages (22 mm). Standing lateral radiographs were used to measure segmental lumbar lordosis, disc height, and rate of subsidence. Subsidence was classified using the following scale: Grade 0, 0 %- 24 % loss of postoperative disc height; Grade I, 25 %- 49 %; Grade II, 50 %- 74 %; and Grade III, 75 %- 100 %. Fusion status was assessed on CT scanning, and pain and disability were assessed using the visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index. Complications and reoperations were recorded. Results. Pain and disability improved similarly in both groups. While significant gains in segmental lumbar lordosis and disc height were observed overall, the standard group experienced less improvement due to the higher rate of interbody graft subsidence. A difference {{in the rate of}} subsidence between the groups was evident at 6 weeks (p = 0. 027), 3 months (p = 0. 042), and 12 months (p = 0. 047). At 12 months, 70 % in the standard group and 89 % in the wide group had Grade 0 or I subsidence, and 30 % in the standard group and 11 % in wide group had Grade II or III subsidence. Subsidence was detected early (6 weeks), at which point it was correlated with transient clinical worsening, although progression of subsidence was not observed after the 6 -week time point. Moreover, subsidence occurred predominantly (68 %) in the inferior endplate. Fusion rate was not affected by cage dimension (p > 0. 999) or by incidence of subsidence (p = 0. 383). Conclusions. Wider cages avoid subsidence and better restore segmental lordosis in stand-alone lateral interbody fusion. Cage subsidence is identified early in follow-up and can be accessed using the proposed classification scale.

40|$|Medicine Lake Volcano is a Quaternary {{shield volcano}} {{located in a}} tectonically complex and active zone at the {{transition}} between the Basin and Range Province and the Cascade Range of the Pacific Province. The volcano is topped by a 7 x 12 km elliptical depression surrounded by a discontinuous constructional ring of basaltic to rhyolitic lava flows. This thesis explores {{the possibility that the}} depression may have formed due to regional extension (rift basin) or dextral shear (pull-apart basin) rather than through caldera collapse and examines the relationship between regional tectonics and localized volcanism. Existing data consisting of temperature and magnetotelluric surveys, alteration mineral studies, and core logging were compiled and supplemented with additional core logging, field observations, and fault striae studies in paleomagnetically oriented core samples. These results were then synthesized with regional fault data from existing maps and databases. Faulting patterns near the caldera, extension directions derived from fault striae P and T axes, and three-dimensional temperature and alteration mineral models are consistent with slip across arcuate ring faults related to magma chamber deflation during flank eruptions and/or a pyroclastic eruption at about 180 ka. These results are not consistent with a rift or pull-apart basin. <b>Limited</b> <b>subsidence</b> {{can be attributed to the}} relatively small volume of ash-flow tuff released by the only known major pyroclastic eruption and is inconsistent with the observed topographic relief. The additional relief can be explained by constructional volcanism. Striae from unoriented and oriented core, augmented by striae measurements in outcrop suggest that Walker Lane dextral shear, which can be reasonably projected from the southeast, has probably propagated into the Medicine Lake area. Most volcanic vents across Medicine Lake Volcano strike north-south, suggesting they are controlled by crustal weakness related to Basin and Range extension. Interaction of dextral shear, Basin and Range extension, and the zone of crustal weakness expressed as the Mount Shasta-Medicine Lake volcanic highland controlled the location and initiation of Medicine Lake Volcano at about 500 ka...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} of the troposphere is constant {{over the long run}} because energy lost by radiation is compensated for by subsidence warming. Compensating for radiative cooling requires that the troposphere subside at a velocity of approximately 500 m d- 1, corresponding to subsidence mass fluxes of 5 kPa d- 1 near the bottom and 1 kPa d- 1 {{near the top of the}} troposphere. The mass flux decreasing in the upward direction results from surface air rising to a range of levels. The warming occurs where the air subsides and not where the latent heat of water vapour is released. The subsidence tends to occur where the atmosphere is coldest and easiest to compress. The warming produced by intense updrafts is not limited to the local area and can be distributed over the whole globe. The warming can occurs in areas remote from the updraft such as the rainless sub-tropical regions and the polar regions. The <b>subsidence</b> velocity is <b>limited</b> by warming because subsidence velocities greater than 500 m d- 1 increase local temperature causing the subsidence to take place elsewhere. A subsidence velocity of 500 m d- 1 (0. 006 m s- 1) is much lower than the typical updrafts velocity of 1 m s- 1. Mass balance limits the fractional area of the updrafts to about 1 % thereby restricting possible flow regimes. There can be no classic Hadley direct or and Ferrel indirect circulation cells with upflow and downflow of approximately equal areas. A general circulation scheme consisting of fast penetrative drafts and slowly subsiding layers is proposed. The paper analyses how energy is transferred from the updrafts to the subsiding layers. The convection process transfers energy for rising air to descending air, from wherever the energy is received to wherever it radiated to space. Heat of compression is shown to be effective at transferring energy both upward and poleward...|$|R

Teleseismic (Benetatos et al., 2004) and regional (Zahradnik et al., 2004) waveform modelling has revealed the multiple (mainly double) source character of the mainshock, and our preferred model indicates a) the earthquake occurred as two distinct events, separated in space (40 km) and time (14 sec), b) the moment was released in three distinct patches (asperities). The first patch of moment released is located underneath the western coast of Lefkada Island confined in a small area (25 × 10 km 2) and at depths below 12 km. The second patch of moment release is located further south in the sea, close to the northern coast of Cephalonia Island and is confined in an even smaller area (15 × 10 km 2). The third patch of moment released occurred in the area between the two fault segments considered, which corresponds to {{the intersection of the}} Lefkada and Cephalonia Segments of CTFZ. A maximum slip of 34 cm was observed on the north segment beneath Lefkada Island. In order to obtain satisfactory fit to the teleseismic body waves the contribution from subevents on both segments has to be considered. Shakemaps of peak ground velocities (PGV), simulated from the slip model around the epicentral region, especially on the western coast of Lefkada Island, are in good agreement with the distribution of reported damage and intensity level of VII.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1289 on 14. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) The Vera Basin {{is used as}} a case study to examine the structural evolution and sedimentary response of a basin undergoing uplift and inversion during the Plio-Pleistocene. Particular emphasis is placed on the drainage evolution during that period. Located within the Internal zone of the Betic Cordilleras, the Vera Basin is defined within a large left-lateral shear zone and has evolved as a reponse to isostatic uplift from nappe emplacement during the Oligocene, and by regional compressive tectonics. Since basin formation during the Seravallian, sedimentary fill has been dominantly marine. During the Plio-Pleistocene a switch from marine to continental conditions occurred. These sediments (Cuevas, Espiritu Santo and Salmcr 6 n Formations) represent the final stages of basin fill and form the focus of this study. The Cuevas Formation represents an early Pliocene marine transgression within the Vera Basin. Early sedimentation infilled a pronounced submarine topography produced by a rapid laie Miocene fall in sca- level. A broad, shallow shelf platform area existed which opened out to the Pliocene Mediterranean Sea towards the east. Along the northern and western basin margins, wave dominated shorelines were formed. Structural activity was confined to low amounts of basin <b>subsidence</b> and <b>limited</b> left lateral strike-slip movement along the Palomares Fault Zone. The Espiritu Santo Formation marks a major palaeogcographic reorganisation and the final marine phases of the Vera Basin during the mid to late Pliocene. Unsteady strike-slip movement along the Palomarcs fault zone on the eastern basin margin partially enclosed the Vera Basin by northwards movement of a structurally detached landmass. Gilbert-type fan-delta bodies prograded westwards from the landmass (Sierra Almagrera), infilling the central region of the basin. Early fan-delta sediments were reworked into shoreline areas along the western and northern basin margins. Western margin shorelines retreated northwards as a response to partial enclosure and a gradual lowering of sea-level. Late stages of the Espiritu Santo Formation, saw a fan-delta body prograde from the northern basin margins. Interaction between the basinal and marginal fan-delta bodies enclosed the northern region of the Vera Basin. A swamp/mangrove environment developed within the enclosed northern basin area suggesting a humid, sub-tropical climntc. Continental conditions were established during Salmer 6 n Formation times in the late Pliocene. Along the western and northern basin margins, the retreating Pliocene shorelines provided a topography onto which the primary consequent drainage network developed. Three separate drainage systems can be identified on the basis of clast assemblages, palaeocurrents, depositional style and morphological expression. Early deposition was characterised by the progradation of alluvial fans of two drainage systems (Cuevas & Jauro), sourced from the northern and western basin margins. Distal areas of the northern fan system intercalated with an evaporitic playa lake. A third drainage system in the northwest of the basin (Salmeron) developed within a topographic low between the two fan systems. An increase in structural activity {{towards the end of the}} Salmeron Formation was characterised by a basin wide phase of north-south compression. Uplift and extensional faulting lead to abandonment of the primary drainage network. Fan entrenchment and minor rerouting of sediment supplies marked the establishment of a new secondary consequent drainage network during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene drainage network records the progressive dissection of the Vera Basin as a response to ongoing regional epeirogenic uplift. During this post-inversion phase the Rios Antas, Almanzora and Aguas developed respectively along the western, northern and southern basin margins as a series of braided streams. Distal, coastal areas of this drainage network are recorded by a series of Pleistocene shoreline sequences which developed as a response to fluctuating sea-level during the Pleistocene glacial and inlerglacial periods. Early Pleistocene proximal parts of the drainage network are well preserved. Distal parts of the Pleistocene fluvial system display limited evidence for interaction between the drainage network and shoreline sequences. This lack of preservation relates to the high energy, wave dominated deposilional setting of the Pleistocene shoreline areas which reworked fluvial sediment inputs into the shoreline environment. The Plio-Pleistocene evolution of the Vera Basin, and in particular the development of the fluvial system during this period has been highly complex. Despite the importance of sea-level and climatic controls, tectonic activity during this period of basin inversion has been the dominant control on the positioning of the drainage networks, depositional styles and sediment supply...|$|R
40|$|Subsidence {{caused by}} {{extraction}} of hydrocarbons and solution salt mining is a sensitive {{issue in the}} Netherlands. An extensive legal, technical and organisational framework is in place to ensure a high probability that such subsidence will stay within predefined limits. The key question is: how much subsidence is acceptable and at which rate? And: {{how can it be}} reliably assured that (future) subsidence will stay within these limits? To address the issue for the Wadden Sea area, the concept of ‘effective subsidence capacity’ is used. To determine the ‘effective subsidence capacity’, the maximum volumetric rate of relative sea-level rise, that can be accommodated in the long term, without environmental harm, is established first. The volume of sediment that can be transported and deposited by nature into the tidal basin where the subsidence is expected, ultimately determines this ‘limit of acceptable average subsidence rate’. The capability of the tidal basins to ‘capture’ sediment over the lunar cycle period of 18. 6 years is the overall rate-determining step. Effective subsidence capacity is then the maximum average subsidence rate available for planning of human activities. It is obtained by subtracting the subsidence volume rate ‘consumed’ by natural relative subsidence in the area (sealevel rise plus natural shallow compaction) from the total long-term acceptable <b>subsidence</b> volume rate <b>limit.</b> In the operational procedure for mining companies, six-years-average expectation values of subsidence rates are used to calculate the maximum allowable production rates. This is done under the provision that production will be reduced or halted if the expected or actual subsidence rate (natural + man induced) is likely to exceed the <b>limit</b> of acceptable <b>subsidence.</b> Monitoring and management schemes ensure that predicted (6 -year average) and actual (18. 6 -year average) subsidence rates stay within the <b>limit</b> of acceptable <b>subsidence</b> rate and that no damage is caused to the protected nature. A GPS based early warning system is used for early detection of unexpected behaviour. In support of SSM (State Supervision of Mines, the government regulator), TNO-AGE (an independent government advisory group) applies an independent Bayesian statistical analysis of all data, as they become available, to calculate the probability of scenario’s under which future subsidence will exceed the defined limits. It is external to the operator’s annual measurement and control loop and ensures that preventive actions can be taken in time in case such scenarios emerge. Regular communication keeps the authorities and the general public informed {{on the use of the}} effective subsidence capacity to demonstrate that the actual average subsidence rate stays strictly within the defined bounds and that, from a scientific point of view, there is no reasonable doubt that damage to the tidal system will not occur now or in the future...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{sections}} of Harris and Montgomery counties located North and Northeast of Houston use groundwater almost exclusively. These areas have witnessed substantial {{population growth and}} associated increases in water demand. In 1999 approximately 60 % of potable water in Houston and its adjoining communities was produced from surface water. The remaining approximately 40 % was derived from groundwater. However, the "Subsidence District" which is the authority responsible for granting groundwater permits has mandated that groundwater use needs to be decreased to 20 % {{within the next few}} years so as to <b>limit</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Pipelines are not available to distribute purified water from the existing surface water treatment plants located in the South and East of Houston to the Northern areas that actually require additional water. Because Lake Houston is located in the geographical area of interest and is a surface water source, the City of Houston is interested in developing it for its future water needs. Additionally, a favorable hydraulic gradient exists from the Lake to the proposed service areas in Harris and Montgomery counties. Federal regulations such as the Stage II of the Disinfectant/Disinfection By-Products Rule (1) and the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (2) are expected to be promulgated in the near future. These rules are anticipated to introduce more stringent maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for total trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), possibly introduce new MCLs for individual species of THMs and HAAs, reduce turbidity levels, and enhance inactivation/removal requirements for Cryptosporidium. (Cryptosporidium was the causative protozoan for the more than 400, 000 cases of acute gastrointestinal disease in Milwaukee, WI in March 1993.) The treatment processes in the City of Houston's existing water purification plants are not expected to be sufficient in meeting these anticipated regulations. Therefore, both regulatory requirements and engineering considerations point towards Lake Houston as an attractive surface water source for the next water purification plant to supply potable water to the City and its adjoining communities. However, water quality in Lake Houston can be characterized as being poor with high concentrations of turbidity, color, total organic carbon (TOC), nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, etc. (3). Pressure-driven membrane processes can be employed as effective barriers against a wide range of contaminants including particles, turbidity, protozoan cysts and oocysts, bacteria, viruses, color, organic carbon, disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors, and dissolved metals. Additionally, microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) pretreatment may be necessary to reduce fouling rates and increase chemical cleaning intervals during surface water nanofiltration (NF) (4). Therefore, an integrated membrane system employing MF or UF pretreatment to NF is expected to be an important treatment candidate for Lake Houston water. Nanofiltration (NF) membranes typically operate at pressures less than 100 psi and are capable of high rejections of natural organic matter (NOM) and precursors to disinfection by-products (DBP) including trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) (5 - 8), many of which are suspected carcinogens, mutagens, or teratogens...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the lateral variability of stratigraphic sequences under changing conditions of subsidence and/or sediment supply. Changes in sediment supply, subsidence and absolute sea-level result {{in at least}} three modes of distortion of a depositional sequence. Our study of a case history from offshore West Africa, together with numerical analysis, provides insights as to how changes in subsidence and sedimentation may be extracted from the stratigraphic record. We analysed a listric fault/raft system, located on the Congo­Cabonda margin, resulting from gravity-induced extension of a mixed siliciclastic/carbonate platform sequence. Within this system, quantitative analysis was carried out on high-resolution stratigraphic sequences of five wells, as well as on their geometry, on the relative duration of prograding compared to retrograding half-cycles, and on the timing of the inversion of these half-cycle trends. Parameters were defined to quantify the distortion of depositional sequences that results from either (i) spatial variations in subsidence and sedimentation rates ("spatial distortion" D), or (ii) superposition of two frequencies of stratigraphic cyclicity ("cycle superposition distortion" D'). Using a numerical model, we investigate the distortion of depositional sequences showing two superposed scales of cyclicity, in response to spatial and temporal variations of subsidence and sedimentation rate. We show that: (i) Spatial variations in subsidence rate can result in modification of the timing of trend inversion: the onset of progradation may be delayed and the onset of retrogradation may occur earlier in the more rapidly subsiding areas. (ii) The sedimentation rate can modulate the amount of distortion related to <b>subsidence</b> by amplifying, <b>limiting,</b> compensating or even inverting the temporal offset. (iii) Spatial variations in sedimentation rate alone may also induce changes in the timing of trend inversion: the onset of progradation may take place sooner and the onset of retrogradation may be delayed in the area showing the fastest sedimentation rate. (iv) The amount of distortion depends not only on the sedimentation and subsidence rates, but also on the maximum rate of sea-level change causing the depositional sequence, that is, it depends on the period and amplitude of the sequence. The faster the sea-level change (i. e. the higher the frequency and the larger the amplitude), the weaker is the distortion produced. (v) In terms of resulting time lag, numerical analysis shows that the distortion of high frequency depositional sequences (genetic units) is negligible. These sequences can therefore be safely used to correlate time lines across the studied area, whereas use of lower frequency sequences with significant spatial distortion could lead to significant errors in correlation. We use these results to interpret the distortion observed in the case study, in terms of temporal and spatial variations of subsidence and sedimentation rates. In this case, complex temporal and spatial variations in subsidence and sedimentation rates lead to variations of the distortion of stacks of genetic unit. This distortion produced difference in timing of the onset and duration of the inversion of trend within prograding and retrograding half-cycles...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution seismic {{reflection}} {{data from}} the east Coromandel coast, New Zealand, provide details of the sequence stratigraphy beneath an autochthonous, wave dominated inner shelf margin during the late Quaternary (0 - 140 ka). Since c. 1 Ma, the shelf has experienced <b>limited</b> <b>subsidence</b> and fluvial sediment input, producing a depositional regime characterised by extensive reworking of coastal and shelf sediments during glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations. It appears that only one complete fifth-order (c. 100 000 yr) depositional sequence is preserved beneath the inner shelf, the late Pleistocene Waihi Sequence, suggesting any earlier Quaternary sequences were mainly cannibalised into successively younger sequences. The predominantly Holocene-age Whangamata Sequence is also evident in seismic data and modern coastal deposits, and represents an incomplete depositional sequence {{in its early stages}} of formation. A prominent aspect of the sequence stratigraphy off parts of the east Coromandel coast is the presence of forced regressive deposits (FRDs) within the regressive systems tract (RST) of the late Pleistocene Waihi Sequence. The FRDs are interpreted to represent regressive barrier-shoreface sands that were sourced from erosion and onshore reworking of underlying Pleistocene sediments during the period of slow falling sea level from isotope stages 5 to 2 (c. 112 - 18 ka). The RST is volumetrically the most significant depositional component of the Waihi Sequence; the regressive deposits form a 15 - 20 m thick, sharp-based, tabular seismic unit that downsteps and progrades continuously across the inner shelf. The sequence boundary for the Waihi Sequence is placed at the most prominent, regionally correlative, and chronostratigraphically significant surface, namely an erosional unconformity characterised in many areas by large incised valleys that was generated above the RST. This unconformity is interpreted as a surface of maximum subaerial erosion generated during the last glacial lowstand (c. 18 ka). Although the base of the RST is associated with a prominent regressive surface of erosion, this is not used as the sequence boundary as it is highly diachronous and difficult to identify and correlate where FRDs are not developed. The previous highstand deposits are limited to subaerial barrier deposits preserved behind several modern Holocene barriers along the coast, while the transgressive systems tract is preserved locally as incised-valley fill deposits beneath the regressive surface of erosion {{at the base of the}} RST. Many documented late Pleistocene RSTs have been actively sourced from fluvial systems feeding the shelf and building basinward-thickening, often stacked wedges of FRDs, for which the name allochthonous FRDs is suggested. The Waihi Sequence RST is unusual in that it appears to have been sourced predominantly from reworking of underlying shelf sediments, and thus represents an autochthonous FRD. Autochthonous FRDs are also present on the Forster-Tuncurry shelf in southeast Australia, and may be a common feature in other shelf settings with low subsidence and low sediment supply rates, provided shelf gradients are not too steep, and an underlying source of unconsolidated shelf sediments is available to source FRDs. The preservation potential of such autochthonous FRDs in ancient deposits is probably low given that they are likely to be cannibalised during subsequent sea-level falls...|$|R
40|$|Se estudió una sucesión sedimentaria que aflora en el sudeste de la Cuenca Neuquina, en el departamento El Cuy (Río Negro). La misma incluye a las formaciones Huincul y Lisandro que integran el Subgrupo Río Limay (Grupo Neuquén), y han sido asignadas al Cenomaniano- Turoniano. Se identificaron once litofacies de origen fluvial, tres litofacies de naturaleza eólica y dos litofacies volcaniclásticas. A partir de los agrupamientos en unidades genéticamente relacionadas se definieron siete elementos fluviales de intracanal, cuatro de planicie de inundación y cuatro eólicos. La distribución espacial y relaciones entre los elementos arquitecturales ha permitido reconocer sistemas fluviales agradantes de alta sinuosidad (SF-I y II), un sistema de abanico {{terminal}} (SAT) y campos de médanos barjanoides (SE). El análisis estratigráfico-secuencial permitió definir cinco Secuencias a partir de las relaciones espaciales y temporales de los elementos arquitecturales mayores y de la determinación de superficies estratigráficamente significativas. La base de la Formación Huincul está representada por el SF-I, caracterizado por un sistema de alta sinuosidad, con baja relación canales/planicie de inundación y abundantes depósitos de desbordes. Este tramo de la secuencia se interpreta como el Cortejo de Alta Acomodación (AA) de la Secuencia I (S-I). El sector cuspidal de la unidad está integrado por un sistema similar pero con una alta relación canal/planicie de inundación y constituye el Cortejo de Baja Acomodación (BA) de la Secuencia II (S-II). Se propone que la depositación de la Formación Huincul tuvo lugar bajo condiciones climáticas cálidas con un régimen de estacionalidad marcado. La Formación Lisandro se inicia con depósitos de un sistema distributario proximal de abanico terminal (SAT) que representan el Cortejo AA de S-II. De aquí en adelante es notoria la recurrencia de SE, caracterizando los Cortejos BA y una sucesión desde cuenca de inundación a distributarios proximales de SAT, integrando los Cortejos AA de las secuencias S-II, III, IV y V. La unidad se depositó bajo condiciones climáticas semiáridas permanentes. Las unidades estratigráficas estudiadas se consideran de carácter sinorogénico, con un control tectónico significativo en la definición del espacio de acomodación y un volcanismo principalmente activo durante la sedimentación de la Formación Huincul. La Formación Lisandro corresponde a un período de abrupto incremento en la tasa de subsidencia en la Cuenca Neuquina. In the Cuy Department, Rio Negro Province (Fig. 1), {{there are}} outcrops of the Late Cretaceous continental deposits of the Subgroup Rio Limay (Fig. 2), in virtually continuous exposures that allow detail studies and {{exploration of the}} architecture of the sedimentary bodies. This contribution presents the results of the sedimentological study and sequential stratigraphic analysis for the depositional period of the Huincul and Lisandro formations (Subgroup Río Limay). The outcrops appear in the Planicie de Rentaría (Area A), with continuous sections longer than 3 km and Anfiteatro (Area B) with outcrops of more than 5 km (Fig. 1). In these areas we made detailed sedimentological profiles (Fig. 3), we described and interpreted lithofacies and architectural elements employing photograms and we defined stratigraphicaly significant discontinuities. We identified 11 fluvial lithofacies, 4 conglomerates (Gm, Gh, Gp and Gt), 5 sandstones (Sm, St., Sp, and Mr. Sh), and 2 pelitic (Fl and Fm), according to the nomenclature of Miall (1996). In addition, 2 volcaniclastic lithofacies, 1 primary pyroclastic lithofacies (Tlpm) and 1 volcaniclastic sineruptive lithofacies (TLpe) following criteria Mc Phie et al. (1993) were defined, and finally 3 eolic lithofacies (Spe, She and Sathya) (Fig. 4). These were grouped into 11 fluvial architectural elements and 4 eolic (Fig. 5). We have recognized channel elements (CHI) and CHII), intrachannel (LA, DAI, DAII, SBI and SBII) and floodplain (CRI, CRII, CS and OF). The eolic architectural elements include dunes (ED) and interdunes (DI, and WI FI). The paleoenvironments sedimentary include river systems, terminal fans and dune fields. The Sistema Fluvial I (SF-I) is integrated by LA, DAI, DAII, SBI, CHI, CRI, CRII and OF (Fig. 6). The meanders loops show, in most cases, complete filling sequences in which records of migration of large sand dunes are preserved which retain topsets deposits and the scrolls their undulating tops. The channel belts are separated by potent floodplain deposits, with frequent intercalation of levels of overflow both channelized or in mantle, and show a multilateral persistence in potent sections of the column. The crevasse splay exhibits paleosoils with low levels of development, frequent presence of gleyzed horizons and high degree of bioturbation. The general characteristics of the S-FI are proper of aggrading fluvial systems of high sinuosity. The Sistema Fluvial II (SF-II) is characterized by LA, DAI, DAII, SBI and to a lesser proportion, by CRI and OF (Fig. 6). The meanders loops often show preservation of the channel fill by lateral accretion with complete successions. Also the dunes preserve topsets deposits and the scrolls the original topography (Fig. 7). The frequency of conservation of filling phase of the abandoned channel with strong bioturbation and development gleyzed horizons suggests frequent avulsion by strangulation. The preservation of the floodplain is low, and it is characterized by intense bioturbation, and a high volcaniclastic participation in some reaches. We consider that the fluvial system model is of high sinuosity highly aggrading. The terminal fan system (Sistema Abanico Terminal) (TSS), characteristic of semiarid regions with strong seasonal climatology, is represented by CHII, CS or SBII and OF (Fig. 6). These constitute flooding basin deposits (CI), simple multiepisodic channel fillings corresponding to middle sections of the distributary plain and simple channels with development of small transversal cross bars and multilateral relations of distal distributary plain. The aeolian system (Sistema Eolico) (IS) consists of SD, DI, WD and FD. The spatial distribution of dunes and interdunes, the high dispersion of paleocurrents with a principal mode at the avalanche deposits and multiple stabilization surfaces suggest the development of a field of barchan dunes. In the element WI, we identified ferric and mottled halos and bioturbations that indicate the presence of paleosoils with gleyzed horizons (Retallack, 1976, 1990) which and characterize environments with good oxygenation. According to the temporal and spatial arrangement of the different paleoenvironments, their evolutionary trend and the analysis of significant discontinuity surfaces, we produced the stratigraphic sequence for the Subgroup Rio Limay (Fig. 8). The sequence starts with the Secuencia I, corresponding {{to the base of the}} Huincul Fm and is represented by SF-I, defined by belts of potent channels, isolated in floodplain deposits and with the development of overflow fans under conditions of rapid aggradation. The avulsion by overflow crevasse splay was the control mechanism of the system. The development of composite paleosoils in distal segments of the plain indicates the existence of long periods during which the channel band remained relatively stable poitions. The incorporation of volcaniclastic materials to fluvial deposits claims a volcanic activity close in time. The geometry and continuity of the sandy bodies and its proportion in relation to the floodplain deposits suggests periods of low frequency of avulsion/subsidence rate. The large-scale architecture observed is the equivalent to a High Accommodation System Track (Cortejo) (AA) with a ratio A/S close to 1 associated with a gradual decline in the base level under conditions of high sediment supply. A net surface (Discontinuidad D-IS-IS) is the basis of the sequence II, marked by an abrupt change in the fluvial architecture river (SF-II). The mechanism of lateral migration was by strangulation and abrupt cut of the bends. Only underdeveloped paleosoils in the abandoned channel fillings and the little preservation of the floodplain deposits are recognized. The stacking of channel belts signs out a reduction in the accommodation space. The top layer of Huincul Fm is interpreted as Lower Accommodation System Track (Cortejo) (BA). The Discontinuity IIC (D-IIC) marks the base of Lisandro Fm, which is an surface of fluvial flooding defining the expansion of a terminal fan system associated with an abrupt increase in the accommodation space and rapid progradation of the facies of an environment of intermediate distributary plain. This stretch of the Sequence is interpreted as the High Accommodation System Track (Cortejo) (AA) of the Sequence II (S-II) was associated with a period of high subsidence. The deposits of terminal fans are covered by a wet eolian system (IS). The change in the depositional environment marks the beginning of the Sequence III (SIII), limited at the base by D-IIIS. The development of a field of parabolic dunes associated with environments dry, wet and flooded interdune indicates a gradual rise in the water table that, eventually, was above the depositional surface generating shallow lagoons. The shortterm climatic changes related with an increase in precipitation and the relative position of the water table controlled the development stabilization surfaces and the growth and migration of aeolian forms. We identified two supersurfaces (D-IV and DV, Fig. 18) which may be assigned to periods with an increase in the supply or availability of sediment climatically conditioned. Periodically, the interdune corridors were overrun by ephemeral streams associated with the flood basin environments of SAT during flooding events. All deposits, characterized by a strong stacking of the eolian successions are interpreted as the Cortejo BA from the Sequence III. A new fluvial flood event marked by the Discontinuity VIC, is represented by facies flood basin, a distributary plain with the development of intertwined channels showing evidences of the SAT progradation. This sector is interpreted as the (Cortejo) AA System Track of S-III associated with a period of renewed <b>subsidence.</b> D-VIIS <b>limits</b> the base of the S-IV whose (Cortejo) BA System Track is similar to the previous Sequence and includes 3 supersurfaces (D-D-VIIIIX / X). The expansion of the flooding basin facies of a limited terminal fan at the base by D-XIC represents the base of the (Cortejo) AA System Track of the Sequence IV. Tabular units associated with a distal distributary plain that replaced towards the top by thick channels of low sinuosity close to the backbone of the system represent an progradation event of the SAT. The beginning of the Sequence V is marked D-XIIS associated with the development of a new SE. The architectural design of large scale is similar to that of the (Cortejos) BA System Tracks of the Sequences III and IV and includes supersurfaces D-D-XIII and XIV. Something similar occurs with the surface of fluvial flooding (D-XVC) on which we identified a prograding succession of SAT. The characteristics of the systems involved in the Lisandro Fm suggest a climate change to semi-arid conditions and low gradient in the depositional environment. The sequential stratigraphic analysis of the formations Huincul and Lisandro suggests that the deposits are sinorogénic and the different pulses of subsidence are registered in the (Cortejos) AA and BA System Tracks defined in this study...|$|R
