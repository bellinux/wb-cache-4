5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides.

The <b>solvent</b> response is caused by reorganization of the bulk <b>solvent</b> following the laser pump event, and in order to extract the structural information of the solute, the <b>solvent</b> response has to be treated. Methodologies capable of doing so include both theoretical modelling and experimental determination of the <b>solvent</b> response. In the work presented here, we have investigated how to obtain a reproducible <b>solvent</b> response-the <b>solvent</b> term-experimentally when applying laser pump, X-ray probe time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering. The <b>solvent</b> term describes difference scattering arising from the structural response of the <b>solvent</b> to changes in the hydrodynamic parameters: pressure, temperature and density. We present results based on NIR and dye mediated <b>solvent</b> heating, and demonstrate that the <b>solvent</b> response is independent of the heating method. The NIR heating is shown to be rendered unusable by higher order effects under certain experimental conditions, while the dye mediated <b>solvent</b> heating is demonstrated to exhibit first order behaviour with respect to the amount of energy deposited in the solution. We introduce a standardized method for recording <b>solvent</b> responses in laser pump, X-ray probe time-resolved X-ray wide-angle scattering experiments by using dye mediated <b>solvent</b> heating.
