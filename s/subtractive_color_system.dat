25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system,</b> which filters colors from white light by using {{superimposed}} cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|E
25|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{additive}} systems (including a camera with two apertures, {{one with a}} red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. Herbert Kalmus, Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system</b> for Technicolor. The system used a beam splitter in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green, then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was Toll of the Sea (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was The Black Pirate (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E

[...] On the HSV color wheel, also known as the , [...] the complement of green is magenta; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{that use}} {{additive}} color processes {{usually have a}} color gamut which is roughly a convex polygon in the hue-saturation plane. The vertices of the polygon are the most saturated <b>colors</b> the <b>system</b> can produce.

40|$|The {{computer}} modelling of projection TV screen with additive and subtractive multicolor formation was made. The neutral polarizers with phase compensator films {{were shown to}} be suitable for LC <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> instead of <b>color</b> polarizers. The advantages of such construction of <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> include the application of three identical STN cells. This approach considerably simplifies the technology and results in a lower price of the <b>color</b> projection <b>systems.</b> The additive LC screen can be also produced {{on the basis of}} neutral polarizers and phase retardation plates instead of the conventionally used microfilters. The phase retardation plates can be generated, using photoanisotropic polymer films. According to calculations, the proposed construction of an additive LC screen enable to increase the brightness several times as much as compared with usual configurations...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> {{start with}} light, presumably white light. Colored inks, paints, or filters between the watchers {{and the light}} source or {{reflective}} surface subtract wavelengths from the light, giving it color. If the incident light is other than white, our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well, but not perfectly, often giving a flawed impression of the [...] "true" [...] color of the surface.|$|R
50|$|Yellow is {{the color}} between green and orange on the {{spectrum}} of visible light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly 570590 nm. In traditional color theory, used in painting, and in the <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system,</b> used in color printing, yellow is a primary color. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity.|$|E

50|$|In color theory, {{the gamut}} of a device or process is {{that portion of the}} color space that can be represented, or reproduced. Generally, the color gamut is {{specified}} in the hue-saturation plane, as a system can usually produce colors over a wide intensity range within its color gamut; for a <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system</b> (such as used in printing), the range of intensity available in the system is for the most part meaningless without considering system-specific properties (such as the illumination of the ink).|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} {{of two of the}} standard three additive primary colors in equal proportions produces an additive secondary color—cyan, magenta or yellow—which, in the form of dyes or pigments, are the standard primary <b>colors</b> in <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>systems.</b> The <b>subtractive</b> system using primaries that are the secondaries of the additive system can be viewed as an alternative approach to reproducing a wide range of colors by controlling the relative amounts of red, green, and blue light that reach the eye.|$|R
500|$|Green is {{the color}} between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light with a has {{dominant}} wavelength of roughly 495570 nm.

[...] By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.|$|R
2500|$|The {{invention}} of Prizma {{led to a}} series of similarly printed color processes. [...] This bipack <b>color</b> <b>system</b> used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> print.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system,</b> or CMYK (subtractive), {{which can}} be {{overlaid}} to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan {{is one of the}} primary colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black. In the additive color system, or RGB (additive) color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light.|$|E

50|$|In a {{projector}} with {{a single}} DLP chip, colors are produced either by placing a color wheel between a white lamp and the DLP chip or by using individual light sources to produce the primary colors, LEDs or lasers for example. The color wheel is divided into multiple sectors: the primary additive colors: red, green, and blue, {{and in many cases}} white (clear). Newer systems substitute the primary <b>subtractive</b> <b>colors</b> cyan, magenta, and yellow for white. The use of the <b>subtractive</b> <b>colors</b> is part of the newer <b>color</b> performance <b>system</b> called BrilliantColor which processes the additive colors along with the <b>subtractive</b> <b>colors</b> to create a broader spectrum of possible color combinations on the screen.|$|R

5000|$|Results {{obtained}} when mixing additive {{colors are}} often counterintuitive for people {{accustomed to the}} <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system</b> of pigments, dyes, inks and other substances that present color to the eye by reflection rather than emission. For example, in subtractive color systems, green {{is a combination of}} yellow and cyan; in additive color, red plus green makes yellow. Additive color {{is a result of the}} way the eye detects color, and is not a property of light. There is a vast difference between a pure spectral yellow light, with a wavelength of approximately 580 nm, and a mixture of red and green light. However, both stimulate our eyes in a similar manner, so we do not detect that difference, and both are yellow light to the human eye. (See eye (cytology), color vision.) ...|$|E

50|$|Although it {{had been}} {{available}} previously, color in Hollywood feature films first became truly practical from the studios' commercial perspective {{with the advent of}} Technicolor, whose main advantage was quality prints in less time than its competitors. In its earliest incarnations, Technicolor was another two-color system that could reproduce a range of reds, muted bluish greens, pinks, browns, tans and grays, but not real blues or yellows. Toll of the Sea, released in 1922, was the first film printed in their <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> <b>system.</b> Technicolor's camera photographed each pair of color-filtered frames simultaneously on one strip of black-and-white film by means of a beam splitter prism behind the camera lens. Two prints on half-thickness stock were made from the negative, one from only the red-filtered frames, the other from the green-filtered frames. After development, the silver images on the prints were chemically toned to convert them into images of the approximately complementary colors. The two strips were then cemented together back to back, forming a single strip similar to duplitized film.|$|E

As in its last additive system, the camera had only one lens but used a beam splitter that allowed red and green-filtered images to be photographed simultaneously on adjacent frames of a single strip of black-and-white 35 mm film, which ran through the camera at twice the normal rate. By skip-frame printing from the negative, two prints were made, on film stock with half the normal base thickness. They were chemically toned (i.e., the silver particles forming the black-and-white images were proportionally replaced by coloring matter) to colors roughly complementary to the filter colors (red for the green-filtered images and vice versa), as <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> reproduction requires. They were then cemented together, base to base, into a single strip of film. No special projection equipment was needed.|$|R

40|$|Modeling <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> mixture (e. g., the {{way that}} paints mix) is {{difficult}} when working with colors described only by three-dimensional color space values, such as RGB. Although RGB values are sufficient to describe a specific color sensation, they do not contain enough information to predict the RGB color that would result from a subtractive mixture of two specified RGB colors. Methods do exist for accurately modeling subtractive mixture, such as the Kubelka-Munk equations, but require extensive spectrophotometric measurements of the mixed components, making them unsuitable for many computer graphics applications. This paper presents a strategy for modeling <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> mixture given only the RGB information of the colors being mixed, written for a general audience. The RGB colors are first transformed to generic, representative spectral distributions, and then this spectral information is used to perform the subtractive mixture, using the weighted arithmetic-geometric mean. This strategy provides reasonable, representative <b>subtractive</b> mixture <b>colors</b> with only modest computational effort and no experimental measurements. As such, it provides a useful way to model <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> mixture in computer graphics applications...|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{sequential}} <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> {{for moving}} images predates {{the invention of}} fully electronic television. Although usually known at the time simply as [...] "additive" [...] rather than sequential <b>color</b> <b>systems,</b> two-color Kinemacolor, in commercial use since 1906, and its predecessor three-color format, invented by Edward Raymond Turner and patented in 1899, were both sequential natural <b>color</b> <b>systems</b> for use with motion picture film. They utilized black-and-white film and rotating color filter wheels to record the amount of each color in the scene on alternating frames of the film, {{so that when the}} frames were projected by light of similar colors at a sufficiently rapid rate, those colors blended together in the viewer's eye and produced a wider range of hues. Due to litigation by William Friese-Greene, Kinemacolor ended up in the public domain in 1915, after which several derivative sequential color processes (such as Friese-Greene's Biocolour and the original Prisma Color) were developed.
