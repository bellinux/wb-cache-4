30|$|<b>Sandal</b> (Santalum album L) {{contains}} several interesting {{amino acids}} and amines {{which are not}} seen in other plants.

5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift <b>sandals</b> made from hay and straw.|$|E
