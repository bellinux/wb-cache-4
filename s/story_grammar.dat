40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} the effect of event repetition on the amount and nature of <b>story</b> <b>grammar</b> produced by children when recalling the event. Method: Children aged 4 years (N = 50) and 7 years (N = 56) participated in either one or six occurrences of a highly similar event where details varied across the occurrences. Half the children in each age and event group recalled the last/single occurrence 5 - 6 days later {{and the other half}} recalling the last/single occurrence after 5 - 6 weeks (the final and single occurrence was the same). Children’s free recall responses were classified according to the number and proportion of <b>story</b> <b>grammar</b> elements (Stein 2 ̆ 6 Glenn, 1979 - setting, initiating event, internal response, plan, attempt, direct consequence and resolution) as well as the prevalence of causal links between the individual story-grammar elements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of four instructional strategies on the recall patterns, comprehension scores, and written productions of tenth-grade survey English literature students. The four instructional strategies were (1) genre-specific <b>story</b> <b>grammar,</b> (2) generic <b>story</b> <b>grammar,</b> (3) teacher-posed questions and answer instruction, and (4) theme instruction. The genre used for instruction of all groups was Science Fiction literature. A Science Fiction genre-specific <b>story</b> <b>grammar</b> was developed, devised, and employed as an instructional tool for this study. Prior research had not investigated different instructional methodologies using a genre-specific <b>story</b> <b>grammar.</b> Research using the Mandler and Johnson generic <b>story</b> <b>grammar</b> had been limited to studies conducted in elementary classrooms, with the exception of one secondary study. This secondary study did not examine the recall patterns nor written story productions of the subjects, but it did examine the comprehension of complex short stories using a generic <b>story</b> <b>grammar</b> as a means of instruction. The research recommended that genre-specific story grammars be developed for complex stories read in secondary content domains. In addition, previous research recommended that more investigations which explore experimental instructional methodologies needed to be conducted at the secondary level of education. Recall was measured by an isolated recall task, comprehension was measured by multiple choice tests based on the content of three Science Fiction stories, and application knowledge was tested by means of a written story production. The criteria used to assess the recall, comprehension, and written story production was the Science Fiction genre-specific <b>story</b> <b>grammar.</b> Statistical analysis using a Pearson r, chi square, the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test, a MANOVA, an ANOVA, and paired t-tests showed a statistical significance for treatment group over time.

40|$|Automatic story {{generation}} has a long-standing {{tradition in the}} field of Artificial Intelligence. The ability to create stories on demand holds great potential for entertainment and education. For example, modern computer games are becoming more immersive, containing multiple story lines and hundreds of characters. This has substantially increased the amount of work required to produce each game. However, by allowing the game to write its own story line, it can remain engaging to the player whilst shifting the burden of writing away from the game’s developers. In education, intelligent tutoring systems can potentially provide students with instant feedback and suggestions of how to write their own stories. Although several approaches have been introduced in the past (e. g., <b>story</b> <b>grammars,</b> <b>story</b> schema and autonomous agents), they all rely heavily on handwritten resources. Which places severe limitations on its scalability and usage. In this thesis we will motivate a new approach to story generation which takes its inspiration from recent research in Natural Language Generation. Whose result is an interactive data-driven system for the generation of children’s stories. One of the key features of this system is that it is end-to-end, realising the various components of the generation pipeline stochastically. Knowledge relating to the generation and planning of stories is leveraged automatically from corpora and reformulated into new stories to be presented to the user. We will also show that story generation {{can be viewed as a}} search task, operating over a large number of stories that can be generated from knowledge inherent in a corpus. Using trainable scoring functions, our system can search the story space using different document level criteria. In this thesis we focus on two of these, namely, coherence and interest. We will also present two major paradigms for generation through search, (a) generate and rank, and (b) genetic algorithms. We show the effects on perceived story interest, fluency and coherence that result from these approaches. In addition, we show how the explicit use of plots induced from the corpus can be used to guide the generation process, providing a heuristically motivated starting point for story search. We motivate extensions to the system and show that additional modules can be used to improve the quality of the generated stories and overall scalability. Finally we highlight the current strengths and limitations of our approach and discuss possible future approaches to this field of research.

30|$|In {{addition}} to classroom observations, a scoring rubric {{was used by}} teachers to assess {{the quality of the}} digital stories created by the students. This stage had two different aims: to assess the level of student engagement, and document the educational outcomes achieved through digital storytelling. The level of engagement is a quantity that can be measured {{with the help of a}} scoring rubric. According to Sadik, it is appropriate to use an assessment instrument, such as a scoring rubric, to evaluate ICT-based learning projects (Sadik [2008]). Therefore, the role of digital storytelling was assessed by means of an evaluation rubric. An evaluation rubric created by the University of Houston ([2011]) was chosen as a guide to create the rubric for this research (Additional file 1 : Appendix C). The evaluation rubric included nine criteria; these are: Purpose, Plot, Pacing of Narrative, Dramatic Question, <b>Story</b> Content, <b>Grammar</b> and Language Usage, Technological Competence, Emotional Content and Economy of Content. Four levels of descriptors were given for each category, with scores of 4, 3, 2, or 1 possible, depending on the level of success in that area.|$|R
40|$|Interactive Digital Storytelling (IDS) {{constitutes}} a research field {{that emerged from}} several areas of art, creation and computer science. It inquires technologies and possible artefacts that allow ‘highly-interactive’ experiences of digital worlds with compelling stories. However, the situation for story creators approaching ‘highly-interactive’ storytelling is complex. There is {{a gap between the}} available technology, which requires programming and prior knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, and established models of storytelling, which are too linear to have the potential to be highly interactive. This thesis reports on research that lays the ground for bridging this gap, leading to novel creation philosophies in future work. A design research process has been pursued, which centred on the suggestion of conceptual models, explaining a) process structures of interdisciplinary development, b) interactive story structures including the user of the interactive story system, and c) the positioning of human authors within semi-automated creative processes. By means of ‘implicit creation’, storytelling and modelling of simulated worlds are reconciled. The conceptual models are informed by exhaustive literature review in established neighbouring disciplines. These are a) creative principles in different storytelling domains, such as screenwriting, video game writing, role playing and improvisational theatre, b) narratological studies of <b>story</b> <b>grammars</b> and structures, and c) principles of designing interactive systems, in the areas of basic HCI design and models, discourse analysis in conversational systems, as well as game- and simulation design. In a case study of artefact building, the initial models have been put into practice, evaluated and extended. These artefacts are a) a conceived authoring tool (‘Scenejo’) for the creation of digital conversational stories, and b) the development of a serious game (‘The Killer Phrase Game’) as an application development. The study demonstrates how starting out from linear storytelling, iterative steps of ‘implicit creation’ can lead to more variability and interactivity in the designed interactive story. In the concrete case, the steps included abstraction of dialogues into conditional actions, and creating a dynamic world model of the conversation. This process and artefact {{can be used as a}} model illustrating non-programmer approaches to ‘implicit creation’ in a learning process. Research demonstrates that the field of Interactive Digital Storytelling still has to be further advanced until general creative principles can be fully established, which is a long-term endeavour, dependent upon environmental factors. It also requires further technological developments. The gap is not yet closed, but it can be better explained. The research results build groundwork for education of prospective authors. Concluding the thesis, IDS-specific creative principles have been proposed for evaluation in future work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5000|$|The seventh {{chapter of}} the Chandogya Upanishads opens as a {{conversation}} between Sanatkumara and Narada. The latter asks, [...] "teach me, Sir, the knowledge of Soul, because I hear that anyone who knows the Soul, is beyond suffering and sorrow". Sanatkumara first inquires from Narada what he already has learnt so far. Narada says, he knows the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Atharva Veda, the epics and the history, the myths and the ancient <b>stories,</b> all rituals, <b>grammar,</b> etymology, astronomy, time keeping, mathematics, politics and ethics, warfare, principles of reasoning, divine lore, prayer lore, snake charming, ghosts lore and fine arts. Narada admits to Sanatkumara {{that none of these}} have led him to Self-knowledge, and he wants to know about Self and Self-knowledge.|$|R
