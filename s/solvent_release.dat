The second landfill, the Rubble Disposal Area was excavated with off-site disposal of PCB-impacted soil from a wetland area, topped by a soil cap, marked with institutional controls and has 30-year long-term monitoring in place since 2007, although methane gas concentrations emanating from the site still await corrective action. The Small Landfill where thallium and zinc were present in one groundwater monitoring well needed no corrective action as of 2002. The Sewage Treatment Plant contained organochlorine pesticides, including dieldrin and 4,4'-DDT. A Record of Decision was signed in April 2008 and most of the contaminated soil has been excavated, petroleum contaminated soils remain and construction is still underway. Building 81 caused migration of VOC's into nearby groundwater, and in-situ chemical oxidation treatment started in September 2000, but failed. After a remedial investigation completed in October 2011 and a final Feasibility Study issued April 2013, remedy selection was planned for summer 2013.At Building 82 in-situ treatment of shallow and deep groundwater for chlorinated solvents, land-use controls, and long-term monitoring was agreed upon in September 2012.

The gel particles used are polyelectrolyte networks swollen in aqueous solutions of hydroxypropylcellulose and placed in a hydrophobic matrix. As soon as the complex modulus of the matrix becomes larger than the shear modulus of the swollen gel, the gel widens, releases solvent in the vorticity direction and then solvent is detached and flows away.

40|$|Despite recent advances, {{subsurface}} remediation of {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOCs), such as chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons, remains a challenging environmental problem. As a result, the development of innovative methods for remediating subsurface VOC remains a major environmental priority. In addition to these priority pollutants, perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) and 1, 4 -dioxane are contaminants of emerging concern due to their potential toxicity and prevalence in the environment. These emerging contaminants have increasingly been identified as co-contaminants at VOC release sites, and remediation strategies capable of treating VOC as well as 1, 4 -dioxane and PFCs would be of great value. In this dissertation, field and laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate an innovative remediation strategy for VOC priority pollutants and determine its effects on PFCs and 1, 4 -dioxane. Chapter 1 details {{the outcome of a}} solubility-enhanced in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) pilot-scale field test for the remediation of VOC.

40|$|The {{northern}} karst {{region of}} Puerto Rico {{has a long}} and extensive history of toxic spills, chemical waste, and industrial <b>solvent</b> <b>release</b> into the subsurface. High potential for exposure in the region has prompted aggressive remediation measures, which have extended for over 40 years. Of particular concern is contamination with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) because of their ubiquitous presence and potential health impacts. This work evaluates historical groundwater quality data to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of CVOC contamination in the karst aquifer system of northern Puerto Rico, and its response to remedial action in two superfund sites contaminated with CVOCs. Historical data collected from different information sources with different monitoring objectives is evaluated spatially and temporally using Geographic Information System (GIS) and statistical analysis. The analysis shows a significant extent of contamination that comes from multiple sources and spreads beyond the demarked sources of pollution. CVOCs are detected in 65 % of all samples and 78 % of all sampled wells. Groundwater shows continued level of contamination {{over long periods of}} time, demonstrating a strong capacity of the karst groundwater system to store and slowly release contamination. Trichloroethene and Tetrachloroethene are the most frequently found, although other CVOCs (e. g., Trichloromethane, Dichloromethane, Carbon Tetrachloride) are detected as well. The spatial and temporal distributions of CVOCs seem to be highly dependent upon the monitoring scheme and objectives, indicating that the data does not adequately capture the contamination plumes. Targeted remedial action using pump and treat (air stripping) and soil vapor extraction in two superfund sites has reduced concentrations over time, but the spatial and temporal extent of the contamination reflect inability to completely capture the heterogeneous plumes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{attractive}} {{options for}} carbon capture solvents suffer from high viscosity, {{making it difficult}} to generate large surface areas for fast absorption, and amine-based aqueous liquids suffer from potential environmental impacts from <b>solvent</b> <b>release.</b> As part of a US-DOE ARPA-E program, a team from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Babcock and Wilcox, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have created a new encapsulated form of carbon capture solvents in which the operating fluid, amines or carbonates in our tests to date, is enclosed in a thin polymer shell forming 200 - 400 μm beads. While mass transport across the polymer shell is reduced compared to the neat liquid, the large surface area of the beads lessens this disadvantage. The liquid, as well as any degradation products or precipitates, remains encapsulated within the beads, which can be thermally regenerated repeatedly. Encapsulated solvents have the capacity of liquids and the physical behavior of solid sorbents. We imagine them to be useful in fairly conventional-style capture applications, as well as exotic new approaches facilitated by their high surface area. The beads appear to be both chemically and mechanically stable under typical industrial conditions. Examples of the engineering constraints that the beads must satisfy for several application strategies, including their use in fluidized beds, will be presented. To date we have encapsulated MEA, piperazine, and a variety of carbonate solutions, which appear to be optimal for this application. We have demonstrated rapid CO 2 uptake and desorption using colorimetric methods, which permit rapid spectroscopic determination of the extent of CO 2 uptake and release (shown to the left, loaded form is yellow).
