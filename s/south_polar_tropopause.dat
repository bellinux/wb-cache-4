40|$|Aims: Disk-averaged {{infrared}} spectra of Neptune between 1. 8 and 13 μm, {{obtained by the}} AKARI Infrared Camera (IRC) in May 2007, have been analysed to (a) determine the globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure; (b) derive the abundances of stratospheric hydrocarbons; and (c) detect fluorescent emission from CO at 4. 7 μm. Methods: Mid-{{infrared spectra}} were modelled using a line-by-line radiative transfer code to determine the temperature structure between 1 - 1000 μbar and the abundances of CH_ 4, CH_ 3 D and higher-order hydrocarbons. A full non-LTE radiative model was then {{used to determine the}} best fitting CO profile to reproduce the fluorescent emission observed at 4. 7 μm in the NG channel (with a spectral resolution of 135). Results: The globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure is quasi-isothermal between 1 - 1000 μbar, which suggests little variation in global stratospheric conditions since studies by the Infrared Space Observatory a decade earlier. The derived CH_ 4 mole fraction of (9. 0 ± 3. 0) × 10 ^- 4 at 50 mbar, decreasing to (0. 9 ± 0. 3) × 10 ^- 4 at 1 μbar, is larger than that expected if the tropopause at 56 K acts as an efficient cold trap, but consistent with the hypothesis that CH_ 4 leaking through the warm <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> (62 - 66 K) is globally redistributed by stratospheric motion. The ratio of D/H in CH_ 4 of 3. 0 ± 1. 0 × 10 ^- 4 supports the conclusion that Neptune is enriched in deuterium relative to the other giant planets. We determine a mole fraction of ethane of (8. 5 ± 2. 1) × 10 ^- 7 at 0. 3 mbar, consistent with previous studies, and a mole fraction of ethylene of 5. 0 _- 2. 1 ^+ 1. 8 × 10 ^- 7 at 2. 8 μbar. An emission peak at 4. 7 μm is interpreted as a fluorescent emission of CO, and requires a vertical distribution with both external and internal sources of CO.

An emission peak at 4. 7 μm is interpreted as a fluorescent emission of CO, and requires a vertical distribution with both external and internal sources of CO. Finally, comparisons to previous L-band studies indicate significant variability of Neptune's flux densities in the 3. 5 - 4. 1 μm range, related to changes in solar energy deposition. © ESO, 2010...|$|E
50|$|Since the {{tropopause}} {{responds to}} the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it, it is at its peak levels over the Equator, and reaches minimum heights over the poles. On account of this, the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17 km over the equator. Due to the variation in starting height, the tropopause extremes {{are referred to as}} the equatorial <b>tropopause</b> and the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) {{has several}} well known biases that have {{important}} dynamical implications for research. Some {{examples of these}} biases include a cold temperature bias near the tropopause at high latitudes, systematic biases in the mean zonal wind, and transient momentum fluxes that are too strong. One method for investigating the impacts that these biases have is to use data assimilation techniques to reduce the bias and observe how the system reacts. The cold <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> temperature bias found in CAM is common to climate models. For the Northern Hemisphere, the bias is generally observed in the summer months. By assimilating a July 2003 set of observations {{in the region of}} this bias, we observe that reducing this bias forces the zonal jet and storm tracks to shift poleward. This finding mirrors the results of several earlier studies where the height of the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> influences the location of storm tracks and zonal jets by moving them equatorward as the height decreases, and poleward as the height increases as is predicted to occur with increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses...|$|R
