40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of new services by composition of existing ones has gained considerable momentum {{as a means of}} integrating heterogeneous applications and realising business collaborations. <b>Services</b> <b>that</b> enter into compositions with other services may have transactional properties, especially those in the broad area of resource management (e. g. booking services). These transactional properties may be exploited in order to derive composite services which themselves exhibit certain transactional properties. This paper presents a model for composing <b>services</b> <b>that</b> expose transactional properties and more specifically, <b>services</b> <b>that</b> support tentative holds and/or atomic execution. The proposed model is based on a high-level <b>service</b> composition operator <b>that</b> produces composite <b>services</b> <b>that</b> satisfy specified atomicity constraints. The model supports the possibility of selecting the <b>services</b> <b>that</b> enter into a composition at runtime, depending on their ability to provide resource reservations at a given point in time and taking into account user preferences...|$|R
