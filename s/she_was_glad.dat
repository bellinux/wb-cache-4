5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E
5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed {{on an annual basis}} each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E

500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick Kennedy said {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely {{more interesting than the}} Angie Bolen mystery". He said the relationship made more sense for Katherine than her previous subplots involving her romance with Mike and her mental breakdown following their break-up. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, but she said that did not like the direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club complimented [...] "The Set Up" [...] {{and said}} the {{characters}} played off each other well, but added the episode [...] "felt a little too plot driven to ascend to A-material heights". Heisler particularly praised the performances of Chris Pratt and Will Arnett, who he said displayed a subtler sense of humor than in his role on the television series Arrested Development. TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher praised the episode, and said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> the writers found a reason to keep April in the show without keeping her on as an intern indefinitely. Gallagher also said the jealousy issue was handled well between Mark and Ann, giving the impression of true feelings between the characters. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger praised the decision of April becoming Ron's assistant because of the comedic potential of the duo. Sepinwall said although Theroux was charming and funny, Arnett [...] "didn't quite fit into the show's low-key, naturalistic vibe".|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} has {{garnered}} critical acclaim. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised {{the show for}} its [...] "high level of interest" [...] in depicting its dystopian world. However, she said that its violent scenes were so gruesome they might scare viewers. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis called it a [...] "compelling cyberpunk mystery", praising the society depicted and the series of murders orchestrated by Shogo Makishima. However, he criticized the use of advanced technology and compared it with other science fiction films despite saying that it handled the themes better whereas Makishima's immunity to it was left unexplained. DVD Talk gave high praise to Makishima because of his achievements across the story and his personality. Certain episodes have been referred as [...] "filler" [...] because they are used as a build-up to the climactic ones. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network gave high praise stating that from episode 12, the series was [...] "a real blast to watch" [...] and that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> {{with the development of}} the protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. However, she severely criticized the plot twist regarding the Sybil System's true identity calling it [...] "one of the stupidest revelations in the history of anime".|$|E

500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. When she read the script, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko {{said she had to}} do [...] "training non-stop from the morning to the evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was easy for her because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard". When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.|$|E
500|$|In Saint-Briac, {{during the}} summer, Kirill played golf {{and he and}} Victoria joined in picnics and excursions. [...] They {{were part of the}} social life of the community, going out to play bridge and {{organizing}} theatricals. [...] During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games. [...] However, it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris [...] "for the occasional fling". Victoria, who had devoted her life to Kirill, was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her, according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania. She kept up a façade for the sake of her children, including her teenage son Vladimir, but was unable to forgive Kirill's betrayal. Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild, Mechtilde of Leiningen, in February 1936. Family and friends arrived, but nothing could be done. When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> Marie had come, to which Victoria haltingly replied, [...] "It makes all the difference." [...] However, she [...] "shuddered away from Kirill's touch," [...] wrote Marie. She died on 1 March 1936. Queen Marie eulogized her sister in a letter after her death: [...] "The whole thing was tragic beyond imagination, a tragic end to a tragic life. She carried tragedy within her – she had tragic eyes – always – even as a little girl – but we loved her enormously, there was something mighty about her – she was our Conscience." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, [...] "Wake me up when something actually happens." ...|$|E
500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the harder it is for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E
500|$|... "Helping Hand" [...] {{received}} overwhelming positive reviews. Of the episode, Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said, [...] "As I'm {{realizing how}} much I'm thoroughly enjoying the characters on Body of Proof, [...] "Helping Hand" [...] has Megan finally noticing how little she knows about them. The best part is, she does something {{to try and}} change that {{and the results are}} both comical and touching". Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing makes you a part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship". On this, she said that Bud had some of the best lines in the episode, calling them [...] "the best". She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners". Finally, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> it was not too [...] "gory" [...] and summarized, [...] "On Body of Proof I'm more interested in the characters than the graphic medical details. Thankfully they continue to give me plenty of what I want". TV OverMind Carissa Pavlica said she was [...] "really enjoying" [...] the relationship between Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) and Megan. Pavlica explained, [...] "In the Pilot, the other medical examiners seemed to hope they could somehow get rid of Megan by tattling on things to Kate. This week, as she saw Megan struggle in her connection with the living, she attempted to reach out and give advice". Of the plot of the episode, Pavlica said; ...|$|E
