5|$|Though he {{lost the}} 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran again for the {{presidency}} in 1980, and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role, and her management of staff became more apparent. She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John <b>Sears</b> <b>and</b> Michael Deaver, and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa Caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and {{decided it was time}} to fire <b>Sears</b> <b>and</b> his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.|$|E

Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1828 Greene married Mary Elizabeth Vinton, sister of his best friend at West Point, David Vinton. Elizabeth gave birth to three {{children}} {{over the next four}} years: Mary Vinton, George <b>Sears,</b> <b>and</b> Francis Vinton Greene. While assigned to Fort Sullivan in Eastport, Maine in 1833, tragedy struck Greene's family: Elizabeth and all three of their children died within seven months, probably from tuberculosis. To ease the pain on his mind and to escape the isolation and loneliness of peacetime Army garrison duty, he immersed himself in study of both the law and medicine, coming close to professional certification in both by the time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become a civil engineer.|$|E

5|$|Two {{changes were}} made in the routing of US10 by 1929. As shown on the maps of the time, US10 was rerouted to bypass Flint. The former routing through the city was {{redesigned}} M-10. A second change moved the highway to its present routing west of Baldwin to the Lakeâ€“Mason county line. A bypass of downtown Midland was opened in 1934. The previous routing through town was initially renumbered US 10A. A rerouting project in Osceola County started in 1936. By the end of the year, a new roadway was opened between <b>Sears</b> <b>and</b> M-66. Until the second segment of the project was completed two years later, US10 was routed concurrently with M-66. When the new routing between M-66 and Lake in Clare County was opened, that concurrency was eliminated and all the previous routings were transferred to local control.|$|E
