5|$|Wang Mang {{preserved}} these {{central government}} monopolies. When Eastern Han began, {{they were once}} again repealed, the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs. Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 AD) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> iron from 85 to 88 AD, but abolished them {{in the last year}} of his reign. After Emperor Zhang, the Han never returned the <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> iron industries to government ownership.|$|E

40|$|Temperatures {{higher than}} 20 ºC can boost the growth, on the <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod surface, of {{bacteria}} that present a red pigment (Rodrigues et al., 2003; Rodrigues et al., 2005). These organisms, besides {{the change of}} the food product appearance, also cause an unpleasant flavor and the product is rejected by the consumers, although does not cause any health concern. Currently, the export of <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod, to Africa, has increased and {{a great amount of}} product is rejected due to the high environmental temperature and the lack of a proper cold chain storage infrastructure. Vacuum packaging, and modified atmosphere packaging have been used for fresh and cooked seafood preservation, but, as far as the authors know, were never used to preserve <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried fish. In the present study it was observed the effect of vacuum packaging, packaging with 80 %N 2 : 20 %CO 2 and finally the addition of sodium metabisulfite on the <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod stored under temperature abuse (15 ºC, 25 ºC and 35 ºC). Accordingly, packaging under vacum and, specially, packaging with 80 %N 2 : 20 %CO 2 successfuly increased the shellife of <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod. The addition of sodium metabisulfite has increased the shelflife of <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod preserved at 15 ºC, but not of <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod preserved at 25 ºC and 35 ºC...|$|R

5|$|Hydrochloric acid was {{historically}} called acidum salis, muriatic acid, {{and spirits}} of salt {{because it was}} produced from rock <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> green vitriol (by Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century) and later from the chemically similar common <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> sulfuric acid (by Johann Rudolph Glauber in the 17th century). Free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius. Later, it was used by chemists such as Glauber, Priestley, and Davy in their scientific research.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> salt water.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea <b>salt)</b> <b>and</b> mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E

5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{has a high}} {{sodium and}} fat content, and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains {{in an effort to}} reduce <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> fat. Due to this, low-fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. In 2009, seven large cafe chains in the UK made a commitment to reducing <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> fat through similar substitutions. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
