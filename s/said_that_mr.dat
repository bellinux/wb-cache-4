The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sogavare was toppled in {{a vote of}} no confidence. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Sogavare's refusal to extradite Moti was the main cause of the Prime Minister's downfall. Opposition leader Fred Fono promised in November that Mr Moti would be extradited if the opposition came to power. The Fiji Times suggested that Mr Moti might then flee to Fiji.

Reports said Mr. Yi had been disappointed by North Korean submarine attack on a South Korean corvette [...] "Cheonanham" [...] in March 2010, and the RO's unconditional loyalty to North Korean regime, and he finally decided to reveal the treason plot and get a 'new life.' He allegedly handed in a USB drive containing the RO's doctrine and goal, members' activities, and materials for ideological study.

[...] The Prime Minister said he would not have been invited Alsuleiman had he known of his position regarding homosexuals. The sheikh had previously spoken about the [...] "evil actions" [...] of homosexuality. Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed has defended Alsuleiman, saying Islam has a, [...] "longstanding" [...] position on homosexuality" [...] which [...] "no person can ever change". [...] He said that any attempt to call out its teachings could lead to radicalisation. [...] ANIC treasurer Imam Mohamed Imraan Husain said, [...] "Islam prevents lesbianism and being gay."

2500|$|Lamon and Pinkerton famously clashed {{over the}} President-elect's protection. Lamon offered Lincoln [...] "a Revolver and a Bowie Knife" [...] but Pinkerton protested that he [...] "would {{not for the}} world have it <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lincoln had to enter the {{national}} Capital armed". [...] The two men further disagreed over Lamon's desire to alert the Chicago Journal to their early arrival in Washington because Pinkerton, more prudently, wished not to publicize their change of plans. [...] In Pinkerton's account of the plot, he wrote disparagingly of Lamon, referring {{to him as a}} [...] "brainless, egotistical fool". [...] Pinkerton allowed William Herndon to copy his report, which was obtained by Lamon when he purchased Herndon's papers to write his Life of Abraham Lincoln. [...] However, when Herndon first requested copies of Pinkerton's report, Pinkerton agreed only on the condition that certain material be kept confidential, specifically naming his remarks about Lamon.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Burns was {{originally}} voiced by actor Christopher Collins in the episodes [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", [...] "Homer's Odyssey", There's No Disgrace Like Home and [...] "The Telltale Head". He was soon replaced by Harry Shearer because Sam Simon found him [...] "difficult to work with". Shearer has voiced the character ever since. He modeled {{the voice on}} Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer is also the voice of Smithers {{and is able to}} perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Shearer <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns is the most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice. He describes Mr. Burns as his favorite character, saying he [...] "like Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people make the mistake of diluting it. Never adulterate your evil." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{church of}} St Columba, erected in 1904, is a {{building}} of stone, with chancel, nave, south porch and a tower containing one bell. [...] The Church was consecrated on 3 May 1905. It {{was built by}} the villagers {{under the direction of}} Lloyd Wilson to the designs of the well-known church architect, W. D. Caroe, who gave his services gratuitously. [...] It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Caroe had recently returned from a visit to St Columba's on the Isle of Iona and that he was influenced by the ruined abbey church of Our Lady, hence the feeling of early Celtic influence. [...] Until 1936, St Columba's, was a chapelry in the Parish of Christ Church, Little Broughton. [...] It is now a listed building. [...] Although only a small church of approximately 100 seats, it has an atmosphere which is often commented on by visitors. [...] In the last 18 months it has undergone extensive restoration and is about to be internally redecorated. The register dates from 1905. There is a Wesleyan chapel, built in 1903, and there was a Primitive Methodist chapel, built 1864.|$|E
2500|$|Dence was an {{entertaining}} speaker, {{as can be}} seen by the speech he gave on Opening Day. He said that [...] "the original design of the building was a rough sketch by his daughter, with all the features he sought to include in the building. This was handed by him to Mr Palmer [...] [...] [...] who prepared the present design in all its manifold details." [...] He said to great applause that the Pavilion was [...] "built so strongly and solidly, and on such good foundations that it was likely to stand the fierce north-easterly breezes for generations yet to come," [...] and that [...] "while the East Cliff Pavilion remained, Mr Palmer's name would ever remain." [...] He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Ingleton's building work had done him great credit and that he [...] "must have put the best materials in it for the love of it." [...] On the subject of the popularity and health-giving properties of the town, he suggested to much laughter that because 1,000 and 1,400 persons were listed in the town directory in 1902 and 1904 respectively, Herne Bay could have 200,000 inhabitants in the year 2000. He wanted to press for gardens and walks on the East Cliff, and for a nearby park.|$|E
2500|$|In a poll {{hosted by}} MSN more than 80% of readers {{said they would}} {{continue}} watching the show following the first episode. Phil Hogan writing for The Guardian bemoaned the story development. He observed that there is [...] "so much crisis with so little drama". The Daily Mail's Ian Hyland {{was impressed with the}} series and praised the performances of Piven, Tapper and Loftus. Ross Sweeney from Cultbox said that the show had direction but lacked [...] "actual substance and any real surprises". He praised the costume designers for their [...] "astonishing attention to detail". Susanna Lazarus of the Radio Times opined that the character's earnestness detracted from the realism of the story. She added the female cast created the [...] "plot tension" [...] needed to maintain viewership. Gabriel Tate of Time Out branded it an unsubtle, daft series with glorious production values but felt it was [...] "ideal escapism for a Sunday night". He also stated that the character of Agnes Towler was [...] "the heart of the show". Benjamin Secher from The Daily Telegraph <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Selfridge is a [...] "less cosy, more charismatic" [...] production of The Paradise. A [...] "sumptuous, frothy drama" [...] and [...] "entertaining spectacle", but ultimately Secher did not believe the story. MSN critic Dan Owen branded it [...] "sumptuous Sunday evening viewing". He thought the [...] "wonderful" [...] sets and costumes were better than those featured in fellow period drama Downton Abbey.|$|E

60|$|The tapping at {{the door}} began again, and she ran to open it. The inexorable housemaid was there; she <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Maybough was frightened at her not finding either of the young ladies in their rooms, and had sent her {{to see if they}} were in the studio.|$|R

2500|$|It {{should also}} be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> M’Culloch’s {{attempts}} to get the (perhaps disgruntled) [...] Heritors to repair the dilapidated church met with little success. He therefore began preaching in a tent next to the church, using letters and printed sermons from New England detailing the extraordinary events taking place there — the so-called First Great Awakening. The lack of a minister for many years had led to {{a huge number of}} [...] "fellowships", or praying societies, in the parish. Now Mr M’Culloch added another ingredient — the letters and sermons were supplemented by sermons on his own specialist theme [...] "Regeneration: its nature and necessity". Mr M’Culloch’s readings from the pulpit, along with his private conversations with concerned parishioners, laid a solid foundation for the historical events that soon followed — the extraordinary events known as the Cambuslang Work — or [...] "wark" [...] in Scots — referring to the [...] "work of the Lord". Later, Mr M’Culloch claimed some 400 people had been converted during the Cambuslang Work, including 70 from Cambuslang itself. It is typical of his modesty that we do not know if he himself ever eventually experienced conversion, though he did exclaim at one point during his last illness [...] "The whole is shortly summed up in the words of Jesus Christ; ‘He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned’" ...|$|E
