50|$|In Yemen (as also in Israel), the all-male social-gathering {{always takes}} place around set tables, {{on which a}} variety of dainties have been laid up, with {{beverages}} (never actually <b>solid</b> <b>foodstuffs),</b> and traditionally opens with a nashīd. The first to perform {{this is the most}} distinguished of the guests at the social-gathering, usually the rabbi, even if he were not a man with a pleasant voice, neither an expert in terms of musical performance, seeing that the music of the nashīd is simple, similar to the music of liturgical poems (piyyutim) recited in the synagogues, expressing longing and emotion. After he commences with the nashīd, the performance passes unto a more experienced man in the congregation, known for his musical talents and who is called by the Hebrew word, meshorer (singer of poetry).|$|E

We use drinking water as a control carrier liquid for beverages and chewing gum base as a control for <b>solid</b> <b>foodstuffs.</b> We compare the taste of different materials of similar particle size and the mouthfeel of a given material at varying particle sizes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue {{to their}} growing consumption, {{ready-made}} meals {{are a major}} dietary component for many people in today's society, representing an important potential {{route of human exposure}} to several food contaminants. The recent restrictions in the use of bisphenol A have led the plastic industry to look for alternative chemicals, most of them belonging to the same family of p,p′-bisphenols. The aim of the current work was to develop and validate a method based on stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol A and its main analogs – bisphenol S, 4, 4 ′-sulfonylbis(2 -methylphenol), bisphenol F, bisphenol E, bisphenol B, bisphenol Z, bisphenol AF, bisphenol AP, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol P – in <b>solid</b> <b>foodstuffs,</b> and particularly in ready-made meals. Extraction was carried out by ultrasound-assisted extraction after sample disruption with sand. A selective solid-phase extraction procedure was then applied to reduce potential matrix interferences. Derivatization of bisphenols with pyridine- 3 -sulfonyl chloride increased their ionization efficiency by electrospray ionization. Validation of the proposed method was performed in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, linearity, precision, measurement uncertainty, trueness and limits of detection. Satisfactory repeatability and intermediate precision were obtained; the related relative standard deviations were ≤ 7. 8 % and ≤ 10 %, respectively. The relative expanded uncertainty (k= 2) was below 17 % for all bisphenol analogs and the trueness of the method was demonstrated by spike recovery experiments. Low limits of detection, in the range from 0. 025 μgkg− 1 to 0. 140 μgkg− 1, were obtained for all compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, it was eventually applied to several ready-made meals purchased from different supermarkets in Belgium...|$|E
40|$|Triheptanoin-enriched diets {{have been}} {{successfully}} used in the experimental treatment of various metabolic disorders. Maximal therapeutic effect is achieved {{in the context of}} a ketogenic diet where triheptanoin oil provides 30 - 40 % of the daily caloric intake. However, pre-clinical studies using triheptanoin-rich diets are hindered by the difficulty of administering to laboratory animals as a <b>solid</b> <b>foodstuff.</b> In the present study, we successfully synthesized triheptanoin to the highest standards of purity from glycerol and heptanoic acid, using sulfonated charcoal as a catalyst. Triheptanoin oil was then formulated as a solid, stable and palatable preparation using a ketogenic base and a combination of four commercially available formulation agents: hydrophilic fumed silica, hydrophobic fumed silica, microcrystalline cellulose, and talc. Diet compliance and safety was tested on C 57 Bl/ 6 mice over a 15 -week period, comparing overall status and body weight change. Practical applications: This work provides a complete description of (i) an efficient and cost-effective synthesis of triheptanoin and (ii) its formulation as a solid, stable, and palatable ketogenic diet (triheptanoin-rich; 39 % of the caloric intake) for rodents. Triheptanoin-rich diets will be helpful on pre-clinical experiments testing the therapeutic efficacy of triheptanoin in different rodent models of human diseases. In addition, using the same solidification procedure, other oils could be incorporated into rodent ketogenic diet to study their dosage and long-term effects on mammal health and development. This approach could be extremely valuable as ketogenic diet is widely used clinically for epilepsy treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{increasing}} {{improvements in the}} quality of food products conducted to an increased interest in osmotic treatment. This technology involves the partial dehydration of a water-rich <b>solid</b> <b>foodstuff,</b> either whole or in pieces, through immersion in an osmotic solution. In fact, osmotic treatment is applied with the goal of modifying the composition of food material through partial water removal and impregnation of solutes, without affecting the structural integrity of products. Three kinds of osmotic treatments have been used, depending on the pressure applied on the system: OD (osmotic dehydration at atmospheric pressure), VOD (osmotic dehydration at vacuum pressure) and PVOD (pulsed vacuum osmotic dehydration). However, the most common are OD and VOD technologies. Some of the potential applications of osmotic treatment in food technology include: (i) the development of compositionally formulated products by introducing functional food ingredients, such as firming agents, antioxidants, antimicrobial and nutraceuticals; (ii) preserving color, texture, natural flavor and aroma and any heat-sensitive nutrient components; and (iii) pre-treatment before freeze-drying for improving final product quality. However, the osmotic treatment on this wide range of applications requires an appropriate choice and control of operating conditions, such as processing temperature, pressure, time, composition, geometry of the food pieces and contact between the food pieces and the solution. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the main effects of operating conditions and responses of the porous fruits to osmotic treatment, both at atmospheric and vacuum pressure, and to describe the important developments related to this technology in the fruit industry. Quality aspects of osmotic treatments on processed fruits, as well as technical challenges of this technique will also be discussed...|$|R

The recent restrictions in the use of bisphenol A have led the plastic industry to look for alternative chemicals, most of them belonging to the same family of p,p’-bisphenols. However, data on the occurrence of these new bisphenol analogues in foodstuffs are still scarce. Thus, the aim of the current work was to develop and validate a method based on stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography‒tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol A and its main analogues ‒ bisphenol S, 4, 4 '-sulfonylbis(2 -methylphenol), bisphenol F, bisphenol E, bisphenol B, bisphenol Z, bisphenol AF, bisphenol AP, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol P ‒ in <b>solid</b> <b>foodstuffs,</b> and particularly in ready-made meals.

The proposed method was successfully applied to several ready-made meals purchased from different supermarkets in Belgium. Bisphenol A was detected in all samples at concentrations up to 17. 6 ± 2. 9 µg kg- 1, whereas among the bisphenol analogues, only bisphenol S and bisphenol F were found in one sample of canned beef ravioli.
