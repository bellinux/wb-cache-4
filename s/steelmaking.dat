5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of basic oxygen <b>steelmaking</b> (BOS), {{developed in the}} 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen <b>steelmaking</b> is superior to previous <b>steelmaking</b> methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The improvement of <b>steelmaking</b> processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of wrought iron from pig iron to make swords.|$|E
5|$|Further {{refinements}} in the process, such {{as basic}} oxygen <b>steelmaking</b> (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods {{by further lowering}} the cost of production and increasing {{the quality of the}} final product. Today, steel {{is one of the most}} common man-made materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. <b>Steelmaking,</b> including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|New {{methods of}} {{producing}} it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, {{new methods of}} producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new <b>steelmaking</b> process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of <b>steelmaking</b> or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the blast furnace process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} reflects Troy's {{evolution from}} its origins as a Hudson River port into an early industrial center built around textile manufacture and <b>steelmaking.</b> During this period it was rebuilt {{twice in the}} wake of two devastating fires, resulting in its mix of architecture styles. After the decline of its industries in the mid-20th century, downtown Troy was threatened by urban renewal efforts that galvanized local preservationists, leading to the early NRHP listings and eventually the creation of the district.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} in <b>steelmaking</b> {{began with the}} {{introduction}} of Henry Bessemer's Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in <b>steelmaking.</b> Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, the Angle Mills {{site was}} the largest steel plate factory in the world. In 1892, in {{addition}} to <b>steelmaking,</b> the company had a foundry (a mile from Consett at Crookhall) capable of making 150 tons of iron castings per week, and a brickworks capable of making around 12,000 bricks per week. The estate had grown to roughly 2,700 workers' cottages. The company ran a 16-bed infirmary to treat injured workers. The 6,000 workers were paid an average of £5.33 a month. The company continually invested in modern equipment, such as a Roots blower (a powerful air pump) that was acquired in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for <b>steelmaking</b> and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in <b>steelmaking.</b> The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved <b>steelmaking</b> technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of <b>steelmaking</b> brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E
5|$|The {{manganese}} content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around {{the beginning of}} the 19th century, manganese was used in <b>steelmaking</b> and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of Parkinson's disease. In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, <b>steelmaking</b> to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|The British Iron and Steel Research Association was {{originally}} established at No.11 Park Lane in June 1944, an institution responsible {{for much of}} the automation of modern <b>steelmaking.</b> It has since moved to No.24 Buckingham Gate. The contact lens pioneer, Keith Clifford Hall held a practice at No.139, later expanding to No140, from 1945 to 1964. The site of his practice is now commemorated by a green heritage plaque. The film and stage actress Anna Neagle lived at Alford House on Park Lane between 1950 and 1964 with her husband Herbert Wilcox; the location of which is now marked with a green heritage plaque. The hotel trade continued to prosper; construction of the London Hilton on Park Lane at 22 Park Lane began in 1960 and opened in 1963 at a construction cost of £8m (now £). On 5 September 1975, a Provisional IRA bomb exploded at the hotel, killing two people and injuring over 60. The blast also damaged neighbouring properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been {{controlled}} by many groups, from the Brigantes, the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain, to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction. The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until {{the unification of}} Britain under the Stuarts, with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles {{of many of the}} political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from trade unionism to Manchester Capitalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving, shipbuilding, <b>steelmaking</b> and mining. The deindustrialisation that followed {{in the second half of}} the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in <b>steelmaking</b> influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in <b>steelmaking,</b> {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{cyanamide}} is {{also used}} as a wire-fed alloy in <b>steelmaking,</b> in order to introduce nitrogen into the steel.|$|E
25|$|Advances in technology, {{such as the}} {{development}} of the widestrip continuous sheet mill, made most of the skilled jobs in <b>steelmaking</b> obsolete.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{industry}} such as <b>steelmaking</b> and {{petroleum refining}} {{that characterizes the}} economy of northern Lake County {{does not have a}} significant presence in Merrillville.|$|E
25|$|Corby {{became a}} <b>steelmaking</b> centre through the {{establishment}} of the Stewarts & Lloyds production site in the 1930s, and by 1960 had grown {{to become one of the}} most heavily industrialised areas in the Midlands. In 1981 however the plant had become unprofitable and owners British Steel Corporation closed the site. By then it was one of the largest <b>steelmaking</b> operations in Western Europe, covering , with four blast furnaces, two coke oven complexes and associated facilities. During its operation a huge quantity of industrial waste, including toxic waste, had been deposited there.|$|E
25|$|The Sons of Vulcan {{provided}} 85 {{percent of}} the new union's membership, and dominated the new organization for much of its early history. Its membership was almost exclusive to the iron industry, as <b>steelmaking</b> was still in its infancy.|$|E
25|$|The crest, {{on top of}} the helm, shows a blast furnace. This is also {{referred}} to in the Latin motto: Refulget labores nostros coelum or The heavens reflect our labours popularly attributed to the glow observed in the night sky from the <b>steelmaking</b> activities.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{graphite}} {{is mostly}} consumed for refractories, batteries, <b>steelmaking,</b> expanded graphite, brake linings, foundry facings and lubricants. Graphene, which occurs naturally in graphite, has unique physical properties and {{is among the}} strongest substances known. However, the process of separating it from graphite will require more technological development.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{successful}} {{first use of}} the hot-blast technique in the U.S. {{was carried out in}} 1835 at Oxford Furnace in Warren County, New Jersey, by William Henry, Seldon Scranton's father-in-law. By 1838, Henry had moved to the Lackawanna Valley, where he was experimenting with using anthracite coal in <b>steelmaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Huntington {{is still}} a base for the {{metalworking}} and welding trades with the repair of railroad rolling stock, barges, and river boat equipment. Major fabricating firms—such as Huntington Special Metals, Steel of West Virginia, Martin Steel, Huntington Plating, Richwood Industries, Evans Welding and Fabricating Co, and Hammers Industries—serve the railroads, river transportation, <b>steelmaking,</b> coal, oil, natural gas, electrical, windpower, biofuel, and other important industries.|$|E
25|$|Belgium was {{the first}} {{continental}} European country to undergo the Industrial Revolution, in the early 19th century. Liège and Charleroi rapidly developed mining and <b>steelmaking,</b> which flourished until the mid-20th century in the Sambre and Meuse valley and made Belgium among {{one of the three}} most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis, and the region experienced famine from 1846 to 1850.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} fuel on Mars. Carbon monoxide/oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the atmosphere of Mars by zirconia electrolysis, without using any Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel. Likewise, blast furnace gas collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on Cowper stoves and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on open hearth <b>steelmaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} that he was a referee, McClung also pursued a career in <b>steelmaking.</b> His first work was as a chemist at the Carnegie Steel Company's Carrie Furnace in Rankin, Pennsylvania. During that time, he took up {{residence}} in Pittsburgh. Sometime in 1898, McClung was hired as the assistant superintendent at the blast furnaces of the Cambria Steel Company. After serving that position for about five years, he was hired by the Illinois Steel Company and was made the superintendent of the company's Joliet iron and steel blast furnaces. McClung would hold the position until his death, five years later.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{started in}} the UK with an initial {{concentration}} on the textile industry, followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining and <b>steelmaking.</b> British merchants, shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains {{a significant part of}} the economy but accounted for only 16.7% of national output in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{produced}} at Zug Island is transported in hot metal cars via rail to <b>steelmaking</b> {{at the main}} plant while DTE's coke is shipped via rail to supply consumers, chiefly ISG/Mittal, in the merchant metallurgical market. During the industry's peak, thousands of workers were employed on the island with {{a large percentage of}} the downriver community supported by the local steel producer. Today a few hundred people work on the island with the hourly workers at U.S. Steel represented by United Steelworkers Local 1299. In fall of 2008 U.S. Steel halted its production due to the economic downturn, but restarted its production in fall of 2009.|$|E
