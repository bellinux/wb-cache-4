40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of undetected radiographically iatrogenic longitudinal <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anterior cortex during intramedullary nailing of the femur {{has not been}} well documented. Methods Cadaveric study using nine pairs of fresh-frozen femora from adult cadavers. The nine pairs of femora underwent a standardized antegrade intramedullary nailing and the detection of iatrogenic lesions, if any, was performed macroscopically and by radiographic control. Results Longitudinal <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anterior cortex was revealed in 5 of 18 cadaver femora macroscopically. Anterior splitting was not detectable in radiographic control. Conclusion Longitudinal <b>splitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anterior cortex during intramedullary nailing of the femur cannot be detected radiographically. </p...|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} other LCL hopefuls, Playford journeyed around the {{electorate}} advocating his platform. The constituency had a considerable German element, descendants of refugees who had escaped persecution in the German Empire. Grateful for the past help of Playford's grandfather, they swung their strong support behind {{him and he was}} comfortably elected to the South Australian House of Assembly. With a <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Labor vote, the first LCL government was formed with Richard Layton Butler as Premier.|$|E

This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party.

Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Carrossier Normand was considered the best carriage horses available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and Anglo-Norman (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob. In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. When the original Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E

5|$|Home Rule was the {{key issue}} in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government {{and representatives of}} the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over these provisions led to a <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E

5|$|In February 1872 Bruce {{proposed}} {{a bill that}} took some of the commission's recommendations, but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to {{the whole of the}} UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Josephine rejected it in its entirety and published The New Era, a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re-published in serial form in The Shield. It was the first <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In February 1956 Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of {{personality}} at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and {{embarked on a}} reform course. The de-Stalinization of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a difficult position. While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.|$|E

In the 4200m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway point when Kerry jumped in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth {{by the end of his}} leg, just 0.78s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1m 52.64s, the 18th fastest <b>split</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race.

5|$|The Finns faced a {{detrimental}} {{interaction of}} power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917.

The Social Democrats wanted to retain the civil rights achieved and increase socialists' power over the society. The conservatives feared to lose the long-held socioeconomic might.
