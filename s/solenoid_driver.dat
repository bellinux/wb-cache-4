40|$|In {{order to}} {{digitally}} control the bonding {{force of a}} wire bonder precisely, this paper uses a DC solenoid as a force source, and by controlling the solenoid’s current, which causes the electromagnetic force, we can control the bonding force that capillary applies. The bonding force control system in this {{paper is composed of}} PC (Personal Computer) and hypogyny MCU (Micro Controller Unit), which communicate using a RS 485 interface. The digital value of a given bonding force is given by the PC to the MCU. By comparing the sampling current of the solenoid, and through PID regulation, D/A converter of the digital potentiometer and the <b>solenoid</b> <b>driver</b> circuit, the half-closed loop control system of bonding force is accomplished. Tuning of the PID parameters is accomplished with fuzzy adaptive control theory and simulated by Matlab simulink. The control system is tested by comparing the desired bonding force and the force actually applied and examming the relationship between bonding quality and bonding force. </p...|$|E
40|$|Our {{mission was}} {{to build a new}} robot for the RoboCup competition. Based on last year’sRoboCup project it was {{determined}} that the Pioneer 3 -DX robot would be too slow to becompetitive in competition. Our goal was to create an Omni-directional robot that will move at acompetitive speed. Our team has designed new components as well as using componentsdesigned by the previous team. The <b>solenoid</b> <b>driver</b> and proximity sensing circuit designed bythe previous team is utilized in our design. Several designs were proposed and evaluated for theplatform, wheel orientation, kicking mechanism, power supply, drivers and microcontrollers. The final design is a combination of a bullet and pyramid shaped platform with four Omnidirectionalwheels that are controlled by single channel motor drivers. It has a pneumaticswinging kicking mechanism designed to propel the ball 4 meters through the air. The robot isdesigned to achieve a minimum velocity of 2 m/s. It uses a high level 32 -bit microcontroller andis powered by a single 25. 9 V Li-Polymer battery. The robot uses sensors to enable kicking andreport position. The robot is expandable with a CAN bus and a full speed USB port...|$|E
40|$|The current {{automotive}} IC sector counts {{hundreds of}} different systems, standard products or ASICs, for the inductive load drivers application. Many of them, such injector drivers, DC/brushless motor <b>drivers,</b> <b>solenoid</b> <b>drivers,</b> {{are designed to}} work in a specific operating mode, with fixed architecture and parameters. Since the need of different applications increases, a flexible approach to the design is mandatory. The state of the art offers only software-oriented systems to overcome these problems, which require embedded MCU. In this paper, an alternative system design for inductive load driver is proposed. It is based on an optimized and flexible architecture. With this flexible approach, it is possible to implement most of the topology scheme with regulation feedback and a programmable solution for shaping the current waveform into the loads...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Solenoid valve {{is the key}} {{component}} to determine the performance of {{electronic fuel injection system}} for the diesel engine. By theoretically analyzing the characteristics of <b>solenoid</b> valve <b>driver,</b> we found out that one of the factors that affect the closing and opening speed of solenoid valve is drive current. In this paper, GT-Flow software is used to simulate and analyze the drive current, and come to the optimal combination of current. The selected drive current is used to analyze the emission performance of 16 V 265 H diesel engine, to determine the best advance angle for fuel supply, and to compare the simulation results with the experimental values. ...|$|R
