40|$|AbstractPurposeEndovascular {{repair of}} infrarenal {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAA) {{is associated with}} a risk of late treatment failure due to persistent endoleak, aneurysm enlargement, infection, loss of device integrity, or graft thrombosis. This report describes our experience with <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> (delayed explantation) of failed infrarenal AAA endografts. Patients and methodsDuring an eight-year period, a total of 319 patients underwent infrarenal AAA endovascular repair. Of these, nine (2. 8 %) patients underwent <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> to open surgical repair following endovascular repair. The time interval between endograft placement and <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> was 24 ± 13 months (range, 2 - 48 months). ResultsThe indications for <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> were endograft infection (n = 1), aortic aneurysm enlargement (> 5 mm) with (n = 6) or without endoleak (n = 2). Explanted endografts included the following devices: Excluder (WL Gore, n = 1), AneuRx (Medtronic AVE, n = 1), and Ancure/EVT tube (Guidant, n = 7). All patients underwent successful aortic bypass grafting following endograft removal. Mean follow-up after conversion was 29 ± 28 months (range, 4 - 72 months). Due to variations in device design, a range of operative techniques were used to facilitate endograft explantation. Removal of Ancure/EVT tube and Excluder endografts necessitated suprarenal aortic clamping in order to facilitate circumferential detachment of the proximal endograft hooks and barbs. In addition, explant procedures were assisted by cooling of AneuRx and Excluder endografts with iced saline so as to contract the Nitinol stent scaffold. The method of aortic reconstruction was aortobiiliac (n = 7), aortouniiliac (n = 1), and axillobifemoral (n = 1). The postoperative length of stay was 20 ± 21 days (range, 7 - 70 days) and associated morbidity included non–Q wave myocardial infarction (n = 1), respiratory failure requiring reintubation (n = 1), endocarditis (n = 1), and urinary tract infection (n = 2). Thirty-day perioperative mortality was 11 % (1 / 9). ConclusionDespite the overall high technical and clinical success rates of endovascular AAA repair, the risk of late failure remains. Unique challenges are associated with removal of aortic endografts and preoperative planning requires careful consideration of distinct differences among endograft designs. Physicians should be aware of these modes of failure and the technical details to intervene on the failed endograft...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the results of laparoscopic {{management}} of acute small bowel obstruction (SBO) from abdominal adhesions to both exploratory laparotomy and <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> to open surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients (mean age 61 years) with adhesion-induced SBO were divided into successful laparoscopy (66 patients [71 %]), <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> (24 [26 %]), and primary laparotomy (three patients). RESULTS: Patients with successful laparoscopy had more simple adhesions (57 %), fewer prior operations, and lower American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class. Operative time was shortest in the laparoscopy group (74. 3 +/- 4. 4 min), as was the duration of both intensive care unit and hospital stay. Mortality was 6 %, regardless of operative technique. CONCLUSIONS: A trial of laparoscopic adhesiolysis by a surgeon with advanced laparoscopic skills seems advisable in the majority of patients with acute adhesive SBO, whereas patients with more extensive adhesions, higher ASA class, and more than two prior abdominal operations often require laparotomy to achieve equally satisfactory outcome...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{identify}} factors {{that increase the}} risk of conversion to open surgery following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and to assess their outcome. Design analysis of 1871 patients enrolled in the EUROSTAR collaborators registry. Materials and Methods: patient characteristics, anatomic features of the aneurysm, type of endovascular device, institutional experience and the year in which the procedure was performed were related to risk of conversion. Results: forty-nine patients (2. 6 %) required conversion. In 38 patients conversion was performed during the first postoperative month (primary conversions) and in 11 patients during follow-up (secondary conversions). Primary conversion was mostly due to access problems and device migration. Secondary conversions were performed for rupture in six and for a persistent endoleak, with or without aneurysmal growth, in five patients. Patients who were converted were significantly older, had a lower body weight, and had a higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conversion was associated with shorter, wider infrarenal necks and larger aneurysms. The conversion rate was lower when a team had performed more than 30 procedures, and in procedures performed during {{the last two years of}} the study period. The conversion rate was higher with EVT or Talent devices. Patients who required primary conversion had an 18 % mortality rate, compared to 2. 5 % mortality in patients without conversion (p< 0. 01). <b>Secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> was associated with a perioperative mortality of 27 %, and when performed for rupture 50 %.

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{retrospective}} single-center study analyzed long-term results after LifePath (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, Calif) endoprosthesis implantation for abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA), primarily {{focusing on the}} wire form fracture issue and consecutive endoleak rate. MethodsBetween 1999 and 2004, all consecutive patients with LifePath AAA devices in our institution {{were included in the}} retrospective analysis. All patients had computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging preoperatively and image postprocessing. The follow-up using CTA imaging specifically addressed material fatigue (wire form fractures) resulting in migrations and type I endoleaks. ResultsDuring the 6 -year study period, which included the 1 -year withdrawal and redesign of the device, 51 patients were treated with LifePath AAA endografts. The 30 -day mortality was 0 %. The perioperative 30 -day morbidity was 9. 8 %. One patient required a primary conversion due to misdeployment of the iliac limbs within the graft main body. The primary endoleak rate was 20. 56 % (type I, 2 %; type II, 19. 6 %). During the mean follow-up of 40. 7 months, 12 patients died, six were lost to follow-up, and 32 underwent subsequent CTA imaging. Eight patients (25 %) demonstrated a proximal type I endoleak, seven (22 %) had a type II endoleak, and three had a type III endoleak (9 %). In nine patients (28. 1 %), wire form fractures could be detected at image postprocessing. Four patients required a <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion</b> due to endoleak and aneurysm growth (2 type I endoleaks and 2 type III endoleaks). ConclusionWire form fracture is the major structural problem in the LifePath balloon-expandable endograft device, resulting in a significant endoleak rate. We must caution those patients with a LifePath device in-situ that careful follow-up must be performed due to material fatigue and they should consider <b>secondary</b> <b>conversion...</b>|$|E

Inspection of the shapes of thermo-nephelograms (bscat vs temperature) also revealed that photochemically formed aerosols have distinctly different thermo-nephelograms than those obtained on humid “hazy” days.

Methods: The records of 60 high-risk AAA patients (52 men, 8 women; mean age 74 years) who were treated with infrarenal (n 538) or suprarenal (n 522) endografts and had serial computed tomograms (CT) over $ 12 months were analyzed.
