Open water leads are formed by the winds, tides, and currents. These leads expose water near 0 °C to much colder air, which results in the rapid formation of ice. With the formation and growth of ice salt is simultaneously pushed out back into the ocean due to gravity (gravity drainage) as well as outward which form brine channels extending to the surface.  This results in high saline “surface skim” that is usually 5 °C to 10 °C warmer than the surrounding air forming new sea ice. Typically a temperature difference between the ice surface and the air of at least 15 °C is required, though this can be reduced if the air is very humid. In these conditions a layer of <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour</b> occurs due to the [...] "surface skim" [...] providing excess water vapor. As the warmer, wet air meets the overlying cold air it becomes supersaturated and condenses allowing small crystals to form a nucleus on the sea ice surface's imperfections and grow by vapor deposition. In general, frost flowers only form in relatively windless conditions; in high winds the supersaturated layer is scrubbed from the surface and blowing snow obscures the ice surface.|$|E

Canonical ensemble molecular dynamics simulation using the Yasuoka-Matsumoto method is applied to nucleation in <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapours</b> that contain more carbon dioxide than in the saturated state at the dew line. Established molecular models are employed that are known to accurately reproduce the VLE of the pure fluids as well as their binary and ternary mixtures.

Simulation results for the carrier gas influence on the nucleation rate are compared with the classical nucleation theory (CNT) considering the "pressure effect" [Phys. Rev.

It is found that the presence of air as a carrier gas decreases the nucleation rate only slightly and, in particular, to a significantly lower extent than predicted by CNT. The nucleation rate of carbon dioxide is generally underestimated by CNT, leading to a deviation between one and two orders of magnitude for pure carbon dioxide {{in the vicinity of the}} spinodal line and up to three orders of magnitude in presence of air as a carrier gas.

40|$|Abstract. For the {{analysis}} of the release of fission product aerosols from reactor cor- in a severe accident, it is necessary to understand the process of homogeneous nucleation of droplets from a <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour,</b> including the dependence on system pressure, which can vary greatly {{depending on the type of}} accident. A model of the effect of carrier gas on the nucleation process is presented, based on the changes to the energy distribution of nucleating vapour molecule clusters induced by~callisions with carrier gas molecules. The rate of nucleation is altered since the cluster decay rate is strongly energy dependent. The approach is compared with previous treatments of the problem, illustrating the impottance of using an equilibrium cluster energy distribution which goes beyond a Gaussian approximation. and clarifying previous confusion between cluster temperature and cluster energy in the literature. Calculations of nucleation rates are performed for n-nonane in argon and water vapour in air, and show that an analytic approximation gives a reasonable approximation to numerical results. However, the resulting pressure depen-dence of the nucleation rate is weaker than has been observed experimentally suggesting that additional mechanisms operate. 1...|$|E
40|$|This review {{highlights}} recent {{observations from}} {{a large number of}} studies investigating formation and growth within different environments and discusses the importance of various mechanisms of particle formation and growth between the different environments. Whilst, several mechanisms for new particle formation have been proposed the importance of each mechanism is still the centre of much debate. Proposed nucleation mechanisms include condensation of a binary mixture of sulfuric acid and water; ternary nucleation of sulfuric acid, water and a third molecule, most likely ammonia; ion induced nucleation; secondary organic aerosol formation involving condensation of low or non volatile organic compounds and homogeneous nucleation of iodine oxides. Laboratory and modelling studies have shown these mechanisms can occur in the atmosphere although the contribution depends on the concentrations of precursor compounds present. In addition, atmospheric particle formation events are significantly affected by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity and the surface area of pre-existing particles, which is also discussed here. One major problem hampering our current understanding is that these new particles are smaller than the lower size detection limit of most instruments and are only observed after some particle growth has occurred. Particles growth occurs through condensation of <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapours</b> {{on the surface of the}} nucleated particles. This requires a lower degree of supersaturation than nucleation and thus condensation of the nucleating species reduces the rate of particle formation. Therefore, it is believed that particle growth often occurs through the condensation of other gases, including organic and inorganic compounds, than those responsible for nucleation. This decoupling of nucleation and growth means that the individual gases responsible for nucleation and growth can be unclear. Since observations of particle formation only occur following growth to observable sizes it is possible that a pool of undetectable particles exist at all times but are only observed following significant condensational growth...|$|R

The obtained results suggest that both gaseous sulphuric acid and organic vapours contribute to organic particle formation in continental background areas. The initial growth of freshly-nucleated clusters is driven mainly by condensation of gaseous sulphuric acid and by a lesser extent self-coagulation. After the clusters have reached sizes of around 2 nm in diameter, low-volatile organic vapours start to condense spontaneously into the clusters, thereby accelerating their growth to detectable sizes. A shortage of gaseous sulphuric acid or organic vapours limit, or suppress altogether, the particle formation, since freshly-nucleated clusters are rapidly coagulated away by pre-existing particles.

Grand canonical MD with McDonald's daemon is discussed in the present contribution and applied for sampling both nucleation kinetics and steady-state properties of a <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour.</b> The idea behind that approach is to simulate the production of clusters up to a given size for a specified supersaturation.

We have applied an optimal velocity model including stochastic noise, where cars {{are treated as}} moving and interacting particles. The motion of N cars is described by the system of 2 N stochastic differential equations with multiplicative white noise. Our system of cars behaves in qualitatively different ways depending on the values of control parameters c (dimensionless density), b (sensitivity parameter characterising the fastness of relaxation), and a (dimensionless noise intensity). In analogy to the gas–liquid phase transition in <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour</b> at low enough temperatures, we observe three different regimes of traffic flow at small enough values of b < bcr. There is the free flow regime (like gaseous phase) at small densities of cars, the coexistence of a jam and free flow (like liquid and gas) at intermediate densities, and homogeneous dense traffic (like liquid phase) at large densities. The transition from free flow to congested traffic occurs when the homogeneous solution becomes unstable and evolves into the limit cycle. The opposite process takes place at a different density, {{so that we have}} a hysteresis effect and phase transition of the first order.

At the present time, such explosion hazards are controlled using explosion suppression systems based around Halon 1301 deployment. However, due to its environmental impact, such methods are being reviewed with the objective being their replacement with environmentally friendly alternatives. During the course of this study, the effect of water in the form of vapour and 'fine' mists has been investigated to determine its effectiveness in the containment and control of a potential methane explosion. Laminar flame/water interaction has been studied in considerable detail, {{and to a lesser extent}} the interaction with turbulent burning mechanisms has been studied through a demonstration study based on the conclusions of the laminar flame studies the efficiency of water in various concentrations and states (vapour or liquid-droplets) has been appraised. The research studies have also necessitated fundamental studies of droplet formation via <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapours,</b> within small-scale laboratory test facilities, and methods suitable for generating large-scale sprays deemed suitable for the replacement of Halon systems were then appraised and characterised so as safety systems of the future may be optimised. The laminar test programme illustrated that water is a competitive explosion suppressant capable of extinguishing a fully propagating flame. It was found that water vapour and 'fine' water droplets are most effective in the mitigation of methane-air flames during early flame formation when curvature effects are a predominant factor, with 'fine' water droplets being more effective than vapour at this time. Turbulent experiments demonstrated that water in the form of 'fine' droplets can be used to fully arrest a propagating stoichiometric methane-air explosion, at concentrations probably less than the molar water concentration associated with inerting methane air explosions. A system based on the 'flashing' concept was fully characterised to illustrate that sprays similar to those utilised in the laboratory combustion work can be produced in a full- scale release, leading to the conclusions that Halon based systems may in the near future be replaced by environmentally sound explosion suppression systems that utilise water.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{growth of}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) into cloud droplets under <b>supersaturated</b> water <b>vapour</b> conditions {{is described by}} classic Köhler theory. This spontaneous activation of CCN depends on the interplay between the Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water activity or increasing solute concentration, and the Kelvin effect, whereby activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with decreasing surface tension, which is sensitive to surfactants. Surface tension lowering caused by organic surfactants, which diminishes the Kelvin effect, {{is expected to be}} negated by a concomitant reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by the displacement of surfactant molecules from the droplet bulk to the droplet–vapour interface. Here we present observational and theoretical evidence illustrating that, in ambient air, surface tension lowering can prevail over the reduction in the Raoult effect, leading to substantial increases in cloud droplet concentrations. We suggest that consideration of liquid–liquid phase separation, leading to complete or partial engulfing of a hygroscopic particle core by a hydrophobic organic-rich phase, can explain the lack of concomitant reduction of the Raoult effect, while maintaining substantial lowering of surface tension, even for partial surface coverage. Apart from the importance of particle size and composition in droplet activation, we show by observation and modelling that incorporation of phase-separation effects into activation thermodynamics can lead to a CCN number concentration that is up to ten times what is predicted by climate models, changing the properties of clouds. An adequate representation of the CCN activation process is essential to the prediction of clouds in climate models, and given the effect of clouds on the Earth’s energy balance, improved prediction of aerosol–cloud–climate interactions is likely to result in improved assessments of future climate change...|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneous {{condensation}} of vapours {{mixed with}} a carrier gas in the stagnation point boundary layer flow near a cold wall is considered {{in the presence of}} solid particles much larger than the mean free path of vapour particles. The <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour</b> condenses on the particles by diffusion and particles and droplets are thermophoretically attracted to the wall. Assuming that the heat of vaporization is much larger than the Boltzmann constant times the temperature far from the wall, vapour condensation occurs in a condensation layer (CL). The CL width and characteristics depend on the parameters of the problem, and a parameter R yielding the rate of vapour scavenging by solid particles is particularly important. Assuming that the CL is so narrow that temperature, particle density and velocity do not change appreciably inside it, an asymptotic theory is found, the δ-CL theory, that approximates very well the vapour and droplet profiles, the dew point shift and the deposition rates at the wall for wide ranges of the wall temperature T̃_w and the scavenging parameter R. This theory breaks down for T̃_w very close to the maximum temperature yielding non-zero droplet deposition rate, T̃_w,M. For large R, we can either assume that the width of the CL is zero (0 -CL theory, then the vapour density reaches local equilibrium with the condensate immediately after it enters the dew surface), or use a nonlinear multiple scales theory. The 0 -CL theory corrects the δ-CL theory for T̃_w very close to T̃_w,M and any R, whereas the multiple scales theory is appropriate for large and moderate R.

40|$|Homogeneous {{condensation}} of vapours {{mixed with}} a carrier gas in the stagnation point boundary layer flow near a cold wall is considered. There is a condensation region near the wall with <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour.</b> Assuming that the surface tension times the molecular area is {{much larger than the}} thermal energy far from the wall, droplets are nucleated exclusively in a narrow nucleation layer where the Zeldovich flux of clusters surpassing the critical nucleus size is at a maximum. The vapour condenses in the free molecular regime on the droplets, which are thermophoretically attracted to the wall. Unlike the narrow condensation region for heterogeneous condensation on solid particles, in the case of homogeneous condensation the condensation region is wide even when the rate of vapour scavenging by droplets is large. A singular perturbation theory of homogeneous vapour condensation in boundary layer flow approximates very well the vapour and droplet density profiles, the nucleation layer and the deposition rates at the wall for wide ranges of the wall temperature and the scavenging parameter B. A key point in the theory is to select a trial vapour number density profile among a one parameter family of profiles between an upper and a lower bound. The maximum of the Zeldovich flux for supercritical nuclei provides the approximate location of the nucleation layer and an approximate droplet density profile. Then the condensate number of molecules and the vapour density profile are calculated by matched asymptotic expansions that also yield the deposition rates. For sufficiently large wall temperatures, a more precise corrected asymptotic theory is given.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the emission of sub-micrometric particulate matter entrained in flue gases of industry and vehicles exhausts, {{is one of the}} most critical treats for human health because of the toxicological effects of ultrafine particles on the respiratory system and their ability to cross alveoli’s membranes reaching the circulatory system too. Albeit this scenario, the traditional particle abatement devices are mainly designed and optimised to treat particles larger than 1 μm, but they are far less effective towards the sub-micrometric particles. In particular, the existing technologies are far less efficient in collecting sub-micrometric particles, especially in the range 0. 1 - 1 μm, called Greenfield gap. The aim of this work is the study of the heterogeneous condensation, a promising method that can be used to achieve very high particles removal efficiency with reduced costs: particles undergoing heterogeneous condensation increase their diameter by deposition of a liquid film on the particles surface, generating a liquid-solid aerosol with desired diameter. Therefore, this process can be used as a preconditioning technique to enlarge the particles diameter at micrometric size, allowing the use of conventional separators for gas cleaning. Although largely studied for its effect on atmospheric phenomena and for the application to particle measurement techniques (the CPC units), heterogeneous condensation has never been used at industrial scale as a method for gas cleaning. In this study, theoretical and experimental analyses on the heterogeneous condensation have been carried out. For this purpose instrumented lab scale equipment has been designed, constructed and tested. Experimental protocols and measurement techniques have been optimized. The core of the equipment is the growth tube, that consists in a glass tube where the particle laden gas flows comes into contact with a <b>supersaturated</b> water <b>vapour</b> environment, generated by a liquid film flowing on the tube internal walls.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} early stages of {{crystallisation}} in the bulk, at surfaces and in pores. The main motivation is to achieve a greater understanding of the crystallisation of proteins in the presence of disordered porous media, although this research is applicable {{to a wide range of}} research fields. Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is used in conjunction with techniques such as forward flux sampling to measure the rate of nucleation of crystals. Initially, the 2 d Ising model is used to simulate nucleation in rectangular pores with one open end. By calculating the rate of nucleation from pores with different pore widths we show that the overall rate of nucleation peaks at a certain pore width. To investigate effects from crystallisation we used a simple system of spherical particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. Our typical conditions of study are below the triple point temperature where the equilibrium phase is crystal. As a pre-requisite to investigating crystallisation in pores we studied bulk transitions and surface transitions at planar surfaces. We find that, starting from a bulk <b>supersaturated</b> <b>vapour,</b> crystallisation occurs via two distinct steps. In the first step, a liquid droplet nucleates from the vapour. Then, the crystal phase nucleates in the liquid droplet, provided that this liquid droplet exceeds a minimum size. Since it has been shown that similar sized crystallites have lower free energies in highly defected structures such as icosahedral and decahedral ordering we investigated the role of defects in our- nucleated crystallites. Crystallites with defects patterns similar to those seen in decahedral ordering are found to have lower relative free energies than those with fcc ordering. We also observe non-equilibrium effect which we suggest are due to the slow dynamics associated with defect formation. At a planar surface crystallisation is studied from liquid phase. We find that the surface behaviour, such as freezing and pre-freezing transitions, directly effects the nature of crystallisation. Far below freezing nucleation is well described by Classical Nucleation Theory but as the surface-particle interaction becomes more attractive the nuclei become more 2 dimensional. At surfaces with a strongly attractive surface-particle interaction, the formation of a surface crystal phase removes the barriers to bulk crystallisation. Whilst crystallisation behaviour in the bulk and at a planar surface appears qualitatively similar to that of liquid nucleation, this thesis shows that crystal nucleation in a wedge shaped pore is drastically different. Due to intrinsic angles in the crystal lattice, crystallisation is enhanced at angles that allow a defect-free unstrained piece of crystal to fit into the wedge. At other angles the formation of defects and strain causes a decrease in the rate of crystallisation. Our simulation using both the Ising and Lennard-Jones model show that crystallisation is enhanced from pores with a particular size and shape. Therefore, disordered porous media with a wide distribution of pore sizes and shapes may be needed as there is a greater chance that they will contain pores with the required geometry...|$|E
