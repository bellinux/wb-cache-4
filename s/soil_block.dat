A technique has been developed to study in detail and under controlled conditions, the preferential flow of water and solutes in large, intact <b>soil</b> <b>blocks,</b> isolated at field sites and transported to the laboratory. The <b>soil</b> <b>blocks,</b> 46 -cm (18 ") on each side (145 kg, 320 lb) were carefully cut with a flat shovel, then encased on the vertical sides with a polyurethane foam shell (inside a plywood box) to stabilize it during transport and later experimentation. The blocks were cut at least 46 cm deep to ensure that the A/B horizon interlayer was included. Unstable, preferential water flow (and solute movement) often occur...|$|R

The automation of the lysimeter allowed sample collection and storage over a user-defined period with no human interaction. As an example of the use of the automated lysimeter, results show the distribution of phosphate within the soil.

The loam soil retained 74 % of the unreactive P applied but was a net source of reactive P (the load increased by 61 %). This indicates leaching of native soil P or hydrolysis of organic compounds and complicates our understanding of P retention in buffer strip soils.

40|$|Oak {{woodlands}} in California intermingle {{with annual}} grasslands. They frequently have a grassy understorey, {{which has a}} distinct species composition and abundance unlike adjacent open communities. <b>Soil</b> <b>blocks</b> were reciprocally transplanted in autumn (at seed stage) between oak understorey and open grassland. Changes in species composition and species population densities were monitored over the following two years. Species composition of adult plants in the reciprocally transplanted <b>soil</b> <b>blocks</b> resembled the original 'donor' seed bank in the first spring after transplant, but {{in the second year}} it was not very different from the surrounding community in the 'receptor' habitat. In the <b>soil</b> <b>blocks</b> transplanted from the open grassland to the oak understorey, overall abundance was severely reduced after two years, and light-exigent species like Lolium multiflorum, Bromus mollis and Hypochoeris glabra were eliminated. When understorey plots, which had low initial seed reserves, were reciprocally transplanted into the open grassland, they were readily colonized by the high seed producers Lolium multiflorum and Bromus mollis, which outcompeted shade-tolerant species like Montia perfoliata and Galium aparine. However, Stellaria media, with a persistent seed bank, still survived and reproduced after two years in the open grassland. In a second experiment, <b>soil</b> <b>blocks</b> from both habitats were transplanted onto the top of an uniform soil base in large boxes in a fenced experimental site, and half of them were then subjected to artificial dense shade. Total plant density was severely reduced by shading, although Bromus diandrus, Carduus pycnocephalus and Stellaria media were the species least affected. Half of the shaded and full-sun plots in the uniform soil were clipped periodically. Avena fatua dominated the full-sun, unclipped plots, while adult plant densities of Lolium multiflorum, Bromus mollis and B. diandrus increased with the clipping treatment. Reduced radiation under evergreen oak canopy caused high seedling mortality of the transplanted open species and seems the main factor precluding their distribution in the oak woodland. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that artificial shading severely reduced the seedling density of open species. Reciprocally, strong interference by dominant tall grasses seems to limit the establishment of understorey species in the open grassland. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Plant roots, particularly of woody vegetation, apparently stabilize soil on slopes because in most areas where the vegetation is removed, frequent bank failure occurs. Plant roots increase soil-shearing resistance both directly by mechanical reinforcement and indirectly through removal of pore water by transpiration.

The growth traits of transgenic poplars (Populus alba) with decreased xyloglucan from overexpression of Aspergillus aculeatus xyloglucanase were characterized during a 4 -year field trial. The field-trial site consisted of two blocks, a fertile <b>soil</b> <b>block</b> and a non-fertile <b>soil</b> <b>block,</b> determined by soil analysis. In the fertile block, the growth of aboveground biomass of the transgenic poplars was reduced to 24 – 44  % compared to that of wild-type poplars, in contrast to the growth seen in chamber and greenhouse conditions. In the non-fertile block, the aboveground biomass of transgenic poplars was also smaller than that of the wild-type poplars. Because poplars reproduce asexually by root suckers, we also compared the formation of root suckers from transgenic and wild-type poplars. Root suckers formed less frequently from transgenic poplars than from wild-type poplars. The growth rates of root suckers from transgenic poplars were also slower than those from wild-type poplars. The results showed that constitutive degradation of xyloglucan impairs poplar growth and vegetative reproduction ability.|$|E
