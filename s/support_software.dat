25|$|A cross {{assembler}} (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is {{run on a}} computer or operating system (the host system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems {{that do not have}} the resources to <b>support</b> <b>software</b> development, such as an embedded system. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, either via read-only memory (ROM, EPROM, etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as Motorola S-record or Intel HEX.|$|E
2500|$|While {{some small}} {{communities}} {{continue to use}} 'low-tech' approaches to dispatch, in many places in the U.S. the technology is quite advanced. [...] Advanced technologies in use may include electronic mapping, Global Positioning System (GPS) or its first cousin Automatic vehicle location (AVL). [...] The use of decision <b>support</b> <b>software</b> such as AMPDS is also common, as are surveillance 'add-ons'. [...] As a result, many dispatchers are trained to a high level in their own right, triaging incoming calls by severity, and providing advice or medical guidance by telephone prior {{to the arrival of}} the ambulance or rescue squad on the scene. [...] Some are certified as EMTs or paramedics in their own states, and increasingly, are becoming certified as Emergency Medical Dispatchers.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with many}} things in Hong Kong, the {{dispatch}} of emergency vehicles continues {{to be influenced by}} the British legacy. [...] The telephone number for emergency services throughout Hong Kong is 999, just as in Britain. [...] All 999 calls are answered by the Hong Kong Police Force. [...] If an ambulance is the only response required, the call is passed directly to Hong Kong Fire Services dispatchers. [...] If the call information is complex, as with a traffic accident, the police dispatchers will notify the ambulance service when they suspect that ambulances might be required. [...] Both ambulances and fire apparatus are co-dispatched by the Hong Kong Fire Service dispatchers. The system operates technologies and decision <b>support</b> <b>software</b> that are approximately equivalent with those found in Europe and North America.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The co-evolution of {{business}} processes and <b>supporting</b> <b>software</b> systems {{is needed for}} keeping them aligned and it requires managerial and technological effort for adequately planning it. In fact, any modification performed in the business process activities and/or <b>supporting</b> <b>software</b> systems may impact the process activities in terms of input/output and/or purpose of the software system and, therefore, cause misalignment. A coarse grained strategy is proposed for detecting misalignment between business processes and <b>supporting</b> <b>software</b> systems when changes are executed, and for identifying which objects should be considered by additional change for restoring the alignment. The strategy proposes the exploitation of quality parameters, for codifying the alignment concept, and impact analysis techniques, for propagating the change and identifying all the process objects impacted by the change and requiring new interventions. ...|$|R
