40|$|Tooling is an {{important}} area in the manufacturing process. Increase in the complexity of tooling for any operation results in a corresponding increase in the time and costs required to develop such tooling. Rapid tooling {{is the concept of}} producing tools through the aid of rapid prototyping. The ideal candidate operations for rapid tooling have been those for which it is difficult to develop tooling by the usual methods. Non-traditional machining operations are potential candidates that can make use of the advantages of rapid tooling. One such operation is electric discharge machining (EDM) or <b>spark</b> <b>eroding.</b> In this paper the use of rapid prototype patterns, made by the stereolithography technique, for the manufacture of EDM electrodes is discussed. The use of other techniques such as silicone rubber casting and electroforming in the making of the EDM electrode is also described. This work deals with the viability of using an electroformed shell of copper, backed with a suitable material, as an EDM electrode. Based on the present study it can be concluded that electroformed copper electrodes seem to possess an excellent potential for use as EDM tools...|$|E

No implants or restorations in the mandible and one implant in the maxilla failed during the observation period. The marginal bone loss was 1. 2 mm after 5 years. The results of clinical evaluation showed statistical significant differences between gingivitis, keratinized mucosa and the marginal bone loss. The radiographic assessment showed no statistical significant differences in mesial and distal alveolar bone loss depends on periodontal pathogens, the implantposition (maxilla/ mandible; mesial/ distal). As mechanical complications at the implant-prosthetic components retention losses of the protheses (31 %) appeared, an unstability of protheses (13 %) and the screw loosening (9 %).

40|$|Abstract. Crack {{detection}} in {{the region}} of the weld root for control rod nozzles installed in the reactor pressure vessel cap, is difficult due to limited accessibility. For ultrasonic testing, probe coupling is possible only at the inner surface of the engine rod guide tube. There is a water gap of 2 to 3 mm between guide tube and control rod nozzle. Investigations were preformed to determine ultrasonic inspection parameters best suited to crack detection across a water gap. Measurements across a water gap were carried out on planar, convex and concave surfaces specimens. Test reflectors (<b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> notches) were introduced at different depths for the respective specimen. The notches had different positions and orientations in relation to the weld. After detection of test reflectors, sizing tolerances were reviewed. Measurement data were post processed by means of reconstruction technique using SAFT. Measurement and analysis results are presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>eroding,</b> {{which is}} {{commonly}} employed to cut samples out of magnetic shape-memory alloy single crystals, produces a rough surface layer. Directly after cutting, the single crystals exhibit a high twinning stress. After {{removal of a}} surface layer by electropolishing, the twinning stress reduces significantly and stress–strain curves become serrated. The reduction of twinning stress has previously been attributed to {{the removal of the}} defective surface layer. In this work, it is shown that different surface treatments in combination with repeated mechanical deformation experiments significantly reduce the twinning stress, {{regardless of whether or not}} electropolishing is used. The reduction of the twinning stress is due to softening that takes place as a mechanical training effect, which occurs with mechanical testing. In addition, the stress–strain curves of samples subjected to different surface treatments differed in so far as the curves of electropolished samples showed serrated flow, while the curves of unpolished samples and those of mechanically polished samples were smooth. Furthermore, the unpolished samples displayed significant hardening at higher strain. Following subsequent mechanical polishing, this hardening reduced to nearly zero, and the average twinning stress decreased another 30 – 50 % to 1. 6 MPa and below. For these samples, the twinning stress stayed at a very low level until twinning was complete...|$|E

The technique is demonstrated for circular and elliptical cracks {{as small as}} 100 μm in depth with an accuracy of about 10 %. The key features are the positions and spacing of peaks and nulls in angular and frequency dependence of scattered surface intensity. A simple model based on optical diffraction theory is demonstrated on cracks in commercial hot-pressed silicon nitride studies at 100 MHz and on <b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> slots in commercial aluminum studies at 2 - 10 MHz.

In this context, the spray formation and atomisation characteristics of gasoline, ethanol and 1 -butanol were investigated for a 7 -hole <b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> (SE) injector and its ‘direct replacement’ Laser-drilled (LD) injector using optical techniques. In {{the first step of}} the optical investigation, high-speed spray imaging was performed in a quiescent injection chamber with global illumination using diffused Laser light. The images were statistically analyzed to obtain spray penetration, spray tip velocity and spray ‘cone’ angles. Furthermore, droplet sizing was undertaken using Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). A single spray plume was isolated for this analysis and measurements were obtained across the plume at a fixed distance from the nozzle exit. The droplet measurements were grouped into bins and maps were created showing droplet sizes and velocities against time and position during and post injection. All tests were performed at 120 bar fuel pressure, two injection chamber ‘back’ pressures (0. 5 bar and 1 bar) and two injector temperatures (20 °C and 80 °C), to examine effects relevant to typical engine operating conditions with early intake stroke injection strategies, including fuel flash boiling...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of surface {{modifications}} and constraints on the mechanical properties of Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals, which are imposed by (i) structural modifications near the surface, (ii) mounting to a solid surface, and (iii) guiding the stroke. <b>Spark</b> <b>eroded</b> samples were electropolished and characterized before and after each polishing treatment. Surface damage was then produced with spark erosion and abrasive wearing. Surface damage stabilizes and pins a dense twin-microstructure and prevents twins from coarsening. The density of twins increases with increasing degree of surface deformation. Twinning stress and hardening rate during mechanical loading increase with increasing surface damage and twin density. In contrast, when a damaged surface layer is removed, twinning stresses, hardening rate, and twin density decrease. Constraining the sample by mounting and guiding reduces the magnetic-field-induced strain by locking twins at the constrained surfaces. For single-domain crystals and for hard magnetic shape-memory alloys, external constraints strongly reduce the magnetic-field-induced strain and the fatigue lifetime is short. In contrast, for selfaccommodated martensite and for soft magnetic shape-memory alloys, the twin-microstructure adapts well to external constraints and the fatigue lifetime is long. The performance of devices with MSMA transducers requires managing stress distributions through design and control of surface properties, microstructure, and constraints...|$|R
40|$|The advent and {{popularity}} of portable electronics, {{as well as}} the need to reduce carbon-based fuel dependence for environmental and economic reasons, has led to the search for higher energy density portable power storage methods. Lithium ion batteries offer the highest energy density of any portable energy storage technology, but their potential is limited by the currently used materials. Theoretical capacities of silicon (3580 mAh/g) and tin (990 mAh/g) are significantly higher than existing graphitic anodes (372 mAh/g). However, silicon and tin must be scaled down to the nano-level to mitigate the pulverization from drastic volume changes in the anode structure during lithium ion insertion/extraction. The available synthesis techniques for silicon and tin nano-particles are complicated and scale-up is costly. A unique one-step process for synthesizing Si-Sn alloy and Sn nano-particles via spark plasma erosion has been developed to achieve the ideal nano-particulate size and carbon coating architecture. Spark erosion produces crystalline and amorphous spherical nano-particles, averaging 5 - 500 nm in diameter. Several tin and silicon alloys have been <b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> and thoroughly characterized using SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, Auger spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and TGA.

The weld joints were produced with a spectrum of industrially relevant weldment properties. It included materials with weld metal resistance to creep deformation and crack growth was (a) lower, produced by butt welding (BW), and (b) higher, produced by electron beam welding (EBW). Therefore, the materials studied cover a spectrum of microstructures and ductility to give representative data that applies to a range of weld types. The high temperature properties were determined on standard round tensile and creep specimens. Crack growth was studied using C(T) 25 (W= 25 mm, B= 12. 5 mm) and C(T) 50 (W= 50 mm, B= 15 mm) type specimens, under constant load that produced CCG data in the small-scale creep to extensive creep ranges.

40|$|The {{consequences}} for the static and dynamic system behaviour of misalignment in an overconstrained direction are analysed. Therefore, a relatively simple parallel leaf spring guidance, which is overdetermined only once, serves as a case to gain insight. A multibody program using flexible beam theory is {{used to determine the}} change in vibration mode frequencies and stiffnesses due to misalignment. A previously developed beam element for modelling the leaf springs is shown to be able to describe these phenomena with a limited number of elements. Buckling loads and associated buckling modes are also determined analytically. An instrument has been fabricated to measure the change of vibration mode frequencies due to a rotational misalignment in the overconstrained direction. Experiments using wire <b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> leaf springs are in good agreement with the calculations. Differences between the experimental and calculated results are attributed to the imperfections in the hardware model, in particular residual stresses, and the assumptions used for the beam element in the numerical model. A small misalignment, in this case 0. 8 – 5. 8 [*]mrad, causes strong change of static and dynamic system behaviour. The decreased stiffnesses perpendicular to the compliant direction are disturbing, because these are designed to be large to enhance precision manipulation. The negative effects of overconstrained design are largest if relatively thin and wide leaf springs are used. If the misalignment is kept below 50 % of the angle of which a bifurcation occurs, the overconstrained design of the parallel leaf spring mechanism does not significantly influence the system natural frequencies and stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Particulate {{emissions}} are of growing concern due to health impacts. Many urban {{areas around the}} world currently have particulate matter levels exceeding the World Health Organisation safe limits. Gasoline engines, especially when equipped with direct injection systems, contribute to this pollution. In recognition of this fact European limits on particulate mass and number are being introduced. A number of ways to meet these new stringent limits have been under investigation. The focus {{of this paper is}} on particulate emissions reduction through improvements in fuel delivery. This investigation is part of the author's ongoing particulate research and development that includes optical engine spray and combustion visualisation, CFD method development, engine and vehicle testing with the aim to move particulate emission development upstream in the development process. As part of this work, a <b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> and a laser drilled injector were fully characterised in a spray vessel under key engine running conditions. Injector nozzle geometries and mass flow data were also measured in great detail. This paper demonstrates using both steady state and transient engine testing that very significant improvements in particulate emissions can be made. Control strategies enabling multiple injections of smaller volumes of fuel per injection are the most promising technology. The MAHLE Flexible ECU (MFE) combined with injector testing allowed early stage development and demonstrated these effects for a number of key engine operating conditions. Most notably it was found that particulate matter emissions could be reduced by 80 - 90 % during the catalyst light off phase. A new approach was developed (MASTER) to simultaneously assess the effects of calibration changes on all emissions to increase testing efficiency and hence get to more optimised solutions faster. This approach was successfully tested on a production engine comparing two injectors achieving 82 % reduction in particulate number emissions during the first 200 seconds of the NEDC relative to the EU 5 b baseline. Finally it was found that both fuel properties and injector deposits can {{have a significant effect on}} particulate emissions...|$|R

40|$|The project 'Strength and {{fracture}} behaviour of branch {{connections and}} elbows under internal pressure load and superimposed external bending moment' (BV IV) {{was carried out}} at MPA Stuttgart from 1989 to 1993. The objective of the project BV IV was to extend the foundations for a safety-relevant assessment of the main coolant pipes (MCP) of primary systems of pressurized water reactors (PWR). This was made by enhancing the state of knowledge of the load bearing behaviour (stress state) {{as well as the}} failure and fracture behaviour (crack initiation, crack propagation, leak-before-break) of degraded branch connections (T-branches) and elbows. The manufacture and design of the T-branches and elbows was performed according to the conditions in the plants KWO, KKS, KWB A, GKN- 1, KKU and KWB B. The dimensions corresponded to those of the main coolant pipe, resp. to the T-branch of the surge line. The T-branches and Elbows were on the one hand made of the material 20 MnMoNi 5 5 (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e > 150 J) {{and on the other hand}} of a MnMoNiV-special melt (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e #approx# 50 J). Both materials dispose of comparable strength properties. The loads applied during the tests covered the loading types and levels occurring in the plants as well as those postulated for accidents. In the case of the T-branches the flaws were applied on the inside of the nozzle corner shaped as a quarter-elliptical nozzle corner flaw longitudinal to the run pipe axis, in the case of the elbows the flaws (<b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> notches, prefatigue cracks) were applied longitudinally on the inside in the area of the bend flanks. The flaw size was chosen in a way to be definitely found by nondestructive examination methods. Five tests with T-branches consisting of a run pipe with set-on nozzle and six tests with 90 elbows were carried out. An external bending moment (in the case of elbows in-plane bending moment with opening mode, in the case of T-branches in-plane at the branch pipe) was applied reaching maximum load resp. until occurrence of leakage (quasistatic load, in the case of elbows also pulsating load). This took place in the tests after attaining the test temperature (temperature of the upper shelf impact energy, for one T-branch made of the special melt the test temperature corresponded to the transitional range of the C_v-T-curve with T 30 C) as well as the static internal pressure (operational pressure, exception one test with T-branch with p_i = 11 MPa).

25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid <b>sparking</b> will overheat, <b>erode,</b> or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|R

Copper Electrode {{was used as a}} tools in this research. EDM is a thermal process that uses <b>spark</b> discharge to <b>erode</b> electrically conductive materials, it’s primarily used for hard metals that very difficult to machine with traditional techniques. EDM tests on a mild steel workpiece were conducted on a sodick AQ 55 L (ATC) EDM Die-Sinking Machine. The surface Roughness tester Series Mahrsurf XR 20 is used to measure Ra and the surface microstructure was examined with a metallurgical microscopes. The EDM machining parameters those were used were peak current, IP (9 A and 18 A), discharge voltage (90 V and 120 V), servo voltage, SV (20 V and 60 V), pulse on-time (100 μs and 300 μs) and pulse off-time (500 μs and 700 μs). The full factorial design of experiment (DOE) from STATISTICA software was used to generate the arrangement of the experiment parameter and the software was used to analyze the effect of each parameter on the machining characteristics. From the analyzed result, peak current, IP and the pulse on-time have significant effect to the Surface Roughness, Ra. The lower values of these two parameters the lower Surface roughness, Ra observed. From the observation on the metallurgical microscopes, it is found there are clearly EDM damaged layer on the workpiece, distinguished by the width and length of microcrack and craters, especially at high peak current, IP and pulse on-time.

EDM is a thermal process that utilizes <b>spark</b> discharges to <b>erode</b> a conductive material. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to study the effect of independent variable to accuracy of micro EDM drilling process and to optimize it by using Taguchi method. Taguchi Method is used to find the optimal drilling parameters for hole diameter in drilling operation. The orthogonal array, the signal-to-noise ratio, and analysis of variance are employed to study the performance characteristics in drilling operations of mild steel (50 mm length x 75 mm width x 5 mm height) as workpiece by using 1 mm copper (Cu) pipe electrode. Three drilling parameters namely, pulse off time, peak current, and servo standard voltage, are optimized with considerations of hole diameter. It is found that Taguchi’s robust orthogonal array design method is suitable to analyze the hole diameter problem. Also parameter design of Taguchi method provides a simple, systematic and efficient methodology for the optimization of drilling process. The result concluded that use of greater pulse off time, greater peak current and medium servo standard voltage give the better hole diameter for the specific test range. The results also significantly reduce the cost and time market and improve product reliability and customer confidence. There are several suggestions that could be implanted as to improve results and obtained more accurate finding. For example, the experiment should be run repeatedly {{in order to gain}} more accurately ANOVA table. In addition, further study could consider more factor such as pulse on time, material removal rate (MRR), coolants and etc in the research to see how the factors would affect hole diameter...|$|R

Geprüft wurden Proben vom Typ CT und DENT in unterschiedlichen Abmessungen unter kraftkontrollierter Zugschwellbeanspruchung. Beanspruchungen mit Haltezeiten zwischen 0, 1 h und 10 h decken den für die Versagensvorhersage besonders interessierenden Bereich der Interaktion zyklischer und statischer Schädigung ab. Die Durchführung langzeitiger Versuche mit Laufzeiten bis ca. 8000 h bzw. 30000 LW bietet unter Berücksichtigung der zeitabhängigen Entfestigungsvorgänge im Kriechbereich eine notwendige Grundlage für die Übertragbarkeit der experimentellen Ergebnisse auf das Bau-teilverhalten. Für Beanspruchungen mit Lastwechselfrequenzen f > 0, 01 Hz ohne eingeschobene Zughaltezeiten ist kein Frequenzeinfluss auf das Risseinleitungsverhalten erkennbar. Für Beanspruchungen mit niedrigeren Lastwechselfrequenzen und eingeschobenen Zughaltezeiten ist ein zunehmender Einfluss statischer Schädigung zu erkennen, der, verglichen mit zyklischen Beanspruchungen, zu einer Verringerung der Anrisslastspielzahl N_A führt. Die Anrisslastspielzahl N_A bzw. die Risseinleitungsdauer t_A sind in diesem Bereich eine Funktion der Belastungsfrequenz f bzw. der Zughaltezeit t_H. Beanspruchungen mit sehr langen Haltezeiten bzw. Lastwechselfrequenzen 10 ^- 3 Hz transkristalline Rissausbreitung, für f < 10 ^- 3 Hz interkristalline Rissausbreitung dominiert. Mit Hilfe des Zwei-Kriterien-Verfahrens könne der Risseinleitungszeitpunkt sowie die Schä-digungsart (Leck-vor-Bruch oder Bruch-vor-Leck) für Bauteile unter Kriechbeanspruchungen vorhergesagt werden. Dabei werden die Beanspruchungen an der Rissspitze (Parameter K_I) sowie im Fernfeld der Komponente (Nennspannung Sig_n) auf den jeweiligen, zeitabhängigen Werkstoffkennwert K_IA bzw. R_mtT bezogen. Dieses, bisher nur für zeitlich konstante Belastungen überprüfte, Verfahren wurde auf Kriechermüdungsbeanspruchungen erweitert. Dazu wurde der Kennwert K_IA, der den Werkstoffwiderstand gegenüber Risseinleitung kennzeichnet, auf der Basis der Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Versuche modifiziert, sodass auch Zug-schwellbeanspruchungen mit f < 10 ^- 3 Hz sicher beschrieben werden können. Spannungsumlagerungsprozesse und Unterschiede in der Querdehnungsbehinderung führen im Kriechbereich zu einer Größenabhängigkeit der Rissinitiierungsdauer. Daraus resultiert bei Verwendung des Zwei-Kriterien-Verfahrens für große Proben / Bauteile eine konservative Voraussage des Rissinitiierungszeitpunktes. For {{power plants}} {{which are used}} in the medium and peak load regime the {{dominant}} loading situation of high temperature compo-nents is creep fatigue. Thus, the life as-sessment requires data about crack initiation and crack growth under creep fatigue con-ditions. These characteristics can not be easily substituted by pure fatigue crack or creep crack data. Therefore, a comprehensive test programme was carried out to investigate ex-perimentally the creep fatigue crack behaviour of a bainitic turbine rotor steel (30 CrMoNiV 4 - 11) and a martensitic pipe steel (X 10 CrMoVNb 9 - 1). The test materials were taken from industrial products. All tests on 1 %CrMoNiV-steel were carried out at 550 °C, all tests on steel 9 %CrMoVNb at 600 °C. Side grooved compact tension (CT) specimens with 25 and 50 mm thickness as well as double edge notch tensile (DENT) specimens with 15 and 60 mm thickness have been tested in order to observe possible influences of ge-ometry and thus to check the transferability of specimens test results to the behaviour of components. Long term tests up to 8000 h under cyclic tension load with R = F_min/F_max = 0. 1 were performed with hold times at maximum load from 0. 1 up to 10 h to come near to service conditions. These loading frequencies are also chosen to build up the range of interaction between trans- and intergranular crack growth. Long term tests of power plant steels under creep and creep fatigue loadings are serving as a basis to transfer experimentally results to component behaviour, concerning the time dependent material behaviour in the high temperature regime like decreasing creep strength and ductility and increasing notch susceptibility. An analytical description of crack initiation and crack growth under creep fatigue conditions is of technical and economical interest. To achieve this relevant data describing crack behaviour under creep and pure fatigue are needed. A large database of creep crack data is already available for steel 30 CrMoNiV 4 - 11 from several German research projects of IfW Darmstadt and MPA Stuttgart. On steel X 10 CrMoVNb 9 - 1 several addi-tional tests have been performed. For the prediction of crack initiation under creep fatigue conditions a modified two-criteria-method is proposed. The original method was developed for creep crack initiation. A nominal stress Sig_n 0 considers the stress situation in the ligament of a specimen or a component, i. e. in the farfield of the creep crack. The fictitious elastic parameter K_I 0 characterizes the crack tip situation. The stress intensity factor is valid for linear elastic behaviour only, but it can be approximately used for a limited plastic zone near the crack tip. These loading parameters are normalised in a two-criteria-diagram by the respective time and temperature dependent values, which indicate the material resistance against crack initiation. The normalised parameters are the stress ratio R_sig = Sig_n 0 /R_mtT for the farfield and the stress intensity ratio R_K = K_I 0 /K_IA for the crack tip. The value R_mtT is the creep rupture strength of the material and the parameter K_IA characterizes the creep crack initiation of the material. This parameter has to be determined from specimens with high ratio K_I/Sig_n, preferably CT 25 -specimens. In the modified two-criteria-diagram for creep fatigue crack initiation, only loading situations with damage mechanisms, dominated by creep deformation processes, are predictable conservatively, caused by the reference to results of creep tests on smooth and <b>spark</b> <b>eroded</b> specimens. Therefore the portion of fatigue damage, must be restricted. This can be done by a commitment of an upper frequency for the application of Two-Criteria-Dia-gram. For the tested frequency range from 10 ^- 1 Hz down to 10 ^- 5 Hz in the above mentioned experiments, the transition between frequency and time dependent fracture behaviour was estimated to about 10 ^- 3 Hz. This estimation is based on microscopical investigations of the fracture mode (trans- vs. inter-granular), observations of crack growth rate da/dN vs. frequency and hold time respectively as well as comparisons of crack initiation results between creep fatigue tests and pure cyclic / pure static tests. Below f < 10 ^- 5 Hz differences between creep fatigue and pure creep results are rather neglectaible, the application of the Two-Criteria-Diagram for static (creep) loading is suggested. For creep fatigue loading, instead of K_I 0 as parameter to describe crack tip behaviour in the component K_I max should be used as the stress intensity calculated for maximum load Fmax during the service cycle. K_I max is also calculated in the fictitious, linear elastic manner, as described above...|$|R
