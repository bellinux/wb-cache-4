40|$|Background and aims: Studies in {{patients}} seeking medically assisted reproduction {{have shown that}} <b>smoking</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>fertility,</b> but little information {{is available in the}} general population. We assessed the associations between smoking and the number of children, childbearing planning and age at menopause in a representative sample of the population of Lausanne, Switzerland. Methods: Data from 6711 participants (3530 women, age range 35 – 75 years) collected between 2003 and 2006 and again in 2009 and 2012. Smoking status, number of offsprings and age of menopause were assessed. Results: Women who currently smoke had significantly less children than former or never smokers: the number of children per women (average ±SD) was 1. 38 ± 1. 05, 1. 45 ± 1. 07 and 1. 576 ± 1. 16, respectively (p< 0. 001). Women who currently smoke had their first child at an earlier age than the others: 26. 7 ± 5. 2, 27. 4 ± 5. 4 and 26. 9 ± 5. 2 years old for current, former and never smokers, respectively, (p= 0. 01). Similar findings were found for men: number of children per men 1. 475 ± 1. 16, 1. 67 ± 1. 13 and 1. 55 ± 1. 22 for current, former and never smokers, respectively (p< 0. 001); no difference was found regarding age at the first child. The difference persisted after multivariate adjustment (adjusted for age, body mass index, Caucasian origins, alcohol consumption, caffeinated drinks consumption, educational level, receiving social help and women taking contraceptives) for the age at first child among women. No association was found between Heaviness of Smoking Index and the number of children among current smokers in both genders. Women who smoke had their menopause more than 1 year prior than never-smoking women (48. 9 ± 0. 2 years compared with 47. 8 ± 0. 3 years, respectively, p= 0. 002). Conclusions: Smoking is associated with an earlier age of having the first child and of menopause among women...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} azoospermia factor (AZF) deletions in Dutch patients with testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). <b>Reduced</b> <b>fertility</b> is associated with TGCTs and <b>reduced</b> <b>fertility</b> and TGCTs might share genetic risk factors according to the testicular dysgenesis hypothesis. Up to 8 % of infertility and <b>reduced</b> <b>fertility</b> in the general male population {{can be explained by}} the presence of constitutional deletions of part of the long arm of the Y chromosome (Yq 11), referred to as the AZF region. Methods. In 112 patients with TGCT, screening for constitutional deletions in the AZF region was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis in DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes. A set of 24 primer pairs, of which 20 primer pairs are homologous to previously identified and mapped sequenced tag sites within the AZF region were used. Results. No deletions in the Yq 11 region were detected in any of the 112 patients. Conclusions. Large Y chromosome microdeletions in the AZF region are not a major contributor to the development of TGCT and TGCT-associated <b>reduced</b> <b>fertility.</b> (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{identified}} specific body systems {{affected by the}} hazardous effects of the cigarette smoking particularly the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The effect of smoking on male reproduction has also been studied where semen quality was investigated in different cross-sectional studies including infertile patients with conflicting results. This article aimed to assess the relationship between smoking and male infertility. A review of published articles was carried out, using PubMed, medical subject heading (MSH) databases and Scopus engine excluding the effects of smoking outside male infertility. Key words used to assess exposure, outcome, and estimates for the concerned associations were: smoking, semen, male infertility, sperm, humans, and fertility. Most of the reports showed that <b>smoking</b> <b>reduces</b> sperm production, sperm motility, sperm normal forms and sperm fertilising capacity through increased seminal oxidative stress and DNA damage. Few papers reported nonsignificant differences in semen parameters between smokers or non-smokers. It is concluded that although some smokers may not experience <b>reduced</b> <b>fertility,</b> men with marginal semen quality can benefit from quitting smoking...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} education, health and social security on fertility in developing countries. Spending on education does not necessarily <b>reduce</b> <b>fertility.</b> For example, with small amounts of education fertility tends to increase before falling off {{at the level of}} completed primary school; its specific effect can only be measured by working at a particular population group. Health care services which reduce child mortality also <b>reduce</b> <b>fertility</b> when life expectancy reaches a level which anticipates the need for fewer children. Generally, this is a more costly way to <b>reduce</b> <b>fertility</b> than family planning. Lastly, even though the general effect of social security systems on fertility is more difficult to study and quantify, a preliminary estimate shows it to be the most costly method, compared with education, health care and family planning.
