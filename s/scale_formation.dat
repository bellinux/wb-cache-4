25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged <b>scale</b> <b>formation,</b> but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} stratigraphic and sedimentologic {{study of}} the Early Cenomanian Fish <b>Scales</b> <b>Formation</b> and the Barons Sandstone in southern Alberta, based on detailed core measurement and well log correlation, was undertaken {{in order to assess}} the principal controlling factors on the mid-Cretaceous stratigraphic fill of the Cordilleran foreland basin. Fine-grained units in the basin, such as the Fish <b>Scales</b> <b>Formation</b> (Mowry equivalent) and the Early Turonian Second White Specks Formation (Greenhorn equivalent), have traditionally been attributed to deposition during episodes of high eustatic sea levels. However, facies, allostratigraphy, and isopach patterns of the latest Albian Westgate, Fish Scales, mid–late Cenomanian Belle Fourche and Second White Specks formations in southern Alberta suggest that strata were deposited alternately during orogenic loading periods and unloading periods. We interpreted the Fish <b>Scales</b> <b>Formation,</b> a deposit formed during the marine transgression of the Mowry Seaway in the latest Albian–earliest Cenomanian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during an orogenic unloading period. The Barons Sandstone, interbedded with the mudstone of the Fish <b>Scales</b> <b>Formation,</b> is interpreted as a regressive shoreface, distributary channel and barrier island sandstone deposited during the unloading period. We also tentatively interpreted the Second White Specks Formation, a regional stratigraphic marker deposited during the so-called peak eustatic sea level in the Early Turonian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during a period of regional orogenic unloading. This study questions the significance of the Mowry Shale and Greenhorn Formation as indicators of eustatic highstands of sea level, and suggests regional tectonism as the primary control on basin evolution.

Unlike conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by relative positions or distances, we propose a novel bearing-based approach where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings.
