40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increasing}} concern about the threat of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipments (WEEE) generating in China. The Chinese government had {{made a series of}} regulations and policies to address this problem. However, these practices are more focusing on the environmental protection rather than the resource utilization. Since WEEE is also a valuable kind of renewable resource, this essay will try to understand the current situation <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling and resource utilization technologies and equipments. In the year of 2014, China Household Electric Appliance Research Institute conducted a questioner research targeting the 91 subsidy funded companies, which received 50 responses. By the comparison of previous studies of this issue and the analysis of the data collected, resource utilization situation of the industry can be addressed. This essay will also explore an evaluation model to assess the resource utilization standard <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling. Based on the analysis, nine outcome criteria and evaluation strategies are formed to judge the resource utilization standards <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling companies. This evaluation model will target all the life cycle <b>of</b> <b>WEEE,</b> and include criteria such as recycling technology and equipment, management standard, and resource utilization level...|$|R
30|$|Murugan (2008), Chancerel and Rotter (2009) {{pointed out}} that the rate <b>of</b> {{generation}} <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> is high worldwide and continues to increase, being one of the fastest and most growing waste flows.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and critically analyses the current waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) management practices in various countries and regions. Global trends in (i) the quantities {{and composition of}} WEEE; and (ii) the various strategies and practices adopted by selected countries to handle, regulate and prevent WEEE are comprehensively examined. The findings indicate that for (i), the quantities <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> generated are high and/or on the increase. IT and telecommunications equipment seem to be the dominant WEEE being generated, {{at least in terms of}} numbers, in Africa, in the poorer regions of Asia and in Latin/South America. However, the paper contends that the reported figures on quantities <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> generated may be grossly underestimated. For (ii), with the notable exception of Europe, many countries seem to be lacking or are slow in initiating, drafting and adopting <b>WEEE</b> regulations. Handling <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> in developing countries is typified by high rate of repair and reuse within a largely informal recycling sector. In both developed and developing nations, the landfilling <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> is still a concern. It has been established that stockpiling of unwanted electrical and electronic products is common in both the USA and less developed economies. The paper also identifies and discusses four common priority areas for WEEE across the globe, namely: (i) resource depletion; (ii) ethical concerns; (iii) health and environmental issues; and (iv) WEEE takeback strategies. Further, the paper discusses the future perspectives on WEEE generation, treatment, prevention and regulation. Four key conclusions are drawn from this review: global amounts <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> will continue unabated for some time due to emergence of new technologies and affordable electronics; informal recycling in developing nations has the potential of making a valuable contribution if their operations can be changed with strict safety standards as a priority; the pace of initiating and enacting WEEE specific legislation is very slow across the globe and in some cases non-existent; and globally, there is need for more accurate and current data on amounts and types <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> generated...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, waste {{electric}} and electronic equipment (WEEE) pollution problem has caused public concern widely in the world. In China, {{huge numbers of}} appliances are sold and discarded each year. It is difficult to carry out reliable estimation <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> output using the existing models due to the limited data available in many countries, especially in large developing countries. In order to plan, manage and use WEEE in a sustainable way, accurate forecasting <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> generation plays a key role. Based on the quantity of household ownership of appliances in China, several GM (1, 1) gray theory models were set up to predict the quantity of household ownership appliances in China. The results indicate {{that more and more}} WEEE will be produced. By 2031, the quantity <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> will reach 516 million sets, or 13 million tons. By means of the combination of gray relation analyses (GRA) in this research, it was discovered that the realty business has high correlation with Chinese household ownership of appliances. In order to solve the WEEE collection problem, in this paper, it is suggested that the Chinese government issue a kind <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> voucher. If the voucher is used successfully in WEEE recycling, it will not only promote a standard recycling system for WEEE, but also can accelerate the extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy implementation in China...|$|R
40|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} goods production {{is one of}} the fastest growing markets in the world. More new electronic goods appear every year. If the electronic waste cannot be managed and recycled properly, more and more electrical {{and electronic}} waste (WEEE) would be generated in the future. In fact, improper WEEE treatment causes tremendous harmful effect to the environment and finally affects our health. More effort was put in WEEE recycling worldwide. In recent years, the government, NGOs and other responsible parties worked very hard in Hong Kong WEEE recycling. However, Hong Kong is still lagging behind in terms <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling compare with other countries. In Hong Kong, large quantities <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> are shipped to developing countries, which are non-ethical. Some of them would also go to landfills in Hong Kong, which causes serious land contamination. Even if the electronic waste is collected, the collectors may not follow the EPD guidelines to recycle the waste. Therefore, it is important to let people know the environmental impact <b>of</b> <b>WEEE,</b> the proper WEEE recycling channels and the importance <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling so as to raise their awareness towards WEEE issues. There are few research findings about household WEEE recycling in Hong Kong, especially the household attitude and behavior towards WEEE recycling. The result in this dissertation can fill this knowledge gap. In this study, questionnaires will be used to find out the WEEE generation pattern and recycling frequency in households, the prefer disposal methods for household WEEE and the household attitudes and behavior towards WEEE recycling. Besides, some WEEE recycling facilities will be visited to identify difficulties in WEEE recycling. Finally, possible ways will be suggested to tackle the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Europe 7. 3 {{million tonnes}} of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{were created in}} 2002, {{and the fact that}} growth rate <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> is 3 - 5 % per annum with a {{significant}} amount of this waste used to be dumped into landfills without any pre-treatment, has resulted in the introduction <b>of</b> European <b>WEEE</b> directive. The directive requires companies who manufacture or import electrical and electronic equipment to take financial and legal responsibility for its environmental-friendly recovery and recycling. The current recycling applications <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> are often developed on ad hoc basis and mainly attributable to the hidden economic value within used products. However, at present the recycling facilities are faced with the challenge to improve WEEE recycling activities to ensure that a larger proportion of components and materials are being recovered at a reasonable cost and {{yet at the same time}} legislative requirements are being met. A major assertion made in the research reported in this paper is that a systematic framework is needed to aid the decision making involved in adopting the best possible end-of-life strategies for WEEE.

40|$|ABSTRACT: High levels <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> {{and limited}} {{capacities}} for disposal and recycling, {{together with the}} necessity to transpose the European legislation into national law have shaped the profile <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> system in Romania. In order to improve the functionality of this system {{it is important to}} understand the citizens’ behaviour towards WEEE recycling. Recent research conducted in different countries suggest that various determinants, such as socio-economic and demographic factors, environmental knowledge, habits, conve-nience, motivations, can be used to analyse WEEE recycling behaviour. The results are contradictory and demonstrate that the peculiarities of each country have different influences on how people engage in WEEE collection and recycling. In the present paper, using hypotheses testing we have developed a WEEE recycling behaviour model for Romanians. It was assumed that socio-demographic factors and personal norms would predict WEEE recycling attitude and attitude, contextual forces, knowledge and recycling habits would influ-ence WEEE recycling behaviour. The data, gathered using a survey, were processed using a fuzzy approach. The results showed that in the Romanian context the strongest determinants <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> recycling behaviour are people attitudes and habits. Moderate effects have recycling knowledge, pro-environmental norms and insti-tutional support, while gender, income, perception of availability of collection points and regulations haven’t any influence...|$|R

The Directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure a minimum rate of separate collection <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> from private households and to ensure all WEEE is collected separately and managed in an environmentally sound manner. To this end, Member States must ensure producers meet specific targets for recovery and component, material and substance reuse and recycling. In order to calculate targets as well as track implementation generally, information on the quantities and categories of electrical and electronic equipment put on the market and WEEE collected and reused, recycled and recovered must be compiled and reported on a periodic basis. This is complicated by other provisions contained in the Directive, including the distinction of ten different categories <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> and different financing provisions depending on whether the WEEE originates from private households. The purpose of this thesis was to examine the information, record-keeping and reporting requirements associated with the pending implementation <b>of</b> the <b>WEEE</b> Directive in Ireland. A number o f important, if not critical considerations in the establishment <b>of</b> an effective <b>WEEE</b> reporting system have been identified, including several potentials for errors, omissions or duplications. Recommendations are provided to address some of the issues identified, as are suggestions for further work, including collective consideration of certain issues by relevant stakeholders. In light of the above, a relatively simple, albeit standardised regulatory reporting system is recommended. Attention should be focused on making and continuing improvements to existing waste statistics and the associated reporting systems and to increasing awareness <b>of</b> the <b>WEEE</b> Directive and waste reporting requirements, generally. Having a centralised reporting system and limiting the number <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> for which detailed monitoring is required would greatly facilitate the compilation of data, although sampling exercises and compositional surveys would still be necessary. This requires the active engagement of public and private sector stakeholders at a National level...|$|R

But a corresponding recycling system <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> has yet to be established. The actual WEEE flow in China is therefore kind of unknown. Through an in-depth analysis of the recycling system and extended survey <b>of</b> the <b>WEEE</b> recycling process in Beijing, this paper puts forward a WEEE closed loop chain model concerning the source, pathway and volume of the flow. It identified some key control points in the WEEE recycling process, which are taken into account in several policy recommendations...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} growing amount of waste from {{electronic}} and electrical equipment (WEEE) EU developed, year 2002, a directive (2002 / 96 /EG) {{with the objective}} to govern the management and reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>WEEE.</b> The directive is based on producer responsibility which makes the producer responsible for collection and dispose <b>of</b> <b>WEEE.</b> In 2012 a new revised directive (2012 / 19 /EU), with tougher collection targets, was developed. Both {{the old and the}} new directive states that the approach to tackle WEEE should be prioritized in order of prevention, reuse and then recycling. Hitherto the amounts <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> has increased every year, making it relevant to examine which type of preventive measures the directive contains and how effective they are. I have also examined how the EU wants Member States to interpret and promote the measures of reuse and also discussed the consumption and production of electronic products in the context sustainable development. The study is mainly a literature review in which scientific articles and books on environmental policy have been used to create theoretical framework. In order to study how the prevention and reuse has worked out in practice five interviews has been conducted with actors that are working with issues related to the context <b>of</b> <b>WEEE</b> and electronic recycling. The study shows that all of the preventive measures outlined in the directive are linked to the stage of manufacture in productdesign where eco-design is a well-known and broad field. The empirical material in this study also shows that reuse is an implicit section in the directive with no clear strategy of how to implement it. The general conclusion is that the preventive measures on a large scale have been absent and that the outcomes from the measures that have been implemented have not met the objectives. The reason why reuse is difficult to promote is primarily explained by that there are obstacles in terms of laws and regulations that make the measures of reuse hard to implement in the Member States...|$|R
