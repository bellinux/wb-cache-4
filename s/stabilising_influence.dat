25|$|After Docherty's departure, his {{assistant}} Ron Suart {{was placed in}} temporary charge of the first team. Chelsea lost their next game 7–0 against Leeds United, equalling the club's highest-ever margin of defeat (in 1953–54, they had lost 8–1 to Wolves). Dave Sexton, ex-Chelsea coach and Leyton Orient manager, and a character far more calm and reserved than Docherty, was appointed manager. The core of the side inherited from Docherty remained largely unchanged, although he added more steel to the defence with the signings of John Dempsey and David Webb, as well as signing striker Ian Hutchinson, giving mercurial midfielder Alan Hudson his debut and recalling winger Peter Houseman.

40|$|Delivering quality {{primary care}} to large populations is always challenging, {{and that is}} {{certainly}} the case in India. While the sheer magnitude of patients can create difficulties, not all challenges are about logistics. Sometimes patient health-seeking behaviour leads to delays in obtaining medical help for reasons that {{have more to do}} with culture, social practice and religious belief. When primary care is accessed via busy state-run outpatient departments there is often little time for the physician to investigate causes behind a patient's condition, and these factors can adversely affect patient outcomes. We consider the case of a woman with somatic symptoms seemingly triggered by psychological stresses associated with social norms and familial cultural expectations. These expectations conflict with her personal and professional aspirations, and although she eventually receives psychiatric help and her problems are addressed, initially, psycho-social factors underlying her condition posed a hurdle in terms of accessing appropriate medical care. While for many people culture, belief and social norms exert a <b>stabilising,</b> positive <b>influence,</b> in situations where someone's personal expectations differ significantly from accepted social norms, individual autonomy can be directly challenged, and in which case, something has to give. The result of such challenges can negatively impact on health and well-being, and for patients with immature defence mechanisms for dealing with inner conflict, such an experience can be damaging and ensuing somatic disturbances are often difficult to treat. Patients with culture-bound symptoms are not uncommon within primary care in India or in other Asian countries and communities. We argue that such cases need to be properly understood if satisfactory patient outcomes are to be achieved. While some causes are structural, having to do with how healthcare is accessed and delivered, others are about cultural values, social practices and beliefs. We note how some young adult women are adversely affected and discuss some of the ethical issues that arise...|$|R

The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918.

30|$|Since orthoses aim to <b>stabilise</b> joints, they <b>influence</b> both {{gait pattern}} and walking function. We, therefore, divided the {{participants}} into groups {{according to their}} orthoses, as has been described in a previous study [11]. Among the AMC groups, the lowest NNcost was found in AMC 1. We could not, however, confirm this observation statistically due to the low participant number. Children in AMC 1 required above-knee orthotic solutions with locked knee joints and were totally dependent on orthoses to achieve walking ability. This group had the lowest NNconsumption of all groups, including TD children, which is probably related to their low walking velocity to decrease physical exertion. In normal gait, the knee flexes during the swing phase [26], which is not possible in a locked KAFO. Compensatory movements such as pelvic hiking or circumduction of the leg [26] are, therefore, necessary. In persons with knees immobilised with a cast, reduced walking speed and increased oxygen cost have been reported [27]. In AMC 1, {{it was possible to}} maintain the oxygen consumption at an acceptable level by reducing walking velocity, which contributes to an increase in oxygen cost. The highest NNcost was found in AMC 2, of whom all needed orthoses and all except two children were community ambulators.|$|R

Therefore {{it is crucial to}} {{understand}} more thoroughly the communication roles and responsibilities of interagency team members and to examine how individual members communicate within a complex, evolving, and unstable environment. It is also important to understand how different organisational identities and their spatial geographies contribute to the interactional dynamics. Earthquakes hit the Canterbury region on September, 2010 and then on February 2011 a more devastating shallow earthquake struck resulting in severe damage to the Aged Residential Care (ARC) sector.

40|$|Prostatic {{diseases}} are common; benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is almost ubiquitous in elderly men and 899, 000 men {{were diagnosed with}} prostate cancer worldwide in 2008. The incidence of both is increasing and expected to continue to rise. Therefore, prostatic diseases represent a considerable economic burden, but there are currently no reliable markers available to accurately differentiate indolent from aggressive disease nor to predict who will benefit from treatment for either BPH or prostate cancer. This results in over and under-treatment of both diseases with consequent patient related morbidity and mortality. The molecular mechanisms underlying {{the natural history of}} prostatic diseases remain elusive. It is accepted that prostate cell growth and survival are exquisitely dependent upon activation of the androgen receptor (AR) by androgens. Following ligand binding, AR undergoes further phosphorylation at serine residues, which inhibit proteolytic degradation, <b>stabilise</b> AR and <b>influence</b> AR transactivation. It is therefore plausible that alterations in AR phosphorylation may drive prostatic disease progression. However, few studies have explored the significance of AR phosphorylation, or the kinases driving AR serine phosphorylation in the clinical setting. The over-riding objective {{of this study was to}} establish the clinical relevance of AR serine phosphorylation status in prostate tissue in both BPH and prostate cancer. The specific aims of the current study were: •	To firstly establish and validate a panel of AR phosphospecific antibodies. •	To evaluate site specific AR serine phosphorylation expression levels in prostate cancer and BPH patient cohorts, with full clinical data and follow-up. •	To investigate the expression of candidate kinases mediating such phosphorylation. This involved establishing tissue banks with linked comprehensive clinical databases, and utilising this tissue to establish AR phosphorylation expression profiles for each patient.

40|$|Advanced zirconia-based {{materials}} have many important applications in electronics and medical applications, and of most interest to this research, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) {{which is a}} key technology for alternative and hydrogen-based energy generation. The SOFC in its most basic form is a device for converting hydrogen and oxygen into water with a resulting generation of power. Most SOFC manufacturers/developers are using zirconia doped with yttria as the electrolyte with variations {{on the amount of}} yttria. The SOFC places high demands on the ceramic components, placing significant demands on powder processing technology to enable fabrication of reliable components. It has been shown that the process of co-precipitation of three initially mixed chlorides, aluminium chloride, yttrium chloride and zirconium oxychloride in aqueous solutions, can produce an oxide powder {{that can be used in}} SOFC manufacture. Zirconia powders synthesised from aqueous solution in this way have been found, however, to include hard agglomerates which are detrimental to further processing and applications. Industrial manufacture of zirconia and zirconia-yttria products can best be summarised as four step operation; (1) hydrolyse of zirconyl chloride and mixing of other solutions, (2) precipitation, (3) calcination (4) forward processing for particle size, surface area and handle-ability characteristics. The use of aqueous solutions allows for lower costs of production and reduced waste. However such production is hampered by limited understanding of the fundamental chemistry particularly during aqueous processing which limits the development of better powders for the widespread use of SOFC’s. The aim of this project was to develop an understanding of these problems based on an industrial process that is in use within Western Australia. The work has been broken up into five sections, with the first four dealing with predominately non-stabilized zirconia and tracks the process from aqueous chemistry through to final ceramic. The final section does the same for a 3 mole% yttrium partially <b>stabilised</b> zirconia. The <b>influence</b> of concentration and added chloride salts on the solution speciation of zirconyl chloride solutions, and the precipitate formed upon addition of aqueous ammonia, has been investigated using a combination of techniques, such as SAXS, DLS, ICP-OES, TEM and SEM. To further investigate the precipitation process the effect of pH of precipitation, starting solution concentration, and agitation levels on the particle size of hydrous zirconia precipitates have been investigated. The pH of precipitation was also found to have a significant impact on the type of hydrous zirconia produced. TGA/DTA, micro combustion and TEM / EDS were used to investigate the difference in the powders produced at pH 3 and 12. The two hydrous zirconium manufactured at pH 3 and 12 have been studied as further processing consistent with industrial procedures was undertaken, including how the differences in structure due to the pH of precipitation, may effect the calcination, in situ and ex situ x-ray diffraction was used for this. With the knowledge developed thus far, two 3 mol% partially stabilised zirconia (P-SZ) samples suitable for the SOFC market were manufactured from solutions through to ceramics. The combination of SAXS, DLS, in situ XRD, TEM, ICP, TGA/DTA, micro combustion, and standard ceramic testing was found to be excellent for providing comprehensive information on changes through an industrial process and will allow optimisation to produce powders suitable for SOFC applications...|$|R

40|$|Continued {{expansion}} of the gold and nickel mining industry in Western Australia during recent years has led to disturbance of larger areas and the generation of increasing volumes of waste rock. Mine operators are obligated to rehabilitate all disturbed surfaces and reconstructed landforms, and considerable effort and expense is now applied to the achievement of this objective. Associated with increasing rehabilitation effort is the requirement to accurately judge rehabilitation success {{through the development of}} completion criteria. Completion criteria are rehabilitation performance objectives set as conditions of approval for each stage of rehabilitation and for the project as a whole. They provide standards against which the success of rehabilitation can be measured, or more broadly the point at which responsibility for rehabilitation is complete. The current research project tackles the development of completion criteria by investigating ecosystem function within a variety of rehabilitation trials at four mine sites located in arid and semi-arid Western Australia, and also within surrounding 'natural' vegetation complexes undisturbed by mining, termed analogue sites. Six specific objectives were identified as part of the study: 1. To establish an appropriate end point land use for each mine site where field trials were established; 2. To examine long-term ecosystem development through the assessment of revegetation at a variety of rehabilitation sites; 3. To examine functional components within analogue communities and make appropriate comparisons with rehabilitation trials; 4. To record the potential reproductive capacity of revegetation progeny, and determine how this relates to ecosystem function; 5. To provide a better understanding of ecosystem function by investigating the relationship between state factors, interactive controls, and ecosystem processes at rehabilitation and analogue sites; and 6. To develop a methodology for establishing realistic environmental completion criteria at mine sites situated in arid and semi-arid Western Australia. Field trials were established at four mine sites located within three subtly different bioclimatic zones that extend through the arid / semi-arid shrubland belt of Western Australia; Northeastern Goldfields (Granny Smith Gold Mine, Sunrise Dam Gold Mine), Eastern Goldfields (Black Swan Nickel Mine), and Northeastern Wheatbelt (Westonia Gold Mine). 1 The re-establishment of a self-sustaining vegetation cover integrated with the surrounding ecosystem, was the common end land use objective at the four mine sites selected for this study. For three sites located in the Northeastern Goldfields and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, sheep were grazed on surrounding rangeland; the fourth site located in the Northeastern Wheatbelt of Western Australia, and was surrounded by Crown Land. 2 To better understand ecosystem function, the dynamic behaviour and interaction of plant biodiversity parameters was monitored regularly at 19 post-mining rehabilitation sites up to 11 years after direct seeding. For functional ecosystems, plant biodiversity parameters changed rapidly during the initial five years after seeding following predictable trends, after which time they remained within a relatively stable range. The stabilising of parameters over time was identified as a key indicator of rehabilitation success, however {{the point at which the}} parameters <b>stabilised</b> was <b>influenced</b> by numerous variables and was difficult to accurately predict. Prolific seed germination resulted in high seedling density during the initial growing season. Plant density then progressively decreased in response to competition, before stabilising within a range approximately five years after seeding. Revegetation cover was typically low during the first growing season, increasing rapidly there after before also stabilising in line with plant density. Maximum species richness was generally achieved during the first and second year when annual Atriplex species were prominent. Perennial Atriplex species established more slowly during the early stages of revegetation development, but eventually replaced the annual component as the dominant taxa. Perennial Maireana species required up to three years before germinating in the field and establishing themselves in the revegetation; in many cases they replaced perennial Atriplex as the prominent taxa. The presence or absence of cyclonic rainfall during the first growing season was a major determinant of the ecosystem trajectory, controlling revegetation structure and composition. The germination and successful establishment of hard seeded species, including Acacia and Senna, was reliant on heavy summer rainfall during the early stages of ecosystem development to break seed dormancy and extend the length of the first growing season. This provided an important competitive advantage against faster growing Atriplex species, which possessed greater drought tolerance. The intensity of summer rainfall was also beneficial in leaching surface salts from the upper profile and hence, reducing salinity within the rooting zone. In the absence of heavy summer rainfall during the first growing season, the establishment of a low chenopod dominated vegetation cover was favoured, total species richness for the rehabilitation tended to be lower, and the variety of plant life forms was restricted to low and mid stratum shrubs. Increasing water stress resulted in progressively higher rates of local species extinction, with fewer taxa possessing the drought tolerance adaptations required to survive. For established revegetation, cyclonic rainfall increased productivity (as measured by % foliage ground cover) and stimulated the establishment of new taxa, which in many cases were brought in from adjacent unmined vegetation complexes (analogue sites). While the benefits of summer cyclonic rainfall were undoubtedly important to ari and semi-arid ecosystems, the occurrence of drought was also important in buffering the ecosystem against large-scale change by acting as a negative feedback to constrain cumulative productivity. Parent waste rock material varied considerably between rehabilitation sites, affecting the soil resource supply and associated functional components. Extreme salinity was a typical limitation of the rehabilitation medium, reducing the variety of salt tolerant species and favouring annual Atriplex during the early stages of ecosystem development. The cover of annual species present during early stages of ecosystem development contributed to decreasing salinity in the plant rooting zone, by reducing surface temperature and hence capillary rise of salts during summer months. Annual Atriplex species were replaced by perennial Atriplex in line with decreasing surface salinity. Fundamental to successful revegetation of the post-mining rehabilitation site was the requirement that reconstruction and contouring focus on maximising water retention and reducing salinity within the upper soil profile. Once the initial vegetation community established and plant parameters became relatively stable, change continued to occur, albeit slowly. One factor contributing to this change was the immigration rate of biota from adjacent revegetation or more commonly from surrounding analogue complexes. Linking rehabilitation areas to surrounding functional ecosystems ensured the movement of plants and animals, and ultimately increased the rate of recovery. The sustainability of post-mining rehabilitation was enhanced where these links were established early, allowing for the provision of additional seed and the migration of displaced species. The life cycle pattern of keystone species in the revegetation was found to be an important determinant in long-term sustainability of the plant cover, particularly for chenopod shrublands where one species was typically dominant. The senescence and death of large numbers of a dominant revegetation species together, had the ability to significantly alter the revegetation structure and composition. The impact for rehabilitation where a number of dominant taxa co-exist was less pronounced. Thus it follows that a minimum level of species richness was important to long-term rehabilitation sustainability, as was the development of an age-class structure in the rehabilitation. The most common disturbances encountered at the rehabilitation trial sites were drought, overgrazing and weed infestation. All three disturbances decreased the plant biodiversity parameters measured. Ecosystem recovery following disturbance was dependent on effective rainfall, but occurred rapidly with plant parameters returning to pre-disturbance levels within one to two growing seasons. The recovery of plant biodiversity parameters followed the same trends identified at functional rehabilitation sites during the initial five years following direct seeding. 3 Assessment of plant biodiversity parameters occurred at 15 analogue sites supporting native vegetation undisturbed by mining. It was anticipated that data from analogue sites could be used as a 'reference' against which to compare developing rehabilitation. However, analogue vegetation complexes were less dynamic in comparison to rehabilitation sites. Minor seasonal changes were recorded for plant biodiversity parameters, but overall annual change was minimal. Significant and sudden changes within analogue communities only occurred following disturbance, such as severe overgrazing, and recovery to pre-disturbance levels was rapid following the removal of the disturbance and return of effective rainfall. A major difference between rehabilitation and analogue sites related to their age. Rehabilitation sites were 'juvenile systems' assessed against a time frame much shorter than had been required for natural processes to achieve the developmental state represented at analogue sites. Hence, it was important not to model one specific analogue site too closely, but instead model the desired revegetation structure and species composition on a variety of local analogue complexes occurring in parent materials 'matched' closely to those of the rehabilitation site. Data from analogue sites should be utilised extensively during rehabilitation planning, but cautiously when interpreting the rehabilitation outcome. For mine sites in arid and semi-arid Western Australia, the application of specific numeric targets for plant biodiversity parameters as a measure of rehabilitation success was not recommended. A number of factors and controls in the developing ecosystem together determined the rehabilitation outcome. These factors were site and time specific; minor changes in any number of variables led to significantly different rehabilitation outcomes, making them difficult to accurately predict. 4 Quality and germination testing confirmed progeny seed from a number of rehabilitation trials was of similar or higher viability than the maternal seed originally sown. This was further confirmed by field responses at trials in the Northeastern Goldfields one year after the 1994 drought, when elevated plant density was recorded following the return of above average rainfall. The ability of rehabilitation to show an immediate response to rainfall following a seven-month drought, and for vegetation parameters to subsequently recover to pre-disturbance levels within one to two years, provided an indication that the revegetation cover was resilient. The relationship between plant production and rainfall was dependent on a 'carryover' effect between seasons or following drought years, and 'pulses' mediated, for instance, by the amount of seed in the soil store. The 'reserve' component in and ecosystems was responsible for both the memory of the system between pulses and for its long-term resilience. 6 The analysis of time series data collected from 19 rehabilitation trials emphasized the importance of planning and implementation of best practice techniques to subsequent rehabilitation success, and reinforced the difficulty associated with accurately predicting the final rehabilitation outcome. The large spatial heterogeneity of undisturbed vegetation complexes across the landscape of arid and semi-arid Western Australia, provided the foundation on which site-specific rehabilitation scenarios could be modelled, albeit with caution. The translation of data into useful completion criteria was dependent on the realisation that successful rehabilitation requires the implementation of best practice rehabilitation techniques, as determined by technically prescriptive (design) based standards, as much as the identification of a successful rehabilitation outcome, as determined by performance (outcome) based standards. With this in mind, completion criteria were developed as part of a robust theoretical framework incorporating the larger mine plan, and were not simply based on numbers generated as stand-alone performance standards. The broad methodology generated could be adopted by any mine site across the mining industry, however the criteria and, more specifically, the standards for each criterion should always remain site specific. The methodology designed for developing completion criteria has been addressed in three stages: 1. Planning, 2. Operational and Monitoring, and 3. Post-Mining Hand-Over. Within each stage three parameters are addressed: 1. Criteria, 2. Process, and 3. Standard. 'Planning' is the most important stage in the development of completion criteria. It is the stage when an appropriate end land use is determined, analogue sites are assessed, a rehabilitation plan developed along with specified design standards ensuring implementation of best practice techniques, and a process of risk assessment implemented. The 'Operational Monitoring Stage' focuses on rehabilitation success during the period of ecosystem development. This stage is concerned largely with rehabilitation monitoring, from which performance standards can be developed to gauge rehabilitation success for specific periods during revegetation development. The initial task in Stage 2 is to ensure all aspects of the rehabilitation plan have been implemented as specified in Stage 1, and meet agreed design standards. The final stage of the completion criteria process, 'Post Mining Hand Over', is to ensure the rehabilitated site is safe, and able to successfully revert to the end land use. While plant biodiversity parameters formed the focus of the current study, a variety of other functional ecosystem components may also make sound assessment criteria for determining rehabilitation success. Increasing the knowledge base for other functional components in arid and semi-arid ecosystems would further increase the ability to accurately determine rehabilitation success...|$|R

50|$|Despite dialectal variation, {{which is}} found in any {{widespread}} language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> of their common Christian (Roman Catholic) culture. It {{was not until the}} Moorish conquest of Spain in 711 cut off communications between the major Romance regions that the languages began to diverge seriously. The Vulgar Latin dialect that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely cut off from the unifying influences {{in the western part of}} the Empire.|$|E
50|$|Amrozis' {{elder brother}} Muklas was a {{respected}} {{member of a}} pesantren in Malaysia. Amrozi had not seen him for over ten years and Muklas had, to some degree, been a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> in Amrozis' early adult years. Amrozi decided to visit Muklas but was initially shunned and rejected because of his errant ways. He was devastated by this and realised that to become accepted he needed to become a good Muslim. Amrozi ceased smoking and watching movies. He began praying {{five times a day}} in his efforts to gain the acceptance of Muklas and Muklas finally agreed to let him stay.|$|E

The {{climate of the}} Alicante region according to Köppen climate classification is a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). On average the temperature ranges between [...] and [...] in January, and between [...] and [...] in August, with an average annual temperature of [...] Daily variations in temperature are generally small because of the <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> of the sea, although occasional periods of westerly wind can produce temperature changes of [...] or more. Seasonal variations in temperature are also relatively small, meaning that winters are mild and summers are hot.|$|E
50|$|The Abbai are a {{semi-aquatic}} {{race with}} a matriarchal and deeply pacifist society. The Abbai themselves are amphibious and build {{much of their}} planet's infrastructure at least partially submerged underwater. They are fully capable of acting normally on dry land and in space too, being as physically resilient as most other species. Their history of peaceful coexistence has allowed them to develop their technology to advanced levels without the disruptions war brings about. This has also led to their adopting an approach of diplomacy over open warfare and are a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> over the League of Non-Aligned Worlds and later the Interstellar Alliance.|$|E
5000|$|America's {{presence}} in Middle-Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia {{has been one}} source of discontent that has served {{as an excuse to}} Islamic fundamentalists to commit acts of violence. Even as the U.S. downscales its presence and existing bases (e.g. Saudi Arabia), {{it is not clear that}} the U.S. {{presence in}} Iraq will be anything but de-stabilising because many in the Muslim world resent the [...] "infidel" [...] presence in the Middle East, using this as a means of inciting the disenfranchised in their populations to violence. On the other hand, a stable democracy in Iraq could have a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence.</b> Clearly, there was a gamble there, and only the post-war period will prove which viewpiont was correct.|$|E
50|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence,</b> set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E
5000|$|The famines were {{a product}} both of uneven {{rainfall}} and British economic and administrative policies. Colonial polices implicated include rack-renting, levies for war, free trade policies, {{the expansion of}} export agriculture, and neglect of agricultural investment. Indian exports of opium, rice, wheat, indigo, jute, and cotton were {{a key component of}} the economy of the British empire, generating vital foreign currency, primarily from China, and stabilising low prices in the British grain market. Export crops displaced millions of acres that could have been used for domestic subsistence, and increased the vulnerability of Indians to food crises. Others dispute that exports were a major cause of the famine, pointing out that trade did have a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> on India's food consumption, albeit a small one ...|$|E
5000|$|Ua Briain's {{activities}} in the Irish Sea area as a mixture of old and new, of pragmstisim and idealism ... But they are invested with a modern purpose. Ua Briain makes one marriage with the king of Norway, and another {{with one of the}} most powerful non-royal families in Europe; he treats with the king of Scotland; his aid to the Welsh princes acts as a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> in Welsh politics; he incurs trade sanctions from the king of England, and negotiates their suspension. Altogether, Muirchertach Ó Briain lifted his head above the domestic power struggle and sought to involve Ireland in the international politics of Europe, so that some sixty years later, these activities were still well remembered, and are reflected in the vitae of St. Flannan of Killaloe.|$|E
5000|$|Merivale {{proved to}} be a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> for Leigh, but despite her {{apparent}} contentment, she was quoted by Radie Harris as confiding that she [...] "would rather have lived a short life with Larry Olivier than face a long one without him". Her first husband Leigh Holman also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier. Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Tovarich. She also appeared in the films The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961) and Ship of Fools (1965).|$|E
50|$|In 1918, the German Army in {{the east}} was the most {{powerful}} force in the region. Even more importantly, {{it was not only}} undefeated, it was victorious (in contrast to the German Army on the western front). However the commander of the German forces {{in the east}}, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties. He believed, rightly, that his army was the only <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> over the Eastern Europe. Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former Oberkommando-Ostfront (or Ober-Ost) occupation zone became a thin line to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia. The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918. Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons en masse and returned home. Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength.|$|E
5000|$|As a songwriter, Gibb contributed {{primarily}} to melody, {{with his brothers}} writing the lyrics that they would sing on the finished song (for the most part). It is difficult to identify his contributions because the songs were so shaped to the singer, but his brothers' continued writing collaboration with him on solo projects shows how much they relied on him. He was sometimes known as [...] "the quiet one" [...] for his less obvious contributions to the group, but privately {{he was a good}} teller of stories, who immensely enjoyed talking with fans. His reputation as a mild-mannered, <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> with two very ambitious brothers continued through his life. His comic personality shone on stage during Bee Gees concerts when the brothers would perform an acoustic medley. Many times during the song [...] "Holiday", Maurice would mock Robin while he was singing or pretend he was bored (Maurice did not sing on the original record).|$|E
50|$|From 1904, 2,500 tons of wolfram {{valued at}} £250,000 were {{produced}} at Wolfram Camp, {{half of which}} went through John Moffat's Irvinebank Company mill. John Moffat, a large speculator and enterprising investor in north Queensland mining, was diversifying his interests through steady exports of rare metals. The Irvinebank Mining Company spent upwards of £1,000 on development work on the main mines the Weate, Tully, Weate United and Comerford in 1905. The Irvinebank Company set up the battery in 1906 on Bulluburrah Creek in the lower valley using the technology for separating molybdenite which was developed by local miners. W.A. Pepper was the battery manager. The battery comprised: a rockbreaker, Cornish rolls, a Krupp table, and a Frue vanner to remove the quartz. This battery was a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> on Wolfram Camp - treating ore from the Mulligan, United, Downfall, Nichol's, Forget-me-Not, Bonner, Tully, Weate, Larkin United, Murphy's and Leinster's claims. The mill was closed for long periods throughout 1909 because of strikes over the 44-hour week. It operated again from 1910 to 1912 and was closed in the rationalisation of the Irvinebank Mining Company's assets that year.|$|E
5000|$|On his {{retirement}} the Guardian newspaper commented:- [...] "If {{he has a}} public profile at all it is because Byford came to symbolise the apparent excesses of top executive pay at the corporation. There he was, grey man with a job for life, half a million pounds in salary and, {{because he had been}} at the BBC so long without ever leaving, an uncapped two-thirds final salary pension entitlement and no obvious market rate comparator to justify such riches. It was very easy to put the question, as even many lower ranking BBC staff did - who else would pay Mark Byford £500,000 and for what? - knowing there was no very good answer." [...] However, the remainder of that article, written by media commentator, Steve Hewlett, suggested that his presence might be missed greatly at the Corporation. [...] "He made things happen and by common consent brought a firm moral sense to everything he did, rising above his own particular interests." [...] It went on to highlight how he was a <b>stabilising</b> <b>influence</b> on Director General, Mark Thompson.That opinion appeared highly prophetic {{in the light of the}} two major Newsnight scandals - concerning Sir Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine respectively - which engulfed the BBC within 18 months of Byford's departure. Both of those incidents led to widespread adverse criticism of high level management of journalism within the BBC and were surrounded by suggestions that the Director General of the day was not sufficiently informed about issues highly significant for the reputation of the Corporation.|$|E
