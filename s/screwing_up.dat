500|$|In July 2005, former CBS {{reporter}} Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in {{his book}} 100 People Who Are <b>Screwing</b> <b>Up</b> America. Goldberg wrote that [...] "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left." [...] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation [...] "is an act, a put-on." [...] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.|$|E
500|$|Gary Anderson's missed kick {{has been}} singled out as the main {{contributing}} factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able {{to capitalize on the}} late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss {{as one of the most}} devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to Chad Hartman, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, [...] " [...] will always be known as the guy who was a part of <b>screwing</b> <b>up</b> the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." [...] ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including two further NFC Championship losses in 2000 and 2009. Cunningham concurred by claiming, [...] "With that kick, it just seemed like the whole franchise went wide left." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the character's death, Digital Spy's Kris Green praised Crace's acting. He {{compared}} Danielle's {{revelation that}} Ronnie {{was her mother}} to the EastEnders storyline several years previously, when Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) revealed she was actually the mother of her supposed sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan). Green opined: [...] "Although it didn't quite capture the magic of [...] it definitely comes an extremely close second." [...] He concluded: [...] "I'd probably {{go as far as}} to say that it's one of the best episodes EastEnders has produced in a long time". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian Sarah Dempster. Simon called it [...] "the EastEnders episode of the year", though was again critical of Danielle, writing: [...] "As a nation we've been driven mad by Danielle <b>screwing</b> <b>up</b> her forehead, shrugging her shoulders and walking around like a wide eyed simpleton. She isn't the first person in the world to track down their biological mother and while it's seldom easy, I can't imagine it's ever been quite so hard as Danielle has made it." [...] Writing for The Times, Tim Teeman was critical of the length of time it took for the storyline to conclude, calling it [...] "the most drawn-out 'reveal' in soapland". He deemed Ashdown's scripting of Danielle's exit to be [...] "mad crescendo after mad crescendo", and the storyline as a whole [...] "implausible", concluding that by the time Danielle died in Ronnie's arms: [...] "EastEnders had hit the misery mother lode." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him <b>screwing</b> <b>up</b> a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Ortiz began boxing at the insistence of his father, an alcoholic who often beat his children following his wife's departure. In an interview, Victor said, [...] "I hated that lady. I drew her a card once with a little rose on it and I gave it to her. She just threw it down and said 'What do I want that shit for?'

2500|$|Initially, the TCP managed both {{datagram}} transmissions and routing, but as {{the protocol}} grew, other researchers recommended a division of functionality into protocol layers. [...] Advocates included Jonathan Postel of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, who edited the Request for Comments (RFCs), the technical and strategic document series that has both documented and catalyzed Internet development. Postel stated, [...] "We are <b>screwing</b> <b>up</b> in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering." [...] Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended {{to create an environment}} where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. The Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.|$|E
