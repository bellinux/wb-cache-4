25|$|Due to the foggy {{conditions}} and limited visibility at the airport, it took controllers nearly {{two minutes to}} determine that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to North Central Flight 575. Once they did, they alerted the Chicago Fire Department, which arrived at the scene about a minute later, three minutes after the crash. Employing 11 crash and fire vehicles and two ambulances, the fire department extinguished the fire in about 16 minutes at around 6:19p.m. CST.|$|E
25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of what was {{happening}} to General Belgrano, as they were out of touch with her in the gloom and had not seen the distress rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Paris, they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming {{at the beach}} and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: [...] "They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination." [...] In Fitzgerald's, [...] "A Life in Letters," [...] Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler. He writes of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda's fidelity. The book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda's love, of courtship, break, restoration with financial success, and the Jozan betrayal: [...] "I feel old too, this summer... the whole burden of this novel—the loss of those illusions that give such color {{to the world that}} you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory." [...] The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis; the typescript was sent to Scribners at the end of October. Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks, [...] "That September 1924, I knew <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> that could never be repaired." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the surrender, the Japanese {{would remain}} {{in control of the}} camp until 11 September. During this period, there were no work parties and the prisoners did not suffer any beatings. [...] "It became {{apparent}} during the next few days that the Japanese soldiers knew <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> but were not sure what it was", wrote Pepler. Extra food was provided by the Japanese shortly afterwards; the camp hospital was furnished with bed chairs and mosquito nets for the first time, and substantial amounts of medicine were issued.|$|E
2500|$|The mount {{was covered}} by the cloud for six days, and on the seventh day Moses went into {{the midst of the}} cloud and was [...] "in the mount forty days and forty nights." [...] And Moses said, [...] "the [...] {{delivered}} unto me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the [...] spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly." [...] Before the full forty days expired, the children of Israel collectively decided that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to Moses, and compelled Aaron to fashion a golden calf, and he [...] "built an altar before it" [...] and the people [...] "worshipped" [...] the calf.|$|E

2500|$|Some critics accused Baudrillard {{of instant}} revisionism; {{a denial of}} the {{physical}} action of the conflict (which was related to his denial of reality in general). Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and Berkelian idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin (in his book Baudrillard and the Media) have argued that Baudrillard was {{more concerned with the}} West's technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, and what that means for the present possibility of war. Merrin argued that Baudrillard was not denying that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral [...] "atrocity masquerading as a war". Merrin viewed the accusations of amorality as redundant and based on a misreading. In Baudrillard's own words (pp.71–72): ...|$|E
2500|$|As Rivers {{notes in}} Instinct and the Unconscious, one manifestation of {{his lack of}} visual memory was his {{inability}} to visualise {{any part of the}} upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. This visual blank is made even more significant by the fact that Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than {{he had been able to}} with any house since and, although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home. [...] With the evidence that he was presented with, Rivers was led to the conclusion that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to him on the upper floor of that house, the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it [...] "interfered with [...] comfort and happiness". Indeed, not only was that specific memory rendered inaccessible but his sensory memory in general appears to have been severely handicapped from that moment.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{investigators}} and psychics such as Annette Martin and Jeanne Borgen and paranormal teams {{have sought to}} [...] "contact spirits" [...] at Alcatraz. KGO Radio Morning News anchor Ted Wygant, a skeptic of the paranormal, visited Alcatraz in 1982 with psychic Jeanne Borgen and spent the night there. Wygant said {{for most of the}} duration of the visit they found nothing, but around 3 am in the utility corridor, the place where three of the men of the 1946 Battle of Alcatraz were shot dead, he said that although it was pitch black, he suddenly got a [...] "tremendous feeling of anger" [...] and felt an evil presence lying on the floor at the place where the men had died. He started cursing and said that he felt a strong compulsion to fire a gun at people. Borgen said that it left Wygant quite out of character, and said that when they turned on the light, [...] "his face was changed, you could see the anger and hate in his eyes". Wygant has said though that it is quite difficult for him to believe there was something really there, but he is certain that he felt that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> In 1984, paranormal investigator and writer Michael Kouri claimed that he visited the prison and in a trance was spoken to by the spirit of a dead prisoner who told him that he had been beaten and had his legs broken and was placed in solitary confinement. According to the Los Angeles Times, one woman, who claimed to be psychic, began speaking German in a child's voice {{on a tour of the}} prison hospital, and said that Alcatraz was frequented by spirits.|$|E
