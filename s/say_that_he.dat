5|$|Maximus {{is one of}} {{the last}} men to be {{recognized}} by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church. In the encyclical Spe Salvi (2007), Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus 'the great Greek doctor of the Church', although it's not clear if the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus 'Doctor of the Church' or to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> already was one.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley's detractors <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not {{a visionary}} for taking {{baseball}} west. They say the game was naturally heading toward geographical expansion and O'Malley just an opportunist. Rather than truly being a leader these detractors say his leadership was a manifestation of making the most money.|$|E

5|$|Solomon was {{set free}} during the canonization {{process of the}} first king of Hungary, Stephen I, in 1083. In an attempt to regain his crown, Solomon allied with the Pechenegs, but King Ladislaus {{defeated}} their invading troops. According to a nearly contemporaneous source, Solomon died on a plundering raid in the Byzantine Empire. Later legends <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> survived and died as a saintly hermit in Pula (Croatia).|$|E
5|$|The First Triumvirate did {{not approve}} {{the use of the}} flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was {{initially}} unaware of that. He had the flag blessed by the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta, on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. When he found out the flag was not approved, he put it away. When asked, he would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was keeping it for a great victory.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{frequently}} accompanied {{his wife}} to church services. Third-hand reports <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took communion, although he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite. He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non-communicants (as was the custom of the day). He ceased attending at all on communion Sundays after being admonished by a rector.|$|E
5|$|After Ealdred's {{return to}} England he {{took charge of}} the sees of Hereford and Ramsbury. Ealdred also {{administered}} Winchcombe Abbey and Gloucester Abbey. The authors of the Handbook of British Chronology Third Edition say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060, but other sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> merely administered the see while it was vacant, or that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This is not to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding {{to be the best}} Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E

5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País.

5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E
50|$|The royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies, Jesus College MS. 20, and Hengwrt MS. 202 {{show him}} as the {{ancestor}} and descendant of kings, and thus presumably a king himself.

5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and {{the initial}} {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma President David Boren wrote {{a letter}} to Big12 {{commissioner}} Kevin Weiberg asking for the loss to be erased from Oklahoma's record, something that Weiberg did not support. Weiberg did <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would raise concerns about the Pac-10 policy of using their own officials for inter-conference games in Pac-10 stadiums. Bob Stoops said that he may cancel the 2008 game scheduled at Washington if the Pac-10 officiating policy is not changed.|$|E
5|$|The {{archbishop}} {{swore to}} Henry I {{that he would}} support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22December 1135. He was persuaded {{to do so by}} Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen's brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right to impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore that he had been present at the king's deathbed and had heard the king <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> released the oath.|$|E

50|$|Nectarios {{pleaded with}} his bishop (the Bishop of Adelaide) {{to let him}} go to Madagascar, but the bishop at first refused, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was too useful to him where he was.

5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender {{and this has been}} repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.|$|E
5|$|Various {{stories have}} been told about Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was a}} nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E
