Dry-process roasting and/or sublimation products with an arsenolite/sulphur mixture consist mainly of amorphous golden yellow oval drops and spherules of amorphous arsenic <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass</b> (g-AsxSx) with a smooth surface ranging from 1 to 20 μm Ø in association with arsenolite crystal aggregates {{and members of the}} alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9). A bright lemon yellow to orange-red arsenic sulphide pigment on a sixteenth/seventeenth-century South German polychrome recumbent sculpture and a seventeenth-century Dutch painting attributed to Rembrandt's studio has been identified as an artificial orpiment produced with dry-process (roasting/sublimation) methods. The recumbent figure contains (i) yellow, orange or red-brown amorphous splintery fragments and spherules of arsenic <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass</b> of up to 25 μm Ø, (ii) yellow, brown or red-brown crystalline spherules and splintery fragments of alacranite, (iii) lemon yellow to red-brown agglomerates of arsenic <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass,</b> and (iv) colourless irregular fragments or octahedral crystals of arsenolite. This type can be classified as 'complex artificial orpiment'. The arsenic sulphide pigment in the yellowish paint layers of the Rembrandt studio painting proved to be very uniform bright yellow spherules (max. 9 μm Ø) of arsenic <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass,</b> which can be classified as 'purified artificial orpiment glass'. A deep red historic arsenic sulphide cake from the collection of the Landesmuseum Joanneum (Graz, Austria) called 'Realgar' {{turned out to be an}} amorphous arsenic <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass</b> matrix (approx. g-As 2 S 3) filled with numerous red crystal aggregates of alacranite (approx. As 8 S 9) in the form of spherules, which fill gas bubbles and pores with an average 3 μm Ø (max. 20 μm Ø). A very fine-grained light red arsenic sulphide powder called 'Realgar' from an archaeological excavation of a historic arsenic smelter near Strassegg (Steiermark, Austria) turned out to be a member of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) in the form of idiomorphic crystals and complex twinned crystal aggregates (average 10 μm Ø, max. 30 μm Ø). All red-colored crystals or crystal aggregates of artificial arsenic sulphides that have been called 'realgar' in the past are in fact members of the alacranite solid solution series.

40|$|Optical fibres {{drawn from}} {{sulphide}}-based glasses {{have been studied}} now for almost two decades. Initial work began in the 1970 s when fibres from glasses based on arsenic sulphide or germanium sulphide rapidly found application as infrared waveguides, providing transmission to beyond 5 microns. In 1993, the first active application of a <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass</b> was demonstrated and measurements on bulk samples of rare-earth doped gallium lanthanum glass showed the possibility of pump efficiencies of over 60 %. This lead to widespread activity {{with the goal of}} demonstrating a low-loss <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass</b> optical fibre and an 1300 nm optical fibre amplifier. Today, research on several families of <b>sulphide</b> <b>glass,</b> including gallium lanthanum sulphides, germanium sulphides and halide-modified glasses has progressed to the point where several of these materials have been drawn into fibre form. However, application of fibre is critically dependent on the achievement of a low loss single-mode optical fibre which has yet to be achieved. At Southampton, our work has focussed on gallium lanthanum glass and fibre, for both active and passive applications. As part of our ongoing programme, optical, thermal and mechanical properties of these glasses are under study. In parallel with this, fibre drawing is being refined in a quest for practical fibres. Over the past year, improvements have been made in understanding and eliminating the sources of loss in these glasses. In this paper, we describe the current specifications of fibres based on this material group.

40|$|The {{majority}} of optical fibre now installed in Europe and North America operates {{in the second}} telecommunications window, centred at 1. 32 microns. In this region, fibre loss reaches one of its minima and chromatic dispersion is negligible. Unlike trans-oceanic cables which operate at 1. 55 microns, no optical fibre amplifier exists at this lower wavelength, thus necessitating a conversion of optical signals to electrical signals in order to amplify and re-transmit over long distances. It is clear that to upgrade currently installed fibre and to remove barriers that limit the full exploitation of land-based fibre, an optical fibre amplifier operating at 1. 3 microns will play a critical role. Intense interest in fluoride glass optical fibres doped with praseodymium, the PDFA, was generated three {{years ago with the}} announcement of a 1. 3 micron amplifier operating with a gain of over 10 dB. This host was extremely inefficient however, with a gain of less than 0. 1 dB/mW of pump power, compared to the gain coefficient of 11 dB/mw achieved with an erbium-doped amplifier operating at 1. 55 microns. <b>Sulphide</b> <b>glasses</b> based on Ga 2 S 3 and La 2 S 3 have recently attracted attention as a promising alternate host for the rare-earth praseodymium. When doped in a suitable glass, two energy levels of this ion are separated by an energy equivalent to 1. 3 microns. In fibre form, such a glass provides the potential for highly efficient amplification. In addition to the basic Ga:La:S composition, we have developed and characterized a number of related glasses with an aim to improving quantum efficiency and also the thermal properties which are critical for fibre drawing. The goal is to approach the present 1. 550 micron power amplifier performance of a 20 dB gain using only a few tens of milliwatts of pump power.
