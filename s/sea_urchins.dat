5|$|Sea otters consume over 100 {{different}} prey species. In {{most of its}} range, the sea otter's diet consists {{almost exclusively}} of marine benthic invertebrates, including <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses. Where prey such as <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> clams, and abalone are present {{in a range of}} sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3inches (7cm) across.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> in check. <b>Sea</b> <b>urchins</b> graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry is {{pervasive}} in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or mirror symmetry, {{as do the}} leaves of plants and some flowers such as orchids. Plants often have radial or rotational symmetry, as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones.

5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), {{hatchling}} turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors.

5|$|Later, more {{specific}} similarities were discovered: for example, the Distal-less gene {{was found in}} 1989 {{to be involved in}} the development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies, the fins of fish, the wings of chickens, the parapodia of marine annelid worms, the ampullae and siphons of tunicates, and the tube feet of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins.</b> It was evident that the gene must be ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago). Evo-devo had started to uncover the ways that all animal bodies were built during development.|$|E
5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperTwo {{successful}} {{cases of}} <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> enhancement activities were considered using {{the experiences of}} two neighboring provinces in Ilocos Sur and Ilocos Norte, both located in Northwestern Luzon, Philippines. One case was done at the coastal waters of Nagabungan Bay in Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, which experienced a decline in <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> population in the early 1990 s with 1 – 2 pcs 100 m⁻² fishing area. The reseeding project was done in 2002. One thousand pieces of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> juveniles were stocked in submerged plastic cages in the reef area of the said bay. These were grown to adult size in four months, maintained as spawners, and allowed to naturally spawn to repopulate the area. In 2004, <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> abundance in the bay and neighboring towns increased to 30 - 60 pcs 100 m⁻². Another case was done at Nalvo, Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur, where <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> stock enhancement activity was successful. A declining <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> abundance of only 20 pcs 100 m⁻² fishing area was also observed in the late 1980 s. In the early 1990 s, the University of Northern Philippines reared <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> in cages leading {{to the development of}} <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> culture in the area. After two years, the population of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> tremendously increased to more than 100 pcs 100 m⁻² fishing area.

5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{individuals}} {{within a particular}} area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.|$|E
