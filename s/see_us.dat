Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} assassination, Palme {{had been accused}} of being pro-Soviet and not {{sufficiently}} safeguarding Sweden's national interest. Arrangements had therefore been made for him to go to Moscow to discuss a number of contentious bilateral issues, including then ongoing Soviet submarine incursions into Swedish waters (<b>see</b> <b>US</b> Psychological warfare and U 137).|$|E

25|$|In 1997, {{adverse effects}} of low-dose BPA {{exposure}} in laboratory animals were first proposed. Modern studies began finding possible connections to health issues caused by exposure to BPA during pregnancy and during development. <b>See</b> <b>US</b> public health regulatory history and Chemical manufacturers reactions to bans. As of 2014, research and debates are ongoing as to whether BPA should be banned or not.|$|E
25|$|In case a {{war broke}} out between NATO and the Soviet Union, the fighter {{aircraft}} stationed in Bodø were to support NATO's Atomic Strike Plan, which would <b>see</b> <b>US</b> Strategic Air Command (SAC) bomber aircraft drop nuclear warheads over {{the base of the}} Soviet Northern Fleet. Norwegian fighter pilots trained on techniques for dropping nuclear bombs, but the battle plans called for them to be used for reconnaissance and precision bombing of radar and communications targets with conventional bombs. With the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles, SAC's interest for Bodø dwindled from 1959.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover Defender {{vehicles}} {{have been}} used by many of the world's military forces, including the US in some limited capacity, following experience with the vehicle during the first Gulf War, where US forces found the British Army's vehicles to be more capable and better suited to operation in urban areas and for air-lifting than the Humvee. (<b>See</b> <b>U.S.</b> Army Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.) The British Army has used Land Rovers since the 1950s, as have many countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. The British Army replaced its Series III fleet with One Tens in 1985, with a smaller fleet of Nineties following in 1986. Both used the 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesel engine. These older vehicles are reaching the end of their service lives, with many being sold onto the civilian market from the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Chief of Staff of the United States Army Harold Keith Johnson, and {{subsequently}} historians such as Harry G. Summers, Jr. came to <b>see</b> <b>US</b> goals as having become mutually inconsistent, because defeating the Communists would require declaring a national emergency and fully mobilising {{the resources of}} the US. General Johnson was critical of Westmoreland's defused corporate style, considering him overattentive to what government officials wanted to hear. Nonetheless, Westmoreland was operating within longstanding army protocols of subordinating the military to civilian policymakers. The most important constraint was staying on the strategic defensive out of fear of Chinese intervention, {{but at the same time}} President Lyndon B. Johnson had made it clear that there was a higher commitment to defending Vietnam. Much of the thinking about defense was by academics turned government advisors who concentrated on nuclear weapons, seen as making conventional war obsolete. The fashion for counter-insurgency thinking also denigrated the role of conventional warfare. Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Korean War, Americans expected their wars to end with the unconditional surrender of the enemy.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{aircraft}} were acquired by companies who were contracted by the United States Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management to provide airtankers for fighting wildfires. Others were pressed into civilian cargo service. After {{a series of}} crashes, the age and safety of the aircraft being used as airtankers became a serious concern, and the U.S. C-119 airtanker fleet was permanently grounded in 1987. Eventually, many of these aircraft were provided to museums across the U.S. in a complicated – and ultimately illegal – scheme where stored USAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports and Navy Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine patrol aircraft were provided to the contractors {{in exchange for the}} C-119s. (<b>See</b> <b>U.S.</b> Forest Service airtanker scandal.) After the end of the airtanker days, many C-119s flew in Alaska for Northern Pacific Transport, Gifford Aviation, Stebbins & Ambler Air transport, and Delta Associates, being used for public service contracts, such as hauling building materials to the villages in the bush of Alaska that have no road access.|$|E
500|$|In 1905–06, George, Prince of Wales, visited India {{and wrote}} to the King from Agra, [...] "In the evening we saw the Munshi. [...] He has not grown more {{beautiful}} and is getting fat. [...] I must say he was most civil and humble and really pleased to <b>see</b> <b>us.</b> [...] He wore his C.V.O. which I {{had no idea he}} had got. [...] I am told he lives quietly here and gives no trouble at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The battle had {{significant}} effects within the Scots community of North Carolina, where Loyalists refused {{to turn out}} when calls to arms were made later in the war, and many were routed {{out of their homes}} by the pillaging activities of their Patriot neighbors. [...] Flora MacDonald ended up returning to her native Skye in 1779, and when General Charles Cornwallis passed through the Cross Creek area in 1781, he reported that [...] "any of the inhabitants rode into camp, shook me by the hand, said they were glad to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> and that we had beat Greene and then rode home." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2004, {{the band}} {{continued}} to tour {{in support of}} The Artist in the Ambulance. Island Records issued a promotional disc (that features an alternate version of [...] "The Artist in the Ambulance") in early 2004 that would become the basis for If We Could Only <b>See</b> <b>Us</b> Now, a CD/DVD package outlining the group's career. Named after a lyric from [...] "So Strange I Remember You," [...] the CD portion contained live tracks from a performance at the Apple Store and various B-sides. A slot to promote the CD/DVD came on the 2004 Vans Warped Tour.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with The Times, Coombes said, [...] "It's insane {{that people think}} we would ever sound like that again... We're proud of 'Alright' and how well it did, but we never {{wanted to find a}} formula and stick to it. Our aim was always to progress and keep the music interesting, for us and for the fans. So the people who <b>see</b> <b>us</b> in the street and still shout 'We are young' may not like the new album, but fans who have grown up with us and know to expect change probably will." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Pulse of Radio, vocalist Taylor said that Slipknot would be changing their stage set around for the US arena leg. [...] "We're {{getting away from the}} pyro. We're going way more visual this time. We're incorporating a lot of video." [...] He explained that they always try to do something different: [...] "We've got people still coming to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> for, you know, after ten years, and we just want to try and give something special." [...] On the opening show of the leg, percussionist Crahan debuted a new mask which was significantly different from the one he wore while touring in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Juskalian {{spent the}} next twenty-seven months as a POW and was held in various camps in Italy, Poland and Germany. After being interrogated in Kairouan, {{he was sent to}} Tunis and flown to Naples. The planes flew at a low {{altitude}} as Juskalian described: [...] "They flew about 100feet above the Mediterranean because they were afraid that, if they flew higher, the American fighter planes—not knowing POWs were inside—would <b>see</b> <b>us</b> and shoot us down." [...] The POWs were sent to Oflag IX-A/Z British POW camp in Rotenburg an der Fulda where they remained until June 6, 1943, when they were transferred to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland.|$|E
500|$|Sven Pipien {{was hired}} in December to replace Colt. Pipien had {{previously}} played with Mary My Hope and had been a housemate of Chris. [...] Audley Freed was hired as the second guitarist before a 1998 tour {{in support of the}} band's Sho' Nuff box set. [...] Recording sessions for By Your Side were well underway at this point, and continued after the tour, but Freed did not contribute to the album. [...] Chris said of the new members, [...] "It's great. These guys want to be here—and we feed off of that. And that will become obvious when you <b>see</b> <b>us</b> on the road." ...|$|E

500|$|... "There {{was never}} a {{shortage}} of blown-up bodies {{that needed to be}} rushed to the nearest medical care. The British and French troops were in bad shape – even guys about my age looked old and tired. After three years of living and dying inside a dirt trench, you know the Brits and French were happy to <b>see</b> <b>us</b> [...] "doughboys." [...] Every last one of us Yanks believed we’d wrap this thing up in a month or two and head back home before harvest. In other words, we were the typical, cocky Americans no one wants around, until they need help winning a war." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his early}} optimism, Noades soon {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that a League club in Milton Keynes would not draw crowds much higher than those Wimbledon already attracted in south London. [...] "I couldn't really <b>see</b> <b>us</b> getting any bigger gates than what Northampton Town were currently getting at that time, and, in fact, are still getting," [...] he recalled in 2001. [...] "I really couldn't see any future in it. I can't actually see that there is a means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes." [...] Abandoning his interest in MK City, Noades sold Wimbledon to Hammam in 1981 for £40,000. Later that year Noades bought nearby Crystal Palace and briefly explored merging that club with Wimbledon.|$|E
500|$|Because Carter {{originates}} {{from the}} films, Marvel Studios co-presidents Feige and D'Esposito [...] "are very invested {{in this and}} they've been really collaborative and very generous with their world". Markus, talking about the series' place in the greater architecture of the MCU, later said [...] "you really only need to drop the tiniest bit of hint and its connected. You don't have to go, [...] "Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!"...Everything is enhanced just {{by the knowledge that}} its all connected." [...] Butters said, [...] "We always want to feel like you <b>see</b> <b>us</b> as a piece of [...] But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{said that}} he had <b>seen</b> <b>us</b> through the {{skylight}} studying a paper," [...] continued Mr. Chalk, shaking his head. [...] "I thought at the time you were rather rash, Tredgold." ...|$|R
6000|$|Looking behind us, we saw {{eight or}} ten mounted Matabele! Stalwart warriors they were--half naked, and riding stolen horses. They were coming our way! They had <b>seen</b> <b>us!</b> They were {{pursuing}} us! ...|$|R
