40|$|It {{had been}} more than 10 years since the {{previous}} agricultural census was taken. The publication of the new census opens the way for an initial analysis of the structural transformations that have occurred in the sector during that time. The study takes an in-depth look at the main changes that have taken place in the production structure and in the use of factors of production, especially labour and land. Brazil's agrarian structure has undergone significant changes in the past decade. These shifts have been brought about by alterations in the macroeconomic situation that have, in their turn, prompted changes in land use, including a reduction in the amount of land used for crops and permanent pasture and an increase in the amount used for <b>seed</b> <b>pasture.</b> One million agricultural holdings and 5. 4 million jobs have disappeared. These changes can be attributed to economic adjustment policies and the sector's own production patterns, which have affected both the use of cropland ang grazing land and the agricultural population. These shifts have also had a strong impact in terms of social equity and land distribution. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} soil management practices and irrigation on plant water relations, physiological response and productivity of chestnut stands in Northeastern Portugal were assessed during four growing seasons (2003 to 2006). Treatments were: conventional soil tillage up to 15 – 20 cm depth with a tine cultivator thrice a year (CT); no tillage with spontaneous herbaceous vegetation (NV); no tillage with rainfed <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (NP); and no tillage with irrigated <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (NIP). Results suggest that soil water availability {{was the most}} critical parameter for chestnut productivity over the study period. In all treatments, high predawn leaf water potentials (- 0. 40 to - 0. 55 MPa) were observed during the dry seasons of 2003, 2004 and 2006, showing no critical conditions for plant productivity, which is ascribed to water availability in deep soil layers. In contrast, in 2005, an extremely dry year, water potentials decreased and varied from - 1. 46 to - 1. 72 MPa in late summer, showing unfavourable conditions for nut production. Maintenance of spontaneous herbaceous vegetation without irrigation enhanced productivity of chestnut stands {{as compared with the}} conventional tillage system and the no tillage system with <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture.</b> Productivity in the soil watering system (NIP treatment) was not significantly different from that observed in the NV treatment.

So, in order to get information related to the effect of that practice, on these systems, a study was carried out since 2002, where the use of that equipment (NTR) is compared with the traditional tillage (TTC), the use of irrigated <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (ISP), droughty <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture</b> (USP) and the maintenance of natural vegetation cover under canopy (NTV).

Although {{it has been used}} as a sustainability index for assessing production systems, it does not take into account many other biophysical environmental dimensions more relevant at the local scale, such as soil erosion, nutrient imbalance, and pesticide contamination. We estimated carbon footprint, fossil fuel energy use, soil erosion, nutrient imbalance, and risk of pesticide contamination for five real beef background-finishing systems with increasing levels of intensification in Uruguay, which were combinations of grazing rangelands (RL), <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures</b> (SP), and confined in feedlot (FL).

40|$|The {{forage yield}} and quality, weed seedbank {{abundance}} and allelopathic potential of seven native grass and legume species were evaluated in field and greenhouse experiments {{conducted at the}} Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Swift Current Research and Development Centre (SCRDC), Saskatchewan, Canada. Native perennial forage species were selected from three functional groups (C 3, C 4 grasses and legumes) and seeded in 2010 and 2014 in monocultures and mixtures, including: western wheatgrass (WWG) (Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey), bluebunch wheatgrass (BBW) (Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve), nodding brome (NOB) (Bromus porteri (J. M. Coult.) Nash), little blue stem (LBS) (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash), side-oats grama (SOG) (Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.), purple prairie clover (PPC) (Dalea purpurea Vent.) and white prairie clover (WPC) (Dalea candida Willd.). Objectives of this thesis were to: 1) evaluate the long-term forage yield and quality of these forage species in monocultures and mixtures; 2) determine the weed seedbank density and aboveground weed populations in stands of these species; and 3) evaluate the allelopathic effect of these species on three problematic weeds: dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg.), scentless chamomile (Matricaria perforata Mérat) and foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.). Forage mixtures produced greater dry matter than monocultures at all harvesting times. Mixtures of which WWG was a component produced higher forage yield, and a mixture of WWG, BBW, LBS and legumes can provide sustainable forage yield and quality and can be suitable options for <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures.</b> In this study, the forage stands experienced one of the driest and wettest years {{in the history of}} the region. We observed no significant differences in forage production of each species from dry to wet year supporting the idea of high stability and productivity of native species during varying climate conditions. Mixtures of forage species also promoted lower weed densities in the seedbank and in the swards aboveground compared to monocultures. Among mixtures, those containing WWG had a significant lower abundance of weeds in the seedbank and aboveground weed populations compared to other forage species. The weed seedbank varied seasonally with the minimum number of weed seeds in early spring and maximum in late summer. The most abundant weeds in the seedbank were the least abundant weeds in aboveground population and vice versa. WWG showed promising results as a native forage species by demonstrating the potential to suppress weeds and reduce weed seed size when seeded in monocultures and mixtures. In the greenhouse, root leachate from WWG, LBS and SOG reduced the aboveground and belowground growth of weeds up to 90 %. These findings suggest that the use of allelopathic species may provide weed control and management benefits in <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures</b> and native prairie restorations. In conclusion, forage mixtures produced greater dry matter and promoted lower weed densities in the seedbank and aboveground populations compared to monocultures. This demonstrates that increasing forage mixture diversity can increase forage yield and be an effective ecological and non-chemical weed control tactic in <b>seeded</b> <b>pastures...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of {{nitrogen}} fertilizer (in the presence of potassium and phosphorus) and cutting frequency on the yield of Brachiaria ruziziensis was undertaken at the Wakwa animal Research Station on ferralitic soil. A 7 x 3 factorial design was used. The treatments were seven levels of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 90 units of nitrogen) and three cutting frequencies (heavy : 30 days, moderate : 45 days and light : 60 days). Single application of 100 units of triple superphosphate and potassium sulfate per hectare and nitrogen at the above mentioned rates was made {{at the beginning of each}} rainy season. Later, after each cutting nitrogen alone was applied. Results of three years of study indicate that fertilization consistently increased the yield of Brachiaria ruziziensis compared to non-fertilized plots by as much as 132. 8 %, 133. 7 % and 92. 83 % respectively in 1985, 1986 and 1987.

40|$|Abandoned {{pastures}} and secondary forests are increasingly prominent features of tropical landscapes. Forest regrowth on abandoned pastures is generally slow and virtually limited to regeneration from seeds from external sources, since agricultural activities alter site conditions. We hypothesize that seed availability {{is a major}} limiting factor in forest recovery on abandoned pastures. This hypothesis was tested by studying the seed bank, seed rain, and seed predation in a small pasture (1 ha) situated in a forest-pasture mosaic in northwestern Costa Rica. The tree seed density in the <b>pasture</b> <b>seed</b> bank was much lower (21 /m 2) than the density in the seed bank of a neighboring secondary forest (402 /m 2). Within a period of five weeks, 23 tree <b>seeds</b> entered the <b>pasture</b> by <b>seed</b> rain. This number is low compared to densities found in closed forests but higher than densities reported in other studies where virtually no seeds were found beyond 20 m from the forest edge. Possibly {{the small size of}} the <b>pasture</b> with <b>seed</b> sources nearby and the small-scale landscape mosaic enhance seed dispersal. Predation limits the <b>seed</b> density in <b>pastures,</b> with 42 % of the woody species consumed by predators. The low seed density in the seed bank, and hampered recruitment combined with significant losses, pose severe restrictions to forest recovery on abandoned pastures. Moderate land use, and small sized clearings with seed sources nearby may increase the pace of recovery. Nevertheless, forest establishment may still take a considerable time. Thus, enlarging the available pool of species may be a worthwhile management strategy...|$|R

The treatments were: chisel plow (average depth 15 cm), which corresponds to the traditional tillage (MT); disc harrowing tillage, up to 7 cm depth (GD); rainfed <b>seeded</b> <b>pasture,</b> with leguminous and grasses species (PS); and no-tillage with spontaneous herbaceous vegetation (NM). Results, between 1999 and 2004, showed that the average production of litterfall (leaves, burs, chestnuts and inflorescences), was greatest in NM treatment (755 g m- 2), followed by the PS (729 g m- 2), GD (708 g m- 2) and MT (627 g m- 2) treatment, although the differences were not significant.

40|$|The chief aim of pasture {{research}} is to discover means of providing the largest possible amount of highly nutritious forage {{at the time the}} animal requires it. Throughout the grazing season animal herbage requirements are relatively constant, while herbage production from pastures usually is quite variable. Several practices have been employed in an attempt to obtain more uniform seasonal production, and overcome periods of feed surplus and feed shortage during the grazing season. One such practice has been to <b>seed</b> <b>pastures</b> comprised of several species. This is based on the observation that forage species differ in their requirements, and make maximum growth at different times of the year. Thus, it has been suggested, if the correct combination of species is obtained, production will be uniform throughout the season. However, uniform production has not generally been realized, and most mixtures follow similar patterns of production, determined by factors other than species composition. This observation, brings up the question of whether it has been correct to assume that each species would maintain its individual characteristics in a mixture. It seems reasonable that one species would affect the growth habit of others with which it is associated. In the work reported herein, a comparison was made of the seasonal frowth and yield of 3 grass species when grown alone and when grown in mixtures. The mixtures included all combinations of the three species with each other, and with white Dutch clover. The total yields of the mixtures were also compared for seasonal yield fluctuations. Nitrogen determinations were made on most of the separated species. Some of the literature pertaining to problems involved in obtaining uniform seasonal production was reviewed.
