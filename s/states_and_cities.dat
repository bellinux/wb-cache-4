25|$|Shortly after President Franklin D.

25|$|In 1850, Congress {{passed the}} Fugitive Slave Act, which {{required}} {{law enforcement and}} citizens of free states to cooperate in the capture and return of slaves. This met with considerable overt and covert resistance in free <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> such as Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Refugees from slavery continued to flee the South across the Ohio River {{and other parts of}} the Mason–Dixon line dividing North from South, to the North and Canada via the Underground Railroad. Some white northerners helped hide former slaves from their former owners or helped them reach freedom in Canada.|$|E
25|$|For decades thereafter, {{passports}} {{were issued}} {{not only by}} the Department of State but also by <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities,</b> and by notaries public. For example, an internal passport dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to travel as a free black man to visit relatives in Southern slave states. Passports issued by American authorities other than the Department of State breached propriety and caused confusion abroad. Some European countries refused to recognize passports not issued by the Department of State, unless United States consular officials endorsed them. The problems led the Congress in 1856 to give to the Department of State the sole authority to issue passports.|$|E
25|$|About 1800 BC, Assyria {{came into}} {{conflict}} with the newly created city state of Babylon, which eventually eclipsed the far older Sumero-Akkadian <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> in the south; such as Ur, Isin, Larsa, Kish, Nippur, Eridu, Lagash, Umma, Uruk, Akshak and Adab, incorporating them into a greater Babylonia. Assyria remained untroubled {{by the emergence of}} the Hittite Empire and Kingdom of Mitanni, both to the north of Assyria, and by the Kassites who had seized Babylonian from its Amorite founders. After securing its borders on all sides, Assyria entered into a quiet and peaceful period in its history which lasted {{for two and a half}} centuries. The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in c. 1600 BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitannian-Hurrian domination in c. 1500 BC. The Indo-European language-speaking Mitannians are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a language isolate, i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.|$|E

25|$|Urban areas. Institutional {{arrangements}} for {{water supply and}} sanitation in Indian cities vary greatly. Typically, a state-level agency is in charge of planning and investment, while the local government (Urban Local Bodies) is in charge of operation and maintenance. Some of the largest cities have created municipal water and sanitation utilities that are legally and financially separated from the local government. However, these utilities remain weak in terms of financial capacity. In spite of decentralisation, ULBs remain dependent on capital subsidies from state governments. Tariffs are also set by state governments, which often even subsidise operating costs. Furthermore, when no separate utility exists, there is no separation of accounts for different activities within a municipality. Some <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> have non-typical institutional arrangements. For example, in Rajasthan the sector is more centralised and the state government is also in charge of operation and maintenance, while in Mumbai the sector is more decentralised and local government is also in charge of planning and investment. In 2012 the Delhi Jal Board contracted out operations and management in three zones of the city to private companies under performance-based contracts to reduce non-revenue water. The Vasant Vihar-Mehrauli zone is operated by SMPL Infrastructure of India, Malviya Nagar by Suez Environnement and the Nangloi zone by Veolia Environnement.|$|E
25|$|From the mid 14th century BC {{through to}} the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central and eastern regions of Syria and the north western Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the Middle Assyrian Empire, and both Egyptian and Hittite {{influence}} waned as a result. Powerful Assyrian kings forced tribute on Canaanite <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> from north, east and central Syria {{as far as the}} Mediterranean. Arik-den-ili (c. 1307–1296BC), consolidated Assyrian power in the Levant, he defeated and conquered ancient Semitic-speaking peoples of the so-called Ahlamu group. He was followed by Adad-nirari I (1295–1275BC) who continued expansion to the northwest, mainly {{at the expense of the}} Hittites and Hurrians, conquering Hittite territories such as Carchemish and beyond. In 1274BC Shalmaneser I ascended the throne, a powerful warrior king, he annexed territories in Syria and Canaan previously under Egyptian or Hittite influence, and the growing power of Assyria was perhaps the reason why these two states made peace with one another. This trend continued under Tukulti-Ninurta I (1244–1208BC) and after a hiatus, Tiglath-Pileser I (1115–1077BC) who conquered the Arameans of northern Syria, and thence he proceeded to conquer Damascus and the Canaanite/Phoenician cities of (Byblos), Sidon, Tyre and finally Arvad.|$|E

White governments in the South required even interstate railroads to enforce their segregation laws, despite national legislation requiring equal treatment of passengers. SCOTUS ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) that [...] "separate but equal" [...] accommodations were constitutional, but in practice, facilities for blacks were far from equal, generally being of lesser quality and underfunded. [...] Blacks faced restrictions and exclusion throughout the United States: if not barred entirely from facilities, they could use them only at different times from whites or in (usually inferior) [...] "colored sections".|$|E

[...] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel [...] "a front-line general in the war against drugs." [...] Rangel said [...] "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. [...] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent [...] "moral and political suicide". [...] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. [...] By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's [...] "Just Say No" [...] campaign had been quite valuable. [...] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time.
