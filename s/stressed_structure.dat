Forty-six children, twenty-three dyslexics and twenty-three good readers, decoded sentences with a target word placed in two different positions, either on the right (to the end of the sentence) or on the left (on the beginning of the sentence), to value the influence of semantic cues during reading.

This selection was made in order to assess the ability of reading target words with different syllabic and <b>stress</b> <b>structures.</b> The results showed that text reading performance (correct positioning of word stress and speed in decoding the whole sentence) of dyslexics was below that of good readers. In particular, dyslexic children showed more contextual facilitation than good readers, decoding better the target word when it was placed to the end of the sentence than when it was placed to the beginning of the sentence.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the photocatalytic behavior of epitaxial anatase TiO 2 thin films, using the azodye golden yellow remazol RNL 150 % as a probe molecule. The films were deposited by pulsed laser deposition on various single crystal substrates {{as well as}} on amorphous SiO 2 for comparison. It was observed that the nature of film-substrate interaction and the stress provoked by the substrate play important roles in photocatalytic properties. Indeed, the film grown on (100) SrTiO 3 presented a very poor photocatalytic activity (33 % of discoloration), which can be related to the charge distribution in the SrTiO 3 /TiO 2 interface. The film deposited on (100) LaAlO 3 showed a low activity (50 % of discoloration) attributed to a highly <b>stressed</b> <b>structure.</b> The best photocatalytic performance (80 % of discoloration) was achieved with a film grown on C-sapphire presenting a large amount of (001) anatase with a low amount of (100) rutile.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} SHM of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV) for high {{pressure}} hydrogen storage, based on embedded optical fibres and Rayleigh OFDR. Fibre Bragg Gratings in situ strain measurements on flat samples are first presented {{to assess the}} mechanical state of such anisotropic structures, and define a preliminary SHM criterion. Comparative fatigue tests were also performed on NOL rings to evaluate optical fibres mechanical impact, but their analysis in terms of energy revealed the difficulty to provide reliable results if the first cycles energy is not accurately controlled. Therefore, with no detrimental effect of the optical fibre embedment within the composite architecture, several instrumented pressure vessels were manufactured and tested. Accordingly, a mechanical criterion based on OFDR differential strain profiles analysis was defined to bring out internal defects, demonstrating the ability to early detect and locate internal flaws without requirements to inflate vessels at high pressures. Additionally, their sensitivity vs. pressure, analysed during a first burst test, provided additional valuable data about structure integrity. Finally, we define four complementary criteria based on in situ strain measurements to control pressure vessels for damage assessment, or any hydrostatic <b>stressed</b> <b>structure</b> since the underlying principles rely on strains proportionality vs. uniformly applied stresses...|$|E

The untreated and surface modified samples were characterised with optical absorption spectroscopy and two-wavelength micro-Raman spectroscopy excited with 488 nm and 785 nm light sources, allowing {{to examine the}} chemical bonding configuration of the surface layers on different depths and by selective enhancement of vibrations of different structural units. Upon treatment, simultaneously {{with the development of}} the broad D and G bands, a gradual decrease of the peaks corresponding to the C=C stretching and C=O stretching modes were observed with both excitations. Downshifting and broadening were detected for the C=C peak with both excitations and also for the C=O peak with the 488 nm excitation due to formation of condensed aromatic rings. Oppositely, upshifting was found with 785 nm excitation for the C=O peak and especially for its broad shoulder newly developed at the high wavenumber side. The latter feature was assigned to C=O groups attached to polymer chains without conjugation and the bands behaviour was interpreted by breaking of the C=C bonds of the polymer, leading to the formation of a crosslinked, disordered and <b>stressed</b> <b>structure</b> with still intact C=O groups, due to the increased nuclear damage {{at the end of the}} ion track...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} a modified Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) algorithm for optimal design of topologies for complex structures. A new approach for adaptively controlling the material elimination and a &# 039;gauss point average stress&# 039; is used as the ESO criterion {{in order to reduce the}} generation of checkerboard patterns in the resultant optimal topologies. Also, a convergence criterion is used to examine the uniformity of strength throughout a structure. The ESO algorithm is validated by comparing the ESO based solution with the result obtained using another numerical optimisation method (SIMP). The capabilities of ESO for producing an optimal design against a specified strength constraint are illustrated using two industrial design problems, viz: a bulkhead used in an aircraft structure and a sideframe used in a railway freight wagon. It has been shown that topology optimisation using ESO can result in a considerable reduction in the weight of a structure and an optimum material utilisation by generating a uniformly <b>stressed</b> <b>structure.</b> The ESO algorithm was also applied to the shape optimisation of a local geometry of the sideframe to (locally) reduce stress levels.

30|$|The axial {{shortening}} {{analysis of a}} concrete tall building essentially requires a construction sequence analysis and a creep analysis of the concrete structure. The construction sequence analysis {{is a series of}} static analyses, where new construction activities are applied to an already deformed and <b>stressed</b> <b>structure</b> (Kurc and Lulec 2013). Before defining the geometry of the newly added structure for the construction sequence analysis, it is necessary to determine what type of shortening is considered. Total shortening in a tall building can be divided into pre-installation and post-installation shortening (Fintel et al. 1987). Pre-installation shortening and post-installation shortening are sometimes called up-to-slab shortening and subsequent shortening, respectively. In cast-in-place concrete building structures, pre-installation shortening, which is the amount of shortening developed before slab installation, is meaningless since it is automatically compensated by leveling the forms. On the other hand, in steel building structures where columns are prepared to exact lengths, the total shortening, which is the sum of the pre-installation and the post-installation shortenings, is of significance because the slabs are built at a predetermined position. In this study, the analysis models are reinforced concrete tall buildings and the post-installation shortenings are calculated. In an analysis model, the displacement of each node is assumed to be zero until the node is generated. The incremental displacements are calculated for each construction step. The incremental vertical displacements at the columns and walls are accumulated to yield the post-installation shortening at the target time.|$|E

Products ranging from supercomputers to automotive engine controllers now depend on multilayer technology. But the modern multilayer circuit, with its full length Plated-Through Boles (PTH), {{is a highly}} <b>stressed</b> <b>structure,</b> prone to del-amination, barrel fracture and other modes of self [...] destruction. The plating of copper into smaller and smaller diameter holes, of ever increasing length, has brought us close to the practical lim-its of this technology. Cumulative stress and plating limitations combine to make layer count and yield an inverse relationship. Worse yet, reliability is often dramatically compromised as layer count increases. Advances in anisotropic bonding materials and a fresh approach to ML constructions, now make a reliable 100 - layer circuit pos-sible. Stress-free multilayer circuitry can now be fabricated in a simple process utilizing anisotropic technology and other inter-connects. Multilayer circuitry is fabricated by laminating double-sided circuits together with special anisotropic bonding film. Opposing conductor pads on adjacent layers are electrically connected and mechanically bonded during the laminating process. Solder microspheres, dispersed within a dimensionally stable thermosetting dielectric adhesive, provide permanent interlayer connections. A host of benefits accrue for most applications without penal-ties. Reduced cost and increased reliability are key attributes of the new process. A remarkable characteristic of the construc-tion is that stress is non-cumulative and totally independent of the layer count.
