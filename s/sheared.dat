40|$|In the AISI Specification for the Design of Cold-formed Steel Structural Members 2007, {{there are}} two types of <b>shear</b> planes used to {{determine}} the resistance of a bolted connection to block <b>shear</b> failure. When the block <b>shear</b> failure occurs by <b>shear</b> yielding and tensile rupture, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is taken to be the gross <b>shear</b> plane. Conversely, when the block <b>shear</b> failure is deemed to occur by simultaneous <b>shear</b> and tensile ruptures, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is assumed to be the net <b>shear</b> plane. Such an approach is not logical since the <b>shear</b> failure planes should be unique irrespective of the block <b>shear</b> failure mechanism. Through finite element analysis presented in this paper, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is shown to be neither the gross nor the net <b>shear</b> plane, and to be midway between the two <b>shear</b> planes assumed in design specifications. This <b>shear</b> failure plane is termed the active <b>shear</b> plane. The veracity of the active <b>shear</b> area is demonstrated in terms of the ability of the resulting block <b>shear</b> equation to predict the governing failure modes of test specimens consistently, in comparison against the equations assuming the gross and the net <b>shear</b> areas...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{strength}} {{is an important}} soil parameter. Many geotechnical failures {{have been caused by}} inadequate <b>shear</b> strength. In order to obtain a high strength modelling silty clay for use in centrifuge model tests of soil-pipeline interaction, direct <b>shear</b> tests, <b>shear</b> vane tests and cone penetration tests were conducted to investigate its <b>shear</b> strength behaviour. [...] This thesis first presents some background on the <b>shear</b> strength of soils and measurement techniques. The details of the direct <b>shear</b> tests, the <b>shear</b> vane tests, the cone penetration tests and centrifuge modelling are also discussed. The silty clays used in this study were kaolin and a kaolin-silt mixture; the plasticity indices were 30. 6 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The kaolin-silt mixture (K-S) was obtained by mixing equal amounts of kaolin and silt by weight. [...] Direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane tests were conducted on both clays at different vertical stresses under various overconsolidation ratios (OCR's). This thesis presents these test procedures and the test results. Cone penetration tests were also conducted in a centrifuge at 50 gravities to verify the results from the direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane tests and to correlate the cone penetration resistance to the undrained <b>shear</b> strength from <b>shear</b> vane and direct <b>shear</b> tests. Centrifuge modelling principles and the current methods to convert cone tip resistance to <b>shear</b> strength are also presented. Test results show that the <b>shear</b> strength of K-S is higher than that of pure kaolin. <b>Shear</b> strengths of heavily overconsolidated clays obtained from the <b>shear</b> vane tests are higher than those obtained from the direct <b>shear</b> tests.

40|$|Surface rupturing {{during the}} 28 June 1992, Landers, California earthquake, east of Los Angeles, {{accommodated}} right-lateral offsets {{up to about}} 6 m along segments of distinct, en echelon fault zones with a total length of about 80 km. The offsets were accommodated generally not by faults [...] distinct slip surfaces [...] but rather by <b>shear</b> zones, tabular bands of localized <b>shearing.</b> In long, straight stretches of fault zones at Landers the rupture is characterized by telescoping of <b>shear</b> zones and intensification of shearing: broad <b>shear</b> zones of mild <b>shearing,</b> containing narrow <b>shear</b> zones of more intense <b>shearing,</b> containing even-narrower <b>shear</b> zones of very intense <b>shearing,</b> which may contain a fault. Thus the ground ruptured across broad belts of <b>shearing</b> with subparallel walls, oriented NW. Each broad belt consists of a broad zone of mild <b>shearing,</b> extending across its entire width (50 to 200 m), and much narrower (a few m wide) <b>shear</b> zones that accommodate most of the offset of the belt and are portrayed by en echelon tension cracks. In response to right-lateral <b>shearing,</b> the slices of ground bounded by the tension cracks rotated in a clockwise sense, producing left lateral <b>shearing,</b> and the slices were forced against {{the walls of the}} <b>shear</b> zone, producing thrusting. Even narrower <b>shear</b> zones formed within the narrow <b>shear</b> zones, and some of these were faults. Although the narrower <b>shear</b> zones probably are indicators to right-lateral fault segments at depth, the surface rupturing during the earthquake is characterized not by faulting, but by zones of <b>shearing</b> at various scales. Furthermore, understanding of the formation of the <b>shear</b> zones may be critical to understanding of earthquake faulting because, where faulting is associated with the formation of a <b>shear</b> zone, the faulting occurs late {{in the development of the}} <b>shear</b> zone. The faulting occurs after a <b>shear</b> zone or a belt of <b>shear</b> zones forms...|$|R

40|$|The exact {{effect that}} each of the basic <b>shear</b> design {{parameters}} exerts on the <b>shear</b> capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams without <b>shear</b> reinforcement (Vc) is still unclear. Previous research on this subject often yielded contradictory results, especially for reinforced high-strength concrete (HSC) beams. Furthermore, by simply adding Vc and the contribution of stirrups Vs to calculate the ultimate <b>shear</b> capacity Vu, current <b>shear</b> design practice assumes that the addition of stirrups does not alter the effect of <b>shear</b> design parameters on Vc. This paper investigates the validity of such a practice. Data on 656 reinforced concrete beams were used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the <b>shear</b> capacity of reinforced concrete beams and evaluate the performance of several existing <b>shear</b> strength calculation procedures. A parametric study revealed that the effect of <b>shear</b> reinforcement on the <b>shear</b> strength of RC beams decreases at a higher reinforcement ratio. It was also observed that the concrete contribution to <b>shear</b> resistance, Vc, in RC beams with <b>shear</b> reinforcement is noticeably larger than that in beams without <b>shear</b> reinforcement, and therefore most current <b>shear</b> design procedures provide conservative predictions for the <b>shear</b> strength of RC beams with <b>shear</b> reinforcement...|$|R
30|$|A quasi-simple <b>shear</b> test, {{which is}} the most direct method for {{examining}} the <b>shear</b> properties of sheet metals, has been applied to measure the <b>shear</b> moduli of wood.

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{viscosity}} {{is used as}} a parameter {{that characterizes}} the energy dissipation rate under <b>shear</b> loading. For instance, <b>shear</b> viscosity for Newtonian fluid is an intrinsic material parameter and independent of <b>shear</b> rate. Through the method of suspending small particles inside of the Newtonian fluid, particle concentration is formed and exhibits a number of rheological phenomena, for instance, <b>shear</b> thinning, <b>shear</b> thickening, thixotropy, yielding, and <b>shear</b> induced aggregation. In some occasions, the energy dissipation rate decreases with the increasing <b>shear</b> rate, which means decreased <b>shear</b> viscosity and corresponding <b>shear</b> stress increases below linearity with the respect to <b>shear</b> rate, it is defined as <b>shear</b> thinning. To {{the other end of the}} spectrum, another type of non-Newtonian behavior, in which a steep rise in <b>shear</b> viscosity is observed and corresponding <b>shear</b> stress increases faster than linearity with respect to <b>shear</b> rate, it is defined as <b>Shear</b> Thickening (ST). Although this counter intuitive phenomenon of ST was initially viewed as a problem, for instance, complicating and limiting the rate of industrial processes which involved combination of high <b>shear</b> rates and highly concentrated suspensions such as paper coating and pumping of slurries, the unique material properties, such as increased energy dissipation together with increased elastic modulus, make the <b>shear</b> thickening materials very favorable candidates for damping and shock absorption applications. Consequently, engineers and colloid scientists have endeavored to study the science and practical problems of the <b>shear</b> thickening materials. More recently, it is widely proposed that when engineered into composite materials, <b>Shear</b> Thickening Fluids (STFs) can be controlled and harnessed, and thus triggers the development of large number of novel fluids or elastomer materials featuring <b>shear</b> thickening, which in turn broaden the horizon of <b>shear</b> thickening study, and the application of the <b>shear</b> thickening phenomenon is greatly widened as a result...|$|R
5|$|Located {{within an}} area of {{moderate}} southwesterly wind shear, the depression was slow to organize; early on October 14, a clear center was not depicted on Infrared satellite imagery. The depression moved to the west-northwest and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicholas late on October 14 while located 1,200miles (1,930km) east of the Windward Islands. On October 15, deep convection became much better organized, though the center of Nicholas remained displaced from the deepest of the shower activity. Despite the shear, the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest, a motion caused by a mid-level ridge to its north. On October 16, Nicholas transitioned from a <b>sheared,</b> unorganized system to a more organized system, {{as a result of}} banding features and improvement in its convective pattern due to lesser amounts of vertical shear and a healthier anticyclone over the storm. Nicholas continued to strengthen, and attained a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October 17 while located 875miles (1,410km) east of the Leeward Islands.

Foreword Mudslide is a common geological disaster. China, with complex geological environment and concentrate precipitation, which result into frequent mudslide, suffers a great threaten to its people's lives and property safety. Mudslide, in essence, is the soil <b>shear</b> failure. Soil <b>shear</b> failure forms a failure surface, then the surface extended into a mudslide.

Soil <b>shear</b> strength constitutes by the soil internal friction and the cohesion. When the mudslide hidden point take a rainfall, soil moisture content raises, the internal friction and the cohesion reduce, lead to the weakness of the <b>shear</b> strength.

The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water.

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Fern was a {{damaging}} {{storm that}} struck Yap in the 1996 Pacific typhoon season.

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{strength}} of soil {{is characterized by}} cohesion, {{angle of internal friction}} and dilatation. The first two parameters mentioned primarily define the soil's ability to resist <b>shear</b> stress underspecified load. These parameters can be determined by tests conducted either in the laboratory or the field for use in design of geotechnical structures. Some of the tests in the laboratory to determine the <b>shear</b> {{strength of}} soil, include triaxial, ring <b>shear,</b> torsional <b>shear,</b> direct <b>shear</b> and direct simple <b>shear.</b> Direct <b>shear</b> test is the most widely used geotechnical <b>shear</b> device due to its simplicity, however, the test suffers from stress inhomogeneity. Direct simple <b>shear</b> apparatus was developed because of the shortcomings in the direct <b>shear</b> test. In these two tests, different <b>shearing</b> conditions are applied to soil samples. For the direct <b>shear</b> test, <b>shearing</b> occurs at a predetermined center of the specimen which may not be the weakest plane of the soil while indirect simple <b>shear,</b> the entire specimen distorts without the formation of single <b>shearing</b> surface. The mode of <b>shearing</b> established in the direct simple <b>shear</b> device is similar to that which occurs around the shaft of a pile. In contrast to the extensive geotechnical application of direct <b>shear</b> test, limited information exists on direct simple <b>shear</b> test. This thesis endeavours to establish {{the relationship between the two}} tests by undertaking extensive testing to obtain a better understanding of direct simple <b>shear</b> test as used for testing local soils and to determine a correlation with the results from direct <b>shear</b> tests. A series of <b>shear</b> tests were undertaken on Klipheuwel sand, Kaolin clay and composite of the sand and clay using universal <b>shear</b> device. The soils were mixed with water in percentages of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %, and the composite with clay percentages of 10, 25, 50 and 75 %, to investigate the impact of water and clay on the <b>shear</b> parameters determined from the two tests. The results showed that direct <b>shear</b> test gives higher <b>shear</b> strength when compared to direct simple <b>shear</b> test under the same soil condition. The addition of water, and clay, generally reduced the internal friction angle of sand for both tests. Furthermore, increase in cohesion was observed with the addition of water to Kaolin clay for the direct simple <b>shear</b> test and the reverse was true in the direct <b>shear</b> test. The correlation factors developed in this study for the direct simple <b>shear</b> test could be used to refine the results from the direct <b>shear</b> test...|$|R

Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by MÃ©tÃ©o-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E
5|$|After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and {{contained}} little deep and persistent convection; with dry air infringing {{on the western}} edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being <b>sheared,</b> the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September12. After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60miles per hour (100km/h) at 0000UTC on September14.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after forming, {{the storm}} moved northwestward around the {{periphery}} of a ridge of high pressure in the central Atlantic. As Fay moved away from its parent upper low, wind shear once again increased. The National Hurricane Center originally expected the cyclone to remain weak, but Fay began organizing more quickly than anticipated. Relatively strong winds sampled by a Hurricane Hunters aircraft necessitated a special off-hour advisory to raise the cyclone's intensity estimate. The storm started to acquire characteristics of a fully tropical system, and despite strong southerly wind shear preventing thunderstorms from developing near the center, Fay's wind speeds steadily increased. Upper-level air divergence from the nearby non-tropical low {{may have contributed to}} the storm's resilience. After convection became more symmetrical and the wind field contracted, Fay transitioned into a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on October11. At the same time, the system turned toward the north around the central Atlantic ridge, soon gaining an easterly component to its movement. Fay remained heavily <b>sheared,</b> with the deepest convection still displaced from the center.|$|E
