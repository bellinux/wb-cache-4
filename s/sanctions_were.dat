5|$|Sanctions against FR Yugoslavia {{were lifted}} in January 2001.

5|$|The Abyssinian crisis {{showed how}} the League could be {{influenced}} by the self-interest of its members; {{one of the reasons why}} the <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and Adolf Hitler into an alliance.|$|E
5|$|After the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), the British {{government}} {{petitioned the}} United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> expanded again in 1968.|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model of deterrence is studied {{in which the}} imposition of nonmonetary (as opposed to monetary) <b>sanctions</b> <b>is</b> socially costly. It is therefore desirable that the system of <b>sanctions</b> <b>be</b> designed so that <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> imposed infrequently. If courts possess perfect information, the optimal system <b>is</b> such that <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> never imposed-all who can be deterred will be [...] but, realistically, courts' information will <b>be</b> imperfect and <b>sanctions</b> will <b>be</b> imposed.

5000|$|In {{his next}} chapter he focuses in {{more on the}} {{specifics}} of Utilitarianism when he writes about the sanctions of oneself. He states that a person possesses two sanctions; the internal sanction and the external sanction. According to Mill, the internal <b>sanction</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a feeling in our own mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation of duty, which in properly cultivated moral natures rises, in the more serious cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility." [...] (Mill 6) Shorthand, he basically just explains that your internal <b>sanction</b> <b>is</b> your conscience. The external <b>sanction</b> he says <b>is</b> [...] "the hope of favour {{and the fear of}} displeasure, from our fellow creatures or from the Ruler of the Universe". This states that the external <b>sanction</b> <b>is</b> almost a form of fear of God himself. The <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> mentioned because according to Mill the internal <b>sanction</b> <b>is</b> what grasps onto the concept of Utilitarianism and is what make people want to accept Utilitarianism.|$|R
40|$|Are {{economic}} sanctions costly for the sanctioning state? Some {{scholars argue that}} <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> costly tools used to achieve foreign policy goals, while others argue that <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> relatively costless tools leaders use to generate domestic political support. These arguments cannot be true at the same time. This dissertation examines this contradiction and evaluates the costs of sanctions at the national, firm, and individual levels of analysis. Economic sanctions have domestic economic and political consequences. Economic sanctions interrupt otherwise profitable commercial activities. These interventions create winners and losers. Like other forms of economic intervention, winners will {{support the use of}} sanctions and losers will oppose them. But the consequences of <b>sanctions</b> can <b>be</b> difficult to predict. <b>Sanctions</b> <b>are</b> heterogenous and have heterogenous effects. Sanctions don't lead to major changes in sender trade volumes or unemployment levels because the costs of <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> not evenly distributed throughout senders' economies. Economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> only costly for firms that have commercial interests in targeted states. On average, <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> economically costly and politically unpopular, but there are exceptions. How the public responds to sanctions depends on the features of the individual episodes. I use a variety of time series techniques and a laboratory experiment to test these arguments. The results from this dissertation suggest a need to rethink the way sanctions scholars conceptualize the economic and political costs of sanctions for the sanctioning state...|$|R
5|$|In English law, causing {{criminal}} damage was originally a common law offence. The offence was largely {{concerned with the}} protection of dwellings and the food supply, and few <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> imposed for damaging personal property. Liability was originally restricted to the payment of damages by way of compensation.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{completed}} the second Grand Slam {{of his career}} by winning the race, taking pole position, setting the fastest lap and leading every lap of the race. He finished 25 seconds ahead of Vettel, while Felipe Massa finished third for Williams. Rosberg retired with three laps to go due to an engine failure, resulting in Hamilton extending his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 53 points. Hamilton's victory was confirmed {{a few hours after}} the race following an investigation from race stewards after it was discovered that the left-rear tyre on his Mercedes was below Pirelli's recommended minimum tyre pressure standards in a random check but due to procedural inconsistencies, no <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> imposed against either Mercedes driver or the team.|$|E
50|$|Economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> {{used as a}} tool {{of foreign}} policy by many governments. Economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> usually imposed by a larger country upon a smaller country for one of two reasons—either the latter is a threat to the {{security}} of the former nation or that country treats its citizens unfairly. They {{can be used as a}} coercive measure for achieving particular policy goals related to trade or for humanitarian violations. Economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>are</b> used as an alternative weapon instead of going to war to achieve desired outcomes.|$|R

5|$|The Miami Hurricanes {{kept pace}} with the Hokies {{throughout}} the regular season, winning every conference game after their loss to Tech. After Miami won its {{final game of the}} season and tied the Hokies for the Big East football championship (the Big East had no tiebreaker at the time), it appeared that Virginia Tech would be passed over for a Bowl Alliance game in favor of the Hurricanes. Miami traditionally had a stronger football team and a wider following on television, making it more attractive to bowl-game officials. But Miami's bowl hopes evaporated after the NCAA announced Miami would be put under sanctions for recruiting rules violations. One of the sanctions included a ban from bowl games, which Miami elected to take after the 1995 season instead of delaying until 1996. After the <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> announced, the only question for the Hokies was whether they would be bound for the Orange Bowl in Miami or the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. That question was resolved on December 3, 1995, when Bowl Alliance officials announced their selection of Virginia Tech and Texas for the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most <b>sanctions</b> <b>were</b> lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
5|$|The overall British {{operation}} was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic <b>sanctions,</b> <b>were</b> exerted on Liberia—which had supported the RUF {{in exchange for}} conflict diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged the latter to enter the Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an international force, the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued {{to be involved in}} Sierra Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring of Sierra Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests were made by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The success of British operations in Sierra Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several European Union Battlegroups for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.|$|E

40|$|We model an oppressor {{aiming at}} victimizing an {{excluded}} group in his country, with two main variants.
