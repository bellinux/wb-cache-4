Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the discretionary component of Japan's public deficits, which {{is included in}} the structural component in existing work. The identification is done by collecting data and information of <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages.</b> Discretionary expenditure, discretionary revenue, and cyclical revenue are the main factors of increases in public deficits in the 1990 s. The revenue side has had greater impacts on deficits than expenditure. The effects of <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> are examined, using the discretionary deficits. Stimulus policies have multiplier effects, while overall public deficits have not. Results of analyses indicate that: (1) <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> have economic effects, (2) they also bring fiscal deficits, thus can be additional constraints on the government budget, (3) public deficits can be eased with GDP growth if tax is returned to the previous level, (4) the public finance has a structural deficit. ...|$|R
40|$|Economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> in EU {{countries}} and the Italian case - The article discusses the role of fiscal policies acting {{on the supply side}} within the recent economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> of the EU countries, detailed according to OECD methodology and data. The supply side feature is analyzed according to the goals of the "new European industrial policy". Economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> differ rather largely among countries in terms of size. Worthwhile features are: a) the supply side involvement often accounts for {{less than half of the}} whole package, the majority being focalized on the defence of income and purchasing power of the weaker population; b) a preference towards specific sectors occurs only for the automotive (of course in the car producing countries) and construction industries; c) a long term perspective (related to innovation, energy and environment) seems to be present only in few countries; d) concern about dangers from a new protectionism pushed by the State subsidies seems overstated. The Italian package is rather small: its size is justified by the high Italian debt/GDP ratio, but it cannot be explained according to perspectives on expected performance.

5|$|Although a new {{station at}} 10th Avenue and 41st Street {{was part of}} the {{original}} plan, the intermediate station was eliminated in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the terminal station at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street as the only new station on the extension. The MTA indicated that the 10th Avenue station could be included in the project if funding were found. The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) contract award, but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports indicated that the postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>package.</b> In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

The results suggest that on average, political constraints reduced the size of a country's fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> by between 1. 2 and 2. 8 percentage points of GDP (depending on the stimulus measure used). This substantial effect is significant and robust to a number of alternative dependent variables and specifications.

40|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{the world}} economy was {{recovering}} from its deepest recession {{since the end of}} World War II. Most countries around the world took resort to fiscal policy in order to foster this recovery. In this paper, we first discuss {{the pros and cons of}} discretionary fiscal policy from a history of economic thought perspective. Next, we summarise the fiscal policy measures taken in Switzerland. Then we use simulations with the KOF macroeconomic model to assess the effects on the Swiss economy of a) the Swiss measures on the one hand and b) the fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> taken by Switzerland’s most important trading partners on the other. The KOF September 2009 forecast, which incorporates the fiscal stimuli that were launched or in the pipeline at that time, serves as the baseline scenario. To assess the impacts of the fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> in Switzerland and abroad, we re-run the KOF macroeconometric model counterfactually, modifying the variables pertaining to the domestic and the international economy respectively to represent a situation in which no fiscal action had been taken.
