3000|$|The first {{application}} of cathodic protection {{dates back to}} 1824, long before its theoretical foundation was established, and is credited to Sir Humphrey Davy [69]. Cathodic protection is a method to reduce corrosion by minimizing the difference in potential between anode and cathode. This is achieved by applying a current to the structure to be protected (such as a pipeline) from some outside source. When enough current is applied, the whole structure will be at one potential; thus, anode and cathode sites will not exist [70]. It is normally {{used in conjunction with}} coatings and can be considered as a <b>secondary</b> <b>corrosion</b> control technique.

40|$|The use of {{cable-stayed}} bridges in medium- and long-span {{applications in}} the United States has increased significantly {{in the past ten}} years. Of paramount importance with this type of bridge is the protection of the stay cables from corrosive elements. An extensive survey, reported herein, showed a general concern over the adequacy of the corrosion protection of the most widely used current system. In this study, the popular two-barrier system (prestressing strand inside polyethylene sheath injected with portland cement grout) was examined experimentally. The effectiveness of the grout in providing <b>secondary</b> <b>corrosion</b> protection {{in the event of a}} cut or break in the external sheathing was a major focus of the experimental work.

40|$|Steam {{generator}} (SG) fouling, in {{the form}} of corrosion deposits on the secondary sides of SG tubes, has been known to occur in almost all commercial US nuclear PWR (pressurized water reactor) plants. The level of fouling, as measured by the quantity of corrosion products that form, varies widely from plant to plant. In addition, the effect of SG fouling, as measured by a decrease in effective heat-transfer coefficient, has also varied substantially among commercial US plants. While some have observed large decreases in heat transfer, others have noted little change in performance despite the presence of significant quantities of <b>secondary</b> <b>corrosion</b> layers on their SG tubes. This observation has led to considerable confusion about what role secondary deposits play in causing heat-transfer degradation in SGs. As will become clear later in this report, secondary deposits can have a wide range of effects on heat transfer, from highly resistive to slightly enhancing (reflected by negative fouling). These different behaviors are the result of differences in deposit thickness, composition, and morphology. The main focus of this report is an investigation of the effects of secondary deposits on SG thermal performance.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} results of a scientific study of archaeological copper and silver coins from three collections belonging to Roman, Medieval and Modern periods discovered in the UK. The morphology of the corrosion products was studied using Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to understand the formation of corrosion. Morphologically {{it was found that the}} surface corrosion of both metals was similar, a uniform layer of corrosion was identified with a general attack of the surface. Both copper and silver coins demonstrated a distinct layering with a metal core followed by an initial oxide layer and an external layer bearing soil markers and <b>secondary</b> <b>corrosion</b> products where present. X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and SEM-EDS were employed to characterise the corrosion products and determine the basic elemental composition of the corrosion layers. The study successfully identified the primary corrosion products present on the copper coins as copper, cuprite and quartz with the inclusion of other compounds such as kaolinite, cassiterite and malachite across some samples. Silver and Chlorargyrite were identified as the main components of all silver surfaces in the study with hexagonal silver oxide present in certain samples. The elemental composition, pH and texture of soil samples from the areas of excavation in Brough, Nottinghamshire, England were studied alongside the excavated coins and the direct influence the burial environment had on the corrosion process discussed. A novel technique in the field of corrosion studies on artefacts, Medium Energy Ion Scattering, was developed with the intention of attaining information about the structure and composition of the samples surface; preliminary results could only provide compositional information already attainable using existing techniques.

40|$|A corrosion-inhibiting {{mixture of}} {{compounds}} {{has been developed}} for addition to the water used to rinse metal parts that have been cleaned with aqueous solutions in preparation for adhesive bonding of the metals to rubber and rubber-like materials. Prior {{to the development of}} this corrosion inhibitor, the parts (made, variously, of D 6 AC steel and 7075 -T 73 aluminum) were rinsed by deionized water, which caused corrosion in some places on the steel parts especially in such occluded places as sealing surfaces and threaded blind holes. An integral part of the particular cleaning process is the deposition of a thin layer of silicates and silane primers that increase the strength of the adhesive bond. The corrosion inhibitor is formulated, not only to inhibit corrosion of both D 6 AC steel and 7075 - T 73 aluminum, but also to either increase or at least not reduce the strength of the adhesive bond to be formed subsequently. The corrosion inhibitor is a mixture of sodium silicate and sodium tetraborate. The sodium silicate functions as both a corrosion inhibitor and a bond-strength promoter in association with the silane primers. The sodium tetraborate buffers the rinse solution at the optimum pH and functions as a <b>secondary</b> <b>corrosion</b> inhibitor for the steel. For a given application, the concentrations of sodium silicate and sodium tetraborate must be chosen in a compromise among the needs to inhibit corrosion of steel, inhibit corrosion of aluminum, and minimize cosmetic staining of both steel and aluminum. Concentrations of sodium silicate in excess of 150 parts of silicon per million parts of solution (ppm Si) have been determined to enhance inhibition of corrosion; unfortunately, because of the alkalinity of sodium silicate, even a small concentration can raise the pH of the rinse solution to such a level that aluminum becomes corroded despite the inhibiting effect. The pH of a solution that contains a high concentration of sodium silicate can be decreased by adding sodium tetraborate. On the other hand, the addition of sodium tetraborate increases the concentration of dissolved solids to such a high level that cosmetic staining becomes an issue...|$|E

30|$|This section has {{recalled}} that Fe 0 is quantitatively oxidized by water (Eq.  1) {{and that the}} increased efficiency of Fe 0 /H 2 O systems upon addition of external FeII is a proof that primary (FeII, H 2) and <b>secondary</b> (hydroxides/oxides) <b>corrosion</b> products are responsible for decontamination: chemical transformation and removal from the aqueous phase. In other words, Fe 0 is the generator of contaminant collectors (Yao et al. 1971). This knowledge was established prior {{to the introduction of}} the Fe 0 remediation technology (Tseng et al. 1984; James et al. 1992). For example, Tseng et al.

In another phrase, {{the fact that so many}} publications are still discussing the mechanism of contaminant removal in Fe 0 /H 2 O systems is highly confusing. Remember that for the range of concentrations of natural waters, chemical reduction is rarely a stand-alone removal mechanism as (1) the initial concentrations are sometimes lower than the solubility limit of the oxidized species or (2) the maximum contamination level (MCL) is higher than the solubility limit of the reduced species (Ndé-Tchoupé et al. 2015). The former case means that the realized decontamination is due to meta-stability while the later demonstrates that additional efforts are needed to reach concentrations lower than the MCL. For properly designed Fe 0 /H 2 O systems, contaminants are removed by adsorption, co-precipitation and size-exclusion.|$|R

The cohort included eight women and three men who together had {{an average age of}} 60. 1 years (range, forty-three to seventy-seven years); all hips were implanted with a titanium-alloy stem and cobalt-chromium-alloy neck. Patients presented with new-onset and increasing pain at a mean of 7. 9 months (range, five to thirteen months) following total hip arthroplasty.

40|$|The crevice {{formed by}} the tube/tube support plate (T/TSP) {{intersection}} in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) steam generator is a concentration site for nonvolatile impurities (referred to as hideout) in the steam generator water. The restricted mass transport in the small crevice volume prevents the species, which concentrate by a thermal/hydraulic mechanism during the generation of steam, from quickly dispersing into the bulk water. The presence of a porous scale corrosion product {{on the surface of}} the tube and deposits of corrosion products in the crevice further restrict mass transport. The concentrated solutions and deposits in T/TSP crevices have been correlated with several forms of corrosion on the OD of steam generator tubes including intergranular attack/stress corrosion cracking (IGA/SCC), pitting, and wastage. The rate and type of corrosion are dependent on pH, specific anions, and the electrochemical potential. Careful water chemistry control and other remedial measures have essentially stopped all forms of <b>secondary</b> side <b>corrosion</b> except IGA/SCC. Crevice chemistries in an operating steam generator cannot be measured directly because of their inaccessibility. In practice, computer codes (MULTEQ, Molar Ratio Index, etc.) based upon hypothesized chemical reactions and thermal hydraulic mechanisms are used to predict crevice chemistry. The Rockwell program provides an experimental base to benchmark crevice chemistry models and to benchmark crevice chemistry control measures designed to mitigate IGA/SCC. The objective of this program is to develop an understanding of the corrosion accelerating mechanisms, particularly IGA/SCC, in steam generator crevices. The important variables will be identified, including the relationship between bulk water chemistry and corrosion accelerating chemistries in a crevice. An important result will be the identification of water chemistry control measures needed to mitigate secondary side IGA/SCC in steam generator tubes.

40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} the corroded surfaces of reference glasses {{developed for the}} Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) to characterize their corrosion behavior. The corrosion mechanism of nuclear waste glasses must be known {{in order to provide}} source terms describing radionuclide release for performance assessment calculations. Different DWPF reference glasses were corroded under conditions that highlighted various aspects of the corrosion process and led to different extents of corrosion. The glasses corroded by similar mechanisms, and a phenomenological description of their corrosion behavior is presented here. The initial leaching of soluble glass components results in the formation of an amorphous gel layer on the glass surface. The gel layer is a transient phase that transforms into a layer of clay crystallites, which equilibrates with the solution as corrosion continues.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Modular femoral heads provide {{procedural}} enhancement {{by allowing}} accurate restoration of hip offset and limb-length equalization. However, corrosion {{may lead to}} adverse local tissue reactions. Severe trunnion corrosion {{can also lead to}} femoral head dissociation and catastrophic implant failure following primary total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: We describe 5 cases, from our institution, in which the femoral head became dissociated from the femoral stem trunnion <b>secondary</b> to severe <b>corrosion.</b> Possible causes are evaluated. RESULTS: Demographic commonalities among the 5 patients included a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m(2) and male sex. All femoral heads were made of cobalt-chromium alloy and were larger-diameter implants (≥ 36 mm). Four of the 5 patients had a femoral head that increased the neck length above the default on a so-called standard head and 3 of the 5 had a stem with a 127 ° neck-shaft angle. CONCLUSIONS: Although dissociation of the femoral head from the femoral trunnion following total hip arthroplasty is exceedingly rare, the prevalence may increase with longer follow-up. The dissociation is likely related to multiple factors, including a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m(2), male sex, and corrosion resulting from the use of a larger metal head with a neck length of greater than the default and a stem with high offset. It is critical that surgeons be able to recognize this mode of implant failure and appropriately prepare to remove the femoral component during revision surgery.

To clarify the behaviour under these conditions corrosion experiments with non-irradiated fuel elements and with aluminium as cladding material were performed.

To investigate the hydrotalcite properties with respect to final disposal conditions, ion-exchanged experiments with iodide, caesium and americium were performed as well as stability experiments. CO 3 -hydrotalcite and Cl-hydrotalcite are able to exchange these ions. CO 3 -hydrotalcite is stable in a wide pH field, but in the MgCl 2 -brine a Cl-hydrotalcite is formed immediately. These properties make hydrotalcites attractive as possible backfill material...|$|R
40|$|The Podhale {{system was}} the first in Poland where {{geothermal}} space heating and other uses were initiated in the 1990 ’s. In 2001 the main facilities of a regional heating system were started. It {{will be one of the}} largest in Europe in its capacity and heat production. Water discharged from Mesozoic and Eocene carbonates, has a temperature of 76 - 86 °C at the outflows, and forms a good basis for multipurpose uses. To assure proper current production and project development, the investments have been accompanied by research and monitoring of the system. Recently, a study was done using selected methods (X-ray analysis, fluid inclusions, geothermal geochemistry) including those used to analyse thermal evolution of sedimentary basins (e. g. Oxyreactive Thermal Analysis, for the first time applied for Podhale). They combined cognitive and practical aspects to define factors controlling processes crucial for geothermal evolution, exploitation and use. The paper presents some results of the mentioned research and monitoring of the Podhale system in reference to sustainable longterm production for space heating and other uses. It focuses on such issues as water-rock equilibrium, <b>secondary</b> mineralization, scaling, <b>corrosion,</b> and results of almost 10 -years of hydrodynamical and chemical monitoring. Considering curative features of geothermal water, the prospects of extending uses applications by balneotherapy and recreation are presented. These services should be widely developed in Podhale – the main tourist area in Poland. The subject is supplemented by a brief paleohistory of those components of the system, which are essential for its understanding, optimum exploitation, and use...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{of organic}} or inorganic salts {{are used as}} secondary refrigerants in indirect refrigeration systems to transport and transfer heat. Water {{is known for its}} corrosive character and secondary refrigerants based on aqueous solutions have the same tendency. The least corrosive from the aqueous solutions are glycols and alcohols. Salt solutions, such as chlorides and potassium salts, are much more corrosive. Nevertheless, it is possible to minimize corrosion risks at the beginning stage while designing system. Proper design can significantly help in improving system performance against corrosion. There are several aspects which need {{to be taken into account}} while working with secondary refrigerants: design of system, selection of <b>secondary</b> refrigerant, proper <b>corrosion</b> inhibitors, compatible materials used to build the installation and proper preparation of system to operation. While choosing proper materials it is advised to avoid the formation of a galvanic couple to reduce the risk of the most dangerous type of corrosion. Oxygen present in installation is another important factor increasing the rate of corrosion. Even small amounts of oxygen can significantly affect the system lifetime. The methods of cleaning, charging the system with refrigerant, and deaeration procedures are extremely important. The purpose of this thesis work is to present the problems of corrosion occurring in the indirect systems with secondary refrigerants. The thesis describes the mechanism of corrosion and its different types, most commonly used materials in installation, different corrosion inhibitors used to protect system. This thesis also lists the available secondary refrigerants on the market and briefly describes them. Further, it describes the important aspects related with designing, preparing and maintaining of indirect systems. This thesis is giving some clues and shows what should be done in order to reduce risks of corrosion. Effsys 2 P 2 projec...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{radioactive}} wastes from the Savannah River Site {{are stored in}} large underground carbon steel tanks. The majority of the waste is confined in double shell tanks, which have a primary shell, where the waste is stored, and a secondary shell, which creates an annular region between the two shells, that provides secondary containment and leak detection capabilities should leakage from the primary shell occur. Each of the DST {{is equipped with a}} purge ventilation system for the interior of the primary shell and annulus ventilation system for the secondary containment. Administrative flammability controls require continuous ventilation to remove hydrogen gas and other vapors from the waste tanks while preventing the release of radionuclides to the atmosphere. Should a leak from the primary to the annulus occur, the annulus ventilation would also serve this purpose. The functionality of the annulus ventilation is necessary to preserve the structural integrity of the primary shell and the <b>secondary.</b> An administrative <b>corrosion</b> control program is in place to ensure integrity of the tank. Given the critical functions of the purge and annulus ventilation systems, engineering controls are also necessary to ensure that the systems remain robust. The system consists of components that are constructed of metal (e. g., steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, etc.) and/or polymeric (polypropylene, polyethylene, silicone, polyurethane, etc.) materials. The performance of these materials in anticipated service environments (e. g., normal waste storage, waste removal, etc.) was evaluated. The most aggressive vapor space environment occurs during chemical cleaning of the residual heels by utilizing oxalic acid. The presence of NO{sub x} and mercury in the vapors generated from the process could potentially accelerate the degradation of aluminum, carbon steel, and copper. Once identified, the most susceptible materials were either replaced and/or plans for discontinuing operations are executed...|$|R
