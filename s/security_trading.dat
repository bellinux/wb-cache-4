40|$|A global {{trend towards}} {{automated}} trading systems encourages the appearances {{of different kinds}} of decision support systems (DSS) for <b>securities</b> <b>trading.</b> However, the efficiency and effectiveness of the trading decisions and investment strategies suggested by a computer based system are always being oppugned by researchers for abnegating the specialists’ professional intermediary roles in traditional floor trading. Without proper validations, evaluations and comparisons, those valuable decision support systems can hardly be adopted trustily.

50|$|The Bremen Exchange early {{adopted the}} use of {{computers}} in <b>security</b> <b>trading.</b> From 1990 trades were extensively supported by the program BIFOS. In the following years, further programmes were adopted, including BOSS-CUBE, BÖGA (now XONTRO) and IBIS (succeeded by Xetra). Further measures were taken, especially to make trading attractive to private lenders, such as the reduction of the lower limit on continuous trading and the significant expansion of trading hours. In addition, the Bremer Exchange was active through subsidiaries in emissions trading, securities tranding and settlement for third parties, especially small credit institutes and brokerage firms. This collection of measures led to a significant revival of trading activity from 1990.|$|E
50|$|State Bank of India (SBl), with a 200-year history, is {{the largest}} {{commercial}} bank in India in terms of assets, deposits, profits, branches, customers and employees. The Government of India is the single largest shareholder of this Fortune 500 entity with 61.58% ownership. SBl is ranked 60th {{in the list of}} Top 1000 Banks in the world by “The Banker” in July 2012. The origins of State Bank of India date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India. In 1955, the Reserve Bank of India acquired the controlling interests of the Imperial Bank of India and SBI was created by an act of Parliament to succeed the Imperial Bank of India. The SBI group, consists of SBl and five associate banks. The group has an extensive network, with over 20000 plus branches in India and another 187 offices in 34 countries across the world. As of 31 March 2012, the group had assets worth USD 359 billion, deposits of USD 278 billion and capital & reserves in excess of USD 20.88 billion. The group commands over 22% share of the domestic Indian banking market. SBl's non- banking subsidiaries / Joint ventures are market leaders in their respective areas and provide wide-ranging services, which include life insurance, merchant banking, mutual funds, credit cards, factoring services, <b>security</b> <b>trading</b> and primary dealership, making the SBl Group a truly large financial supermarket and India's financial icon. SBI has arrangements with over 1500 various international / local banks to exchange financial messages through SWIFT in all business centers of the world to facilitate trade related banking business, reinforced by dedicated and highly skilled teams of professionals.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{sequential}} model of <b>security</b> <b>trading</b> which, compared to existing models, is extended along the notions of (Simon, H. A., A behavioral model of rational choice. Quart. J. Econ., 1955, 64, 99 - 118; Rubinstein, A., Modeling Bounded Rationality, Zeuthen Lecture Book Series, 1998 (MIT Press: Cambridge, MA), and Odean, T., Do investors trade too much? Am. Econ. Rev., 1999, 89 (5), 1279 - 1298) by adding boundedly rational traders. Our results indicate that both momentum and mean-reversion in asset prices {{can be attributed to the}} presence of agents who are subject to systematic errors in the process of forecasting the liquidation value of a risky security. The length of the momentum period is inversely related to both the amount of information-based trading in the market and the rate at which asset specific information is learned by boundedly rational agents. Furthermore, the model allows explicitly to establish a link between the component of the bid-ask spread that can be explained by bounded rationality and both momentum and reversal.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model in which {{liquidity}} is time-varying and conditionally heteroskedastic. It is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that liquidity variation {{plays an important role}} in the dynamic cross-sectional relation among observable quantities in stock markets. The Kyle-Admati-Pfleiderer framework is extended to a setting with conditionally heteroskedastic information and multiple <b>security</b> <b>trading.</b> When information acquisition is endogenized, liquidity, trading volume, and conditional price-change variance become all stochastic. Their dynamic relation is examined by a simulated vector autoregression (VAR). It finds that liquidity shocks are persistent; a positive volume shock has a negative effect on liquidity in subsequent periods; and liquidity shocks transmit across securities. Using high frequency data, empirical results are provided that are generally consistent with the model’s predictions. JEL Classification: G...|$|E

While the trade-to- trade model of Maynes and Rumsey (1993) addresses {{the problem of}} thin trading by eliminating periods in which no trading is recorded, the proposed improvement addresses the influence of zero-value returns resulting from liquidity trading. This entails segmentation by the sign of company returns (positive, negative, zero). The approach allows for all levels of thinness in <b>security</b> <b>trading.</b> It is evaluated against the trade-to-trade methodology developed by Maynes and Rumsey (1993) and the Market Model using Monte Carlo simulations developed from the method of Brown and Warner (1980 and 1985).
