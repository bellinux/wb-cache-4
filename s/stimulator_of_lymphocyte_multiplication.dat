When the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. The Actinomyces species proved to be potent <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas Streptococcus sanguis, Campylobacter, and Eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. The response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. However, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis.

Granulocytes contained and released lesser amounts of glycosyltransferases, whereas platelets released more fucosyltransferase than sialyltransferase or galactosyltransferase. When mononuclear cells were incubated with 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), {{the release of}} these three glycosyltransferases increased two- to six-fold, and cell suspension glycosyltransferase activities decreased 10 - 50 %. Mononuclear cells were fractionated into lymphocytes and monocytes using baby hamster kidney cells microexudate-coated flasks.

40|$|Summary. Dendritic {{cells and}} their {{precursors}} express PPAR-gamma, whose stimulation has inhibitory {{effects on the}} maturation and function of dendritic cells in vivo. Dendritic cells can differentiate in vitro from CD 133 + progenitors; the influence of PPAR-gamma stimulation on this process is unknown. We have addressed the effect of PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, at a concentration as used in clinics, on the differentiation of dendritic cells from human CD 133 + progenitors. Cells were harvested from cord blood by density gradient and immunomagnetic separation, and cultured for 18 days with fetal calf serum, cytokines and 1 µmol/L rosiglitazone. Analyses included flow cytometry, electron microscopy and mixed lymphocyte reaction. As expected, control cells generated without rosiglitazone were dendritic, expressed MHC-II, CD 80, CD 83 and CD 86 and stimulated mixed reaction potently. A minority of cells expressed the Langerhans cell marker CD 207 /langerin, but none contained Birbeck granules. With rosiglitazone much fewer cells were generated; they were all dendritic, expressed differentiation and maturation-related antigens in higher percentage and were better <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> than those generated without the drug. The vast majority of cells expressed CD 207 /langerin and many contained Birbeck granules, i. e. were full-fledged Langerhans cells. We conclude that stimulation of PPAR-gamma, while negatively affecting the number of generated cells, promotes the maturation of human cord blood CD 133 positive precursors into efficient, immunostimulating dendritic cells with a Langerhans cell phenotyp...|$|R

To improve the reconstitution <b>of</b> human T <b>lymphocytes</b> in NOD-SCID mice, the use of recombinant human interleukin- 15 (rhIL- 15) as a <b>stimulator</b> <b>of</b> human <b>lymphocytes</b> was explored.

Additionally, although mature human cells have not been thought to enter the murine thymus, human T lymphocytes were detected in the huPBL-NOD-SCID thymus after rhIL- 15 treatment.

Polysaccharides from fresh and dried litchi pulp (denoted as LPF and LPD, respectively) were isolated, investigated by GC-MS, GPC and UV/IR spectrum analysis and their antitumor and immunomodulatory activities were evaluated in vitro. LPD, the molecular weight of which was {{lower than that of}} LPF, contained more protein, uronic acid, arabinose, galactose and xylose.

40|$|The most {{distinguishing}} and earliest common immunological abnormality {{shared by}} all three murine models of accelerated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 1 MRL/I, BXSB males, and NZB × NZW females is B cell hyperactivity (1, 2). These hyperactive B lymphocytes express (a) early spontaneous polyclonal activation, (b) increased frequency of colony formation and Ig secretion, and (c) excess autoantibody production. These features are present early in the mice with accelerated SLE but not in their late life SLE-prone counterparts (female MRL/n, BXSB, NZW) or in immunologically normal routine strains (BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6). The underlying mechanisms responsible for this early, generalized B cell activation and autoantibody production are not known but presumably could involve intrinsic B cell abnormalities, regulatory cell defects, or excessive actions {{of one or more}} endogenous or exogenous B cell stimulators.

40|$|Nonlymphoid {{accessory}} cells play {{an important}} role in antigen presentation (1, 2). This accessory cell function has been attributed to macrophages, but more recent data suggest that a specialized dendritic cell, probably in the macrophage lineage but quite distinct from conventional macrophages, is probably the cell that is primarily involved in antigen presentation (3). The best-characterized cell of this type is the dendritic cell, described by Steinman et al. (4), in the spleen and lymph nodes of the mouse. Another cell type of similar dendritic morphology, but with some distinctive features, is the Langerhans's cell (5), which has been definitely implicated in antigen presentation (6). The precise relationship of the Steinman dendritic cell and the Langerhans's cell to one another and to other la-positive cells of similar morphology in thymus (7) and spleen and lymph nodes (8) is unknown. However, that these dendritic cells are likely to play a vital role in the physiology of the immune system is demonstrated not only by the capacity of at least some dendritic cells to function as accessory cells, but also by the recent demonstration that the Steinman cell is an extraordinarily potent <b>stimulator</b> <b>of</b> T <b>lymphocyte</b> division, both in allogeneic (9) an...|$|R
40|$|Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 1 from Gram-negative {{bacteria}} or the lipid A component {{isolated from}} LPS are potent <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> murine B <b>lymphocytes</b> in vivo and in vitro. In {{the absence of}} antigens, LPS initates proliferation and differentiation <b>of</b> B <b>lymphocytes,</b> leading to the synthesis and secretion of nonspecific IgM polyclonal antibodies (1 - 3). As a result, mice also develop several types of autoantibodies such as anti-DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factors (RF) and thymocytotoxic antibodies after the injection of LPS (4 - 8). Although substantial numbers of IgM antibodies are induced, generally their synthesis is transient and short-lived (7, 9).

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC), which express {{high-density}} HLA class II molecules, stimulate strong primary allogeneic T-cell responses via {{an interaction}} of the T-cell receptor with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (signal 1). It {{is not yet clear}} whether they also provide a second stimulus to the responding T cell {{in the form of the}} cytokine interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). To clarify this point, the ability of purified human tonsil DC to produce IL- 1 and to stimulate allogeneic T cells was tested. No intracellular IL- 1 alpha or beta was identified in DC comparable to that readily demonstrated in monocytes, and IL- 1 release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated DC was not detected in either a biological assay for IL- 1 or an ELISA assay for IL- 1 beta. Furthermore, strong stimulation <b>of</b> allogeneic T <b>lymphocytes</b> by DC in the mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR) was noted to occur in the absence of IL- 1 production, and this stimulation was not inhibited by polyclonal antisera to IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta, which were known to inhibit IL- 1 -mediated thymocyte proliferation. Other HLA-class II-positive cell populations, namely peripheral blood monocytes and B cells, purified by methods which avoided DC contamination, were unable to stimulate allogeneic T cells with or without supplementary IL- 1. We conclude that DC are very effective <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> T <b>lymphocytes</b> and that IL- 1 is not required as a second signal for allogeneic T-cell responses...|$|R

40|$|CD 8 + T cells {{recognize}} peptide {{fragments of}} endogenously synthesized antigens of cancers or viruses, presented by MHC I molecules. Such antigen presentation requires {{the generation of}} peptides in the cytosol, their passage to the endoplasmic reticulum, loading of MHC I with peptides, and transport of MHC I–peptide complexes to the cell surface. Heat-shock protein (hsp) 90 is a cytosolic chaperone known to associate with peptide and peptide precursors of MHC I epitopes. We report here that treatment of cells with hsp 90 inhibitors leads to generation of “empty” MHC I caused by inhibited loading of MHC I with peptides. Inhibition of hsp 90 does not inhibit synthesis of MHC I, nor does it affect the activity of proteasomes. Hsp 90 -inhibited cells, such as proteasome-inhibited cells, are poor <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> T <b>lymphocytes.</b> The role <b>of</b> hsp 90 in presentation of an ovalbumin epitope is shown {{to be at a}} postproteasomal step: hsp 90 associates with N-terminally extended precursors of the SIINFEHL epitope, and such peptides are depleted from hsp 90 preparations in hsp 90 -inhibited cells. Inhibition of hsp 90 in the antigen donor cell compromises their ability to cross-prime. Conversely, stressed cells expressing elevated hsp 90 levels show a heat-shock factor-dependent, enhanced ability to cross-prime. These results demonstrate a substantial role for hsp 90 in chaperoning of antigenic peptides in direct and indirect presentation. The introduction of a stress-inducible component in these pathways has significant implications for their modulation during fever and infection...|$|R

The aim of these experiments {{was to investigate the}} effects of HLA-G on T-lymphocyte responses by using MHC class II-bearing HLA-G transfectants as <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> a mixed <b>lymphocyte</b> reaction.

The suppressive effect of HLA-G on the mixed lymphocyte reaction persisted after depletion of phagocytes and CD 8 (+) T-cells from the responder population, but the mixed lymphocyte reaction was entirely abolished by depletion of CD 4 (+) T-cells. These results suggest that HLA-G exerts a direct suppressive effect on CD 4 (+) T-lymphocytes, {{even in the absence of}} the CD 8 (+) cells with which other human MHC class I molecules are thought to interact.

Related to these outcomes of epitope discovery is the recent demonstration that MHC class I/peptide complexes can be expressed as single chain trimers (SCTs) with peptide, β 2 m and heavy chain connected by linkers to form a single polypeptide chain. Studies using clinically relevant mouse models of human disease have shown that SCTs expressed by DNA vaccination are potent <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> cytotoxic T <b>lymphocytes.</b> Their vaccine efficacy has been attributed to the fact that SCTs contain a preprocessed and preloaded peptide that is stably displayed on the cell surface.

Here we demonstrate that human SCTs remain almost exclusively intact when expressed in cells and can incorporate a disulfide trap that dramatically excludes the binding of exogenous peptides.

Further purification led to a 1000 -fold overall increase in accessory activity per cell, with a 50 - 70 % yield. The purest preparations were virtually free of macrophages and contained more than 90 % typical dendritic cells. Maximum responses occurred at a ratio of only one dendritic cell per 200 periodate-treated lymphocytes. This evidence thus indicates strongly that in rats, dendritic cells [...] not macrophages [...] function as accessory cells. Further, the number of dendritic cells in a preparation governed the magnitude of the mitogenic response and was limiting in the case of unfractionated lymph node cells. In addition, when oxidized with periodate or with neuraminidase plus galactose oxidase, the dendritic cell served as a very potent indirect <b>stimulator</b> <b>of</b> untreated responder <b>lymphocytes.</b> Both functions <b>of</b> the dendritic cell appeared to lack species specificity, since mouse dendritic cells were very active when tested with rat responder lymphocytes.

40|$|Antigen {{presentation}} by MHC I molecules involves generation of peptides, loading of MHC I with peptides, and transport of MHC I-peptide complexes {{to the cell}} surface. The peptides are derived from the degradation of endogenous proteins in the cytosol. In this thesis, the chicken ovalbumin epitope SIINFEKL {{has been used as}} the model antigen and mechanism of its generation has been investigated. My results show that complete inhibition of proteasome activity results in only a modest inhibition in generation of new Kb-SIINFEHL complexes. Only a combined inhibition of proteasomes and other cytosolic proteases leads to a complete inhibition of generation of such complexes. Subsequent to their generation, peptides are chaperoned by heat shock proteins (HSPs). My studies provide direct evidence for the involvement of cytosolic hsp 90 in chaperoning of peptides that are destined for loading onto MHC I. My studies define the nature of the peptides chaperoned by hsp 90, and the precise step at which hsp 90 associates with peptides. The role of hsp 90 in presentation of an ovalbumin epitope is found to be at a post-proteasomal step: hsp 90 associates with N-terminally extended precursors of the SIINFEHL epitope, and such peptides are depleted from hsp 90 preparations in inhibitor-treated cells. My results indicate that treatment of cells with hsp 90 inhibitors leads to generation of 2 ̆ 2 empty 2 ̆ 2 MHC I due to inhibited loading of MHC I with peptides. Hsp 90 -inhibited cells are poor <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> T <b>lymphocytes.</b> Altogether, these results define the mechanisms of generation of SIINFEHL or its precursors from intact ovalbumin, and the chaperoning of such precursors by hsp 90. In addition, the role of hsp 90 in processing of a variety of antigens, such as epitope I of larger T antigen is shown. I have also examined the form of the antigen, which is transferred from an antigen donor cell to an antigen presenting cell during cross-priming. My results are consistent with the idea that peptides, rather than the intact protein constitute the transferred form of antigen. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether epidermal cells (EC) from psoriasis lesions and uninvolved skin could stimulate autologous T lymphocytes in the in vitro autologous mixed epidermal cell-T lymphocyte reaction (autologous MECLR). The functional role of antigen-presenting cell (APC) subsets was concurrently determined in this reaction. Mononuclear cells and purified T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of psoriasis patients showed a clear proliferative response to autologous unpurified epidermal cells from involved as well as uninvolved skin. The autologous mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was not elevated in psoriasis patients. In healthy controls and contact allergy patients, T-lymphocyte proliferation was not observed either in the autologous MECLR or in the autologous MLR. The level of proliferation in the autologous MECLR from psoriasis patients correlated to the number of epidermal cells that were added. To exclude the possibility that the observed proliferation in the autologous MECLR in psoriasis was due to the presence <b>of</b> epidermal T <b>lymphocytes</b> that were being stimulated and expanded in vitro, the stimulator EC were gamma irradiated (30 Gy) in some experiments. Preincubation of EC with cyclosporin A (CsA) significantly inhibited the autologous MECLR. The CsA-induced inhibition could be neutralized by the addition of fresh untreated EC to these cultures. This indicated that one of the modes of action of CsA in resolving psoriasis is, as some investigators have already shown, via inhibition of epidermal accessory cell function. In the autologous MECLR, APC from psoriasis skin could initiate this reaction, whereas APC from peripheral blood could not. This occurred in an MHC class H restricted fashion.

Thus a low level of activation by MHC class II+ stimulator cells appears to be required for the response. Analysis of the role of cytokines with costimulatory activity for T cells and/or NK cells indicated that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was important in the proliferative response, while interleukins- 1, - 6 and - 12 and stem cell factor {{did not seem to be}} involved. Cell interaction molecules lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) (CD 11 a), intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) (CD 54), ICAM- 3 (CD 50) and B 7. 2 (CD 86) were up-regulated on HL- 60 -R 7. Blocking mAb to LFA- 1 and B 7. 2 potently inhibited the proliferative response indicating a key role for these molecules in the enhanced immunostimulation by HL- 60 -R 7 cells. The results may have implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic effect of RA in acute promyelocytic leukaemia and may also provide valuable information in regard to the immunogenicity of tumour cells in general...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{non-ionic}} surfactant vesicles (NISV) to enhance antibody production against bovine serum albumin (BSA) was compared with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), in the BALB/c mouse. Two subcutaneous inoculations with NISV entrapped BSA induced antibody levels comparable to, and persisting {{as long as}} those produced by FCA by either the subcutaneous or intraperitoneal route of inoculation. Intraperitoneal inoculation of NISV did not generate as strong an antibody response. The adjuvant activity of NISV was wholly dependent on the BSA being entrapped within preformed vesicles; mixing free BSA with vesicles was not effective. Analysis of the anti-BSA IgG subclasses induced by NISV and FCA showed that NISV were generally better <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> IgG 2 a than was FCA, but poorer <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> IgG 1. From this, we deduce that NISV are potentially better <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> the Th 1 lymphocyte subset than is FCA and by inference, potent <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> cellular immunity. We believe that NISV may offer many advantages over other adjuvants in terms of immunological selectivity, low toxicity and stability...|$|R
40|$|Putative {{dendritic}} cells (DC) {{and their}} precursors {{have been obtained}} from human bone marrow but their origin and relationship to other myeloid cells remains obscure. A minor bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMC) population, which contains the most potent allostimulatory cells and lacks mature cell lineage markers (CD 3, CD 11 b, CD 14, CD 15, CD 16, CD 19, CD 57 and glycophorin A; lineage-negative) was enriched by immunoselection. These preparations, which contain cells with similar characteristics to freshly isolated human blood DC, were further subdivided by serial fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Potent allostimulatory cells were detected in the CD 34, CD 33 and CD 4 positive and negative subpopulations. Cells with putative DC morphology were present in both the CD 33 and CD 4 positive and negative fractions. No significant CD 13 or Thy- 1 staining {{was seen in the}} lineage-negative population. In vitro culture of lineage-negative BMMC for 7 days in conditioned medium resulted in a up to fivefold expansion of cells and generated many lineage-positive progeny. This lineage-positive population was as allostimulatory as the negative progeny. Likewise, the CD 14 -positive and the CD 14 -negative cell progeny were equally allostimulatory. In contrast, the freshly isolated lineage-positive BMMC (containing CD 14 -positive monocytes) remained poor <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> the mixed <b>lymphocyte</b> reaction (MLR), even after culture in the presence of cytokines. These data suggest that {{there are at least two}} phenotypically diverse forms of potent allostimulatory cells in the lineage-negative fraction of human BM, at least some of which express the early haemopoietic precursor antigens CD 34 or CD 33. Some of these precursors generate CD 14 -positive allostimulatory cells upon in vitro culture, suggesting an intimate link between DC ontogeny and myeloid differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Cell-free HIV- 1 virions {{are poor}} <b>stimulators</b> <b>of</b> type I {{interferon}} (IFN) production. We examined here how HIV-infected cells are recognized by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and by other cells. We show that infected lymphocytes are more potent inducers of IFN than virions. There are target cell-type {{differences in the}} recognition <b>of</b> infected <b>lymphocytes.</b> In primary pDCs and pDC-like cells, recognition occurs in large part through TLR 7, {{as demonstrated by the}} use of inhibitors and by TLR 7 silencing. Donor cells expressing replication-defective viruses, carrying mutated reverse transcriptase, integrase or nucleocapsid proteins induced IFN production by target cells as potently as wild-type virus. In contrast, Env-deleted or fusion defective HIV- 1 mutants were less efficient, suggesting that in addition to TLR 7, cytoplasmic cellular sensors may also mediate sensing of infected cells. Furthermore, in a model of TLR 7 -negative cells, we demonstrate that the IRF 3 pathway, through a process requiring access of incoming viral material to the cytoplasm, allows sensing <b>of</b> HIV-infected <b>lymphocytes.</b> Therefore, detection <b>of</b> HIV-infected <b>lymphocytes</b> occurs through both endosomal and cytoplasmic pathways. Characterization of the mechanisms of innate recognition of HIV-infected cells allows a better understanding of th...|$|R
