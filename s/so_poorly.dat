5|$|Hunslet Grange Flats (more {{commonly}} known as the Leek Street Flats) displayed brutalism. They replaced run down back to back houses. It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets, including longer streets such as Alton Street. The flats were popular at first; however, they were <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed. Smaller shops on the site had been demolished even earlier.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|Being {{from the}} First and Second Divisions respectively, both Arsenal and Sheffield United were seeded {{into the third}} round of the FA Cup. In the third round itself, Arsenal was drawn away against Third Division South team Bristol Rovers. Arsenal missed a penalty, and the third Division team went a goal up in the first half; Arsenal were playing <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> that it seemed they would {{struggle}} even for a draw. The turnaround in the match occurred when Cliff Bastin took over from Bobby Davidson at the inside left position. Arsenal equalized in the 65th minute, and scored further four times {{over the course of the}} following fourteen minutes to win the game by five goals to one, with a single goal from Bowden and two each from Drake and Bastin.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|During his {{production}} tenure on Children's Ward, Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for soap operas; his {{intention was to}} eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap Coronation Street. In pursuit of this career plan, he storylined soaps such as Families and wrote scripts for shows such as Cluedo, a game show based on the board game of the same name, and Do the Right Thing, a localised version of the Brazilian panel show Você Decide with Terry Wogan as presenter and Frank Skinner as a regular panellist. One writing job, for The House of Windsor, a soap opera about footmen in Buckingham Palace, was <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> received that his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|The Jets and Raiders were {{founding}} {{members of the}} American Football League; both teams began to play in 1960, the Jets under the name Titans of New York. The two teams had little success in their early years, playing <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> that both the Titans and Raiders were allowed to draft players from other AFL teams following the 1962 season. In 1967, the Jets, {{under the guidance of}} coach Weeb Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath, posted their first winning record at 7–5–2. Oakland, on the other hand, won the Western Division in 1967 with a 13–1 mark under coach John Rauch and then the AFL Championship Game over the Houston Oilers, 40–7, before falling to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II. Both teams were seen as likely contenders for the 1968 AFL Championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} short period of occupation at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) led to an unusual unity of architectural styles for a Mesoamerican city. Almost all archaeological finds at the city, including both artefacts and earlier versions of later structures, date to the last few hundred years before the Spanish conquest. The architecture was built with mica and pumice slabs, in some cases this was coated with stucco. Stone sculpture is almost totally absent from the city, the only example being a ballcourt marker {{in the form of a}} serpent's head with jaws agape and a human head emerging from its mouth. Originally some buildings were decorated with painted stucco but this is <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved that only a few fragments remain.|$|E
5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool.

5|$|Colugos are a {{small group}} of Southeast Asian gliding mammals closely related to the primates. Their fossil record is {{exceptionally}} poor. Although Paleogene groups such as the Plagiomenidae are considered by some to be closely related to colugos, no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo family, Cynocephalidae, had been reported until 1992. In that year, Stéphane Ducrocq and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the Eocene of Thailand as a new genus and species of colugo, Dermotherium major. In 2000, however, Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that Dermotherium might not be a colugo, since the fossil is <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved that few traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported dermopteran features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other placental groups. Mary Silcox and colleagues reaffirmed the colugo affinities of Dermotherium in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in molar morphology.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's melting point is known <b>so</b> <b>poorly,</b> having been variously been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values very close to the caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Rivera joined Panamá Oeste, a local amateur {{baseball}} team, {{as their}} shortstop. Scout Herb Raybourn watched him {{play in a}} baseball tournament but did not project {{him to be a}} major league shortstop. A year later, Panamá Oeste's pitcher performed <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion. Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent to a contract with the Yankees organization on February17, 1990; the contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($ today), according to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres <b>so</b> <b>poorly</b> that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E
