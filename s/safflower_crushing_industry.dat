40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the impacts {{of changes in the}} {{structure}} of the Brazilian soybean <b>crushing</b> <b>industry</b> on the performance of the soybeans complex. It was verified that the trend of concentration in the soybean <b>crushing</b> <b>industry,</b> which had already been verified by previous paper carried out in the decade of 1990, intensified in the beginning of the decade of 2000. The results regarding market power gave support to the hypothesis of monopsony power usage in the purchases of soybeans from the farmers. The results suggest that the crushing firms have had the ability to use market power against soybean farmers. However, the fact that the use of market power has been restricted in the markets where there is excess capacity suggests that the use of market power is less intense where crushing firms have less bargain power in relation to farmers. In this sense, strategies of cooperation in agricultural marketing, by means of either cooperatives or other forms of partnerships among farmers, could be an effective way of countervailing the increasing bargain power of the <b>crushing</b> <b>industry.</b> Industrial Organization, Market power, Market concentration, Soybean industry,...|$|R

The occupation may be categorized as such a factor which affects fertility directly or indirectly due to their unique work environment and occupational hazards. In this article an attempt {{has been made to}} explore the fertility levels and its correlates of women from stone <b>crushing</b> <b>industry</b> keeping in mind the probable occupational environment, socio-cultural attributes and hazards due to their occupational exposures. Data has been collected from women of stone <b>crushing</b> <b>industry</b> from Balason colony, Matigara block, Darjeeling district of West Bengal, after household survey, interview and observation. The analysis of fertility is carried out in period perspective and data on age is estimated by recall method with cross check. Fertility rates and ratios are estimated following standard formula. The overall fertility rates of the group are somewhat higher than state or nation. The sex ratio is also higher favouring females. The high fertility may be attributed to lower age at marriage, lower age at first delivery, low literacy rate as well as higher infant mortality beside their occupational hazards...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} {{the structure of}} cotton by-products industries in se-lected countries (Uganda, Tanzania, Benin, and Burkina Faso) {{in the context of}} the global vegetable oil market. It reaches several conclusions. First, because the markets for various edible oils are highly integrated with each other, examination of each oil market should be done in conjunction with all other (relevant) edible oil markets. Second, the recent surge in demand for commodities used as feedstocks for biofuels is unlikely to become a new source of growth for the cotton oil market. Third, within the context of deepening the on-going reform efforts in West and Central African countries, cotton by-products should be taken into consideration, both in terms of the cotton price setting mechanism and the size of the organization of the cotton by-products industry. Fourth, trade policies including export bans or import tariffs to protect the domestic <b>crushing</b> <b>industries,</b> and policies that favor crude over refined oils, should be rationalized. Fifth, large cottonseed processing operations using advanced technology, while efficient from a technological perspective, tend not to be economically profitable in the African context.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of stone <b>crushing</b> <b>industry</b> on different foliar parameters of Shorea robusta and Madhuca indica which are two dominant broad–leaved tree species of the forest concerned. Measurement of suspended particulate matter (SPM), dustfall and gaseous pollutants in ambient air were done. Heavy deposition of dust particles on leaf surfaces was noted. Various types of foliar anomalies, both microscopic and macroscopic, were detected externally. Decrease in amount of chlorophyll and total carbohydrate in foliar tissues indicated reduction of photosynthesis. Reduction of protein content in foliar tissues was also noted. Site–wise and season–wise variations of almost all data were found to be statistically significant. Comparison of air pollution status and foliar biochemical parameters with those recorded in a control forest was done along with study of spatial significance between polluted sites at Lalpahari with increasing distance from the source of pollution.

40|$|Sunflower {{appears as}} a {{potentially}} highly competitive crop, thanks to the diversification of its market and the richness of its oil. However, seed oil concentration (OC) – a commercial criterion for <b>crushing</b> <b>industry</b> – is subjected to genotypic and environmental effects that make it sometimes hardly predictable. It is assumed that more understanding of oil physiology combined {{with the use of}} crop models should permit to improve prediction and management of grain quality for various end-users. Main effects of temperature, water, nitrogen, plant density and fungal diseases were reviewed in this paper. Current generic and specific crop models which simulate oil concentration were found to be empirical and to lack of proper evaluation processes. Recently two modeling approaches integrating ecophysiological knowledge were developed by Andrianasolo (2014, Statistical and dynamic modelling of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) grain composition as a function of agronomic and environmental factors, Ph. D. Thesis, INP Toulouse) : (i) a statistical approach relating OC to a range of explanatory variables (potential OC, temperature, water and nitrogen stress indices, intercepted radiation, plant density) which resulted in prediction quality from 1. 9 to 2. 5 oil points depending {{on the nature of the}} models; (ii) a dynamic approach, based on “source-sink” relationships involving leaves, stems, receptacles (as sources) and hulls, proteins and oil (as sinks) and using priority rules for carbon and nitrogen allocation. The latter model reproduced dynamic patterns of all source and sink components faithfully, but tended to overestimate OC.

The model is a nonlinear econometric model including all major trading members [...] exporters: U. S., Brazil, and Argentina [...] importers: EC, Spain, Japan, and EE. A U. S. dollar revaluation increases soybean and soymeal prices in all countries except the U. S. The percentage price increases elsewhere are {{much higher than the}} percentage price decrease in the U. S. This indicates that the U. S. faces a world demand which is more inelastic than U. S. export supply. Export revenue in U. S. dollars decreases more when the U. S. devalues against all countries than when it devalues against only importing countries where Brazil and Argentina share the revenue loss. Devaluations of the Brazilian cruzerio and the Argentine peso mostly affect the devaluing country. Each of these exporting countries faces an export demand more elastic than their export supply. There would be increases in soybean exports and less soymeal exports from devaluing countries;The model evaluates a hypothetical 20 percent import tariff of the EC in an attempt to discourage imported soymeal as a protein source and encourage their domestic grain utilization. An import tariff on soybeans alone leads to substitution of imported soymeal for soybeans. This policy is ineffective in reducing soymeal use in the EC and hurts the domestic <b>crushing</b> <b>industry.</b> An import tariff on soymeal alone is more effective, however soymeal consumption in the EC decreases only slightly. There would be soybean and soymeal price reductions in all other regions. The import tariff on the two commodities would reduce soymeal consumption in the EC the most. In all three cases, there would be price decreases, world trade decreases, and the U. S. would have the highest loss in export revenue;Removal of Brazilian export taxes which primarily impose a higher rate on soybean exports than soymeal export, would primarily affect the Brazilian internal sector but other regions very little. Elimination of export taxes would increase domestic soybean and soymeal prices, reduce domestic crushing levels, and reduce soymeal export. The Brazilian export tax policy is effective in keeping domestic prices of soybean and soymeal below world prices and encouraging the domestic crushing industry;The other scenarios considered include a lower EC corn threshold price and additional increase in soymeal consumption in Eastern Europe...|$|R
40|$|Sunflower is {{the most}} {{important}} oilseed crop in South Africa and accounts for approximately 60 % of all oilseeds produced locally. The primary by-products of the sunflower seed <b>crushing</b> <b>industry</b> provides high-value inputs towards the food and animal feed manufacturing sector in the form of edible oil and protein meal. Prior to 1996, the South African sunflower seed complex market was controlled by the Oilseed Board, which operated a single-channel pool scheme and regulated the marketing of oilseeds and oilseed products. Since the liberalisation of the South African agricultural sector, role-players have been fully exposed to the dynamics and risks of the international oilseed complex market. Over the years participants in the agricultural commodity markets have developed various instruments to assist them in their decision-making process – one of them being commodity modelling, which is described as a methodological technique that provides a powerful analytical tool for examining the complexities of commodity markets. In South Africa, many role-players in the various agricultural industries make use of a multi-sector commodity level partial equilibrium model better know as the BFAP sector model which is maintained by the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) at the University of Pretoria. The objective {{of this study was to}} expand the coverage of the existing BFAP sector model by developing a comprehensive system of equations for the total sunflower seed complex, which includes not only a partial equilibrium model for sunflower seed, but also sunflower oil and cake. In this study much emphasis was not only placed on the formation of prices of the various products, but also the application of the most suitable model structures in order to trace the behaviour of the various prices under real market conditions as accurately as possible. This study applied the methodology developed by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) and further adapted by the Bureau for Food and Agriculture Policy (BFAP) to develop the partial equilibrium model of the South African sunflower complex. The single equations were estimated by mainly using ordinary least squares (OLS), but in cases where the results of the OLS were contradictory to the theory or where insufficient data was available, calibration techniques were employed and the equations were synthetically constructed. The constructed model was applied to lay down a baseline projection for the total production and consumption blocks of sunflower seed, oil and oilcake. The baseline projections also formed part of the ex post validation of the model’s performance. Finally the consistency of the model was evaluated in the form of scenario analysis. Various real-world market- and policy-related shocks were imposed and the results were compared to the baseline projections. In general the model developed in this dissertation performed well and can be used to analyse the effects of economic, technological and policy changes on the South African sunflower seed complex. It also provides a sound structure for the development of a complete South African oilseed complex model that includes soybeans, canola, groundnuts, cotton and imported palm oil.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of flaxseed meal (FSM), {{a by-product of}} the flax <b>crushing</b> <b>industry,</b> has not been evaluated properly for use within swine rations. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the nutritional profile of this novel feed ingredient for pigs. The analysis of FSM revealed that it contains, on a dry matter (DM) basis, 133 g/kg ether extract (EE), 345 g/kg crude protein (CP), 60 g/kg ash, 164 g/kg ADF, 250 g/kg NDF, 102 g/kg crude fibre, 14 g/kg starch and 9 g/kg phosphorus. The gross energy (GE) content of the meal was 5. 2 Mcal/kg DM. The ether extract fraction was characterized by, {{as a percent of}} total fat, 46. 6 % á-linolenic acid, an omega- 3 fatty acid. Palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids accounted for 9. 5, 4. 8, 20. 7 and 18. 4 % of the total fat content respectively. The crude protein content was well balanced for all amino acids with the exception of lysine (4. 1 % of CP), the level of which falls below that of the requirements for growing pigs (5. 3 % of CP for pigs 20 - 50 kg). The apparent digestibility of DM, nitrogen, ash, EE and GE as well as determination of the DE and NE content of FSM was determined for both growing pigs (32 pigs, initial weight 70 ± 3 kg) and gestating sows (26 pigs, parities 2 – 4). Animals were fed wheat/barley based diets containing 0, 10, 20 or 30 % FSM. Faecal grab samples were collected for 3 days after a dietary adaptation period. The apparent digestibility of nutrients in FSM was determined both by regression and by difference calculations. As calculated by difference, the apparent digestibility coefficients for DM, nitrogen, ash, and GE were 63. 0, 60. 8, 22. 3 and 60. 5 % respectively for growing pigs. The values obtained for sows were 64. 1, 58. 8, 20. 8, 94. 9 and 65. 4 % for DM, nitrogen, ash, EE and GE respectively. The DE content was 3. 37 Mcal/kg for growing pigs and 3. 52 Mcal/kg for sows. Net energy was then estimated by use of a prediction equation to be 2. 34 and 2. 44 Mcal/kg for growing pigs and sows. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the growth performances and carcass fatty acid profiles of pigs fed with graded levels of FSM. A total of 200 pigs (100 barrows, 100 gilts; initial weight 32 ± 4 kg) were blocked by gender and housed in groups of 5 pigs per pen. The experiment was divided into three phases for pigs 32 - 60 kg, 60 - 85 kg and 85 - 115 kg. Each group was assigned to one of four dietary treatments containing 0, 5, 10 or 15 % FSM at the expense of wheat and soybean meal. At the time of market, 6 pigs per treatment group were randomly selected for carcass fatty acid analysis, and backfat and rib-end loin samples were collected. The average daily gains, average daily feed intakes and gain to feed ratios were not affected by dietary treatment (P > 0. 05). Inclusion of 15 % dietary FSM increased the ALA content from 11 to 47 (± 0. 8) mg/g of backfat (P < 0. 001) and from 5 to 10 (± 0. 4) mg/g of loin tissue (P < 0. 001). Increasing dietary FSM decreased the saturated fatty acid content of backfat (P < 0. 01). The final experiment was designed to determine the availability of phosphorus in semi-synthetic diets containing FSM, and {{to determine the effects of}} microbial phytase inclusion of this availability. Five treatment groups, 8 barrows (45 ± 4 kg initial weight) each, were fed a diet containing 30 % FSM with increasing levels of phytase (0, 575, 1185, 2400 and 2570 FTU/kg). Apparent P digestibility increased from 20. 6 to 61. 3 % with the inclusion of up to 2570 FTU/kg microbial phytase (P < 0. 001), and followed a quadratic response pattern with an R 2 value of 0. 96. A broken-line analysis estimated the optimal phytase inclusion level to be 1415 FTU/kg of diet. Inclusion of just 575 FTU/kg accounted for half of the response, improving the apparent P digestibility by 20 % and reducing P excretion by 850 mg/kg dry matter intake...|$|R
40|$|The <b>crushed</b> stone mining <b>industry</b> {{is valued}} at nearly one billion dollars in Arkansas alone. Physical {{properties}} of the rock dictate whether or not an area may be suited {{for the establishment of}} an aggregate quarry. The Gum Log quarry located 10 miles northeast of Russellville, Arkansas is geographically well situated near areas in need of aggregate material, as well as physically competent rock. The rock mined in Gum Log is located in the Upper Atoka Formation, a Middle Pennsylvanian aged member of the Arkoma Basin. There are five different lithologic facies identifiable in the quarry (Facies 1 - 5 respectively) : A shallow marine, fissile shale unit marks the oldest facies observable in the quarry; a distal bar sandstone with macerated plant debris; thick, highly cross-bedded distributary-mouth-bar sandstone; a tidal flat siltstone facies; and highly cross-bedded distributary channel sandstone, which is the youngest facies observed in Gum Log. By using LA Abrasion test results on the different facies of Gum Log quarry the aggregate potential of the rock can be evaluated. Facies 1 is not well suited for aggregate mining and is unable to be tested with the LA Abrasion method because the process is not designed to test shale. Facies 2 has an average LA percentage of 47. 6 % and is not suitable for aggregate material. Facies 3 is separated into three units based on engineering properties, and have average LA percentages of 27. 4, 31. 6, and 43. 1 % from top to bottom in the section. This facies is the primary unit mined in Gum Log quarry and is well suited for aggregate material. Facies 4 has average LA percentages over 60 % as is not suitable for aggregate material. Facies 5 has an average LA percentage of 27. 3 % and is very well suited for aggregate material; however current prices deem the unit uneconomic. Based on the results of this analysis, mining in Gum Log quarry should continue north and east, following the thick sandstone of Facies 3 and avoiding the overlying siltstones of Facies 4...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This study {{provides}} an overview of the sunflower seed industry, globally and locally. This overview is, followed by measurements of the comparative and competitive advantages of the South African and Argentinean sunflower seed industries. Two indexes are used to calculate the comparative and competitive advantages namely the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index. The results show that South African sunflower seed has a competitive advantage in their primary form, however the value added sunflower seed products show a competitive disadvantage which is opposite to that of Argentina’s sunflower seed products. The finding that South Africa is only competitive in the primary sunflower seed market was calculated by means of trade data. Factors that affect the competitiveness of the sunflower industry were identified to indicate why value added sunflower seed products experience a competitive disadvantage. In the analysis {{it was found that the}} South African sunflower industry is price driven. Since price plays an important role in the competitiveness of the industry, imports of cheaper sunflower crude and refined oils are considered to pose a major threat to the <b>industry.</b> <b>Crushing</b> margins has increased over the last few years due to higher sunflower oil and sunflower oilcake prices. In order to increase the competitiveness of the South African sunflower seed industry, it needs to; be more cost competitive; improve quality; launch new products; invest in new technologies and improve the innovativeness. Emphasis should be placed on the value added seed products as this is where South Africa has a competitive disadvantage. Health issues are of great importance to the local as well as global market and the production of a healthier vegetable oil has become a necessity for this industry. Innovation in this commodity will lead to great improvement in the competitiveness of the sunflower seed industry. Investment towards research and innovation is necessary in order to keep up with the changing environment. The competitiveness of the sunflower seed industry in South Africa cannot be achieved without the help of the government. Policy issues must be put in place to avoid the dumping of cheaper crude vegetable oils as well as bottled cooking oils in South Africa. Master...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Underground stone mining Is an {{emerging}} {{sector of the}} U. S. mining industry. As this expansion takes mines under deeper cover, and as more efficient mining methods are utilized, effective stone pillar design methods {{will become even more}} Important. Current design practices are examined and a discussion of safe mine layouts is presented as a first approach towards weighing the demands for increased production against increased risk. Risks to underground stone-mine workers include rib Instabilities, pillar failures and roof falls. Seventy-two stone-mine pillar designs were examined. Pillars with width to height ratios of less than 1. 5 appear more likely to fail when subjected to excessive stress levels. When width to height ratios fall below 1. 0 defects in the pillars, such as through-running discon 2, can have a significant influence on stability. Discontinuity persistence, dip, material properties and orientation are also important determining factors in pillar strength. During the past three years the number of active underground stone mines in the U. S. A. has ranged between 90 and 100. This number is expected to increase as the <b>crushed</b> stone <b>industry</b> responds to growing demands for its products. 1 As more of the industry moves to benefit from the advantages of underground mining production from underground stone mines is expected to increase above its current level of approximately 66 000 000 r/year. Parker 2 identified four advantages of underground mining operations: (1) surface developments, zoning laws and environmental concerns are often less of an issue; (2) stripping and restoration requirements are eliminated; (3) additional reserves are often available beneath the quarry floor, under pit slopes or under an adjoining property; and (4) space is created for secondary use. Underground mines enjoy the added benefits of work in a constant underground climate, rather than in the variable surface climate, minimization of community concerns by placement of the crushing, sizing and stowing operations underground and reduction of surface vibration concerns through smaller blasts. The drawbacks of underground mining include added health and safety hazards for the stone miners, whose health can suffer from increased exposure to falls of ground, airborne contaminants and fog in large underground openings. Injuries from falls of ground in stone mines have occasionally exceeded the incidence rates for other mineral resources mined underground. 3 Existing underground stone operations, by comparison with stone operations a decade ago, mine more stone at a faster rate and with larger equipment. Because of high demand mines face increased pressure to yield more stone per production blast. A majority of the miners use the V-cut blasting pattern, which limits the depth or pull for each shot to about 4 m. Therefore, to produce more stone, either the mines must work more faces or existing faces must be enlarged. The enlargement of underground openings poses problems in the maintenance o 22 ̆ 01 a strata stability, First, the widths of the mine entries partially control the amount of sag or deflection that any given roof beam can withstand before failure. This deflection can take pi ace quickly after an opening is excavated or much later as weathering processes form additional, thinner beams. Because increased deflection increases the potential for roof beam failure, {{there is a limit to}} how wide a room can safely be made. These limits depend on local geological and stress conditions and, to some extent, the cost effectiveness of roof-bolting. Given these room width limitations, underground stone mines have placed more attention on expansion of production through benching where mining thicknesses permit. The heights of rooms partially control the strength characteristics of adjacent pillars: as the room height increases for a given pillar width the pillar width-to-height ratio (w/h) decreases. In general, stone pillars are very...|$|R
