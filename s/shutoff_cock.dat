40|$|The paper {{deals with}} design {{requirements}} for an aviation fuel system (AFS), AFS basic design requirements, reliability, and design precautions to avoid AFS failure. Compares {{the reliability and}} fail-safety of AFS and aircraft hydraulic system (AHS), considers the promising alternative ways to raise reliability of fuel systems, as well as elaborates recommendations to improve reliability of the pipeline system components and pipeline systems, in general, based on the selection of design solutions. It is extremely advisable to design the AFS and AHS in accordance with Aviation Regulations АП 25 and Accident Prevention Guidelines, ICAO (International Civil Aviation Association), which will reduce risk of emergency situations, {{and in some cases}} even avoid heavy disasters. ATS and AHS designs should be based on the uniform principles to ensure the highest reliability and safety. However, currently, this principle is not enough kept, and AFS looses in reliability and fail-safety as compared with AHS. When there are the examined failures (single and their combinations) the guidelines to ensure the AFS efficiency should be the same as those of norm-adopted in the Regulations АП 25 for AHS. This will significantly increase reliability and fail-safety of the fuel systems and aircraft flights, in general, despite a slight increase in AFS mass. The proposed improvements through the use of components redundancy of the fuel system will greatly raise reliability of the fuel system of a passenger aircraft, which will, without serious consequences for the flight, withstand up to 2 failures, its reliability and fail-safety design will be {{similar to those of the}} AHS, however, above improvement measures will lead to a slightly increasing total mass of the fuel system. It is advisable to set a second pump on the engine in parallel with the first one. It will run in case the first one fails for some reasons. The second pump, like the first pump, can be driven from the aircraft gearbox or from additional motor and fires as soon as the first one fails; to duplicate a fuel emergency <b>shutoff</b> <b>cock,</b> which functions only in case of engine fire, as well as to increase the strength reserves of the pipelines and the fuel system pressure units up to three units, as it is stipulated in the AHS. </p...|$|E
