500|$|By {{skipping}} Iowa, McCain {{was able}} to focus instead on the New Hampshire primary, where his message held appeal to independents and where Bush's father had never been very popular. [...] At first, McCain attracted small crowds and little media attention. [...] But by November 1999, McCain had become competitive, measuring evenly with Bush in polls. [...] Bush said he realized McCain was a strong candidate there: [...] "If I had to guess why Senator McCain is doing well, it's people respect him and <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> He's a good man." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] {{deals with}} {{subjects}} of chivalry and marriage. It {{is based on}} a list of qualities a man should have if he wants to marry Trainor, or call her his girlfriend. Christina Lee of Idolator opined that the lyrics, [...] "You got that 9-to-5, but baby, <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> / so don't be thinking I'll be home making apple pies" [...] and Trainor's [...] "slight twang" [...] on the song recalled the works of American singer Wanda Jackson. Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan opined that the song's lyrical content describes [...] "marriage as a contract between equals who work and don't cook," [...] and deemed it a [...] "YA dream that's no pastel-colored fantasy". The track's melody was likened to those of 1961 songs [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] by Dion and [...] "Quarter to Three" [...] by Gary U.S. Bonds. [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 159 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D♭ major, with a key change to D major, with Trainor's vocals spanning the tonal nodes of A3 to A5. The song follows a basic sequence of D–Bm–G–A as its chord progression. [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] was recorded at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. Trainor's vocals were recorded by Kadish, who was also responsible for the track's mixing, programming and engineering. The song's instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass, synthesizer and acoustic guitar by Kadish; and piano and organ by David Baron; and baritone and tenor saxophone by Jim Hoke. The song was mastered by David Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City, New York.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{commentators}} {{had suggested}} that Bush forecast the selection of Gonzales with his comments defending the Attorney General made on July 6, 2005, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Bush stated, [...] "I don't like it when a friend gets criticized. I'm loyal to my friends. All of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire. And <b>so,</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> like it? No, I don't like it, at all." [...] However, this speculation proved to be incorrect, as Bush nominated D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge John Roberts to the Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|... “ They {{are both}} great players and they {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} in their careers but I do something different. They are all focused on their results. They want to win, they want to achieve their goals, and of course <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> The difference is that I put my focus elsewhere. Bushido teaches that to walk [...] "The Path" [...] is a goal in itself. Results are places on the road that will happen as you take the journey, but they are not the focus. The process is where my focus is and it is where I differ from every other Danish Player in history.” - speaking of fellow country-men Anders Boesen and Kenneth Johnassen after the 2002 European Championships.|$|E
