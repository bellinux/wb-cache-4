40|$|During {{the first}} two space shuttle flights the aft <b>skirt</b> <b>heat</b> shield curtain {{performed}} well during ascent but failed during reentry. This exposed {{the inside of the}} skirt and its subsystems to reentry heating. The resulting exposure damaged various expensive systems items and therefore a curtain reassessment is required. As a part of this reassessment, tests were conducted in the MSFC Hot Gas Facility (HGF). The purposes of these tests were to determine if the curtain would fail {{in a manner similar to}} that in flight and to demonstrate that meaningful tests of the curtain can be conducted in the HGF...|$|R
40|$|A {{full scale}} {{segment of the}} actual Solid Rocket Booster aft <b>skirt</b> <b>heat</b> shield curtain was tested in the Large Radiant Lamp Facility (LRLF) at Marshall Space Flight Center. The curtain was mounted in the {{horizontal}} position {{in the same manner}} as it is to be mounted on the SRB. A shaker rig was designed and used to provide a motion of the curtain, simulating that to be caused in flight by vehicle acoustics. Thermocouples were used to monitor curtain materials temperatures. Both ascent and reentry heat loads were applied to the test specimen. All aspects of the test setup performed as expected, and the test was declared successful...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of these tests}} {{was to determine whether}} Insta-Foam can be used successfully to protect items inside the solid rocket booster aft skirt during reentry. On some of the early Space Shuttle flights the aft <b>skirt</b> <b>heat</b> shield curtain failed during reentry. This allowed the hot gases to damage some of the equipment, etc., inside the skirt. For example, some of the propellant lines were overheated and ruptured and some of the NSI (nozzle severance) cables were damaged. It was suggested that the Insta-Foam thermal protection system be sprayed over these lines, etc., to protect them during future flights in case of a curtain failure. The tests presented were devised and run to check out the feasibility of this idea...|$|R
40|$|The CLVSTATE {{engineering}} code {{is being}} used to predict Ares-I launch vehicle first stage reentry aerodynamic heating. An engineering analysis is developed which yields reasonable predictions for the timing of the first stage aft skirt thermal curtain failure and the resulting internal gas temperatures. The analysis is based on correlations of the Ares I-X internal aft skirt gas temperatures and has been implemented into CLVSTATE. Validation of the thermal curtain opening models has been accomplished using additional Ares I-X thermocouple, calorimeter and pressure flight data. In addition, a technique which accounts for radiation losses at high altitudes has been developed which improves the gas temperature measurements obtained by the gas temperature probes (GTP). Updates to the CLVSTATE models are shown to improve the accuracy of the internal aft <b>skirt</b> <b>heating</b> predictions which will result in increased confidence in future vehicle design...|$|R

40|$|The fourth NASA {{space shuttle}} flight {{incorporating}} redesigned solid rocket motors began on 4 May 1989. The flight motors were designated 360 Q 004 A (left-hand) and 360 H 004 B (right-hand); {{the mission was}} designated STS- 30 R. Overall engine performance was excellent. The low sample rate data that was available showed exceptional propulsion performance. All ballistic and mass property parameters closely matched the predicted values and were well within the required contract end item specification levels that could be assessed. No strain, vibration, or aft <b>skirt</b> <b>heating</b> environments could be addressed due to developmental flight instrumentation deletion. Infrared readings from the shuttle thermal imager were considered very good when compared with ground environment instrumentation readings taken during both the aborted and the actual countdowns. However, hand-held infrared gun reading/ground environment instrumentation comparisons were considered poor during both countdowns, {{with the exception of}} the T - 3 hour timeframe during the actual launch. Postflight inspection again verified superior performance of the insulation, phenolics, metal parts, and seals. All combustion gas was contained by the insulation in the field and case-to-nozzle joints. Inadequate parachute performance on the left-hand booster caused high splashdown loads, which resulted in a displaced nozzle and factory joint weatherseal unbond anomalies. Recommendations were made concerning improved thermal modeling and instruments. The rationale for these recommendations, the dispositions of all anomalies, and complete result details are given...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{demonstrate}} {{and evaluate the}} effectiveness of heat interception methods for use on a relevant cryogenic propulsion stage at a system level has been identified. Evolvable Cryogenics (eCryo) Structural Heat Intercept, Insulation and Vibration Evaluation Rig (SHIIVER) will be designed with vehicle specific geometries (SLS Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) as guidance) and will be subjected to simulated space environments. One method of reducing structure-born heat leak being investigated utilizes vapor-based heat interception. Vapor-based heat interception could potentially reduce heat leak into liquid hydrogen propulsion tanks, increasing potential mission length or payload capability. Due to the high number of unknowns associated with the heat transfer mechanism and integration of vapor-based heat interception on a realistic large-scale skirt design, a sub-scale investigation was developed. The sub-project effort is known as the Small-scale Laboratory Investigation of Cooling Enhancements (SLICE). The SLICE aims to study, design, and test sub-scale multiple attachments and flow configuration concepts for vapor-based heat interception of structural skirts. SLICE will focus on understanding the efficiency of the heat transfer mechanism to the boil-off hydrogen vapor by varying the fluid network designs and configurations. Various analyses were completed in MATLAB, Excel VBA, and COMSOL Multiphysics to understand the optimum flow pattern for heat transfer and fluid dynamics. Results from these analyses were used to design and fabricate test article subsections of a large forward skirt with vapor cooling applied. The SLICE testing is currently being performed to collect thermal mechanical performance data on multiple <b>skirt</b> <b>heat</b> removal designs while varying inlet vapor conditions necessary to intercept a specified amount of heat for a given system. Initial results suggest that applying vapor-cooling provides a 50 heat reduction in conductive heat transmission along the skirt to the tank. The information obtained by SLICE will be used by the SHIIVER engineering team to design and implement vapor-based heat removal technology into the SHIIVER forward skirt hardware design...|$|R
5000|$|Vermeer's {{painting}} {{is even more}} understated, although the use of symbols remains: one of the Delft tiles {{at the foot of}} the wall behind the maid, near the foot warmer, depicts Cupid [...] - [...] which can imply arousal of a woman or simply that while she is working she is daydreaming about a man. Other amorous symbols in the painting include a wide-mouthed jug, often used as a symbol of the female anatomy. The foot warmer was often used by artists as a symbol for female sexual arousal because, when placed under a <b>skirt,</b> it <b>heats</b> the whole body below the waist, according to Liedtke. The coals enclosed inside the foot warmer could symbolize [...] "either the heat of lust in tavern or brothel scenes, or the hidden but true burning passion of a woman for her husband", according to Serena Cant, a British art historian and lecturer. Yet the whitewashed wall and presence of milk seem to indicate that the room was a [...] "cool kitchen" [...] used for cooking with dairy products, such as milk and butter, so the foot warmer would have a pragmatic purpose there. Since other Dutch paintings of the period indicate that foot warmers were used when seated, its presence in the picture may symbolize the standing woman's [...] "hardworking nature", according to Cant.|$|R
40|$|Development of {{thermally}} protected load-carrying structures of reusable launch vehicles capable {{to withstand the}} environment and manoeuvre loads during re-entry needs ground test facilities simulating at least the thermal input and mechanical loads under ambient atmospheric conditions. By this means, the predicted structural behaviour can be confirmed. As a consequence, the DLR-Institute of Structural Mechanics developed the THERMEX test facilities and still improves the test procedures. Within {{the first part of}} the presentation the recent challenging test series on European contributions to the X- 38 re-entry vehicle will be highlighted. Testing the rudder model surface temperatures up to 1175 °C have been achieved by enforcing infrared lamp radiation. A strongly curved panel, the so-called nose <b>skirt,</b> was <b>heated</b> by accommodation of the heater arrays to the geometry of the test article. Because the nose skirt panel was manufactured from C/SiC very small deformations were measured by high-resolution displacement transducers. Within the preceding FESTIP activities cryogenic tank wall panels with an outer high-temperature insulation were tested simultaneously by an outside heating up to 950 °C and an inside cryogenic cooling by liquid nitrogen. Within the second part new developments for forthcoming tests will be illustrated. Such as testing of structures with complicated shapes under combined hot and cryogenic temperature loading will be considered. The concept of modular assemblage of facility components will allow a variety of applications, e. g. ablation exclusively caused by heat irradiation and even brazing of stringers to a titanium panel by fast infrared heating. Another attempt of improvement will be the feasibility to study kinematics of hot structures such as flaps or rudders. Again, the hot gas test facility, part of the THERMEX assembly, will be used to simulate in addition to the thermal loading aerodynamic pressure and flow as well as acoustic excitation. Measurement and data recording will be refined by new amplifiers allowing also the use of type S thermo-couples. For temperature determination even the application of colour coating and infrared camera recording will be studied. The presentation will close with considerations on realisation of successful test procedures. The most important aspect is pre-testing on dummy structures to optimise thermal input and temperature distribution within the tested structure, to adapt the ranges of measurement, and to determine the control parameters of thermal and mechanical loading, especially in the case of kinematics...|$|R
40|$|For large in-space {{cryogenic}} upper stages, substantial axial heat {{removal from}} a forward <b>skirt</b> by vapor-based <b>heat</b> interception {{may not be}} achieved by simple attachment methods unless sufficient thermal conductance from the skirt to the cooling fluid can be achieved. Preferable methods would allow for {{the addition of the}} cooling system to existing structure with minimal impact on the structure. Otherwise, significant modification to the basic structural design andor novel and complex attachment mechanisms with high effective thermal conductance are likely to be required. The approach being pursued by evolvable Cryogenics (eCryo) is to increase the thermal performance of a relatively simple attachment system by applying metallic or other thermally conductive material coatings to the mating surface area of the fluid channel where it is attached the skirt wall. The expectation of candidate materials is that the dramatic increase in conductivity of pure metals at temperatures close to liquid hydrogen vapor temperature will compensate for the reduced actual contact area typical of mechanical joints. Basic contact conductance data at low temperatures for candidate interface materials is required to enable the test approach. A test rig was designed at NASA Glenn Research Center to provide thermal contact resistance testing between small sample coupons coated with conductive material via electron beam evaporation, a low-temperature option that will not affect physical properties of base materials. Average coating thicknesses were 10 k. The test fixture was designed to mount directly to a cryocooler cold head within a vacuum test chamber. The purpose of this test was to determine qualitative contact conductance between various test samples. Results from this effort will be implemented in a sub-scale vapor-based heat interception test, where the applicability for increased heat removal on large structural skirts will be considered...|$|R
