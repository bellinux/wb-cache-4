5000|$|In the 1950s, {{there was}} an effort to produce a [...] "classical" [...] {{ensemble}} of cuatros, with various-sized instruments taking {{on the role of the}} violins, violas, cellos, and double bases in a classical orchestra. To meet these roles cuatros of the aviolinado style were produced in four different sizes and tunings: Cuatro Soprano, Cuatro Alto, Cuatro Tradicional (the <b>standard</b> <b>instrument,</b> also called Cuatro Tenor), and Cuatro Bajo (Bass Cuatro): all have ten strings and are tuned in fourths. The project met with only limited success and today most of these variants are rare, with the cuatro tradicional surviving as the <b>standard</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R

40|$|Residents are {{required}} to learn a multitude of skills during their microsurgical training. One such skill is the judicious application of force when handling delicate tissue. An instrument has been developed that indicates to the surgeon when a force threshold has been exceeded by providing vibrotactile feedback. The objective {{of this study was}} to validate the use of this "smart" force-limiting instrument for microsurgery. A laboratory and an in vivo experiment were performed to evaluate the force-limiting instrument. In the laboratory experiment, twelve novice surgeons were randomly allocated to use either the force-limiting <b>instrument</b> or a <b>standard</b> <b>instrument.</b> Surgeons were then asked to perform microsurgical dissection in a model. In the in vivo experiment, an intermediate surgeon performed microsurgical dissection in a stepwise fashion, alternating every 30 seconds between use of the force-limiting <b>instrument</b> and a <b>standard</b> <b>instrument.</b> The primary outcomes were the forces exerted and the OSATS scores. In the laboratory experiment, the maximal forces exerted by novices using the force-limiting instrument were significantly less than using a <b>standard</b> <b>instrument,</b> and were comparable to intermediate and expert surgeons (0. 637 N versus 4. 576 N; p = 0. 007). In the in vivo experiment, the maximal forces exerted with the force-limiting instrument were also significantly less than with a <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> (0. 441 N versus 0. 742 N; p 0. 1). In conclusion, the development and use of this force-limiting instrument in a clinical setting may improve patient safety...|$|R

40|$|A new {{miniature}} Wright peak-flow meter {{has been}} designed and produced. The meter is tubular with a spring-loaded piston and a longitudinal slot through which air escapes. Its dynamic characteristics have been carefully designed to make it respond only to peak flow and not to rate of rise. Performance tests on early instruments showed fairly close correlation with the Wright peak-flow meter but with a constant error of + 38 1 /min. On later models the correlation was increased to 0. 990 and the error reduced to + 3 %. The mini-meter correlates {{as well with the}} <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> as two <b>standard</b> <b>instruments</b> correlate with each other and should prove useful clinically...|$|R
