50|$|The {{domain name}} seizure process used by Operation In Our Sites was codified in (b)(2), which {{provides}} a legal framework for property seizures by the government. Before the seizure, government officials are supposed to investigate suspected websites {{to find out if}} they actually purchase or access counterfeit items. The government then contacts the copyright holders to confirm ownership of the intellectual property and <b>suspected</b> <b>infringement.</b> Following the investigation, ICE and NIPRCC officials present the resulting evidence to the U.S. Attorneys, and check the domain name registration.If the domain name was registered in the U.S., the government petitions a magistrate judge to issue a seizure warrant for the domain name. With the warrant, the domain name's title and rights are transferred to the U.S. government. After the seizure, the government is supposed to send a written notice of the forfeiture deadline to the website operator within 60 days from the seizure date. The website owner can file the claim against the government within 35 days after receiving the notice. If the owner files a claim, the government has 90 days to prove that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the owner does not make a claim against the seizure, or the government successfully proves a valid seizure, the domain name is forfeited to the government.|$|E

40|$|The issue: Excluding cartels, most {{investigations}} into <b>suspected</b> <b>infringements</b> of European Union competition law are resolved with ‘commitment decisions’. The European Commission drops {{the case in}} exchange for a commitment from the company under investigation to implement measures to stop the presumed anti-competitive behaviour. Commitment decisions are considered speedier than formal sanctions (prohibition decisions) in restoring normal competitive market conditions. They have a cost, however: commitments are voluntary and are unlikely to be subject to judicial review. This reduces the European Commission’s incentive to build a robust case. Because commitment decisions do not establish any legal precedent, they provide for little guidance on the interpretation of the law. Policy challenge: The European Commission relies increasingly on commitment decisions. More transparency on the substance of allegations, and the establishment of a higher number of legal precedents, are however necessary. This applies in particular to cases that tackle antitrust issues in new areas, such as markets for digital goods, in which companies might find it difficult to assess if a certain behaviour constitutes a violation of competition rules. To ensure greater transparency and mitigate some of the drawbacks of commitment decisions, while retaining their main benefits, the full detail of the objections addressed by the European Commission to defendants should be published...|$|R

40|$|Der Aufsatz befaßt sich mit der Rolle von Denunziationen im Dritten Reich, der Bereitschaft vieler Bürger, mit Anzeigen und Verdächtigungen das Terrorsystem der Gestapo zu unterstützen. Im Mittelpunkt der Diskussion stehen dabei methodische Fragen; dem gängigen Ansatz einer Analyse von Staatsystem, gesellschaftlicher und politischer Kultur wird ein Ansatz gegenübergestellt, der stärker auf die Erfahrungen und Lebenswelt der 'einfachen Leute' eingeht. Der Autor wertet Akten der Gestapo aus und untersucht dabei vor allem die Motive von Informanten, wobei der soziale Kontext dieser Menschen stark durch die nationalsozialistische Ideologie und den Antisemitismus geprägt war. (pra) "Since 1990 or so, {{the role}} of denunciations in the Nazi terror system has been {{highlighted}} {{by a number of}} writers interested in the functioning of the Gestapo in the context of everyday life in Germany. Several historians have claimed that ordinary citizens who volunteered information on <b>suspected</b> <b>infringements</b> of the letter or spirit of the laws {{played a crucial role in}} everyday terror under Hitler's dictatorship. This cooperation by German citizens and their apparent willingness to denounce calls for historical analysis. In this paper I discuss the full range of denunciations in Nazi Germany and outline briefly some of the main theoretical problems involved. Essentially, historians have adopted two methods. The first takes a systems approach and focuses on the structures of state, society, and to some extent also on political culture. The other adopts a 'life-world' perspective, and attempts to reconstruct the experiences of historical actors, including those of 'ordinary people'. Each approach has its own advantages, but neither seems to do justice to the phenomenon of denunciations as discussed in the recent literature. The new findings impel us to rethink what we mean by willingness, consent, and support when these concepts are applied to modern dictatorships. The paper should be of interest to a wide variety of specialists. It will offer new substantive findings, suggest directions for future research and delineate some of the main methodological issues and problems that must be confronted. " (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{testing for}} {{circuits}} {{is an important}} task {{in the identification of}} possible infringement of intellectual property rights. In this paper, we propose a novel procedure for global similarity measurement between circuit topologies (networks) and apply this procedure to the comparison of physical designs of circuits. We first construct networks to describe the way in which circuit elements interact. Then, we evaluate the properties of each node from the resulting networks by calculating the cumulative distribution of characteristic parameters such as degree, clustering coefficient, etc. Based on the maximum vertical distance of each pair of distributions, global similarity testing methods are proposed with consideration of the inhomogeneity of parameter distributions and the scale of the networks. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the strategy in terms of robustness and topological information mining. The methodology described here {{can be applied to the}} identification of physical designs of circuits that may contain <b>suspected</b> patent <b>infringement,</b> and it is suitable for a wide range of circuits and systems.

50|$|Legislatures {{have reduced}} {{infringement}} by narrowing {{the scope of}} what is considered infringing. Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions, nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses.

The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are <b>suspected</b> of copyright <b>infringement,</b> thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.|$|R

40|$|The {{rational}} basis test is {{not only}} constitutional but also desirable. Nothing in the Constitution requires more exacting scrutiny than rational basis review and deference to the government is often appropriate. This article makes three main points. First, balancing between individual freedoms and government interests is inevitable in constitutional law, and the rational basis test is a necessary and desirable way of doing so when deference to the government is appropriate. Second, the Court has basically gotten it right about when to apply the rational basis test — using it to analyze government economic regulations and social welfare legislation {{when there is no}} discrimination based on a <b>suspect</b> classification or <b>infringement</b> of a fundamental right. My final point acknowledges a flaw in the test, that as currently applied, is too deferential because it allows laws to be upheld based on a conceivable permissible purpose, and is not concerned with whether the law meaningfully advances the government’s goal. But a merely conceivable purpose should be insufficient to do so. There should have to be an actual legitimate purpose, and there should be a meaningful relationship between the means chosen and the ends sought to be achieved...|$|R
5000|$|On September 29 the Minister of Industry {{introduced}} the Copyright Modernization Act (Bill C-11) — the same {{bill that was}} introduced in the 3rd session of the previous parliament and referred to the 'Legislative Committee on Bill C-32'. The bill is first major copyright reform since 1997 and brings Canadian copyright laws in line with modern digital rights management The act enables copyright holders to sue operators of peer-to-peer file sharing sites, makes circumventing technological protection measures (e.g. digital locks, encryption, etc.) illegal except when in the public interest, makes it illegal to remove rights management information (e.g. digital watermarks), extends moral rights for performers, makes legal the practise of copying for the purpose of backup, format shifting (CD to mp3), time shifting (recording to watch later), and expands fair dealing to include use in education, parody, and satire. However, the proposed law was criticized as [...] "irredeemably flawed" [...] due to a contradiction between consumer rights and digital locks, American interference, a requirement for students to destroy copyrighted digital content after a course ends, and makes notice and notice mandatory for all ISPs, including disclosing the identity and activity of customers <b>suspected</b> of copyright <b>infringement.</b> The bill finally passed the House of Commons on June 18 and given royal assent on June 29.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 a Dutch {{court ordered}} ISPs in the Netherlands not to divulge {{subscriber}} information {{because of the}} way the Dutch content industry group had collected the IP addresses (Foundation v. UPC Nederland). According to Dutch law ISPs can only be ordered to provide personal subscriber data if it is plausible that an unlawful act occurred, and if it is shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the subscriber information will identify the person who committed the infringing act. In Germany court specifically considered the right to privacy and in March 2008 the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that ISPs could only give out IP address subscription information in case of a [...] "serious criminal investigation". The court furthermore ruled that copyright infringement did not qualify as a serious enough offense. Subsequently, in April 2008, the Bundestag (German parliament) approved a new law requiring ISPs to divulge the identity of suspected infringers who infringe on a commercial scale. Similarly, in Sweden, a controversial file sharing bill is awaiting the Riksdag’s approval. The law, which would enter into effect on 1 April 2009, would allow copyright holders to request the IP addresses and names of copyright <b>infringement</b> <b>suspects</b> in order to take legal action against them. The copyright holders, though, should present sufficient evidence of harm to justify the release of information regarding the Internet subscribers. In Italy, the courts established that criminal liability does not extend to file sharing copyrighted material, as long as it is not done for commercial gain. Ruling on a case involving a copyright holder who employed a third party to collect IP addresses of suspected copyright infringers, the Italian Data Protection Authority ruled in February 2008 that the systematic monitoring peer-to-peer activities for the purpose of detecting copyright infringers and suing them is prohibited.|$|R
40|$|One {{fundamental}} {{impetus for}} the development of modern law stems from the need to settle disputes between neighbors. Indeed, the focus of the most-cited article in law review history, Ronald Coase 2 ̆ 7 s The Problem of Social Cost, is firmly on the issue of how the law should deal with someone who interferes {{with the use of a}} neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s property. The myriad of uses to which Coase 2 ̆ 7 s analysis has been put over the last forty years has obscured the relatively straightforward nature of the question that interested him: Should the law force an entity to bear the full cost of its behavior? When one neighbor harms another, should the law impose liability in the form of a damages action, or in the form of a tax (as suggested famously by Pigou), or, perhaps, do nothing at all? The original conundrum contemplated by Coase arises with spectacular clarity in the context of the emerging problem of pollen drift. Genetically modified (GMO) crops constitute a significant segment of agricultural production, and pollen from these crops drifts inexorably across property lines. Consider the situation faced by farmers in the United States who grow non-genetically modified (non-GMO) crops for buyers in jurisdictions that heavily regulate or forbid the sale of genetically modified food products, like the European Union or Japan, or who sell to purveyors of organic food products in the United States or elsewhere. The market for non-GMO crops is enormous, and such goods often command a premium price, but due to the widespread planting of GMO crops, non-GMO farmers run the constant risk of contamination by pollen from patented genetically modified plants. If a farmer has a forward contract for non-GMO corn for sale in Europe, and her corn fields are pollinated by a neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s genetically modified crop, then the anticipated premium from selling the non-GMO crop will be lost. More importantly, the non-GMO farmer may find herself unable to sell the contaminated crop at all. If her plants are now found to contain patented cell structures claimed by the patentee of the GMO corn, then the farmer is arguably a patent infringer and selling her crop without the patentee 2 ̆ 7 s permission will be fraught with risk. The possibility of patent law exacerbating the harm done to the victim of this type of pollution adds an intriguing twist to the original problem. Although the fact of contamination through pollen drift is very real for non-GMO farmers, the danger posed by patent law may seem far-fetched because, in most areas of the law, passive bystanders have a complete defense. Patent law, however, is based on the concept of strict liability. If a department store sells an infringing product, for example, the store is liable whether it knew the product was infringing or not. A scientist working in her lab is guilty of patent infringement even if she has no idea that the new compound she has just synthesized happens to fall within the claims of an existing patent. Monsanto Corporation, the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading agricultural biotech company, has been particularly active in using federal law to police anyone it finds to be growing its patented plants. For instance, in the famous Schmeiser litigation, Monsanto, and other commentators, took the position that a bystanding farmer could be liable for patent infringement stemming from windblown GMO pollen. In fact, Monsanto 2 ̆ 7 s lead in its industry is certainly due in part to its use of forceful investigations and prosecutions against those it <b>suspects</b> of patent <b>infringement,</b> regardless of whether such infringers act willfully or are even aware of their alleged infringement. In short, Monsanto is in the unique position of being able to take a problem that it created [...] the contamination of non-GMO plants by pollen drift from GMO plants [...] and use it to its advantage by prosecuting those bystanding farmers whose crops become contaminated. In Part I of this Article, we apply the Coase Theorem and its most useful corollary to the problem of pollen drift. We conclude that the liability of pollen polluters should be governed by balancing rules under nuisance law, to be applied on a case-by-case basis, rather than by a blanket liability or immunity rule. We also conclude that truly bystanding non-GMO farmers should have a viable defense to patent infringement because liability would result in the application of a reverse Pigovian tax that cannot be justified under accepted economic theory. Only a contextual approach can account for the wide variety of costs that must be identified before determining whether liability for genetic pollution is socially desirable. In the rest of this Article, we demonstrate that existing legal doctrines support the adoption of the framework we advocate. In order to do that more effectively, we briefly provide the background science of genetically modified plants and how their patented characteristics can be adventitiously transferred, and we also highlight the consequences of pollen drift by canvassing the multi-billion dollar market for non-GMO crops. Then, we discuss the common law nuisance and trespass doctrines that may provide farmers with an affirmative cause of action when pollen drift causes a reduction in the value of a planted crop. Finally, we discuss patent law defenses that may be available to patent infringement defendants who characterize themselves as victims of pollen drift (bystanding farmers). We find significant opportunities for true bystanding farmers to rebut patent infringement claims in the voluntary act doctrine and in the doctrines of patent misuse, unclean hands, and volenti non fit injuria. In the spirit of truly descriptive law and economics analysis, we conclude that applicable common law and equitable doctrines appear to be efficient...|$|R
