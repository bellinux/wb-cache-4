50|$|The axiom {{of choice}} implies the {{existence}} of sets of reals {{that do not have}} the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property.</b> However, in Solovay's model, which satisfies all axioms of ZF but not the {{axiom of choice}}, every set of reals has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property,</b> so the use of the axiom of choice is necessary. Every analytic set has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property.</b> It follows from the existence of sufficiently large cardinals that every projective set has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{descriptive}} set theory, {{a subset}} of a Polish space has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property</b> if it is either countable or has a nonempty perfect subset (Kechris 1995, p. 150). Note that having the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property</b> {{is not the same}} as being a perfect set.|$|R
50|$|The Cantor-Bendixson theorem {{states that}} closed sets of a Polish space X {{have the perfect}} <b>set</b> <b>property</b> in a {{particularly}} strong form; any closed set C may be written uniquely as the disjoint union of a perfect set P and a countable set S. Thus it follows that every closed subset of a Polish space has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property.</b> In particular, every uncountable Polish space has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property,</b> and can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable open set.|$|R
50|$|Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) is an {{open-source}} Expression Language (EL) for Java, which, {{while using}} simpler expressions than {{the full range}} of those supported by the Java language, allows getting and <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> (through defined setProperty and getProperty methods, found in JavaBeans), and execution of methods of Java classes.

50|$|The {{properties}} of the projective sets are not completely determined by ZFC. Under the assumption V = L, not all projective sets have the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property</b> or the property of Baire. However, under the assumption of projective determinacy, all projective sets have both the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property</b> and the property of Baire. This {{is related to the}} fact that ZFC proves Borel determinacy, but not projective determinacy.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike full AC, DC is {{insufficient}} to prove (given ZF) {{that there is a}} nonmeasurable set of reals, or that there is a set of reals without the property of Baire or without the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property.</b> This follows because the Solovay model satisfies ZF + DC and every set of reals in this model is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property, and has the perfect <b>set</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{this method}} a {{transformer}} {{is used to}} measure resistivity without any {{direct contact with the}} specimen. The transformer consists of a primary coil which energises the circuit with an AC voltage and a secondary which is formed by a toroid of the concrete sample. The current in the sample is detected by a current coil wound around a section of the toroid (a current transformer). This method is good for measuring the <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> of concrete, its hydration and strength. Wet concrete has a resistivity of around 1 Ω-m which progressively increases as the cement sets.|$|E
50|$|WPF exposes a {{property}} system for objects which inherit from , that {{is aware of}} the dependencies between the consumers of the property, and can trigger actions based on changes in properties. Properties can be either hard coded values or expressions, which are specific expressions that evaluate to a result. In the initial release, however, the set of expressions supported is closed. The value of the properties can be inherited from parent objects as well. WPF properties support change notifications, which invoke bound behaviors whenever some property of some element is changed. Custom behaviors can be used to propagate {{a property}} change notification across a set of WPF objects. This is used by the layout system to trigger a recalculation of the layout on property-changes, thus exposing a declarative programming style for WPF, whereby almost everything, from setting colors and positions to animating elements can be achieved by <b>setting</b> <b>properties.</b> This allows WPF applications to be written in XAML, which is a declarative mark-up language, by binding the keywords and attributes directly to WPF classes and properties.|$|E

The effect of accelerator on the improvement of <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> is of much concern in recent years. In the present study the effect of calcium nitrate on <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> of flyash concrete was investigated. Effect of accelerators on compressive, split tensile strength and flexural behavior of various concrete mixes was studied. For this purpose, four different variables of concrete mixes were considered namely F/C ratio (0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 7), w/c ratio (0. 3 and 0. 4), replacement levels of flyash (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 %), respectively and accelerator dosage (0. 5 and 1 %). The experimental studies showed {{that the effect of}} calcium nitrate on the <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> was greatly improved due to increased reactivity. Further the results on the experimental investigation carried out in the laboratory on the performance indicated that high strength of concrete (52. 1 MPa at 28 days) was obtained for F/C ratio of 0. 6 at w/c ratio of 0. 3 and an accelerator dosage of 1 %. It can be also concluded that 20 % of flyash with a w/c of 0. 4 the strength gain results improved remarkably. Also, the water absorption test r...|$|E

Classically, wool dressing is applied to the limb before the PoP, which can then be moulded to the desired shape. A modification of this practice is to wrap the PoP bandages circumferentially in cotton before wetting and applying to the patient in an attempt to reduce inhalation of plaster dust and reduce mess. However, this may affect the water content of the cast and therefore also its <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> and strength. This study compared the <b>setting</b> <b>properties</b> of PoP casts when used with and without cotton wrapping. Methods: Sixty specimens, compliant with the American Society for Testing and Materials standards for three-point bending tests, were prepared, with thirty wrapped in cotton. All were weighed before and after water immersion, and wrapped around a plastic cylinder to mimic limb application. Bending stiffness and yield strength was measured on a servohydraulic materials testing machine at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Results: The water content of cotton-wrapped plaster was significantly higher (50...|$|E

The characterisation of the spectrum of L will provide insight into the physical interpretation of the problem. The study of scattering theory will proceed with the major results in the field being presented with particular focus on reflectionless scattering.
