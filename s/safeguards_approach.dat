40|$|The Swedish {{strategy}} {{to handle the}} spent fuel from the nuclear power plants isthe direct disposal in a geological repository. The safeguards regime covering allnuclear material in the state will be expanded to cover the new repository, whichwill require a novel <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> due mainly to the inaccessibility of thefuel after disposal. The <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> {{must be able to}} provide a high levelof assurance that the fuel in the repository not diverted, but must also be resourceefficient. An attractive approach with regards to use of resources is to monitoronly the access points to the repository, i. e. the openings. The implementationof such an approach can only be allowed if it is shown to be sufficiently secure. With the purpose of determining the applicability of this “black box” approach, adiversion path analysis for the Swedish geological repository has been carried out. The result from the analysis shows that all credible diversion paths could be cov-ered by the black-box <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> provided that the identified boundaryconditions can be met...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{efforts to}} promote the {{international}} expansion of nuclear energy through the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) {{will result in a}} dramatic expansion of nuclear fuel cycle facilities in the United States. New demonstration facilities, such as the Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility (AFCF), the Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR), and the Consolidated Fuel Treatment Center (CFTC) will use advanced nuclear and chemical process technologies that must incorporate increased proliferation resistance to enhance nuclear safeguards. The ASA- 100 Project, “Advanced <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Approaches</b> for New Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities,” commissioned by the NA- 243 Office of NNSA, has been tasked with reviewing and developing advanced <b>safeguards</b> <b>approaches</b> for these demonstration facilities. Because one goal of GNEP is developing and sharing proliferation-resistant nuclear technology and services with partner nations, the <b>safeguards</b> <b>approaches</b> considered are consistent with international safeguards as currently implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This first report reviews possible <b>safeguards</b> <b>approaches</b> for the new fuel reprocessing processes to be deployed at the AFCF and CFTC facilities.

40|$|This second {{report in}} a series of three reviews {{possible}} safeguards approaches for the new transuranic (TRU) fuel fabrication processes to be deployed at AFCF – specifically, the ceramic TRU (MOX) fuel fabrication line and the metallic (pyroprocessing) line. The most common TRU fuel has been fuel composed of mixed plutonium and uranium dioxide, referred to as “MOX”. However, under the Advanced Fuel Cycle projects custom-made fuels with higher contents of neptunium, americium, and curium may also be produced to evaluate if these “minor actinides” can be effectively burned and transmuted through irradiation in the ABR. A third and final report in this series will evaluate and review the advanced <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> options for the ABR. In reviewing and developing the advanced <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> for the new TRU fuel fabrication processes envisioned for AFCF, the existing international (IAEA) <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> at the Plutonium Fuel Production Facility (PFPF) and the conceptual approach planned for the new J-MOX facility in Japan have been considered as a starting point of reference.

40|$|Design Information Verification (DIV) {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} cornerstones {{for the development of a}} <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> for a facility. Design Information Verification is performed throughout the life cycle of a facility in order to ensure the absence of undeclared design changes and that the <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> remains appropriate and valid. In a large complex facility it is a challenging task to verify the accuracy and completeness of the declared design, and to monitor the modifications and changes that occur during the life of the facility. DIV activities in such a plant require a tremendous investment in human resources, financial resources and time. Large complex facilities also have inherent design features that impose limits on the accuracy, completeness, and continuity of knowledge achievable using traditional DIV methodology. Additionally, physical access to the places of safeguards interest may be difficult. In 2003, the Agency introduced an innovative device - the 3 -dimensional Laser Range Finder (3 DLRF) – that is capable of meeting some of the challenges involved in performing DIV at large complex facilities.

40|$|This third {{report in}} the series reviews {{possible}} <b>safeguards</b> <b>approaches</b> for new fast reactors in general, and the ABR in particular. Fast-neutron spectrum reactors have been used since the early 1960 s on an experimental and developmental level, generally with fertile blanket fuels to “breed” nuclear fuel such as plutonium. Whether the reactor is designed to breed plutonium, or transmute and “burn” actinides depends mainly {{on the design of}} the reactor neutron reflector and the whether the blanket fuel is “fertile” or suitable for transmutation. However, the safeguards issues are very similar, since they pertain mainly to the receipt, shipment and storage of fresh and spent plutonium and actinide-bearing “TRU”-fuel. For these reasons, the design of existing fast reactors and details concerning how they have been safeguarded were studied in developing advanced <b>safeguards</b> <b>approaches</b> for the new fast reactors. In this regard, the design of the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II “EBR-II” at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) was of interest, because it was designed as a collocated fast reactor with a pyrometallurgical reprocessing and fuel fabrication line – a design option being considered for the ABR. Similarly, the design of the Fast Flux Facility (FFTF) on the Hanford Site was studied, because it was a successful prototype fast reactor that ran for two decades to evaluate fuels and the design for commercial-scale fast reactors...|$|R

40|$|As {{nuclear energy}} {{grows in the}} United States and around the world, the {{expansion}} of the nuclear fuel cycle is inevitable. All currently deployed commercial reprocessing plants are based on the Plutonium - Uranium Extraction (PUREX) process. However, this process is not implemented in the U. S. for a variety of reasons, one being that it is considered by some as a proliferation risk. The 2001 Nuclear Energy Policy report recommended that the U. S. "develop reprocessing and treatment technologies that are cleaner, more efficient, less waste-intensive, and more proliferation-resistant. " The Uranium Extraction (UREX+) reprocessing technique has been developed to reach these goals. However, in order for UREX+ to be considered for commercial implementation, a <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> is needed to show that a commercially sized UREX+ facility can be safeguarded to current international standards. A detailed <b>safeguards</b> <b>approach</b> for a UREX+ 1 a reprocessing facility has been developed. The approach includes the use of nuclear material accountancy (MA), containment and surveillance (C/S) and solution monitoring (SM). Facility information was developed for a hypothesized UREX+ 1 a plant with a throughput of 1000 Metric Tons Heavy Metal (MTHM) per year. Safeguard goals and safeguard measures to be implemented were established. Diversion and acquisition pathways were considered; however, the analysis focuses mainly on diversion paths. The detection systems used in the design have the ability to provide near real-time measurement of special fissionable material in feed, process and product streams. Advanced front-end techniques for the quantification of fissile material in spent nuclear fuel were also considered. The economic and operator costs of these systems were not considered.
