Methods: A randomized observer blind controlled trial of 123 very preterm infants was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of the sole tertiary referral centre in Western Australia. Infants were stratified by gestational age (< 29 weeks or 29 - 30 weeks), then randomized into one of three intervention groups: postural support nappy, postural support nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll,</b> or disposable nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll.</b> Interventions started when infants were stable and ceased when routine side-lying commenced. Measurements of shoulder and hip posture were performed pre-intervention, 5 weeks post-intervention and term postmenstrual age. Results: Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> and a postural support nappy demonstrated improved hip posture to term equivalent age compared with infants nursed with either a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> only, or a postural support nappy only. Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> either with or without a postural support nappy demonstrated improved shoulder posture to term equivalent age.

40|$|The {{zinc coated}} steel sheet has been mostly used for {{automobile}} and other industries {{because of its}} high corrosion resistance. This paper deals {{with the development of}} new ceramics <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> used for a continuous galvanizing pot to manufacture stable galvanizing steel sheet. Usually stainless steel rolls coated by tungsten carbide are used to support and stabilize the strip in a continuous galvanizing pot, which is filled with molten zinc. However, corrosion and abrasion arise on the roll surface only in a few weeks, and causing the deterioration of quality of plating. Although developing all-ceramics rolls is most desirable, risk of fracture has to be reduced when the ceramic roll dips into molten metal. In this paper, therefore, how to reduce the thermal stress is considered when the ceramic rolls are installed in molten metal using finite volume method and finite element method. The usefulness of silicon nitride having extremely high conductivity is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Syfte: Studien syftar till att få fördjupad förståelse för hur stressfaktorer kan påverka individens innovativa beteende positivt. Metod: Studien tillämpar en kvalitativ ansats med semistrukturerade intervjuer. Totalt genomfördes elva intervjuer på Volvo Group Trucks Technology samt en intervju och ett kompletterande samtal med två tidigare anställda. Intervjusvaren har analyserats med tematisk analys Resultat & slutsats: Nio stressfaktorer identifierades vilka skapar stress; krav, tidspress, kontroll, <b>support,</b> <b>roll,</b> kultur, riskvilja, sociala medier och mål. Studien identifierade också fem påverkansfaktorer som kan påverka utvecklingen av positiv stress; personlighet, problemlösande, självledarskap, erfarenhet och motivation. Stressfaktorer i kombination med påverkansfaktorer kan bidra till positiv stress hos individen och leda till ökat innovativt beteende. Förslag till fortsatt forskning: Studien efterfrågar mer kvalitativ forskning på stressfaktorer och innovativt beteende. Stress- och påverkansfaktorer som identifierades i studien bör undersökas vidare. Framtida studier bör även undersöka stressfaktorer i {{relation}} till innovationsbeteendets alla tre faser. Framtida studier bör också inkludera fler kvinnor och vidare forskning på hur organisationer kan organisera för innovation. Uppsatsens bidrag: Studiens främsta bidrag är Modell 2 : Stressors Innovative Development, som visar hur stressfaktorer inverkar på innovativt beteende. Modellen ger stöd till ledare som önskar öka anställdas innovativa beteende, för att öka företagets konkurrenskraft. Modellen ger kunskap om vikten av de personliga förmågorna för att positiv stress ska utvecklas, och påverka det innovativa beteendet positivt. Aim: This study aims {{to provide}} {{a deeper understanding of}} how stressors affect the individual innovative behavior positively. Method: The study applies a qualitative approach with semi structured interviews. In total, eleven interviews were conducted within Volvo Group Trucks Technology and one interview and a complementary conversation with two former employees were carried out. Interview responses have been analyzed with thematic analysis. Result & Conclusions: Nine stress creating stressors were identified; demands, time pressure, control, <b>support,</b> <b>roll,</b> culture, risk appetite, distraction and goals. The study also identified five individual capabilities, which are termed as influencing factors; personality, problem solving, personal responsibility, experience, motivation. The study finds that stress can lead to increased innovative behavior when stressors are combined with influence factors contributing to positive stress in the individual. Suggestions for future research: To further increase the understanding of stressors and innovative behavior, more qualitative research within this field is necessary. Stressors and influencing factors, being identified in this study, should be studied in more detail. Future research should aim to study innovative behavior and stress for all three phases of Innovative Behavior. Further studies within this field should also include more women and research on how organizations can organize for innovation. Contribution of the thesis: The study's main contribution is the Model 2 : Stressors ID, which shows how stressors affect innovative behavior. The model provides support for leaders who wish to enhance employees' innovative behavior to increase the company's competitiveness. The model provides knowledge about the importance of personal capabilities in order for positive stress to evolve and influence the innovative behavior positively...|$|E
40|$|Engineering heat {{transfer}} problems are very often {{of a complex}} nature and most often no analytical solutions exist. One way to create solutions to such problems is to apply numerical methods. This study concerns {{heat transfer}} problems with coupled conduction, convection and thermal radiation. Five important but different engineering problems are considered: 1) The transient temperature distribution in a rotating cylinder which is exposed to a time varying incident heat flux, e. g. a nuclear burst, is determined. The cylinder is cooled by mixed convection and thermal radiation. The effects of the leading parameters, such as rotation speed, the cooling parameters and the physical properties of the shell are studied. 2) The cooling of a roll system which is transporting/casting a thin hot plastic film. The leading roll is heated by the hot film, cooled at the interior by forced convection and on the outside by forced convection, thermal radiation and contact with a <b>support</b> <b>roll.</b> The influence of the cooling parameters and the rotation are studied. 3) The heat and mass diffusion in pre-insulated district heating/cooling pipes. The task {{is to determine the}} effects of the gas mass transport through the casing of the pipes on the thermal behaviour and the effects of condensed water due to the mass diffusion of water vapour. The importance of the density of the casing, the wall thickness of the casing, the thickness of the insulation and the surrounding temperature is revealed. 4) The development of a cooling system for an electrical unit in which a time dependent heat is generated due to the Joule effect. 5) The heat transfer from a rectangular fin in a confined space. The fin is cooled by turbulent forced convection. The turbulence model applied is a low Reynolds k-e-model. Predicted results are compared with experimental ones, and a correlation for the Nusselt number is proposed. The effects of thermal radiation for non-participating as well as participating media are considered...|$|E

40|$|The prone {{position}} is used routinely in {{neonatal intensive care}} units worldwide in the nursing of preterm infants because of reported beneficial psychological effects This position can, however, lead to development of flattened posture very low birthweight (VLBW) infants and contributes to both short and longer term implications for functional motor development of upper and lower extremities. To date limited research has been undertaken to investigate methods of reducing flattened posture and its related negative outcomes temperature instability is also a problem for VLBW infants and no nappy exists that meets postural size and thermoregulation requirements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate the effect of a nursing care model designed for the primary prevention of neuromotor problems and temperature instability in VLBW infants. The theoretical framework was based on two bodies of knowledge thermoregulation and neuromotor development. A two phase study was used to test two hypotheses: (1) use of a cloth postural support nappy (N) with an inner absorbent nappy liner would improve temperature stability in VLBW infants nursed in incubators on infant servo control (ISC) : and (2) use of a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> (R) with or without a N would improve neuromotor development in the short and longer term. In Phase 1 a sample of 23 infants 3 ̆c 31 weeks gestation nursed in incubators on ISC was recruited over two months to a randomised, observer blind, crossover trial infants were randomised to commence wearing either a N with or without an inner absorbent liner and alternated wearing each nappy for a 24 hour period over four days. Eight hourly per axilla (PA) temperatures and hourly measurements of infant handling, skin and incubator temperatures were recorded. lnfants in both groups were well matched for birth and postnatal variables. Findings showed that nursing infants in a N with an inner absorbent liner experienced clinically and statistically significant higher skin and lower incubator temperatures. In addition, a prediction model for PA temperature was developed that showed it was possible to predict PA temperatures from skin temperatures. In Phase 2. a sample of 123 infants 3 ̆c 31 weeks gestation was recruited to a randomised, observer blind, controlled trial. Infants were randomised to one of three treatment groups (i. e., N only, N and R, or R only). Measurements of neuromotor development were performed at three assessment periods (i. e., from birth to term conceptional age, then at four and eight months conceptional age). Randomisation was effective. Findings confirmed previous study findings that use of a N improves hip posture up to term conceptional age. The major finding was that use of a R while VLBW infants are nursed in the {{prone position}} in a NICU improved hip and shoulder posture up to eight months conceptional age. In addition, an Infant Posture Evaluation Tool (IPAT) was developed that will enhance the clinical skills of health Professionals involved in the care of these infants. The findings contribute to neonatal nursing theory development in thermoregulation and neuromotor development and function in VLBW infants. Practice implications focus on promoting temperature stability and normal neuromotor function in VLBW infants up until eight months conceptional age. Longer term research will determine the effect of postural interventions on gait and foot progression angles. Testing and validation of the IPAT will facilitate future research related to infant posture...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of longitudinal off-corner depressions or “gutters ” in continuous-cast steel slabs {{has been investigated}} using coupled finite-element models. Thermal-mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has been simulated as it moves down through the mold and upper <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> in the spray chamber. The calculation includes solidification, intermittent gap formation, plastic creep, bulging due to ferrostatic pressure, interaction with the mold and rolls, and phase transformations. The effects of turbulent flow in the liquid pool, flow and melting of the powder layers, superheat dissipation, taper, and thermal distortion of the mold walls are accounted for using separate models. Together, these models illustrate a multi-stage mechanism for gutter formation. The problem starts with a hot, thin region down the off-corner wide face. This {{may be caused by}} locally-inadequate liquid powder feeding, or by insufficient taper of the upper portion of the narrow face mold walls, allowing corner rotation within the mold. Depressions may then be created by excessive taper, buckling the thin shell near mold exit. Alternatively, they may evolve during bulging between <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> below the mold, due to bending of the thin off-corner region. The results suggest that the problem can be avoided by optimizing the mold flow pattern and powder properties to obtai...|$|R
