5|$|In many {{bivalves}} {{that have}} siphons, {{they can be}} retracted back into {{the safety of the}} shell. If the siphons inadvertently get attacked by a predator, they <b>snap</b> <b>off.</b> The animal can regenerate them later, a process that starts when the cells close to the damaged site become activated and remodel the tissue back to its pre-existing form and size.|$|E
5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will <b>snap</b> <b>off.</b> The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

25|$|Orangutans (genus Pongo) {{were first}} {{observed}} using {{tools in the}} wild in 1994 in {{the northwest corner of}} Sumatra. As with the chimpanzees, orangutans use tools made from branches and leaves to scratch, scrape, wipe, sponge, swat, fan, hook, probe, scoop, pry, chisel, hammer, cover, cushion and amplify. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30cm long, <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. Sumatran orangutans use a variety of tools—up to 54 types for extracting insects or honey, and as many as 20 types for opening or preparing fruits such as the hard to access Neesia Malayana. They also use an 'autoerotic tool'—a stick which they use to stimulate the genitals and masturbate (both male and female). In parts of Borneo, orangutans use handfuls of leaves as napkins to wipe their chins while orangutans in parts of Sumatra use leaves as gloves, helping them handle spiny fruits and branches, or as seat cushions in spiny trees. There have been reports that individuals in both captivity and in the wild use tools held between the lips or teeth, rather than in the hands. In captivity, orangutans have been taught to chip stone handaxes.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots next drive spanned {{into the}} second quarter. A 30-yard Welker {{reception}} put the Patriots in the Raiders' red zone; two plays later, Cassel hit Welker on a 13-yard touchdown catch to bring the Patriots' lead to 28–7. The catch was Welker's 100th of the season, making him the eighth player in NFL history to record back-to-back 100-catch seasons. However, Justin Miller returned the ensuing kickoff 91 {{yards for a touchdown}}, cutting the Patriots lead to 28–14. Hobbs responded by returning the very next kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown of his own, increasing the Patriots' advantage to 21 points, 35–14. The Raiders could not advance past their own 38-yard line on their next drive and Lechler punted to the Patriots' 20-yard line. The Patriots eventually reached the Raiders' 43-yard line on 3rd-and-2, but Cassel was intercepted by safety Gibril Wilson at the Raiders' 21-yard line; Wilson returned the interception 5 yards. Four plays into their ensuing possession the Raiders reached Patriots territory {{for the first time in}} the game on a 23-yard catch by Miller. However, two plays later, Russell was intercepted by Patriots cornerback Jonathan Wilhite at the Patriots' 1-yard line; a 16-yard return brought the Patriots to their 17-yard line. With just under three minutes left in the half, the Patriots moved into Raiders territory with help from a 23-yard Faulk run and a 19-yard Faulk catch. However, Cassel was sacked on a 1st-and-10 from the Raiders' 13-yard line, and without any timeouts, Cassel was forced to spike the ball with 29 seconds left. On the spike, the Patriots were called for an illegal shift after Gaffney was not set at the snap; a 10-second clock run-off ensued, and the Patriots were unable to get a field goal <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> in time before the end of the half.|$|E

2500|$|The {{location}} of the accident {{and the fact that}} it took place two months and one day after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan initially spawned fears of another terrorist attack. [...] Terrorism was officially ruled out as the cause by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which instead attributed the disaster to the first officer's overuse of rudder controls in response to wake turbulence, or jet wash, from a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 that took off minutes before it. According to the NTSB, this aggressive use of the rudder controls by the co-pilot caused the vertical stabilizer to <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> the plane. The plane's two engines also separated from the aircraft before it hit the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The Tanith uniform is black, with {{optional}} helmets {{for standard}} troopers and forage caps for the regiment's elite scout platoon. Camo-cloaks (made {{of the fictional}} material [...] "cameleoline") are standard. Every soldier has a long, double-edged bayonet/combat blade the Tanith call Straight Silver. Their favoured special weapons include long-las sniper rifles and flame throwers, and portable missile launchers the Tanith nickname [...] "tread fethers". The cap badge for the Tanith is a wreath-surrounded skull with three daggers behind it; each dagger representing a Tanith regiment. On the badge is the inscription [...] "For Tanith, For the Emperor". After {{the destruction of the}} Tanith 2nd and 3rd regiments, the Tanith <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> the two outside daggers on their cap badges. The Verghastite cap badge is an axe-rake to symbolise their former hive's mining and industrial background.|$|E
2500|$|Another weight-saving concept the {{designers}} {{came up with}} was detachable wingtips. The wings were designed to fold at a point about [...] out along the span, reducing the space taken up on the carrier. Normally the hinge system {{would have to be}} built very strong in order to transmit loads from the outer portions of the wing to the main spar in the inner section, which adds considerable weight. Instead of building the entire wing to be able to withstand high-g loads, only the inner portion of the wing was able to do this. The outer portions were more lightly constructed, and designed to <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> at the hinge line if the g-force exceeded 7.5g. In this case the aircraft would still be flyable and could be repaired after returning to the carrier. This saved [...] of weight.|$|E

60|$|At {{that moment}} an {{accident}} occurred which decided {{the question for}} them.

This propensity is so well-known to Californian travellers that they are somewhat careful in selecting their camping ground, yet, despite all their care, an occasional life is lost by the falling of such branches.|$|E

60|$|The sea on {{the lagoon}} went swiftly {{down with the}} change of wind, but they were {{beginning}} to feel the heave and lift of the outer sea breaking across the atoll.

6000|$|So saying, he leapt on to {{the deck}} of the schooner, and Turnbull's voice was at once heard {{shouting}} the order, [...] "Haul aft the weather sheets of the jibs;" [...] and in a minute the two vessels were gliding away from each other on opposite tacks. Then the Arrow was brought round and followed the Thames, which {{was the name of the}} merchantman. The brigantine was now three quarters of a mile away. Suddenly she was seen to change her course.

60|$|And he {{remained}} wrathful and distinct from her, unchanged outwardly to her, but underneath a solid power of antagonism to her. Of which she became gradually aware.

He walked about for days stiffened with resistance to her, stiff with a will to destroy her as she was. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, there was connection between them again. It came on him as he was working in the fields.
