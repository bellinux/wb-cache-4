25|$|Omni I: Manufactured from {{approximately}} 1980–1986. Self-loading pistol, original design with Browning 1935-type locked breech, in 45 ACP with single column seven-round magazine. Numerous modern {{features such as}} de-cocker <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
25|$|Llama XIX: Manufactured from 1954 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, {{blowback}} operation, miniature copy of Colt 1911 in 9mm corto/.380 ACP with grip safety. Also had {{a longer}} manual <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b> Identical to Llama III-A except for lighter weight aluminium alloy frame.|$|E
25|$|Llama Micro-Max: Manufactured {{from early}} 1996's to 2005. Self-loading pistol, blow-back operation, {{miniature}} version of Colt 1911-A1 in 9mm corto/.380 ACP (7-round capacity) and 7.65mm/.32 ACP (8-round capacity). Extended <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> rounded hammer. Matt black finish only. Replacement for Llama III-A. Also available in high polished chrome.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} method of {{carrying}} grenades was by straps on the ammo pouches. Soldiers also commonly hung grenades on their persons using the <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> {{although it is}} said that [...] "official policy forbade the practice as unsafe." ...|$|R
25|$|The DS {{models are}} double action only pistols: the hammer doesn't stay cocked. Therefore the hammer spur has been removed, and is {{flush with the}} rear of the slide. The <b>safety</b> <b>levers</b> serve as manual safeties only and have no {{decocking}} feature..|$|R
50|$|The P30S, P30LS and P30SKS {{variants}} feature {{an optional}} external ambidextrous thumb safety. This manual safety {{is available for}} most trigger variants. The variants with the optional external ambidextrous thumb safety have similar dimensions compared to the variants without this feature, but weigh approximately 50 g more and the <b>safety</b> <b>levers</b> add 3.66 mm width resulting in an overall width of 38.46 mm.|$|R
25|$|Llama M-82: Manufactured from 1986 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, {{original}} design with Beretta falling-block type locked breech, in 9mm Parabellum with double-stack 15-round magazine. Numerous modern {{features such as}} ambidextrous de-cocker <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> magazine safety, reversible magazine release. Best reliability with NATO specification ball ammunition. Adopted by Spanish Military in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, it {{has become}} popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as {{increase}} corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod which is now also fluted, magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> trigger, and magazine release button.|$|E
25|$|Llama III-A: Manufactured from 1954 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, {{blowback}} operation (earlier models up {{to about}} 1975: locked breech), miniature copy of Colt 1911 in 9mm corto/.380 ACP with seven-round magazine and with grip safety. Also fitted with longer manual <b>safety</b> <b>lever.</b> Early models fitted with lanyard ring; later models replaced this with a ventilated rib and plastic target grips. Luxury finishes (including gold plating) and various engraving options were available. One {{of the most successful}} models in the Llama range.|$|E
25|$|The Llama M-87 was {{introduced}} in 1986. This was a high-grade competition pistol based on M-82 with extended barrel, compensator, muzzle weight, target sights, target trigger, additional manual safety, extended magazine release, extended <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> beveled magazine well, and two-tone finish (chrome with blued slide). Despite the high price, (Retail $US1,450) the M-87 was greeted with excellent reviews on release. However the glowing reviews were unable to overcome distrust of so many innovations on such an expensive gun.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{infantry}} support {{weapon was}} the 7.62×51mm belt-fed FN MAG. Soldiers also carried {{a variety of}} hand grenades including high-explosive (HE), white-phosphorus (WP), and colored smoke. To prevent accidental ignition of a grenade, the <b>safety</b> <b>levers</b> which upon release activated the fuse of the grenade, were taped down. Soldiers were issued HE and WP rifle grenades as well as anti-tank grenades or rockets. Sometimes [...] "bunker bombs" [...] were carried. [...] Machine-gunners and some riflemen carried sidearms.|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} No. 4 Mk I, Britain had {{obviously}} {{settled on the}} rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop {{in place of the}} sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached {{to the rear of the}} nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922–1924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a “V”.|$|E
500|$|The Type 94 pistol is {{operated}} by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James [...] D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of {{to the rear of}} the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. [...] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the [...] pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.|$|E

5000|$|The Special Edition P90 was {{produced}} for Davidson Firearms by Ruger. The Davidson Special Edition P89/P90 gun featured a carbon-steel slide, a matte gray receiver (i.e., the OEM one normally {{provided to the}} stainless-steel guns), and stainless-steel accents (trigger, <b>safety</b> <b>levers),</b> and, {{if it was a}} [...] "TH" [...] variant, the Hogue fingergroove rubber grips with the Ruger logo. The guns came in a Special Edition colored and labeled polymer box. While similarly priced to the stock P90, they only included one magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Bicycles with drop {{handlebars}} {{may have}} more than one brake lever for each brake to facilitate braking from multiple hand positions. Levers that allow the rider to work the brakes from the tops of the bars, introduced in the '70s, are called extension <b>levers,</b> <b>safety</b> <b>levers</b> [...] or, for their reputation for being unable to actuate the full range of travel of the main brake lever, suicide levers. Modern top-mounted brake levers, called interrupt brake levers, use an entirely different method of actuation and are considered safer.|$|R
2500|$|The FS {{models are}} Double-action/Single-action (DA/SA) pistols; {{they have an}} initial {{double-action}} trigger pull subsequently followed by single-action operation. The [...] "FS" [...] models have a <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> that also functions as a decocking lever.|$|E
2500|$|... : Locally {{manufactured}} {{version with}} frame-mounted <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> {{placed on the}} right side of the frame as required by the Mexican government, known as the P7M13S, created under license in 1983 by the Departamento de la Industria Militar (Military Industry Department) of the Dirección General de Fábricas de la Defensa.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] models {{feature the}} {{following}} parts made in stainless steel: [...] the barrel, the slide (including the extractor, {{the safety and}} the right-side manual <b>safety</b> <b>lever),</b> the trigger, the trigger pin, and slide stop lever. The aluminum frame is anodized to match the color. Can have either black or stainless controls.|$|E
2500|$|The 92SB, {{initially}} called 92S-1, {{was specifically}} designed for the USAF trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the 92SB. Features added include a firing pin block (thus {{the addition of the}} [...] "B" [...] to the name), ambidextrous <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> 3-dot sights, and relocated the magazine release catch {{from the bottom of the}} grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard. The later relocation of the magazine release button means preceding models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas.|$|R
50|$|A three-position safety {{attached}} at {{the rear}} of the bolt which operating lever can be flicked from right (safety on, bolt locked) to middle (safety on, bolt can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire), but only when the rifle is cocked; otherwise, the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The <b>safety</b> catch <b>lever</b> is quite large, making it easy to operate, but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the <b>safety</b> catch <b>lever.</b>|$|R

25|$|Early P85 pistols were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} issue {{that resulted in}} one accidental discharge. If the firing pin broke {{in front of the}} firing pin block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken firing pin to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between firing pin and hammer during a decocking operation. This modification was done free of charge. The P85 MKII was released with the safety fix, larger <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> improved accuracy, and the option of a stainless-steel slide.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2009, SIG Sauer {{issued a}} recall of all P238s sold {{within a certain}} serial number range, which they {{referred}} to as a [...] "Mandatory Safety Upgrade". The reason stated for the recall is that a small number of P238s were built with defective manual <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> leading to [...] "the remote possibility that the gun could fire unintentionally, thus creating a risk of injury or death", although SIG Sauer emphasized that no such injuries had actually occurred. [...] According to SIG Sauer, the recall did not affect any pistols with a serial number that started with [...] "27Axxxxx".|$|R
25|$|The P345, {{released}} in 2004, incorporates an integrated keyed lock that locks the {{safety in the}} safe position, a loaded chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect that blocks the firing pin when the magazine is removed. It also has many ergonomic improvements, such as a new polymer frame design (narrower than the double column derived P90 and P97) and low-profile <b>safety</b> <b>levers.</b> It does not feature an ambidextrous slide release or magazine release. Both controls are designed for a right-handed shooter. The model P345PR adds a Picatinny rail to the frame, for mounting lights and other accessories. It {{was designed to be}} legal for sale in states that require elaborate safety measures.|$|R
2500|$|Produced by Beistegui Hermanos in Eibar, Spain, {{this was}} the first pseudo-Mauser on the market, a {{relatively}} crude semi-auto appearing in 1926 and full-auto variants appearing in 1927. Mechanically, it was laid out approximately like the Mauser original, but without the removable lock frame. Internal parts (trigger, hammer, <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> etc.) pivoted on pins and screws extending through the frame. The screws also held the frame together. The bolt was of round cross-section, unlike the square Mauser bolt. The weapon was stamped with either [...] "Royal" [...] or [...] "ETAI".|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the dining}} room the {{terrorist}} put on displays of power to cower the hostages, menacing them with their machine guns, pulling the pins from their grenades but keeping the <b>safety</b> <b>lever</b> depressed. They had two of the women hostages hold the live grenades, causing the worry that if they fell asleep the safety levels would detach causing an explosion. The hijackers veered erratically from politeness to barbarity – one moment one would wash a cup for a hostage to use, the next a hijacker would ram a gun stock into Mrs. Klinghoffer to force her from the floor, then a hijacker would escort a captive to her cabin to change out of a wet swimsuit. The hijackers also tried to engage in some political persuasion, telling the hostages [...] "Reagan no good, Arafat good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1995, the Llama Mini-Max was introduced. It was {{produced}} in [...] 9mm Parabellum and 38 Super (8-round capacity), [...]40 S (7-round capacity) and [...]45 ACP (6-round capacity) with a 3.7-inch barrel. The overall length was 7.3 inches and the height 5.1 inches. Designed for concealed carry, it featured an extended <b>safety</b> <b>lever,</b> rounded hammer, Swartz safety, 3-dot sight, checkered neoprene grips and contoured trigger-guard. {{the use of a}} flared muzzle eliminated the traditional Llama barrel bushing and made disassemby easier. Standard 1911-type magazines could be used in the [...]45 ACP model, increasing capacity by one or two rounds. A wide range of finishes were available including matte blue, satin chrome, and two-tone. Initial reviews were disappointing citing mediocre accuracy and occasional malfunctions, but these may be related to quality control issues and ammunition choice rather than design failure.|$|E
2500|$|The 5906 is a full-sized, double/single-action, staggered-column magazine, 9×19mm pistol. Its {{construction}} is all stainless steel. The 5906 {{is equipped with}} a magazine disconnect feature which is designed to deactivate the trigger if the magazine is not fully inserted. The pistol comes standard with either a 10- or 15-round magazine. Other features include ambidextrous <b>safety</b> <b>levers,</b> a one-piece rear wraparound grip, and a choice of either fixed sights or a rear sight fully adjustable for windage and elevation. A popular model with law enforcement and military units in the United States, the 5906 is nevertheless being replaced by lighter, polymer-framed models from Glock, Heckler & Koch, SIG Sauer as well as Smith & Wesson's own M line of polymer framed handguns in both 9mm and [...]40 calibers.|$|R
50|$|Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori {{converted}} 5,300 specially selected m/1896 long rifles to m/1941 sniper rifles in 1941-1943. The {{bolt handle}} of all m/1941 rifles was turned-down {{in order to}} provide clearance for unimpaired operation of the bolt handle or three-position <b>safety</b> catch <b>lever</b> with a telescopic sight mounted.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark I, {{which is}} no longer produced, was offered with a steel, {{stainless}} steel or aluminum alloy frame and differs primarily in {{the size and shape}} of the <b>safety</b> <b>levers</b> and slide catch. The Mark VII includes an adjustable trigger (retrofittable to Mark I pistols). The Mark I and VII are both available in [...]357 Magnum and [...]44 Magnum; the Mark VII has been chambered for [...]41 Magnum. The barrels had a [...] " [...] dovetail, to which an accessory mount could be attached. Later Mark VII models were offered in [...]50 Action Express with a [...] " [...] Weaver-pattern rail on the barrel; the [...]50 Mark VII would later become the Mark XIX. Barrel lengths were 6, 10, and 14 inches for [...]357 Magnum and [...]44 Magnum, but only 6 or 10 inches for [...]41 Magnum.|$|R
