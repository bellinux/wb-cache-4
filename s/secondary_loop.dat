40|$|When the {{shear stress}} {{measured}} in large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) deformation is {{represented as a}} 2 -D Lissajous–Bowditch curve, the corresponding trajectory can appear to self-intersect and form <b>secondary</b> <b>loops.</b> This self-intersection is a general consequence of a strongly nonlinear material response to the imposed oscillatory forcing and can be observed for various material systems and constitutive models. We derive the mathematical criteria {{for the formation of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>loops,</b> quantify the location of the apparent intersection, and furthermore suggest a qualitative physical understanding for the associated nonlinear material behavior. We show that when <b>secondary</b> <b>loops</b> appear in the viscous projection of the stress response (the 2 -D plot of stress vs. strain rate), they are best interpreted by understanding the corresponding elastic response (the 2 -D projection of stress vs. strain). The analysis shows clearly that sufficiently strong elastic nonlinearity is required to observe <b>secondary</b> <b>loops</b> on the conjugate viscous projection. Such a strong elastic nonlinearity physically corresponds to a nonlinear viscoelastic shear stress overshoot in which existing stress is unloaded more quickly than new deformation is accumulated. This general understanding of <b>secondary</b> <b>loops</b> in LAOS flows can be applied to various molecular configurations and microstructures such as polymer solutions, polymer melts, soft glassy materials, and other structured fluids...|$|R

25|$|A BWR {{is like a}} PWR {{without the}} steam generator. A boiling water reactor is cooled and moderated by water like a PWR, but at a lower {{pressure}}, which allows the water to boil inside the pressure vessel producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>loop.</b> The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, {{and they can be}} simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{potential}} molecules that could form the first hypercycles in nature prompted {{the idea of}} coupling an information carrier function with enzymatic properties. At {{the time of the}} hypercycle theory formulation, enzymatic properties were attributed only to proteins, while nucleic acids were recognized only as carriers of information. This led to the formulation of a more complex model of a hypercycle with translation. The proposed model consists of a number of nucleotide sequences I (I stands for intermediate) and the same number of polypeptide chains E (E stands for enzyme). Sequences I have a limited chain length and carry the information necessary to build catalytic chains E. The sequence I'i provides the matrix to reproduce itself and a matrix to build the protein E'i. The protein E'i gives the catalytic support to build the next sequence in the cycle, I'i+1. The self-replicating sequences I form a cycle consisting of positive and negative strands that periodically reproduce themselves. Therefore, many cycles of the +/− nucleotide collectives are linked together by the second-order cycle of enzymatic properties of E, forming a catalytic hypercycle. Without the <b>secondary</b> <b>loop</b> provided by catalysis, I chains would compete and select against each other instead of cooperating. The reproduction is possible thanks to translation and polymerization functions encoded in I chains. In his principal work, Manfred Eigen stated that the E coded by the I chain can be a specific polymerase or an enhancer (or a silencer) of a more general polymerase acting in favour of formation of the successor of nucleotide chain I. Later, he indicated that a general polymerase leads to the death of the system. Moreover, the whole cycle must be closed, so that E'n must catalyse I1 formation for some integer n > 1.|$|E
25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a <b>secondary</b> <b>loop</b> coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the {{analysis}} of M 1. 8 class (GOES SXR) limb flare and associated post flare loops of 2 May, 2001 which erupted on the west limb in NOAA 9433 (N 15, W 88). The flare started at around 00 : 32 UT from a small mound of twisted loops. When we started Hct. observations at 0052 UT the flare was in decay phase enveloped by highly shearedltwisted post flare loops which we call as primary post flare loops. The unique feature of this flare was that {{a new system of}} loops were developed when the primary loops were almost decaying. We call these newly formed <b>loops</b> as <b>secondary</b> <b>loops.</b> The main aim of the paper is to study the dynamics of the Ha flarelpost flare loops and to understand how the magnetic field gets relaxed from highly shearedltwisted stage to a simplified potential field.

The post flare condensation and formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>loops</b> has also been studied in this paper. The flare was also associated with SXR, HXR and IvIW emissions...|$|R

30|$|Load {{frequency}} control (LFC) of conventional power systems is performed {{with three different}} control loops [2, 3], which <b>loops</b> are primary, <b>secondary</b> and tertiary control loops. The primary control loop provides active power balance, and the <b>secondary</b> control <b>loop</b> minimizes the steady-state error in the control loop frequency formed {{at the end of}} the primary control loop. The tertiary control loop is the central loop that regulates the system frequency error and includes measures performed by verbal instructions in case primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>loops</b> are insufficient. Linear models including primary and <b>secondary</b> control <b>loops</b> are suggested to analyze the {{frequency control}} of the systems [3, 4, 5]. However, there is also a time delay caused by phasor measurement units (PMUs) as well as communication links. The time delay affects performances of these control loops in the power systems and it is approximately in the range of 5 – 15  s [4, 6]. Also the time delay may reduce the damping performance of the control system and even cause the instability if it exceeds the delay margin [7, 8, 9]. In fact, this value is the delay time which makes the system marginally stable. Therefore, the time delay must be considered for both analysis and design of a power system. For this purpose, linear models including time delay have been proposed [3, 4, 5].|$|R

50|$|Most {{installed}} {{systems have}} two loops {{on the ground}} side: the primary refrigerant loop is contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary water loop that is buried underground. The <b>secondary</b> <b>loop</b> is typically made of high-density polyethylene pipe and contains a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol). Monopropylene glycol has the least damaging potential when it might leak into the ground, and is therefore the only allowed anti-freeze in ground sources in {{an increasing number of}} European countries. After leaving the internal heat exchanger, the water flows through the <b>secondary</b> <b>loop</b> outside the building to exchange heat with the ground before returning. The <b>secondary</b> <b>loop</b> is placed below the frost line where the temperature is more stable, or preferably submerged in a body of water if available.
