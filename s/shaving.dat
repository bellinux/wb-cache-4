5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several <b>shaving</b> razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, <b>shaving</b> bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Competition with gizzard <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} survival of larval bluegills Lepomis macrochirus as well as growth and size structure of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, which prey on these planktivorous species. However, little is known about how the presence of gizzard <b>shad</b> influences bluegills beyond the larval stage. We examined bluegill–gizzard <b>shad</b> interactions across 10 reservoirs with and 10 without gizzard <b>shad</b> to de-termine direct and indirect effects of gizzard <b>shad</b> on bluegill population size structure. In the presence of gizzard <b>shad,</b> bluegills exhibited smaller adult (. 3 years old) size structure. Benthic invertebrate densities were higher in non-gizzard <b>shad</b> reservoirs, which may have contributed to increased bluegill growth in these systems. In contrast, zooplankton densities were similar in reservoirs with and without gizzard <b>shad.</b> Turbidity was higher in reservoirs with gizzard <b>shad,</b> which may have reduced foraging success and growth of bluegill. Finally, higher bluegill densities occurred in reservoirs with gizzard <b>shad,</b> which may have resulted from decreased largemouth bass predation due to gizzard <b>shad</b> availability as alternative prey. These results demonstrate that the presence of gizzard <b>shad</b> is associated with reduced bluegill growth rates and adult size structure and that mechanisms other than direct competition for food resources may be responsible. Gizzard <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum is a com-mon freshwater fish species that can predominate fish biomass in many central and southern U. S. reservoirs (Johnson et al. 1988; DeVries and Stein 1992; Stein et al. 1995). Occupying an interme-diate trophic level, gizzard <b>shad</b> can have tremen-dous influence on reservoir systems through middle-out community regulation (Stein et al. 1995).

5|$|While Roman and Celtic Christianity {{were very}} similar in {{doctrine}} and both accepted ultimate papal authority, there were differences in practice.

In addition scholars have identified significant characteristics of the organisation of Irish and Scottish Christianity as relaxed ideas of clerical celibacy, intense secularisation of ecclesiastical institutions, and the lack of a diocesan structure.

5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity.

Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{skipjack}} <b>shad</b> (Alosa chrysochloris) is a North American, migratory, fresh- and {{brackish water}} fish {{species in the}} herring family Clupeidae.

Skipjack <b>shad</b> are found in clear to moderately turbid water in areas with flow. Because they are a migratory species, dams often impede their reproduction. Records suggest that this species was much more abundant in the Upper Mississippi River basin before it was impounded. Currently, the skipjack <b>shad</b> is most abundant in the Upper Mississippi River below the mouth of the Ohio River. They are known as an “early-run” species as they migrate to spawn in the early spring.|$|R

Because relative timing of appearance of <b>shad</b> and bluegills probably influences their relative success, we quantified densities of fish larvae and zooplankton during spring through summer in three reservoirs across 8 years (1987 – 1994), and we conducted three hatchery experiments with varying larval appearance times and gizzard <b>shad</b> densities {{in plastic bags}} (1 m 3). When <b>shad</b> were abundant in reservoirs, bluegill abundance often peaked either {{at the same time}} (36 % of reservoirs and years combined) or after (40 % of reservoirs and years combined) <b>shad</b> peaks.
