Microzonation provides the basis for site-specific risk analysis, which can assist in the mitigation of earthquake damage. In most general terms, seismic microzonation is the process of estimating the response of soil layers under earthquake excitations and thus the variation of earthquake characteristics on the ground surface.|$|R

Therefore, in addition to developing an electronic circuit to implement HPS, this work designs a sliding mode control (SMC) for synchronizing the state trajectories of two horizontal platform systems, subsequently allowing us to easily understand the HPS, perform more detailed analysis, and achieve further control. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the HPS by the proposed electronic circuit system. Comparing the proposed electronic circuitry designs and the HPS of computer simulation reveals {{that the results of}} the non-linear dynamic behavior correlate well with each other. Finally, based on use of the control technology, master-slave chaos synchronization with sliding mode control is achieved by wireless sensors...|$|R
5000|$|A column or pillar in {{architecture}} and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, {{the weight of}} the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind <b>or</b> <b>earthquake</b> <b>engineering,</b> columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed [...] "columns" [...] because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, [...] "column" [...] refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are [...] "engaged", that is to say form part of a wall.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The article {{considers}} the Earth crust blocks {{interaction with the}} use of Newton’s Pendulum. In order to demonstrate various states of geological environment block models affected by external influence the blocks system movement modeling at different contacts (rift model) has been carried out. Rotational and oscillatory movements of blocks conducts to the problem of nonlinear mathematical pendulum oscillation. The nonlinear equation of motion allows multisoliton solutions {{in the form of a}} kink and a breather. Interaction of nonlinear waves leads to further displacement of the unit and to excessive strain on the blocks borders. External influence leads to two types of disintegration of the system either in the form of <b>seismic</b> response (<b>earthquake)</b> <b>or</b> in the form of aftershock process. Long-term weak impact on the rock mass may initiate a strong <b>earthquake</b> <b>or</b> modulate the real seismic process.

40|$|Abstract Improving {{seismic hazard}} {{mitigation}} of the densely populated metropol-itan area of {{and around the}} capital of Taiwan requires detailed knowledge of the 3 D crustal structure of Taipei basin. The high levels of ambient noise and the low levels of regional seismicity of this region complicate investigations of crustal structure with traditional <b>seismic</b> exploration <b>or</b> <b>earthquake</b> tomography methods. We investigate the shallow crust in the metropolitan region using surface wave array tomography with time domain empirical Green’s function (TDEGF) inferred from correlation of ambient seismic noise. Analysis of the TDEGF amplitudes suggests that the dominant sources of ambient seismic noise are the coastlines and shallow continental shelf of the Taiwan Strait, northwest of the study region. Our study demonstrates that ambient seismic noise tomography is feasible at periods of 0. 5 – 3 s, which is much shorter than the 10 – 30 s used in most other studies, and which opens new opportunities for high resolution studies of near-surface heterogeneity. The lateral variation in Rayleigh wave phase velocity correlates well with surface geology and suggests that faults {{play an important role}} in the regional tectonic setting. High phase velocities mark the Tatun volcanic area, the Kuanyin Mountain dominated by Quaternary igneous rock, and the Miocene Western Foothills south of the Taipei fault. Low phase velocities characterize regions are along western and southeastern edges of the Taipei basin and the Pleis-tocene Linkou tableland. Main faults in the region are either marked by low phase velocities or define transitions between regions of high- and low-velocity anomalies...|$|R

25|$|<b>Earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall {{goal is to}} make such structures more resistant to <b>earthquakes.</b> An <b>earthquake</b> (<b>or</b> <b>seismic)</b> engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major <b>earthquake.</b> <b>Earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.|$|R
