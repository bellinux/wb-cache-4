5|$|One of Celtic's most {{important}} players, striker Joe McBride was {{to miss the}} match. He had suffered a long-term knee injury and his last match of the season was on 24 December 1966. McBride would definitely have played had he been fit. He was in <b>such</b> <b>good</b> form for Celtic that, despite missing half the season, McBride finished as the top scorer in Scotland that year with 35 goals in 26 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have <b>such</b> <b>good</b> chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in <b>such</b> <b>good</b> condition.|$|E

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have <b>such</b> <b>good</b> storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
25|$|Since Fourier series have <b>such</b> <b>good</b> {{convergence}} properties, {{many are}} often surprised {{by some of}} the negative results. For example, the Fourier series of a continuous T-periodic function need not converge pointwise. The uniform boundedness principle yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact.|$|E
25|$|Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{were able}} to do this by {{exceptionally}} good chemistry, fantastically good chemistry, which was way ahead of what any one else was capable of at that time. The Americans learned to do it later. But at that time, Hahn and Strassmann were really the only ones who could do it. And that was because they were <b>such</b> <b>good</b> chemists. Somehow they really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a physical process.|$|E

25|$|Electrotype {{was also}} used to {{manufacture}} matrices {{that could be used}} as moulds for individual pieces of metal type. This had several advantages over traditional punchcutting in hard steel: the type master only needed to be carved out of soft metal, and was also useful for large sizes of type, since it was hard to drive large punches into a matrix effectively. It cut the cost of decorative types that would not be used so often as body text typefaces. On the other hand, it gave no steel punch {{that could be used to}} create multiple matrices quickly, and was reported to not always give <b>such</b> <b>good</b> results as steel punchcutting.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese brought beer to Colonial Korea in the 1930s in {{the form}} of German lager beers. After WWII and independence, until at least 1960, all beer in North Korea was {{produced}} domestically. By the 1980s, beer was in <b>such</b> <b>good</b> availability that the common North Korean could drink it. Until the mid-1990s when the state rationing system started to crumble, North Koreans would receive one bottle of Korean liquor soju and three bottles of beer for every major public holiday in North Korea. All North Korean beers are bottled in domestic made glass bottles that are of poor quality. During the North Korean famine, beer bottles were used for intravenous therapy (IV) due to the shortage of proper hospital equipment.|$|E
25|$|Container deposit {{legislation}} involves {{offering a}} refund {{for the return}} of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate. Despite <b>such</b> <b>good</b> results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas. A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, the Swedish Air Force {{purchased}} {{its first}} batch of 70 FB1 Vampires, having {{been looking for}} a jet-powered fighter to replace its outdated SAAB 21 and J 22 aircraft of its fighter force. In Swedish service, the Vampire received the designation J 28A, it was assigned to the F 13 Norrköping Wing. The type soon provided <b>such</b> <b>good</b> service that the Vampire was soon selected to serve as the backbone of the fighter force. In 1949, a total of 310 of the more modern FB.50s, designated J28B, which were based on the Vampire FB.5, were procured. The last of these was delivered in 1952, after which all piston-engined fighters were decommissioned. In addition, a total of 57 two-seater DH 115 Vampires, designated J28C, were also used for training purposes.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become <b>such</b> <b>good</b> friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|An almost {{inaccessible}} cave, dubbed Yoram Cave, {{located on}} the sheer southern cliff face 100 m below the plateau, {{has been found to}} contain numerous plant remains, of which 6,000-year-old barley seeds were in <b>such</b> <b>good</b> state of preservation that their genome could be sequenced. This {{is the first time that}} this succeeded with a Chalcolithic plant genome, which is also the oldest one sequenced so far. The result helped determine that the earliest domestication of barley, dated elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent to 10,000 years ago, happened further north up the Jordan Rift Valley, namely in the Upper Jordan Valley in northern Israel. The Yoram Cave seeds were found to be fairly different from the wild variety, proof for an already advanced process of domestication, but very similar to the types of barley still cultivated in the region - an indication for remarkable constancy. Considering the difficulty in reaching the cave, whose mouth opens some 4 m above the exposed access path, the researchers have speculated that it was a place of short-term refuge for Chalcolithic people fleeing an unknown catastrophe.|$|E

25|$|In a 2004 episode, TC watched an NBC ad for Days of Our Lives on his TV, {{and went}} on to praise the writers of Days of our Lives for coming up with <b>such</b> <b>good</b> storylines; Days, at that time, was under the helm of James E. Reilly, head writer of Passions. In the September 4, 2006, episode, Fox was sucked into a black hole; he then told Tabitha that {{it was the kind of}} black hole that one gets sucked into on the Sci Fi Channel, which was the channel on which Passions repeats aired in 2006. Tabitha then told him stick with NBC (Passions network). In an episode later in September 2006, Siren tried to get Miguel into bed by singing her Siren's song. Miguel told her that she should not {{audition}} for America's Got Talent, which airs on NBC. In another episode, Tabitha talked about The Biggest Loser season finale, which was also aired on NBC. A more recent episode featured characters watching a trailer for the 2007 Diane Keaton film Because I Said So (produced by Universal Studios, which, like NBC, is owned by General Electric).|$|E
25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in <b>such</b> <b>good</b> shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E

And although John inherited his father's dukedom of Suffolk, he had lost the various offices that he had held, such as the Constableship of Wallingford Castle. On top of this, due to his mother retaining one-third of his father's estate in dower, his expectations from the dukedom {{could only have been}} even smaller. His income has been estimated at less than £280 per annum, which was less than the minimum required for an earl, let alone a duke.|$|E

The film was lauded by the critics, and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture.
