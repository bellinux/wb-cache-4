40|$|One of the {{implications}} of Marcus theory of electron transfer is that d, the electrochemical transfer coefficient, would not be constant, but would be a function of potential. Recent work has tended to confirm this implication. To examine this possible potential-dependence d, the system Cr(III) /Cr(II) was investigated by digital polarography, at different Cr(III) concentrations, at varying pH, and in different <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> Most of the resulting rate data do suggest a potential-dependence of d.

40|$|The filling of micron {{through-holes}} (THs) in {{a printed}} circuit board (PCB) by copper electroplating was investigated in this study. The role of <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> such as H 2 SO 4, Na 2 SO 4 and K 2 SO 4, was explored using practical TH filling plating and linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis of plating solutions. The copper could selectively fill THs using one organic additive, namely, tetranitroblue tetrazolium chloride (TNBT), as an inhibitor. The inhibiting strength of TNBT depended on the <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> Although H 2 SO 4 could enhance the inhibiting strength of TNBT, it also decreased the filling capability of the copper plating solution; Na 2 SO 4 and K 2 SO 4 did not enhance the inhibiting strength of TNBT but they increased the filling capability of the copper plating solution. Additionally, the protons could chemically interact with TNBT to form precipitate, whereas sodium and potassium ions did not easily interact with TNBT. The filling capability of the copper plating solution using Na 2 SO 4 and K 2 SO 4 as <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes</b> could be greatly improved by adding a small amount of bis(3 -sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with a molecular weight of 600...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. (Chemistry) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 This {{study has}} two aspects. One {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a sensitive differential pulse polarographic (DPP) method and its use to conduct a preliminary study of natural waters to detect the presence of nitrosoamines, and the second, where the study was carried out in greater detail, is the investigation of the kinetics of reduction of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in aqueous solution. An optimization study was first conducted to identify the conditions that give the greatest sensitivity. Conditions investigated were different <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes</b> and solvent mixtures. <b>Supporting</b> <b>electrolytes</b> used were 0. 10 M solutions of acids, bases and salts, and the solvent mixtures studied were ethanol/water mixtures. The effect of various <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes</b> and various ethanol/water mixtures on peak current was studied in order to select the conditions that give the greatest sensitivity for the determination of nitrosoamine concentrations. The lowest nitrosoamine concentration that can be detected in a solution (limit of detection) was determined. The optimum <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes</b> for N-nitrosoamines and the C-nitrosoamine were respectively found to be 0. 10 M H 2 S 04 and 0. 10 M NaOH. Aqueous solutions were also found to give greater sensitivity than ethanol/water mixtures. The presence of nitrosoamines in some natural water samples was then checked using differential pulse polarography (DPP). Concentrations of nitrosoamines in these water samples were determined using the optimum conditions. The analyte analytes studied were 4 -nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline (4 NDMA); Nnitrosodibutylamine (NDBA),N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA). All four nitrosoamines were detected in some of the selected natural water samples. The kinetics of the electrochemical reduction of NDMA was studied using controlled potential coulometry, linear scan voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Controlled potential coulometry was first used to determine the number of electrons transferred (n) in the reduction reaction. Two moles of electrons were found to be required for the reduction of one mole of NDMA solution, at a stationary mercury drop electrode (SMDE).

The experimentally observed enhancement factor for the reaction in the presence of the <b>supporting</b> <b>electrolytes</b> ranges from 1. 3 to 6.

By positioning an UME in the SECM configuration approximately one-electrode radius away from the (100) face of a CuSO4 crystal, {{it was possible to}} perturb the dissolution equilibrium by locally reducing Cu2+ at the UME surface. As the crystal face locally dissolved into copper and sulfate ions, a visible pit was formed and the chronoamperometric signal could be monitored as a function of distance between the UME and the crystal.

50|$|The {{difference}} between the current that is actually obtained, at any particular value of {{the potential of the}} indicator or working electrode, for the reduction or oxidation of an ionic electroactive substance and the current that would be obtained, at the same potential, if there were no transport of that substance due to the electric field between the electrodes. The sign convention regarding current is such that the migration current is negative for the reduction of a cation or for the oxidation of an anion, and positive for the oxidation of a cation or the reduction of an anion. Hence the migration current may tend to either increase or decrease the total current observed.
