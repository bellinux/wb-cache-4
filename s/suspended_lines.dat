5000|$|Due to a FY 2013 budget {{shortfall}} {{and claims}} of low ridership by the MBTA, weekend {{service to the}} South Shore (and two other lines) was discontinued in July 2012. [...] MassDOT and the MBTA subsequently received substantial feedback from rail commuters and legislative representatives to reinstate weekend service to those lines. In 2014, funding was reallocated to the FY 2015 state budget (for a trial period) and weekend service resumed on the (formerly) <b>suspended</b> <b>lines</b> on 27 December 2014. [...] Prior to the return of weekend service on the Kingston/Plymouth Line, the MBTA held special weekend service to Plymouth for 2 weekends {{leading up to the}} 2014 Thanksgiving holiday. The two trains per day were intended only for tourists going to Plymouth; they did not run on schedules allowing day trips to Boston.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1919, the <b>suspended</b> <b>lines</b> {{began to}} be reinstated, and the {{numbering}} of some lines was changed. Lines from Promenade were redirected to Stadtgraben, after which the lines to Promenade were scrapped. In 1925, {{the construction of a}} line from Centrum to Heubude (modern Stogi) began; it was opened on 4 July 1927. In 1926, tracks on the newly established Paul-Beneke-Weg were opened, scrapping the single rail along Harbour quay. At the time in Neufahrwasser, two balloon loops were constructed; a small loop for the line from Centrum and a larger loop for the line from Brösen. In 1930, a new line from Grosse Allee across Aleja Hallera and ulica Mickiewicza to the loop at the intersection of aleja Legionów and ulica Kościuszki. On the line between Langfuhr and Oliva, the layout was changed, eliminating the line on ulica Szymanowskiego, building it instead on aleja Wojska Polskiego. Construction began for a new tram depot in Langfuhr.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} interest in tunable photonic structures is growing within the photonic community. The usage of Liquid Crystalline Elastomer (LCE) {{structures in the}} micro-scale has been motivated by the potential to remotely control their properties. In order to design elastic photonic structures with a three-dimensional lithographic technique, {{an analysis of the}} different mixtures used in the micro-printing process is required. Previously reported LCE microstructures suffer damage and strong swelling as a limiting factor of resolution. In this article, we reported a detailed study on the writing process with four liquid crystalline photoresists, in which the percentage of crosslinker is gradually increased. The experiments reveal that exploiting the crosslinking degree is a possible means in which to obtain <b>suspended</b> <b>lines</b> with good resolution, quite good rigidity, and good elasticity, thereby preserving the possibility of deformation by light irradiation...|$|E

40|$|Dust (particulate matter) within {{livestock}} and poultry facilities {{is composed of}} dander and feathers, feed particles and dried manure {{to name a few}} sources. These particles, which can absorb gases, can {{play a role in the}} transport of gaseous and odorous compounds as they leave the building through the ventilation system. Removal of dust from the environment within {{livestock and}} poultry buildings not only reduces the overall emission of airborne bacteria, ammonia and odor, but also may have the potential side benefit of improved animal productivity. Electrostatic systems work by imparting a negative charge on dust particles, causing them to stick to grounded sur-faces such as gates, floors, and walls.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} characterisation of millimetre-wave Butler matrix beamforming circuits at 63 GHz. A micromachining technique is used to fabricate the tiny structures. The ability to manufacture the circuits at this frequency may benefit {{to the development of}} intelligent transport system (ITS) communication and sensing systems. All components that build the Butler matrix beamformer are designed to fit the thick SU- 8 photoresist micromachining technology, where structures are built by bonding together five layers of metal coated SU- 8. The matrix is constructed using air filled rectangular coaxial lines. The dielectric losses are avoided by having air filled structure, however the <b>suspended</b> <b>lines</b> need supporting system. Therefore, stubs are placed in the circuits to hold the <b>suspended</b> <b>lines.</b> In order to transfer signal from the Butler matrix to the antenna, a transition is necessary. A rectangular coaxial line to ridge waveguide transition is designed to feed the H-plane horn antenna and the ridge waveguide slot antenna. The novelty of this work is in both the design of new microwave structure and also in the demonstration of millimetre wave structures in micromachined form using SU 8 resist. Four new microwave structures are (1) a back to back rectangular coaxial line to ridge waveguide transition, (2) an H-plane horn antenna, (3) a ridge waveguide slot antenna, and (4) a Butler matrix with a patch antenna array. These and other structures have been built and tested and finally the selection put together to form a new type of Butler matrix. The compatibility of the designs to the fabrication method has been demonstrated. The transition return loss is better than - 12 dB from 60 GHz to 90 GHz and has been proven to work with integration to the horn and the waveguide slot antenna. The Butler matrix with a patch antenna array exhibits the forming of the beams at ± 17 ∘ as expected from the theoretical calculation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

One of the unique features of the structure is the perforated, coral-like outer shield and signal line which provides a means to control characteristic impedance and facilitates sacrificial layer removal after multi-layer deposition. These lines can thus be used to realize multilayer vertical interconnects with embedded MEM devices for RF to mm-wave frequencies.
