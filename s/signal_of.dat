40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the achievable gains for mobile terminal positioning with 3 GPP-LTE when observing <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> opportunity. For that we calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound for pseudo range estimation based on 3 GPP-LTE positioning reference signals and for multiple terminal positioning {{taking into account}} <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> opportunity with unknown transmitter position. We show that at least four mobile terminals are {{required in order to}} benefit from observing such <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> opportunity. When comparing the Cramer-Rao lower bounds for different environments and different numbers of mobile terminals and observed <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> opportunity with the respective reference configurations without <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> opportunity, we can significantly improve positioning performance, especially indoors, where we suffer from lower received power levels compared to an outdoor environment. By observing 4 <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> opportunity, such as WiFi access points, with 10 mobile terminals indoors, we observe an improvement in positioning performance of approximately 70 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> {{very recent}} positive selection provides {{information about the}} adaptation of modern humans to local conditions. We report here on a genome-wide scan for <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> very recent positive selection in favor of variants {{that have not yet}} reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs {{that can be used to}} tag the strongest ∼ 250 <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> recent selection in each population...|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help undermine the camouflage of herbivores.

5|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus {{have been found}} on this bunting, and {{internal}} parasites include Ascaridia galli. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and {{tend to be less}} brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.|$|E

After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he lifts the flag.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E

In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship. French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign upside down to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> distress, and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.|$|E

On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) an antenna, which after being set will help triangulate the <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing a flare <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E
