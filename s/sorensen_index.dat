Although the shallow ponds created for salt production may provide suitable feeding habitats for fish-eating birds, it has also reduced the exploitable area available to the birds feeding exclusively on invertebrates. The Journal of African Ornithology, however, has conducted comparative studies into two saline coastal wetlands {{that have been developed}} into saltpans and two others that are also saline but have no saltpans and as evaluated their findings. They reported on the quality of lagoon water, benthic macroinvertebrates and waterbird communities characterising these wetlands obtained from samples collected between September 2005 and April 2006. Although turbidity was significantly higher in the non-saltpans, the other physico-chemical parameters studied were not significantly different between the two wetland types and in fact scored a <b>Sorensen</b> <b>Index</b> value of 0.88, indicating a high similarity. Also, the studies indicated that waterbirds feeding {{on a wide range of}} food types showed no significant differences in their population densities so the limited studies that have been conducted into the effects of salt production on birdlife have to date not demonstrated an immediate serious adverse effect.|$|E

The highest number of zooplankton species was recorded in oligotrophic Bonita Pond (32 species) and the lowest number in hypertrophic waste stabilisation ponds (7 species). This tendency of decreasing the diversity with increasing trophic level was consistent with a cluster analysis of the samples based on <b>Sorensen</b> <b>index</b> of similarity.

40|$|The classic Jaccard and <b>Sørensen</b> <b>indices</b> of {{compositional}} similarity (and other indices {{that depend}} upon the same variables) are notoriously sensitive to sample size, especially for assemblages with numerous rare species. Further, because these indices are based solely on presence-absence data, accurate estimators for them are unattainable. We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sørensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundance-based sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}} - Eighty per cent of Gabon's {{territory}} {{is covered by}} forest with most species inventory work focused on these areas. However, herbaceous open vegetation types are abundant {{in this country and}} can be found in savannas on the coast, in the centre and in the south, and on inselbergs. The species diversity patterns of these habitats remain largely unexplored yet are targeted for both conservation and development. Here, we evaluate the floristic diversity of savannas in Gabon, their affinities with the inselberg open vegetation, and their contribution to the national park system in Gabon, which is currently undergoing a gap analysis. We then use a case study from the Batéké Plateaux to demonstrate species rarity in a single savanna. Materials and methods - Species presence in the grassy formations of the savannas in Loango, Lopé, Pongara, and Plateaux Batéké national parks and in Kum inselberg is compared using ordination and clustering based on a similarity matrix (<b>Sorensen</b> <b>index).</b> For the Batéké Plateaux savannas, the species rarity and distributions are assessed using Star ratings. Key results - The species in the open herbaceous vegetation in Gabon account for at least 11 % of the total flora of the country (508 species out of 4, 710). Except for the coastal savannas, all sites are highly dissimilar in floristic composition (<b>Sorensen</b> <b>index</b> 0. 065 - 0. 26) and no dominant savanna type occurs within the dataset. The inselberg site is the most dissimilar and constitutes a separate vegetation unit. Most savanna species of the Batéké Plateaux area are widely distributed, but not weedy. A few are extremely rare and are linked with moist habitats, substrate, and fire occurrence. Our results show the diversity and the conservation value of open, herbaceous habitats. Currently, the Gabonese National Park network is partly protecting the savanna and inselberg vegetation.

The results showed that seedlings density of ASC were 29 n m- 2, 33 n m- 2, 20 n m- 2 and 31 n m- 2 in July to October respectively, and that of AGC were 14 n m- 2, 12 n m- 2, 6 n m- 2 and 9 n m- 2 respectively; A. scoparia seedlings represented 53.2 % of the total seedlings in ASC, the dominant species in AGC only account for less than 5 % of the total seedlings. Most of the seedlings found were belonged to Compositae, Leguminoseae and Gramineae; 80 % of seedlings in ASC were mainly comprised of A. scoparia and Lespedeza davurica, while in AGC that consisted of more than 6 species, such as L. davurica, Sophora viciifolia, Dracocephalum moldavicaand, A. gmelinii, Patrinia heterophylla, Heteropappus altaicus so on. <b>Sørensen</b> similarity <b>index</b> between monthly seedlings was approximately 0.47 in ASC and 0.35 in AGC; <b>Sørensen</b> similarity <b>index</b> between seedlings and mature vegetation ranged from 0.18 to 0.34 in ASC, and varied from 0.26 to 0.39 in AGC.

Species richness (observed and estimated) in the Cerradão and Dense Cerrado was higher than that recorded in the Typical Cerrado. Species diversity, based on a Rényi profile, was highest in the Dense Cerrado, in comparison with the other phytophysiognomies. We recorded a higher number of exclusive species in the Cerradão and a greater similarity (Morisita and <b>Sørensen</b> <b>indices)</b> between this vegetation type and the Dense Cerrado. While individuals were tallest in the Cerradão and Dense Cerrado and lowest in the Typical Cerrado, there was no difference among phytophysiognomies in mean diameter. A gradient in decreasing species richness and diversity (hypothesis 1) and vegetation vertical structure (hypothesis 3) was expected for the Cerradão–Dense Cerrado–Typical Cerrado; however, neither hypothesis was supported by the results. The Cerradão and Dense Cerrado were most similar in species composition not confirming hypothesis 2, which predicted that the two savanna vegetation types (Dense Cerrado and Typical Cerrado) were more similar to one another than either is to the woodland (Cerradão). Overall, the similarities among the three study communities depended on the type of parameter analyzed. While the species richness and the vertical and structure of the vegetation of the Cerradão and Dense Cerrado are closely similar, the Cerradão and Typical Cerrado are more similar in their species diversity.

We recorded 94 butterfly species; for the first time exact localities were given for 46 of them, while two were entirely new records for the area. A comparison with five other mountains belonging to the Dinaric Arc was performed using the <b>Sørensen</b> similarity <b>index,</b> which revealed that Blidinje (Čvrsnica & Vran complex) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Mt. Velebit in Croatia have the highest similarity with the Dinara Massif. Several rare species were recorded during this survey, of which Polyommatus ripartii (Freyer, 1830) represents the second record for Croatia. The known ranges for Pieris balcana (Lorković, 1970), Polyommatus damon (Dennis & Schiffermüller, 1775), Polyommatus eros (Ochsenheimer, 1808) and Polyommatus ripartii in Croatia were much expanded...|$|R
