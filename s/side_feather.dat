40|$|The {{study of}} {{asymmetry}} ontogeny may reveal the mechanisms controlling {{the development of}} bilaterally symmetrical characters and the causes of asymmetry. In birds, flight feather asymmetries appear to increase {{at the beginning of}} growth and decrease {{at the end of their}} development. It has been proposed that such a pattern could be proximately caused by a developmental mechanism of compensational growth between the left and right wings, which should act to restore trait symmetry at the end of growth. In this study, I tested the hypothesis of the existence of a mechanism of compensational growth by performing an experiment, which consisted of provoking small asymmetries in the seventh primary feathers of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) by inducing the two feathers (one each side) to moult two days apart. On each side, the feathers grew in a similar way, independently of the growth of the other <b>side.</b> <b>Feather</b> length asymmetries were shortened with the advance of growth. However, the differences in time of growth persisted throughout development. These results do not support the existence of a mechanism of compensational growth. Primary feathers' asymmetries could decrease at the end of growth because the growth of the two feathers follows a programmed trajectory, which tends towards a certain maximum potential size...|$|E

Further, you {{remember}} that {{on the edges of}} the broad <b>side</b> of <b>feathers</b> you find always a series of undulations, irregularly sequent, and lapping over each other like waves on sand. You might at first imagine that this appearance was owing to a slight ruffling or disorder of the filaments; but it is entirely normal, and, I doubt not, so constructed, in order to insure a redundance of material in the plume, so that no accident or pressure from wind may leave a gap anywhere. How this redundance is obtained you will see in a moment by bending any feather the wrong way. Bend, for instance, this plume, B, Fig. 2, into the reversed curve, A, Fig. 2; then all the filaments of the plume become perfectly even, and there are no waves at the edge. But let the plume return into its proper form, B, and the tissue being now contracted into a smaller space, the edge waves are formed in it instantly.|$|R

40|$|Developmental {{stability}} is most accurately assessed {{by measuring the}} small asymmetries between left and right elements of bilateral traits, i. e. fluctuating asymmetry. Although {{there has been much}} recent interest in fluctuating asymmetry, as low asymmetry may reflect high fitness, relatively little is known concerning the developmental origins of these minor discrepancies. Understanding the mechanisms that determine fluctuating asymmetry is crucial to interpreting much of the recent literature, for example, it has often been claimed that asymmetry reflects properties of an individual’s genome. Therefore, in this study, we have examined the ontogeny of fluctuating asymmetry in the primary feathers of European starlings (Sturnus ulgaris) and compared our data with six published hypotheses of the mechanisms of asymmetry development. We found that signed asymmetries were not consistently biased toward either the left or the right <b>side</b> among <b>feathers</b> on the same individual; growth increments (measured every two days) were also not sided; and both absolute and relative asymmetry decrease as the feathers develop. These data are most consistent with a developmental regulatory system that involves some elements of feedback between left and right sides and episodes of compensational growth to correct large asymmetries. We discuss the possible differences in developmental mechanisms that determine asymmetry in traits of varying functional importance. 1...|$|R
