60|$|Titus now {{ordered his}} {{soldiers}} {{to carry the}} walls by <b>storm.</b> <b>Ladders</b> were brought up; and the soldiers, eager for revenge upon the foe who had so long baffled and humiliated them, sprang to the assault with shouts of exultation. The Jews offered no resistance, until the Romans {{reached the top of}} the wall but, as they leaped down on to the roof of the cloister, they threw themselves upon them. Numbers were slain, as they stepped off the ladders on to the wall; and many of the ladders were hurled backward, crushing the soldiers crowded upon them on the pavement beneath.|$|R
6000|$|... "The enemy {{thought to}} take us by surprise, {{yesterday}} evening; but we were ready for them, and our discharge killed over fifty. Then they drew off, and left us until this morning. They made two great attacks: the first by throwing planks across the moat, and placing ladders at three places; the second by trying, again, to <b>storm</b> with <b>ladders,</b> while other bands tried to force their way in at this gateway, and at the two posterns.|$|R
60|$|The {{covering}} {{party of}} the second division consisted of 100 men of the 3d Buffs; the <b>storming</b> party, with <b>ladders,</b> of 160 of the 3d Buffs, supported by 260 of the 3d Buffs, 300 of the 41st, with 200 of the 62d, and 100 of the 41st. The rest of the second division were in reserve.|$|R
5000|$|On the 3rd of March, {{preparations}} {{were made}} to attack a fort known to the French as Fort Bamboo, {{on account of the}} bamboo stockade that surrounded it. This was on a curiously shaped hill with almost perpendicular sides and a Hat top, at the back of a village known as Wan Wan. It was a most commanding position, and its capture by the French with the small force at their command was most creditable. The French brought 330 men to the attack, and the pathway was so steep that they were forced to use <b>storming</b> <b>ladders.</b> In gaining this pathway and reaching the fortifications, the French were for two miles under fire, but so determined was the charge that the Chinese weakened and finally retreated. The tale is told {{by a member of the}} French expedition and a young Chinese officer, an Anhui man, is credited with exceptional braver)-. After the Chinese had fled from the field this officer returned with a small squad, which he led without a sign of fear against the French now greatly outnumbering his little band. This gallant charge in the open field was an exhibition of such rare bravery for the Chinese that the French officer in command was much affected and ordered that the enemy should not be fired upon if it could be helped. Hut, regardless of their inferiority in numbers, the Chinese officer and his men did not falter, and it became necessary for the protection of the French troops to give the order to fire a volley to frighten the enemy from the field. As soon as the smoke had cleared away, the French were surprised to find this officer again leading his men to the front. Again did the French fire, and again did the Chinese appear to retreat; but, with an evident determination to conquer or die on the field, the Anhui man again returned for the third time, with scarcely a corporal's guard remaining. With much regret the French officer gave the order to fire, and the brave little band, lacking only in wisdom, met death to a man. James W. Davidson ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were among}} the mercenaries many men {{accustomed}} {{to the use of}} engines of war. Many, too, had aided in making them; and these were at once set to work to construct the various machines in use at that time. Before the invention of gunpowder, castles such as those of the English barons were able to defy any attack by an armed force for a long period. Their walls were so thick that even the balistas, casting huge stones, were unable to breach them except after a very long time. The moats which surrounded them were wide and deep, and any attempt at <b>storming</b> by <b>ladders</b> was therefore extremely difficult; and these buildings were consequently more often captured by famine than by other means. Of provisions, as Sir Rudolph knew, there was a considerable supply at present in the castle, for he had collected a large number of bullocks in order to feed the strong body who had been added to the garrison. The granaries, too, were well stored; and with a groan Sir Rudolph thought of the rich stores of French wines which he had collected in his cellars.|$|R
50|$|Fighting in the {{mountains}} of Dagestan: In the east, Dagestan was higher and dryer with only patches of forest. Especially in the north it was a system of plateaus cut by deep gorges. Villages were usually built on crags, houses were of stone with loopholes and interlocked so that the whole village was a fort. Some were built stairstep-wise up the side of a hill so that a <b>storming</b> party needed <b>ladders</b> to move from one house to the next. These could be taken by storm at great cost or blasted open with artillery. Lack of firewood made permanent occupation difficult. The best time for the Russians was high summer when the snow had melted and there was grass for the horses.|$|R
50|$|In the 2001 Ssason St Kilda {{ended up}} {{finishing}} 15th (out of 16) with just four wins. In {{the opening round}} the Western Bulldogs 16.11 (107) lost to St Kilda 16.16 (112), In Round 6; St Kilda 18.12 (120) defeated Sydney 14.10 (94), In Round 12; Fremantle 11.14 (80) were defeated by St Kilda 12.18 (90), and in round 22; Hawthorn 13.9 (87) lost to St Kilda 13.11 (89). In 2002 Season Grant Thomas was then appointed as full-time coach. The Saints, under Grant Thomas, again struggled, with only five wins and one draw out of 22 to again finish second last. In the 2003 Season there were signs that the team was at last beginning to turn things around, as it played some eye catching football to <b>storm</b> up the <b>ladder</b> and only narrowly miss the finals, finishing 11th with 11 wins.|$|R
50|$|After {{losing the}} Tag Team Championships, James Storm began a feud with Gunner when Gunner pulled the Feast or Fired {{briefcase}} from Storm, which contained the World Heavyweight Championship match. On the January 2 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{for the first}} time in over two years, James Storm teamed with his former Beer Money partner, Bobby Roode, to defeat Gunner and Kurt Angle in a tag team match. After the match, Storm further taunted Gunner. On the January 23 special episode of Impact Wrestling, Gunner beat <b>Storm</b> in a <b>ladder</b> match with his Feast or Fired briefcase on the line. On the January 30th episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm apologized to Gunner for his previous actions, and later won a tag team match that night with Gunner against Bad Influence. On the February 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm cost Gunner his Feast or Fired match against Magnus for the World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel in the process and setting a steel cage match between the two at Lockdown.|$|R
50|$|While {{fewer than}} 1% of United States dams are being {{considered}} for removal, {{there has been a}} push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them. These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not {{have to wait until the}} dam is removed is introducing environmental flow. Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring <b>storms.</b> Additionally, fish <b>ladders</b> can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. Thereâ€™s debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location.|$|R
5000|$|After Rhino was injured, Storm {{started a}} feud with Eric Young over {{who was the}} better drinker. Young won Storm's World Beer Drinking Championship (a title unrecognised by TNA, {{actually}} a WWE Championship toy belt decorated with beer bottles) and held it for two months before losing it back to <b>Storm</b> in a <b>ladder</b> match. Following this, Rhino made his return from injury and proceeded to deliver a Gore to Storm, challenging him to an Elevation X match. As the ladder match with Eric Young had demonstrated, Storm has a (kayfabe) fear of heights, a major disadvantage in Elevation-X. After teasing a walk-out Storm did in fact compete in the match and after attempting to hide inside of the scaffold structure, Storm ended up losing the match and falling through {{a table in the}} ring below. Following a couple of weeks off to (kayfabe) heal his injuries, Storm returned on the live March 27 episode of Impact! and attacked Sting with a beer bottle. On the April 4 episode of Impact!, Matt Morgan allowed Storm to join Team Tomko making it a five on four match (until Matt Morgan himself joined Team Cage). At Lockdown, Storm, along with Team Tomko lost their match against Team Cage. Storm was then announced as one of the [...] "Egotistical Eight" [...] to participate in the Deuces Wild Tournament, and he would have to team up with a random partner, who was later to be revealed as his bitter rival, Sting. Storm then faced Sting in a [...] "No Disqualification" [...] match that Sting won. At Sacrifice, Sting and Storm lost to Team 3D.|$|R
