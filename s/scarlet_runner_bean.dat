As known from previous experiments, maize and beans have a very low competitiveness against weeds, due to their relative slow youth development. Therefore, the beans were sown subsequently to the mechanical weed control with harrow and hoe, at the 4 -leaf development stage (BBCH 14) of maize. Hence a mechanical weed control after bean emergence is critical, a field experiment is conducted {{to find out whether}} the establishment of an additional catch crop can reduce weed pressure substantially. For this purpose two catch crop mixtures are evaluated in pure maize plots as well as in intercropping plots with <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus coccineus, cv.

The undersown crop mixtures are composed of Italian ryegrass (cv. Gersimi, sowing density: 15 kg ha- 1), which is combined with subterranean clover (cv. Seaton Park, sowing density: 30 kg ha- 1) in US 1 and with Chicory (cv. Puna II, sowing density 7. 5 kg ha- 1) in US 2. The highest biomass (50 g DM m- 2) was produced by US 1 in all variants, while the biomass of US 2 was significantly lower with 32 g DM m- 2. As a result of a successful mechanical weed control as well as a good development of the main crops, the weed pressure in 2014 was generally low.

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetBean anthracnose, {{caused by}} the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is a major disease of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), causing serious crop loss {{in many parts of}} the world. In 1921, M. F. Barrus of Cornell University {{demonstrated}} that bean anthracnose is seedborne. This information resulted in the widespread use of anthracnose-free seed and a subsequent decline in the occurrence of bean anthracnose in the United States. In bean-growing areas that receive frequent rainfall, however, such as central and western New York State, epidemics of the disease may develop. Production is reduced because of poor seed germination, poor seedling vigor, and low yields. Marketing losses are attributed to seed spots and blemishes, which lower their quality rating and salability. The disease is most common and severe on dry and snap beans (P. vulgaris) but may also affect lima bean (P. lunatus L.), <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> (P. multiflorus Willd.), mung bean (P. aureus Roxb.), cowpea (Vigna sinensis Savi), and broad bean (Vicia faba L.) ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} unsolved issues in plant {{development}} is understanding the regulatory networks that control the differential gene activity that {{is required for the}} specification and development of the two major embryonic regions, the embryo proper and suspensor. Historically, the giant embryo of <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> (SRB), Phaseolus coccineus, {{has been used as a}} model system to investigate the physiological events that occur early in embryogenesis – focusing on the question of what role the suspensor region plays. A major feature distinguishing SRB embryos from those of other plants is a highly enlarged suspensor containing at least 200 cells that synthesize growth regulators required for subsequent embryonic development. Recent studies have exploited the giant size of the SRB embryo to micro-dissect the embryo proper and suspensor regions in order to use genomics-based approaches to identify regulatory genes that may be involved in controlling suspensor and embryo proper differentiation, as well as the cellular processes that may be unique to each embryonic region.

40|$|The <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> is a {{climbing}} perennial crop but it {{is often}} grown as an annual for dry seeds and immature green pods production {{in some parts of}} Europe. The runner bean cultivars are appreciated for their large seeds and culinary quality together with high yield. As observed by the authors and local farmers, the runner bean generally requires moderate temperatures for good germination and growth and the optimum temperature ranges from 20 ºC to 30 ºC. Thus, temperature is a limiting factor for runner bean production and temperature under 10 ºC at sowing delays both germination and plant emergence, lengthening the crop cycle and increasing production costs. Therefore, an alternative to make maximum utilization of the available growing period is to use cultivars tolerant to sub-optimal temperature at the germination and emergence stages. The performance of cultivars under different growing conditions was evaluated in growing chamber at optimal (17 ºC-day/ 15 ºC-night) and sub-optimal (14 ºC-day/ 8 ºC-night) temperature on the basis of germination, earliness, ability to grow and vigor (Rodiño et al. 2007).

Thirty-one genotypes were evaluated at 14 and 21 d after inoculation (DAI) using two inoculum densities in 2005 and three in 2006 of each of the two Xcp isolates. Large differences in response to Colorado and Wisconsin Xcp isolates, densities, and evaluation time were observed.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{molecular}} mechanisms by which the embryo proper and suspensor of plant embryos activate specific gene sets shortly after fertilization. We analyzed the upstream region of the <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus coccineus) G 564 gene to understand how genes are activated specifically within the suspensor during early embryo development. Previously, we showed that the G 564 upstream region has a block of tandem repeats, which contain a conserved 10 -bp motif (GAAAAGC/TGAA), and that deletion of these repeats results in a loss of suspensor transcription. Here, we use gain-of-function (GOF) experiments with transgenic globular-stage tobacco embryos to show that only 1 of the 5 tandem repeats is required to drive suspensor-specific transcription. Fine-scale deletion and scanning mutagenesis experiments with 1 tandem repeat uncovered a 54 -bp region that contains all of the sequences required to activate transcription in the suspensor, including the 10 -bp motif (GAAAAGCGAA) and a similar 10 -bp-like motif (GAAAAACGAA). Site-directed mutagenesis and GOF experiments indicated that both the 10 -bp and 10 -bp-like motifs are necessary, but not sufficient to activate transcription in the suspensor, and that a sequence (TTGGT) between the 10 -bp and the 10 -bp-like motifs is also necessary for suspensor transcription.

40|$|Economically, legumes (Fabaceae) {{represent}} {{the second most}} important family of crop plants after the grass family, Poaceae. Grain legumes account for 27 % of world crop production and provide 33 % of the dietary protein consumed by humans, while pasture and forage legumes provide vital part of animal feed. Fabaceae, the third largest family of flowering plants, has traditionally been divided into the following three subfamilies: Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Papilionoideae, all together with 800 genera and 20, 000 species. The latter subfamily contains most of the major cultivated food and feed crops. Among the grain legumes are some of mankind's earliest crop plants, whose domestication parallelled that of cereals: Soybean in China; faba bean, lentil, chickpea and pea in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East; cowpeas and bambara groundnut in Africa; soybean and mungbeans in East Asia; pigeonpea and the grams in South Asia; and common bean, lima bean, <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> <b>bean,</b> tepary bean and lupin in Central and South America.

We identified two mRNAs, designated G 564 and C 541, that accumulate specifically within the suspensor of globular-stage embryos. G 564 mRNA accumulates uniformly throughout the suspensor, whereas C 541 mRNA accumulates {{to a higher level}} within the large basal cells of the suspensor that anchor the embryo to the surrounding seed tissue. Both G 564 and C 541 mRNAs begin to accumulate shortly after fertilization and are present within the two basal cells of embryos at the four-cell stage. In contrast, at the same stage, these mRNAs are not detectable within the two descendants of the apical cell. Nor are they detectable within cells of the embryo sac before fertilization, including the egg cell. We used a G 564 /β-glucuronidase reporter gene to show that the G 564 promoter is activated specifically within the basal region and suspensor of preglobular tobacco embryos. Analysis of the G 564 promoter identified a sequence domain required for transcription within the suspensor that contains several copies of a conserved motif. These results show that derivatives of the apical and basal cells transcribe different genes as early as the four-cell stage of embryo development and suggest that the apical and basal cells are specified at the molecular level after division of the zygote...|$|E
