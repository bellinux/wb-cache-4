In this work, the synthesis of piezoelectric AlN films by reactive sputtering at room temperature has been optimized on thick diamond layers grown on Si and alumina substrates in order to process high frequency devices. The effect of diamond underlayer microstructure is evaluated by TEM. Two sets of samples are studied, AlN/NCD/Alumina and AlN/MCD/Si.

40|$|We {{present a}} strong lensing {{modeling}} technique based on versatile basis sets for the lens and <b>source</b> <b>planes.</b> Our method uses high performance Monte Carlo algorithms, allows for an adaptive build up of complexity and bridges {{the gap between}} parametric and pixel based reconstruction methods. We apply our method to a HST image of the strong lens system RXJ 1131 - 1231 and show that our method finds a reliable solution {{and is able to}} detect substructure in the lens and <b>source</b> <b>planes</b> simultaneously. Using mock data we show that our method is sensitive to sub-clumps with masses four orders of magnitude smaller than the main lens, which corresponds to about 10 ^ 8 M_, without prior knowledge on the position and mass of the sub-clump. The modelling approach is flexible and maximises automation to facilitate the analysis of the large number of strong lensing systems expected in upcoming wide field surveys. The resulting search for dark sub-clumps in these systems, without mass-to-light priors, offers promise for probing physics beyond the standard model in the dark matter sector.

40|$|The angular {{spectrum}} approach (ASA) {{is essentially}} a Green's function method that computes the field by multiplying the source and the Green's function, or propagation operator, in the spectral domain.

In the following paper, the focus is placed on the vibro-acoustical interactions of noise barriers with the surrounding sound field.
