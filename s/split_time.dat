5|$|Prior to the 2011–12 season, Aulie was demoted to the Toronto Marlies. On February 27, 2012, he {{was then}} traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in {{exchange}} for Carter Ashton.

30|$|Regarding the {{performance}} {{over the last}} decade in the <b>split</b> <b>times</b> for the three distances, athletes improved in several split disciplines where men improved their running and swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> and women improved their running <b>split</b> <b>times</b> in the Olympic distance triathlon {{over the last decade}}. This might be because Olympic distance triathletes invested more time in running training to improve overall race performance, as it has been seen in Ironman triathletes (Rüst et al. 2012 a). In the Half-Ironman distance, swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> improved in men over the studied period. This could be due to technological advances in wetsuits, but it will not explain why women were not able to improve their swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> during the same period. The only changes during the last decade over the Ironman distance were an improvement in cycling <b>split</b> <b>times</b> and overall race times in women. The improvement in overall race time is most likely due to the improvement in cycling <b>split</b> <b>times.</b> It has been shown for ultra-triathletes that both cycling and running <b>split</b> <b>times</b> but not swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> were associated with overall race times (Knechtle et al. 2007). Therefore, it can be assumed that Ironman triathletes invested more time in training to improve in the split disciplines with more importance for the race (Rüst et al. 2012 a). The decrease in cycling <b>split</b> <b>times</b> might also be due to improvement in equipment (Bentley et al. 2002), but that will not explain why male triathletes were not able to improve their cycling <b>split</b> <b>times</b> as well.|$|R
30|$|The {{intention}} {{of this case}} report was to report the changes in performance in <b>split</b> <b>times,</b> transition times, overall race times, body mass and selected laboratory values in an event covering 33 consecutive Ironman triathlons. Based upon previous reports for Deca Iron ultra-triathletes {{it was hypothesized that}} the performance in both <b>split</b> <b>times</b> and overall race times would decrease over days. Indeed, swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> increased minimally during the 33  days whereas, however, <b>split</b> <b>times</b> in cycling and running and overall race times remained unchanged.|$|R
30|$|A second {{important}} {{finding was}} that split and overall race times of the shorter distances correlated to split and overall race times in the longer race distances. However, swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> in Double Iron ultra-triathlon showed no correlation with swimming <b>split</b> <b>times</b> in Quintuple and Deca Iron ultra-triathlon. These findings are different {{to the findings of}} Lepers et al. (2011) where <b>split</b> <b>times</b> in swimming and cycling in Double and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon correlated to <b>split</b> <b>times</b> in Deca Iron ultra-triathlon, but not running <b>split</b> <b>times.</b> Although Lepers et al. (2011) also identified all triathletes who finished at least one ultra-triathlon in each of three distances (i.e. Double Iron, Triple Iron, and Deca Iron ultra-triathlon) the disparate findings might be explained that we also included the Quintuple Iron. Furthermore, Lepers et al. (2011) considered only a 5 -year period compared to our 30 -year period from 1985 to 2014.|$|R

5|$|Andrews {{qualified}} {{to represent the}} United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where she won two gold medals. She gained her first gold in the women's 100-meter backstroke, narrowly edging fellow American Betsy Mitchell by eight one-hundredths (.08) of a second – about five inches – for a final time of 1:02.55. It {{was the first time}} she had ever beaten Mitchell. She earned her second gold by swimming the lead-off backstroke leg for the first-place U.S. team in the women's 4×100-meter medley relay event, sharing the honors with her American teammates Tracy Caulkins (breaststroke), Mary T. Meagher (butterfly), and Nancy Hogshead (freestyle), and clocking a winning time of 4:08.34. Her <b>split</b> <b>time</b> of 1:04.00 was slower than her gold-medal time in the individual 100-meter backstroke, but her teammates made good the difference to win and set a new American record in the event.|$|E

He made the active roster and originally <b>split</b> <b>time</b> with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of the}} season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a factor in his release from the team.|$|E
5|$|Blount {{entered his}} junior year at Oregon sharing the running back role with senior Jeremiah Johnson. The two backs lived together, and the talkative Johnson advised Blount in his first Pac-10 season. For Blount, {{it was the first}} season in which he <b>split</b> <b>time</b> with another running back, and his {{reaction}} was mixed. The two backs each contributed nearly 100 yards and three touchdowns in an early 63–14 win over the Washington State Cougars, and both again performed well in a late season victory over the Oregon State Beavers. However, Blount would record lackluster performances in games against USC and Cal. Overall, Blount rushed for 17 touchdowns, setting a single-season school record, and 1,002 yards. Blount and Johnson became only the second duo in team history to both clear 1,000 rushing yards in the same season; Johnson led the team with 1,201 yards.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{began the}} 1944 Philadelphia Athletics {{season as a}} member of the {{starting}} rotation along with Don Black, Lum Harris and Bobo Newsom. However, he did <b>split</b> <b>time</b> in the first half of the year between the starting rotation and the bullpen. Among those appearances was a 16-inning match against the Chicago White Sox; Christopher pitched the final four innings, losing 4–2 after Hal Trosky stole home plate. On July 14, he pitched a 4–3 victory against the Senators, helping his team defeat Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn for the first time in three years. After starting the season with a 4–10 record, on July 22 Christopher went on a seven-game winning streak that culminated with a 5–1 complete game victory over the White Sox. He finished the season with a 14–14 record, 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97. After the season ended, Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States, ending in Wenatchee, Washington.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground The {{present study}} {{examined}} the sex difference in swimming (7. 8 km), cycling (360 km), running (84 km), and overall race times for Double Iron ultra-triathletes. Methods Sex differences in <b>split</b> <b>times</b> and overall race times of 1, 591 men and 155 women finishing a Double Iron ultra-triathlon between 1985 and 2012 were analyzed. Results The annual number of finishes increased linearly for women and exponentially for men. Men achieved race times of 1, 716 ± 243 min compared to 1, 834 ± 261 min for women and were 118 ± 18 min (6. 9 %) faster (p Conclusions To summarize, the present findings showed that men were faster than women in Double Iron ultra-triathlon, men improved overall race times, cycling and running <b>split</b> <b>times,</b> and the sex difference remained unchanged across years for overall race <b>time</b> and <b>split</b> <b>times.</b> The sex differences for overall race <b>times</b> and <b>split</b> <b>times</b> were higher than reported for Ironman triathlon...|$|R

In the minor leagues, he initially hit for a high batting average, but in 2011 combined that with power numbers {{to become one of}} the Phillies' top prospects. He made his major league debut in September 2012, after having hit 38 home runs to lead the Eastern League. In 2013, he <b>split</b> <b>time</b> between Triple-A and the major league Phillies, and was among the league's top rookies during the season.

Below is a listing of at what times during the season players were substituted as starter or saw increased playing time. On the offensive side of the ball, freshman Grant Hill <b>split</b> <b>time</b> with starter Austin Shepherd at right tackle against Kentucky. Kellen Williams was listed on the depth chart as a backup at left tackle and guard; however, coach Saban mentioned Williams as being the sixth starter who can fill in at all the offensive line positions. After the Ole Miss, Williams was listed as the back-up center to Chad Lindsay after an injury to starter Ryan Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Durant {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} at the University of North Carolina in 2000. In 2001, during his first NCAA season, Durant established school freshman records with 17 touchdown passes, 142 completions, 1843 passing yards and 1971 yards of total offense. His freshman records for passing yards and completions were broken in 2007 by T. J. Yates. During his freshman season, Durant was named Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of the Week five times. He finished second overall in ACC Rookie of the Year voting to Florida State quarterback Chris Rix.
