The model presented herein represents the first attempt {{to take into account the}} variable spraying pattern usually found in industrial installations. Overall, the software is flexible and easy to use, allowing the user to specify the emission concentration pattern, the gas concentration pattern, as well as the <b>spraying</b> <b>cycle</b> periods for up to two different emission patterns per day. The model is able to predict experimental data from a biotrickling filter treating isopropanol under intermittent conditions of loading and spraying.

40|$|The {{hypothetical}} {{impact of}} aerial spraying on tsetse fly populations is investigated. <b>Spray</b> <b>cycles</b> are scheduled at intervals two days {{short of the}} first interlarval period and halted once {{the last of the}} female flies that originated from pre-spray-deposited pupae have been sprayed twice. The effect of temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle and general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler weather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy is found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by cooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the ground at the end of spraying, are identified as the main threat to a successful operation. They are slightly more vulnerable at the low temperature extreme of tsetse habitat (16 ^∘C), when the cumulative, natural pupal mortality is high. One can otherwise base one's expectations on the closeness with which the time to the third last spray approaches one puparial duration. A disparity of anything close to the length of a <b>spray</b> <b>cycle</b> advocates caution, whereas one which comes close to vanishing should be interpreted as being auspicious. Three such key temperatures, just below which one can anticipate an improved outcome and just above which caution should be exercised, are 17. 146 ^∘C, 19. 278 ^∘C and 23. 645 ^∘C. A refinement of the existing formulae for the puparial duration and the first interlarval period might be prudent in the South African context of a sympatric Glossina brevipalpis-G. austeni, tsetse population. The resulting aerial spraying strategy would then be formulated using a G. brevipalpis puparial duration and a G. austeni first interlarval period. Comment: 31 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{programme}} emphasizing intensive training, use {{of protective}} equipment and uniforms, daily supervision of safety measures at work, and weekly monitoring of blood cholinesterase levels by the tintometric method was instituted to prevent toxicity in Haitian malaria workers during spraying with the organophosphate insecticides fenitrothion and malathion. The programme functioned well, depressed cholinesterase activity (≤ 50 % of normal) being detected rapidly {{prior to the}} development of serious symptoms. Evidence of fenitrothion overexposure appeared in spraymen early in the first <b>spray</b> <b>cycle,</b> and was associated with faulty protective clothing and a failure to observe strictly the recommended safety measures at work.

No serious reduction of cholinesterase activity was seen in a more limited study of spraymen using malathion. It is strongly recommended that similar training and monitoring programmes should be instituted whenever organophosphate pesticides are used as residual sprays for malaria control.

The quality of spraying varied across different wall substrates in both districts. Evaluation of bendiocarb decay showed that the proportion of houses with recommended concentration declined from 96. 9 %, 93. 5 % and 76. 2 % at months one, two, and three post IRS, respectively (p-trend = 0. 03).

40|$|The {{hypothetical}} {{impact of}} aerial spraying strategies on tsetse fly is investigated. The investigation is largely {{one of the}} effect of temperature on tsetse population dynamics and its reproductive <b>cycle</b> during <b>spraying,</b> given that cooler weather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Conventional insecticidal spraying strategies are found to be more costly in cooler weather because of the greater number of required cycles. This is due to the larger ratios of puparial duration versus first interlarval period implied by lower temperatures. The conventional strategy consequently requires a far greater number of <b>spray</b> <b>cycles</b> at lower temperature. Pupae, which are the immediate decendants of pre–spray–existing pupae (and not third generation, or higher, pupae), are identified as the main threat to successful control by aerial spraying.

40|$|For the {{optimization}} of fuel injection, {{measurement techniques}} {{with a high}} temporal resolution below one millisecond are required to resolve the fuel spray velocity field in time. Since the measurement rate is usually too low to capture the temporal behavior of a single injection at once, a single measurement is performed during the injection and the injection is repeated with a variable time delay of the measurement. Consequently, non-stationary characteristics of the fuel spray cannot be resolved. For this purpose, a high measurement rate 1 kHz is necessary {{in addition to the}} high temporal resolution. While time-resolved particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) is capable of achieving such high measurement rates, Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) is either too slow or is restricted to velocity profile (1 d) measurements. However, DGV {{is considered to be a}} useful alternative or complement to PIV due to its high optical robustness. For this reason, the frequency modulated DGV is enhanced to provide field (2 d) measurements with rates of 1 kHz. This is achieved either by using a micro scanner or by applying a high-speed camera. Both setups provided time-resolved velocity field measurements in a spray test object without repetition of the <b>spray</b> <b>cycle.</b> During each single run, the same characteristic oscillations were identified and the decrease of the velocity at the ending of the spray injection was resolved.

This study was carried out in 2003 and 2004 to provide parasitological baseline data for the development of Malaria Early Warning System (MEWS) for the surveillance of type I epidemic caused by meteorological conditions and to provide data for timing malaria key vector control measures such as Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) for maximum effect. Clinical information about malaria cases were used in this study. In all 692 children aged 6 to 96 months were screened for Plasmodium infection and used for the analysis. The results showed that the majority of infected children (68. 06 %) were aged 12 - 60 months and their asexual parasite density (ap/ u 1) was between 100 - 500 ap/u 1 of the whole blood. The month of September recorded the highest Geometric Mean Asexual-Densities (GMPD) of 13, 655 while the lowest parasite densities were observed {{at the peak of the}} dry season, especially during the months of March and April.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the residual effect of three candidate insecticide formulations on different indoor surfaces in order to guide future interventions, {{in the context of}} Cameroon and other African countries. Methods The study was conducted in the Ntougou neighbourhood in Yaoundé (capital city of Cameroon). Bendiocarb WP, lambda-cyhalothrin CS and deltamethrin WG were sprayed on the indoor wall surfaces of local cement, wood and mud houses. Their effects on the knockdown and mortality of the Kisumu susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae s. s were assessed each month from March to September 2009, using the WHO plastic cones test. Knockdown and mortality rates were compared between different surfaces using Chi-square test. A Kaplan-Meir model was used to estimate the time of treatment failure. Results With bendiocarb WP, the knockdown rates were frequently above 98 % during 13 weeks after spraying, except on mud walls where it significantly decreased at the 13 th week (P th (83 %) and the 20 th (88 %) weeks respectively (P 98 %); while it varied between 60 and 100 % on wood or mud surfaces. The survival estimates of bendiocarb WP treatments remaining effective in killing An. gambiae s. s. (mortality rate ≥ 80 %) was > 13 weeks on cement and wood surfaces and 13 weeks on mud surfaces. Those of lambda-cyhalothrin CS were > 26 weeks on wood surfaces, and 20 weeks on concrete and mud surfaces. By contrast, those of deltamethrin WG were 26 weeks on concrete, 20 weeks on mud surfaces and 15 weeks on wood surfaces.

Beef steer carcasses (n = 36) initially had 12. 8 % moisture in AT. Immediately following washing, AT from the sirloin region had more (P <. 01) moisture (24. 5 %) than AT from the fifth-rib region (15. 6 %). Fat (n = 20) and lean (n - 20) carcasses were selected, and their right and left sides were allotted alternately to either a non-spray chill cycle or to an intermittent cold water spray-chilling cycle lasting either 3 or 6 h. After 20 h of chilling, carcasses subjected to the 6 -h spray had 12. 9 % more (P <. 01) AT moisture and possessed 2. 6 % more moisture in the cutaneous trunci muscle than similar samples from the non-spray chilled counterparts. In comparison, AT samples that were subjected to the 3 -h spray had 3. 9 % more (P <. 65) moisture, and the cutaneous trunci muscle had 2. 0 % more moisture, than their dry-chilled counterparts. After chilling, the spray-chilled AT had substantially higher (P <. 01) moisture in the fifth-rib region (26. 1 %) than in the sirloin (14. 8 %). Spray-chilled sides in the 6 -h cycle gained. 3 % of their hot carcass weight, whereas the corresponding non-spray sides shrank 1. 2 %. Spray-chilled sides subjected to the 3 -h cycle shrank. 4 %, and their dry counterparts shrank 1. 1 %. Carcass washing and length of <b>spray</b> <b>cycle</b> had a greater influence than carcass fatness on surface tissue moisture retention.

40|$|Pyrethroid-resistant {{mosquitoes}} are {{an increasing}} threat to malaria vector control. The Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management (GPIRM) recommends rotation of non-pyrethroid insecticides for indoor residual spraying (IRS). The options from other classes are limited. The carbamate bendiocarb and the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl (p-methyl) emulsifiable concentrate (EC) {{have a short}} residual duration of action, resulting in increased costs due to multiple <b>spray</b> <b>cycles,</b> and user fatigue. Encapsulation (CS) technology was used to extend the residual performance of p-methyl. Two novel p-methyl CS formulations were evaluated alongside the existing EC in laboratory bioassays and experimental hut trials in Tanzania between 2008 - 2010. Bioassays were carried out monthly on sprayed substrates of mud, concrete, plywood, and palm thatch to assess residual activity. Experimental huts {{were used to assess}} efficacy against wild free-flying Anopheles arabiensis, in terms of insecticide-induced mortality and blood-feeding inhibition. In laboratory bioassays of An. arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus both CS formulations produced high rates of mortality for significantly longer than the EC formulation on all substrates. On mud, the best performing CS killed > 80 % of An. arabiensis for five months and > 50 % for eight months, compared with one and two months, respectively, for the EC. In monthly bioassays of experimental hut walls the EC was ineffective shortly after spraying, while the best CS formulation killed more than 80 % of An. arabiensis for five months on mud, and seven months on concrete. In experimental huts both CS and EC formulations killed high proportions of free-flying wild An. arabiensis for up to 12 months after spraying. There {{was no significant difference between}} treatments. All treatments provided considerable personal protection, with blood-feeding inhibition ranging from 9 - 49 % over time. The long residual performance of p-methyl CS was consistent in bioassays and experimental huts. The CS outperformed the EC in laboratory and hut bioassays but the EC longevity in huts was unexpected. Long-lasting p-methyl CS formulations should be more effective than both p-methyl EC and bendiocarb considering a single spray could be sufficient for annual malaria control.

The porous CdSe as both photoanode and absorber could efficiently transport electrons to fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode and extract holes to the electrolyte.

An efficient solar cell having a power conversion efficiency of 2. 6 % at 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm(- 1)) was fabricated.

The present paper {{shows the}} {{experimental}} results obtained on two complex alloys Co-Cr-W-C-Fe-Ni-Si-Mn-Mo and Ni-Cr-Fe-B-Si-C-Co alloys deposited on copper support by welding (TIG). Well- {{known for their}} excellent abrasive wear, corrosion and high temperature erosion resistance, these materials were chosen as protective solutions for some highly mechanically and thermally stressed devices, namely the blast tuyeres of blast furnaces. A testing method which simulates as near as possible the real working conditions is the quick thermal shock, consisting in heating at the chosen testing temperature followed by cooling in cool air <b>spray,</b> for 25 <b>cycles.</b> Testing parameters were set according to the blast tuyere device working conditions.

40|$|From a {{technical}} perspective, the major limiting factors for the wide adoption of CNT films are the DC conductivity, uniformity of sheet resistance and good adhesion of CNT on film substrate. In this study, {{the effects of}} sonificator and process time on the zeta potential and sheet resistance of the CNT-PET film show that although the dispersing power of horn-type sonificator is stronger than that of bath-type, the SWCNT solution obtained with horn-type sonificator agglomerates faster. Likewise, it has been noted that the SWCNT solutions with low enough zeta potentials exhibit higher sheet resistance after making CNT-PET films due to the damage to SWCNTs caused by high dispersion force. Since the spray coating of SWCNT solution gives the SWCNT-SDS composite layer on PET film after drying, the excess SDS should be washed off. The removal of excess SDS was conducted by dipping in the 3 N HNO 3 and SOCl 2 solution and washing with deionized water followed by heat treatment in a 120 degrees C convection oven for 30 min. The lift-off of SWCNT-SDS composite layer after 40 min dipping in the 3 N HNO 3 solution appeared {{to be due to}} the continued permeation leading to swelling of the SDS layer by the 3 N HNO 3 aqueous solution. It was found that ten times of <b>spray</b> coating <b>cycle</b> gave CNT-PET film the sheet resistance of 310 Omega/square and transmittance of 81 %. The TSP made with CNT-PET film exhibited a performance equal to the one made with ITO-PET filmclose 5...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the feasibility of reclaiming T 55 -L- 712 turbine engine compressor housings with an 88 wt percent aluminum to 12 wt percent silicon alloy applied by a plasma spray process. Tensile strength testing was conducted on as-sprayed and thermally cycled test specimens which were plasma sprayed with 0. 020 to 0. 100 in. coating thicknesses. Satisfactory tensile strength values were observed in the as-sprayed tensile specimens. There was essentially no decrease in tensile strength after thermally cycling the tensile specimens. Furthermore, compressor housings were plasma <b>sprayed</b> and thermally <b>cycled</b> in a 150 -hr engine test and a 200 -hr actual flight test during which the turbine engine was operated at a variety of loads, speeds and torques. The plasma sprayed coating system showed no evidence of degradation or delamination from the compressor housings.

5000|$|Smaller arc {{furnaces}} may {{be adequately}} cooled by circulation of air over structural {{elements of the}} shell and roof, but larger installations require intensive forced cooling to maintain the structure within safe operating limits. The furnace shell and roof may be cooled either by water circulated through pipes which form a panel, or by water sprayed on the panel elements. Tubular panels may be replaced when they become cracked or reach their thermal stress life <b>cycle.</b> <b>Spray</b> cooling is the most economical and is the highest efficiency cooling method. A spray cooling piece of equipment can be relined almost endlessly; equipment that lasts 20 years is the norm. However while a tubular leak is immediately noticed in an operating furnace due to the pressure loss alarms on the panels, at this time there exists no immediate way of detecting a very small volume spray cooling leak. These typically hide behind slag coverage and can hydrate the refractory in the hearth leading to a break out of molten metal or in the worst case a steam explosion.|$|R
40|$|Spray {{water cooling}} {{is widely used}} in many {{industrial}} processes to control heat removal from a hot material surface. In order to control heat transfer rates and obtain desired surface temperature distributions, {{a deeper understanding of}} fundamental spray cooling dynamics and more accurate estimation of spray heat transfer rates is needed. In this thesis, a new technique combining experiment and computational modeling has been developed for measuring the steady-state heat transfer extracted locally by water sprays or air-mists impinging on the surface of a hot metallic sample. 	The experimental apparatus was developed by A. C. Hernandez B., H. Castillejos E, and F. A. Acosta Gat CINVESTAV, Mexico, and is designed to be able to employ spray water to cool the metallic sample accommodated inside a copper coil with an alternating current as induction heating goes on inside the sample. Control of total input power from the wall maintains each desired sample thermocouple temperature. A computational model developed using the commercial finite-element package COMSOL Mutiphysics uses a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of the electromagnetics and heat-conduction equations to balance the heat extracted from the sample surface by the boiling water droplets. Measurement of the RMS current flowing through the copper coil enables the model to estimate the heat extracted to the cooling spray by matching the sample thermocouple temperature measurement. Heat transfer coefficients and fluxes are quantified for spray cooling of a platinum sample at temperatures ranging from 100 - 1200 ???C, using typical air-mist nozzles and conditions relevant to steel continuous casting, and also compared with transient measurement results of spray cooling and Nozaki empirical correlation. The results reveal the flexibility of the technique to investigate different aspects of spray cooling. The spray heat transfer coefficients extracted range from 1 kW/m 2 K to 27 kW/m 2 K, and heat fluxes rang from 0. 5 MW/m 2 to 5 MW/m 2 as the sample surface temperature varies from 80 oC to 1185 oC Heat removal hysteresis exists during the <b>spray</b> heating-cooling <b>cycle.</b> The Leidenfrost temperature is found to be around at 850 oC...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCombining {{more than}} 40 years of {{experience}} with innovative designs, Metalcraft Services has become the leading manufacture of improved filter components for existing Tilting Pan Filters in the United States. Metalcraft has specialized in improving the reliability of existing tilting pan filters by providing filter components that increase filtration area, improve flow characteristics, increase structural integrity, and reduce maintenance cost. The optimization process involves diligent onsite technological study, mapping and modeling of an existing filter. Benchmarks are established as to the operational and maintenance condition of the filter, and mechanical deficiencies can be addressed. Filter measurements and data are integrated into the modeling software to revel accurate real time conditions, which then can be compared with corrected or improved modeling of all filter components. The extent of improvements and optimization are discussed with the client and further steps are planned {{in harmony with the}} customer's goals. Continuation of the optimization process allows for implementing improved cloth spray header system matched with a turnover track that is properly timed in relationship to the <b>sprays</b> and dumping <b>cycle.</b> Applying these technologies will result in improved losses, better cloth cleaning efficiencies, extended run time between cloth changes, and lower maintenance cost. By implementing the Filter Optimization process, with enhanced equipment designs and reliability centered maintenance practice, significant returns on investment will be achieved...|$|R
40|$|A spray {{deposition}} manufacturing route {{has been developed}} for the fabrication of carbon nano-structured and micro-structured energy storage devices in a thin film format, with controlled film thickness, homogeneous film surface morphology and high electrochemical performance for both supercapacitors and lithium ion battery anodes. Three types of low cost commercially available carbon materials (graphite, activated carbon and carbon black) have been investigated, and electrodes characterised in terms of surface morphology, surface chemistry, microstructure and electrochemical properties. By using ball milling, CO 2 activation and adding suitable carbon conductive additives, nano-graphite-based film electrodes (one meter long and ~ 3 µ m thickness) have been fabricated, with excellent ion transport and low electrical resistance (2 SO 4 was achieved. The high rate performance of activated carbon-based electrodes (~ 2 µ m thickness) has been enhanced by reducing the contact resistance of electrode/current collector interface and building a well-interconnected and hierachical meso/macro-porous structure. A specific capacitance of over 120 F/g at a scan rate of 600 mV/s or 20 A/g current density in 1 M H 2 SO 4 was achieved. The performance of carbon black-based electrodes (~ 4 µ m thickness) in different electrolytes has been studied in both two- and three-electrode cells. High specific capacitances of 260 F/g at 1 A/g was achieved in 6 M KOH, together with energy and power densities of 21 kW/kg and 18 Wh/kg in 1 M Na 2 SO 4. Finally, graphite-based electrodes for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have also been fabricated with controlled film thickness from ~ 900 nm to ~ 40 µ m and 98 % capacity retention of 371 mA/g after 20 <b>cycles.</b> <b>Spray</b> deposition has been demonstrated to {{have the potential for}} scalability in the manufacture of carbon-based thin film electrodes with competitive properties.
