5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
25|$|While {{there have}} been {{animated}} cartoons based on these giant robots, {{no one has ever}} attempted a live-action feature about them. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that it was a natural fantasy for the big screen–and a terrific opportunity {{to take advantage of the}} special effects that are available today.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} few years I've been {{focusing}} a lot of my research on present day anti-Semitism.... In the course of my research I began to notice that {{some of the people who}} were voicing some of the harshest hostility were themselves Jews, especially Jews on the radical Left. I wanted to document and try to explain their words, which <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as often being extreme.|$|E

6000|$|LAST night a thief came to <b>me</b> [...] And <b>struck</b> at <b>me</b> with {{something}} dark. I cried, {{but no one}} could hear me, [...] I lay dumb and stark.|$|R

25|$|From the age {{of seven}} he went to school at the Institut Victor de Laprade, a Catholic seminary where the thirteen-hour school day was filled with study and prayer. By {{the age of}} fifteen he was sceptical about {{religion}} ("what <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> most was that it was so mechanical: there was a total absence of genuine conviction behind it") and by eighteen he had repudiated Catholicism, although later in life he described himself as an agnostic.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched him}} as a student of politics, rather than someone {{involved}} in politics, and he always <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as someone who was a statesman {{as well as a}} politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.|$|E
25|$|I had not {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, {{and at once}} it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't Harvard {{the oldest}} and best seat of {{learning}} in America?" [...] There was an exaltation in Krebs's voice that arrested my attention, and made me look at him again. A troubled chord had been <b>struck</b> within <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS: '--a man brushed heavily against me, {{and then}} hurried {{on in the}} other direction. I had unbuttoned my coat {{to look at my}} watch under the lamp-post, and after he <b>struck</b> against <b>me</b> I clapped my hand to my waistcoat, and--phew!--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said as how {{she ought}} to be let come home again, and that if I was to stay there at the mill, I'd fetch her. Then he <b>struck</b> at <b>me</b> with one of the mill-bolts. But I didn't think much o' that." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea <b>struck</b> <b>me.</b> We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> — they were so out of line, it almost <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E
500|$|Glazunov and Lyadov were {{friendly}} with Tchaikovsky and were charmed by him. Glazunov studied Tchaikovsky's works and [...] "found much that was new... that was instructive {{for us as}} young musicians. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection." ...|$|E

His voice died away, {{and he was}} sinking back when Malemute Kid gripped him by the wrist and shouted, 'Who? Who would not come?' 'She, Unga.

500|$|Fleming {{took the}} name for his {{character}} {{from that of the}} American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that [...] "It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".|$|E
500|$|Alston played {{minor league}} {{baseball}} as an infielder for the Greenwood Chiefs and Huntington Red Birds in 1935 and 1936, respectively. For the 1936 Huntington team, he hit 35 home runs in 120 games. Alston's only major league game was with the St. Louis Cardinals on September 27, 1936, substituting for Johnny Mize at first base. He later described his major league playing career to a reporter by saying, [...] "Well, I came up to bat for the Cards back in '36, and Lon Warneke <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> out. That's it". He also committed one error in two fielding chances at first base.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{was educated}} at Manor Park School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Nuneaton, near Coventry, in Warwickshire (since closed). According to Daniels, drama lessons at O-levels {{gave him a}} voice, and when he attended sixth form studies at Stratford College between 1980 and 1982, doing A-levels in theatre studies and English literature, he attended Royal Shakespeare Company performances. A fellow student recalled that Daniels, whom he knew as Dave, [...] "was very serious about his work, and <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as incredibly intelligent... you got the sense his mind was working; the cogs were ticking over". Daniels subsequently trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) for three years.|$|E

"You {{would have}} been last week," [...] {{answered}} the other; while a sudden chill <b>struck</b> through <b>me</b> as I remembered the promised acceleration of the transcontinental express.

500|$|Bumgarner married Ali Saunders on February 14, 2010, in {{a private}} {{ceremony}} in which he wore jeans. During the offseason, they live {{on a farm in}} North Carolina that is about thirty minutes from where he grew up in the old furniture manufacturing area of the state, and during the season in a condo in San Francisco. Bumgarner has been a Baptist since his childhood. Andrew Baggarly, a reporter who covers the Giants, wrote of Bumgarner, [...] "While I wouldn't describe him as outgoing, he <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as being smart, well spoken and polite. He is deeply Christian and seems to be very grounded." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} {{potential}} identifications {{have been made}} using alleged clues found in Sonnet 86. The second and third quatrains in particular have garnered much attention in this regard. The description of a poet [...] "by spirits taught to write" [...] has led several critics, including Katherine Duncan-Jones and William Minto, to name George Chapman as the likeliest candidate. [...] This is due to his supposed spiritual inspiration by the ghost of Homer. [...] Another scholar, Richard Levin, connects the line [...] "Above a mortal pitch, that <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> dead?" [...] to Christopher Marlowe's play Tamburlaine, saying that the reactions described in both are similar to each other.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death of my colleague... As I meditated on the {{fragility}} of our human frame, I was drawn once more {{to the life of}} the spirit. Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France... had everything to captivate me... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He pointed {{with his}} finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and rushing forward <b>struck</b> at <b>me</b> with great violence.

'Not only that,' pursued Fanny, 'but {{she gives}} the same charge to Young Sparkler; and doesn't {{let him come}} after me until she has got it {{thoroughly}} into his most ridiculous of all ridiculous noddles (for one really can't call it a head), that he is to pretend to have been first <b>struck</b> with <b>me</b> in that Inn Yard.' ...|$|R

500|$|After the war, the Duke {{admitted}} {{in his memoirs}} that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: [...] " [...] Führer <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions." [...] In the 1950s, journalist Frank Giles heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for helping to [...] "precipitate the war through his treatment of Mussolini... that's what [...] did, he helped to bring on the war... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews". During the 1960s the Duke said privately to a friend, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, [...] "I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing about}} this horrific event, Chang strives to portray {{it as an}} unexamined Asian holocaust. Unfortunately, she {{undermines}} her argument—she is not a trained historian—by neglecting the wealth of sources in English and Japanese on this event. This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) {{at that time and}} uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> about her argument was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing to accept the fact of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal {{to come to terms with}} its past.' ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E
60|$|I {{advanced}} to the bedside, and, stooping over him, I placed my fingers upon his pulse, when immediately he sprang up into the sitting position and <b>struck</b> at <b>me</b> frenziedly with his clenched hands. I have never seen such intensity of fear and horror stamped upon a human face as appeared upon that that which was now glaring up at me.|$|R
60|$|Without an instant's notice he made {{straight}} at me. He had a dinner {{knife in his}} hand, and as I saw he was dangerous, I {{tried to keep the}} table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however, for before I could get my balance he had <b>struck</b> at <b>me</b> and cut my left wrist rather severely.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{mean that}} a dastardly enemy of mine has <b>struck</b> at <b>me</b> through him, and that while he thinks to torture me, he inflicts on him such agonies of terror and {{suspense}} as--You will excuse me, I am sure,' said Nicholas, checking himself. 'I should never speak of this, and never do, except to those who know the facts, but for a moment I forgot myself.' ...|$|R
