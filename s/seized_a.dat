5|$|In 836, Abu'l-Aghlab {{launched}} fresh attacks. A Muslim force {{seized the}} fortress known in Arabic as Qastaliasali (probably Castelluccio on the island's northern coast), but were driven {{away by a}} Byzantine counter-attack. The Muslim fleet, under al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, raided the Aeolian Islands and <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> number of forts on the northern coast of Sicily, most notably Tyndaris. In the meantime, another cavalry raid was dispatched against the region of Etna and was so successful that the price for Byzantine captives plummeted.|$|E

The ship's doctor and nurse attended to the sailor but were unable to save him.|$|E

5|$|On 3 February, Chase's columns {{pushed into}} the {{northern}} outskirts of Manila and <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> vital bridge over the Tuliahan River, which separated them from the city proper. Chase, controlling his columns by radio, suffered slight burns to his hands when a Japanese truck exploded. A squadron of the 8th Cavalry, guided by two Filipino guerrillas reached the sprawling campus of the University of Santo Tomas which {{had been turned into}} an internment camp, liberating some 3,700 internees.|$|E
5|$|Problems rose soon {{already in}} the summer of 1461, when Pavao Špirančić, who governed Croatia as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king and {{frequently}} clashed with King Thomas, <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> border town. By late summer, Stephen and Kosača were preparing to strike him jointly and divide his territory between themselves. Venice objected, fearing that the fortresses Klis and Ostrovica, paramount to the defense of Dalmatia, might fall to the Ottomans if first taken over by the Bosnians.|$|E

5|$|The {{legality}} of the bat'leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, a replica bat'leth was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies. The Colorado Springs Police Department {{said that it was}} a deadly weapon. In New Jersey, bat'leths are considered weapons and are liable to be seized. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered and <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> bat'leth as part of a cache of weapons in connection with a $4 million Medicare fraud investigation in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The small {{community}} of Machias, {{located in the}} eastern district of Massachusetts that is now the state of Maine, was a persistent thorn {{in the side of}} British naval authorities {{since the start of the}} American Revolutionary War.

5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had come down from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns {{in the first two}} captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Spartans {{sent out}} a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E
5|$|Collier's fleet {{arrived at}} the mouth of the river early on August 13. He boarded 123 marines onto the Hope, and ordered her and the Blonde up the river. Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached the log boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. They cut the log boom, <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> sloop carrying lumber, and set fire to a storehouse, seizing stores of flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Vietnamese defence {{personnel}} were concentrated {{at the eastern}} gate of the citadel, where they stubbornly fought off the French. Rigault de Genouilly led 500 French troops in hand-to-hand combat for seven hours, having used explosives to breach the citadel. At 14:00, the French seized control of the citadel. Two hours later, de Genouilly declared the citadel as the new general headquarters of the French forces. The French <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> large arsenal. This included more than 200 cannons, 20,000 hand-held weapons such as firearms, pistols and swords, 100 tons of munitions, 80,000 tons of rice and 130,000 francs in cash. Saltpetre, shot and sulphur were also seized. The Vietnamese material losses were estimated to be around 20 million francs. The citadel commander fled to another village before committing suicide.|$|E
5|$|On 11 or 12 May 1941, {{a band of}} Ustaše led by Puk <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> {{group of}} Serb males from Glina and {{detained}} them regardless of occupation or class. The Ustaše then herded the group into an Orthodox Church and demanded that they be given documents proving the Serbs had all converted to Catholicism. Two Serbs produced the required documents and were released. The Ustaše then locked inside and massacred {{those who did not}} possess conversion certificates, including priest Bogdan Opačić. The bodies were then left to burn as the Ustaše set the church on fire and waited outside to shoot any survivors attempting to escape the flames. On 13 May, a further 100 Serb males were executed by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September, {{a platoon}} of the 2/25th Infantry Battalion came under very heavy fire from a {{concealed}} Japanese machine gun near Heath's Plantation that wounded a number of Australians, including Corporal W. H. (Billy) Richards, and halted the platoon's advance. Private Richard Kelliher suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all. He returned to his section, <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> Bren gun, dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards, which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position. Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 2016, the INR in Warsaw {{announced}} it had <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> package of original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant. The documents dated {{from the period}} 1970–1976; they were seized from {{the home of a}} recently deceased former interior minister, General Czesław Kiszczak. The documents' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert, but the prosecutors demanded a handwriting examination. Eventually, the requested examination concluded that the documents were authentic and, hence, Wałęsa had collaborated with the communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|Operation Osterei (Easter Egg) {{began on}} 12 April 1944 {{with the goal}} of {{clearing}} the Majevica mountain, which was held by elements of the 3rd Corps led by General Kosta Nađ. The 27th Regiment quickly captured Janja and drove through Donja Trnova to reach the Ugljevik coal mines, an important economic objective for the German war machine. Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April, the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead, 45 captured and two deserters along with large amounts of weapons and ammunition. The regiment also <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja Trnova.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf {{was present}} at the consecration of the church at Bec Abbey on 23 October 1077, along with King William the Conqueror of England. Pantulf lost his lands {{temporarily}} because he was suspected of murdering Roger's wife Mabel de Bellême, around 1077. Pantulf came under suspicion because Mabel had <b>seized</b> <b>a</b> castle at Peray en Saonnais held by Pantulf. When he was accused of the murder, Pantulf was in southern Italy, which had also been conquered by Normans. Pantulf sought refuge at the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in Normandy while he was under suspicion; he and his family were under the protection of the abbot.|$|E
