5|$|The {{genocide}} in Lithuania {{is seen by}} some historians {{as one of the}} earliest large-scale implementations of the Final Solution, leading some scholars to express an opinion that the Holocaust began in Lithuania in the summer of 1941. Other <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> the Holocaust started in September 1939 with the onset of the Second World War, or even earlier, on Kristallnacht in 1938, or, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E

5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E

25|$|Kashmiri <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that India's {{military}} occupation inflicts violence and humiliation on Kashmiris. Indian forces {{are responsible for}} human rights abuses and terror against the local population and have killed {{tens of thousands of}} civilians. India's state forces have used rape as a cultural weapon of war against Kashmiris and rape has extraordinarily high incidence in Kashmir as compared to other conflict zones of the world. Militants are also guilty of crimes but their crimes cannot be compared with the scale of abuses by Indian forces for which justice is yet to be delivered.|$|E
25|$|His {{research}} has sparked criticism, in particular from French scholars {{who argue that}} the Vichy regime (1940–1944) was of a more traditional conservative persuasion, although belonging to the far-right, than it was counter-revolutionary, counter-revolutionary ideas being a main characteristic of fascism. René Rémond has questioned Sternhell's attribution of 'boulangisme' to the revolutionary right-wing movements. Some <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that Sternhell's thesis may shed important light on intellectual influences of fascism, but fascism in itself was not born of a sole ideology and its sociological make-up and popularity among the working classes {{must also be taken}} into account.|$|E

25|$|Other <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that Vrhbosna {{was a major}} town {{located in}} the wider area of modern-day Sarajevo. Papal {{documents}} say that in 1238, a cathedral dedicated to Saint Paul {{was built in the}} area. Disciples of the notable saints Cyril and Methodius stopped in the region, founding a church near Vrelo Bosna. Whether or not the town was located somewhere in the area of modern-day Sarajevo, the documents attest to its and the region's importance. There was also a citadel Hodidjed north-east to Old City, dating from around 1263 until it was occupied by the Ottoman Empire in 1429.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} first king of Simhala, Vijaya, came from Simhapura in eastern India, the capital of Kalinga, and that his {{grandmother}} {{was the daughter of}} the king of Kalinga. The emperor Ashoka sent his son to Ceylon to establish Buddhism, and later sent his daughter Sanghamitra to organise the nuns. The Samantapasadika says that she was accompanied by eight families from Kalinga. The Dathavamsa talks of the friendship between king Guhasiva of Kalinga and king Mahasena of Ceylon (277 – 304AD). It also talks of the king of Kalinga giving the tooth relic of Gautama Buddha as a dowry to Dantakumara on his marriage to the kings daughter. Dantakumara took the relic to Ceylon where it was enshrined in a stupa.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} consequences of guilds {{have led to}} heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods {{they must have been}} efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership {{at the expense of the}} entire economy.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the legends}} {{mentioned}} in the 2nd-century CE text Ashokavadana, Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in Pundravardhana drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing {{at the feet of}} Nirgrantha Jnatiputra (identified with Mahavira, 24th Tirthankara of Jainism). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed {{as a result of this}} order. Sometime later, another Nirgrantha follower in Pataliputra drew a similar picture. Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house. He also announced an award of one dinara (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic. According to Ashokavadana, as a result of this order, his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd. However, for several reasons, <b>scholars</b> <b>say,</b> these stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda.|$|E
500|$|The Petition profoundly {{influenced}} the rights contained by the Constitution of the United States.

Other <b>scholars</b> <b>say</b> that the Criminal Trials Clause of the Sixth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Civil Jury Trial Clause of the Seventh Amendment all are influenced by the Petition of Right, primarily through the Massachusetts Body of Liberties.|$|E

The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons". King and Krzywinska say that [...] "Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading {{in terms of the}} Samurai tradition".

In this sense postmodernism is not the answer to modernism, but the continuation thereof.|$|R
