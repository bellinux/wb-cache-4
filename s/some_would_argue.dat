25|$|The figures do {{not include}} the cost of {{operating}} military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others would argue that the military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner to save lives to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.|$|E
25|$|Early on, Andronikos ruled wisely – {{he began}} by attacking the {{corruption}} within the taxation and administration of the empire. Before long his heavy-handed ruling of the Empire gave rise to enemies in {{all corners of the}} Empire; the aristocrats in Anatolia were conspiring against his rule, Isaac Komnenos declared Cyprus an independent kingdom and Béla III of Hungary, formerly engaged to Maria Komnene, began sacking towns along Dalmatia and Croatia. However, these calamities were nothing in comparison to the storm that had lain dormant, that <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> was worse than the Turks of Manzikert – the Normans of the Kingdom of Sicily.|$|E

Others <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that from a publicity perspective it is in the tactical political interests of the Broad Front, for Pedro Bordaberry, seen as one of the principal leaders of the opposition, to be identified in his public pronouncements with a controversial period in which he himself played no direct role.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the clearest}} example to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} difference between original intent and original understanding is to use the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.|$|E
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no sealing washers that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|E
500|$|Cecil {{has said}} that the game's fanbase {{believes}} Dan Brown to have been influenced by Broken Sword when writing his novel, The Da Vinci Code, because of the parallels between the two works. Cecil stated that he is flattered by this sentiment, but that he would never claim so himself due to the threat of Brown's [...] "very serious" [...] lawyers. Joao Diniz Sanches of Pocket Gamer said Broken Sword story is a [...] "tale, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> that effortlessly outclasses Dan Brown's similarly themed and tricksy novel." [...] In an article about Broken Sword, Computer and Video Games described the Knights Templar legend as a [...] "great mythology to base a game on", and noted that Broken Sword [...] "came out years before the Da Vinci Code made that sort of thing popular." ...|$|E
50|$|Though Cartwright {{has been}} listed among the 17th century dramatists {{known as the}} Sons of Ben, as they were to have been {{influenced}} by Ben Jonson, Cartwright's play The Ordinary {{has been described as a}} second-rate Jonsonian comedy, nothing more than a pale copy of an original. <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> perhaps <b>argue</b> that bad replication does not qualilify Cartwright as a true Son of Ben.|$|R

500|$|Although {{developers}} billed {{a realistic}} atmosphere, reviewers criticized {{that aspect of}} the game. [...] "I understand the emphasis for this game is on the gameplay. However, a little more effort {{could have been made}} with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland. After the patch, the song only comes up for the first kick-off and the kick-off of the second half.|$|E
500|$|Like salegy, tsapika (or tsapiky) is {{energetic}} {{dance music}} that originated {{from the traditional}} music of the southwestern region around Toliara and that has recently been adapted to contemporary instruments such as electric guitar, bass guitar and drum kit. [...] Generally even more rapid than the salegy, this 4/4 form of music features a guitar performance style inspired by traditional marovany compositions, but the influence of South African township music is evident in both the guitars and polyharmonic vocals, often performed by female singers who repeat variations on a short refrain throughout the song. [...] Tsapika music is performed at all manner of ceremonial occasion in the South, whether a birthday celebration, community party, or funeral. While salegy had risen to national popularity by the mid-1980s (<b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> the 1970s), tsapika only truly began to garner a similar level of widespread appreciation by the mid-1990s. [...] It {{was not until the}} 2000 release of the [...] "Tulear Never Sleeps" [...] compilation album that the genre achieved international exposure on a major label. This compilation, however, showcases [...] "traditional" [...] tsapika, such as might have more commonly been performed in rural villages twenty years ago, rather than the amplified, synthesized and remixed style in heavy rotation on radio stations performed by national stars like Tearano, Terakaly, Jarifa, and Mamy Gotso.|$|E
500|$|Not {{all were}} as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially {{strapped}} before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: [...] "The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as {{the writer and}} artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible." [...] Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: [...] "technically brilliant but... slightly compromised." [...] Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that [...] "most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work... <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who [...] "was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric" [...] and insisted that each strip [...] "had to include Annie disrobing". Beauchamp agreed: [...] "Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand." [...] Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that [...] "humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously." [...] However, they repeated their respect: [...] "The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> {{observers}} <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that Sapelli's {{action in}} dissociating himself with Juan María Bordaberry in 1973, under {{whom he had}} been serving, demonstrated {{himself to be a}} figure of constitutional principle. Others <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that the position of Vice President of Uruguay, and such power as the holder of the office exercises, is mainly significant {{to the extent that the}} holder is prepared to identify himself unreservedly with the current President of Uruguay, and that in any case the office of Vice President of Uruguay originated from the period of the Presidency of Gabriel Terra, 1931-1938, who ruled by decree.|$|R
5000|$|Though the Empire {{was only}} officially proclaimed by Tsar Peter I, {{following}} the Treaty of Nystad (1721), <b>some</b> historians <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> {{that it was}} truly born either when Ivan III of Russia conquered Veliky Novgorod or when Ivan the Terrible conquered Khanate of Kazan. According to another point of view, the term Tsardom, which was used after the coronation of Ivan IV in 1547, was already a contemporary Russian word for empire, while Peter the Great just {{replaced it with a}} Latinized synonym.|$|R
50|$|There is {{some debate}} about whether {{this is really a}} true {{exception}} or not. <b>Some</b> people <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that it is a derogation or - perhaps somewhat more harshly - an infringement of the principle of legality. While others <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that crimes such as genocide are contrary to natural law and as such are always illegal and always have been. Thus imposing punishment for them is always legitimate. The exception and the natural law justification for it can be seen as an attempt to justify the Nuremberg trials and the trial of Adolf Eichmann, both of which were criticized for applying retrospective criminal sanctions.|$|R
2500|$|In particular, {{variance}} is a symmetric {{measure that}} counts abnormally high returns as just as risky as abnormally low returns. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that, in reality, investors are only concerned about losses, {{and do not}} care about the dispersion or tightness of above-average returns. [...] According to this view, our intuitive concept of risk is fundamentally asymmetric in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon {{credits and}} carbon taxes each have their {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Credits were {{chosen by the}} signatories to the Kyoto Protocol {{as an alternative to}} Carbon taxes. A criticism of tax-raising schemes is that they are frequently not hypothecated, and so {{some or all of the}} taxation raised by a government would be applied based on what the particular nation's government deems most fitting. [...] However, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that carbon trading is based around creating a lucrative artificial market, and, handled by free market enterprises as it is, carbon trading is not necessarily a focused or easily regulated solution.|$|E
2500|$|Laventille {{is located}} East of the St. Ann's River, more {{commonly}} known as the East Dry River, is the working-class neighbourhood of Laventille. For visitors entering Port of Spain from the airport, this neighbourhood dominates the city as it spreads over the surrounding hills. The area is unfortunately portrayed {{as one of the most}} violent in the country due to drug, gun and turf wars among gangs (financed arguably by illicit drug wealth which does not remain in the community), but it is also the birthplace of the steelpan and, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> the spiritual capital of the city since calypso. [...] Steelpan and carnival are the life source of many Trinidadians who live in the capital. South of Laventille are Beetham Estate and Sea Lots, two other economically depressed neighbourhoods.|$|E

50|$|As {{with his}} {{predecessor}} Juan Maria Bordaberry, <b>some</b> observers <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that the close links between leading Colorado party {{figures such as}} Demicheli and the military mirror the similar elements present in the Colorado party's founder, the 19th century President and military patriot, Fructuoso Rivera. The preference for rule by decree of nineteenth century Colorado President of Uruguay Venancio Flores {{would also be a}} historical case in point, according to this argument. Others would reason that Demicheli was morally repudiating Colorado party ideals in cooperating with the civilian-military administration which took office in 1973.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{though it}} is a broad {{consensus}} currently regarding the overall ideology of Taiwanization, there are still deep disputes over practical policies between the three main political groups of Taiwan independence, Chinese reunification, and supporters of Chinese culture. Pro-independence supporters argue that Taiwan is and should be enhancing an identity which is separate from the Chinese one, and in more extreme cases advocates the removal of Chinese [...] "imprints". Meanwhile, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that Taiwan should create a distinctive identity that either includes certain Chinese aspect or exists within a broader Chinese one. Those who support Chinese reunification call for a policy of enhancing the Chinese identity. Groups that support Chinese reunification and Chinese nationalism have emphasized the distinction between Taiwanization and what some perceive as desinicization and argued that they do not oppose the promotion of a Taiwanese identity, but rather oppose the use of that identity to separate itself from a broader Chinese one. On the other hand, a few apolitical groups have claimed that most of the political factions merely use these points to win support for elections.|$|E
2500|$|Nkrumah {{was also}} best-known {{politically}} for his {{strong commitment to}} and promotion of pan-Africanism. He {{was inspired by the}} writings of black intellectuals such as Marcus Garvey, W.E.B. Du Bois, and George Padmore, and his relationships with them. Much of his understanding and relationship to these men was created during his years in America as a student. <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that his greatest inspiration was Marcus Garvey, although he also had a meaningful relationship with C. L. R. James. Nkrumah looked to these men in order to craft a general solution to the ills of Africa. To follow in these intellectual footsteps Nkrumah had intended to continue his education in London, but found himself involved in direct activism. Then, motivated by advice from Du Bois, Nkrumah decided to focus on creating peace in Africa. He became a passionate advocate of the [...] "African Personality" [...] embodied in the slogan [...] "Africa for the Africans" [...] earlier popularized by Edward Wilmont Blyden and he viewed political independence as a prerequisite for economic independence. Nkrumah's dedications to pan-Africanism in action attracted these intellectuals to his Ghanaian projects. Many Americans, such as Du Bois and Kwame Ture, moved to Ghana to join him in his efforts. These men are buried there today. His press officer for six years was the Grenadian anticolonialist Sam Morris. Nkrumah's biggest success in this area was his significant influence in the founding of the Organisation of African Unity.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien was {{the chief}} {{negotiator}} {{of what would be}} called the [...] "Kitchen Accord", an agreement which led to the agreement of nine provinces to patriation. In the Kitchen Accord, Chrétien, Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow came up with the compromise of Section 33, the so-called [...] "notwithstanding clause" [...] allowing Parliament and provincial legislatures to overrule the courts in Charter cases. Chrétien remembered that Trudeau [...] "hated" [...] the idea of Section 33 and that he had to tell him: [...] "Pierre, if you don’t take the notwithstanding clause, you don’t have the Charter." [...] Trudeau only accepted Section 33 when the Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who together with New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield, were the only premiers supporting the federal government phoned him to say he would join the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] if Trudeau did not accept Section 33, which Chrétien remembered changed Trudeau's attitude completely. In a 2012 interview, Chrétien defended the controversial Section 33, saying: [...] "Because <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that in a society the elected people have to be supreme — not judges — and I subscribe to that. Look at what happened in the United States where the judges reign according to their so-called philosophy. That is not the tradition here." [...] With the exception of Parti Québécois Quebec Premier René Lévesque, all of the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] premiers accepted the compromise of Section 33. Chrétien's role in the dealings, however, would not be forgotten in his native province of Quebec, which did not ratify the Constitution Act of 1982 (although the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Quebec was bound by it). One of Trudeau's aides Barry Strayer later said about Chrétien's role in the constitutional battle: [...] "He was able to contemplate compromises that Trudeau would have been able to. Everybody saw him as a honest broker. Without him you could argue it would not have happened".|$|E

Within each diet arm, participants ate higher, intermediate, and lower sodium levels, each for 30 days. The results indicated lower blood pressure with lower sodium intake for both diet groups. Although <b>some</b> critics <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> otherwise, these findings provide important new evidence {{for the value of}} the DASH diet and sodium reduction in controlling blood pressure...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{people use}} the term face {{validity}} to refer only to the validity of a test to observers who are not expert in testing methodologies. For instance, if a test is designed to measure whether children are good spellers, and parents are asked whether the test is a good test, this measures the face validity of the test. If an expert is asked instead, <b>some</b> people <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that this does not measure face validity. This distinction seems too careful for most applications. Generally, face validity means that the test [...] "looks like" [...] it will work, as opposed to [...] "has been shown to work".|$|R

30|$|Corrupt {{policing}} {{practices were}} also {{cited as a}} challenge in policing wildland fires. Dube and Mafoko (2009) also echoed that it is partly because of corruption that the general public has grown to be reluctant to come forward to report on who or what caused a fire. <b>Some</b> respondents <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> the <b>some</b> officers <b>would</b> receive bribes {{so that they can}} set perpetrators of wildland fires free, as a result it does not make a difference whether the case is reported or not. Lack of appropriate punishment has been attributed to increasing wildland fires (Nyamadzawo et al. 2013). Leaf (2002) also shared the same sentiments when he said the current Roman-Dutch system is increasingly believed to be excessively lenient and consequently ineffective at controlling wildland fire crimes because it provides insufficient deterrence against offending.|$|R
50|$|In 1840 {{representatives of}} the British Crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi with 240 Māori chiefs {{throughout}} New Zealand, motivated by plans for a French colony at Akaroa and land purchases by the New Zealand Company in 1839. British sovereignty was then proclaimed over New Zealand in May 1840. <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> later <b>argue</b> that the proclamation of sovereignty was in direct conflict with the treaty which in its Maori version had guaranteed sovereignty (Rangatiratanga) to the Maori who signed it.
