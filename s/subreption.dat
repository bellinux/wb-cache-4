In the early 1760s, Kant produced a series of important works in philosophy. The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures, a work in logic, was published in 1762. Two more works appeared the following year: Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into Philosophy and The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God. In 1764, Kant wrote Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime and then was second to Moses Mendelssohn in a Berlin Academy prize competition with his Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (often referred to as [...] "The Prize Essay"). In 1766 Kant wrote Dreams of a Spirit-Seer which dealt with the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. On 31 March 1770, aged 45, Kant was finally appointed Full Professor of Logic and Metaphysics (Professore Ordinano der Logic und Metaphysic) at the University of Königsberg. In defense of this appointment, Kant wrote his inaugural dissertation (Inaugural-Dissertation) De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Principiis (On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World). This work saw the emergence of several central themes of his mature work, including {{the distinction between the}} faculties of intellectual thought and sensible receptivity. To miss this distinction would mean to commit the error of <b>subreption,</b> and, as he says in the last chapter of the dissertation, only in avoiding this error does metaphysics flourish.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Subreption</b> is {{a concept}} in Roman law and, in this tradition, Canon law. In this context, obreption and <b>subreption</b> belong together. The Latin word for <b>subreption</b> is [...] "subreptio", the German is [...] "Erschleichung".|$|E
50|$|In {{its effects}} <b>subreption</b> is {{equivalent}} to obreption. <b>Subreption</b> may be intentional and malicious, or attributable solely to ignorance or inadvertence. It may affect the primary, substantial reason or motive of the grant, or constitute merely a secondary or impellent cause of the concession.|$|E
5000|$|Obreption and <b>Subreption</b> With {{links to}} the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) ...|$|E
5000|$|In German philosophy, {{the concept}} was used by Christian Wolff (philosopher) and Immanuel Kant to {{denounce}} illegitimate claims to empiricity of representations: I can perceive the formation of my will to lift my arm, and I can perceive the lifting of my arm. To say that I know empirically that my will lifted my arm would be a <b>subreption</b> in Wolff's sense.|$|E
5000|$|Obreption and <b>subreption</b> (both {{from the}} Latin word repo/reptum (genitive), meaning to creep or crawl. The prefix, Ob- means [...] "towards, against, or, {{in the way}} of"; Sub- means [...] "under, or, close to") are terms used in ancient Roman law and in the canon law applied by the Catholic church to species of fraud by which an ecclesiastical rescript is obtained.|$|E
5000|$|The Latin {{phrase for}} the {{philosophical}} concept of <b>subreption</b> is [...] "vitium subreptionis" [...] -vitium: fault, crime, error; subreptionis: creep, stealth, fraud. The German is a literal translation of this Latin phrase: [...] "Fehler der Erschleichung". It can also mean in general a creeping or tacit assumption(s) {{that is not}} explicitly given but is hidden either purposefully (as in sophistry) or not (as in a visual illusion).|$|E
50|$|Dispensations or graces are not granted {{unless there}} be some motive for {{requesting}} them, {{and the law}} of the Church requires that the true and just causes that lie behind the motive be stated in every prayer for such dispensation or grace. When the petition contains a statement about facts or circumstances that are supposititious or at least, modified if they really exist, the resulting rescript is said to be vitiated by obreption, which consists in a positive allegation of what is false. If, on the other hand, silence had been observed concerning something that essentially changed the state of the case, the concealment or suppression of statements or facts that according to law or usage should be expressed in an application or petition for a rescript is called <b>subreption.</b> Rescripts obtained by obreption or <b>subreption</b> are null and void when the motive cause of the rescript is affected by them. If it is only the impelling cause, and the substance of the petition is not affected, or if the false statement was made through ignorance, the rescript is not vitiated. As requests for rescripts must come through a person in ecclesiastical authority, it is his duty to inform himself of the truth or falsity of the causes alleged in the petitions, and in case they are granted, to see that the conditions of the rescript are fulfilled.|$|E
5000|$|Every rescript pre-supposes {{the truth}} of the {{allegations}} found in the supplication. Intentional falsehood or concealment of truth (obreption and <b>subreption)</b> renders a rescript invalid, since no one should benefit through his own deceit. According to some, however, a rescript is valid if voluntary misrepresentation affects only the secondary reason of the grant. This is certainly true where there is no fraud, but merely inadvertence or ignorance of requirements; for, where there is no malice, punishment should not be inflicted; and the petition should be granted, if a sufficient cause therefor exists. A rescript in forma commissoria is valid, if the reason alleged for the grant be true at the time of execution, though false when the rescript was issued. When a rescript is null and void, a new petition is drawn up containing the tenor of the previous concession and cause of nullity, and asking that the defect be remedied. A new rescript is then given, or the former one validated by letters perinde valere. If the formalities sanctioned by canon law or usage for the drawing up of rescripts are wanting, the document is considered spurious. Erasures, misspellings or grave grammatical errors in a rescript render its authenticity suspected. Excommunicated persons may seek rescripts only in relation to the cause of their excommunication or in cases of appeal. Consequently, in rescripts absolution from penalties and censures is first given, as far as necessary for the validity of the grant.|$|E

5000|$|When {{there is}} {{occasion}} to procure a dispensation that exceeds {{the powers of}} the ordinary, or when there are special reasons for direct recourse to the Holy See, procedure is by way of supplica (petition) and private rescript. The supplica need not necessarily be drawn up by the petitioner, nor even at his instance; it does not, however, become valid until he accepts it. Although, since the Constitution [...] "Sapienti", all the faithful may have direct recourse to the Roman Congregations, the supplica is usually forwarded through the ordinary (of the person's birthplace or domicile, or since the Decree [...] "Ne temere" [...] the residence of one of the petitioners), who transmits it to the proper Congregation either by letter or through his accredited agent; but if there is question of sacramental secrecy, it is sent directly to the Penitentiaria, or handed to the bishop's agent under a sealed cover for transmission to the Penitentiaria. The supplica ought to give the names (family and Christian) of the petitioners (except in secret cases forwarded to the Penitentiaria), the name of the Ordinary forwarding it, or the name of the priest to whom, in secret cases, the rescript must be sent; the age of the parties, especially in dispensations affecting consanguinity and affinity; their religion, at 1east when one of them is not a Catholic; the nature, degree and number of all impediments (if recourse is had to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum or to the Holy Office in a public impediment, and to the Penitentiaria {{at the same time in}} a secret one, it is necessary that the latter should know of the public impediment and that recourse has been had to the competent Congregation). The supplica must also contain the causes set forth for granting the dispensation and other circumstances specified in the Propaganda Fide Instruction of 9 May 1877 (it is no longer necessary, either for the validity or liceity of the dispensation, to observe the paragraph relating to incestuous intercourse, even when probably this very thing had been alleged as the only reason for granting the dispensation). When there is question of consanguinity in the second degree bordering on the first, the supplica ought to be written by the bishop's own hand. He ought also to sign the declaration of poverty made by the petitioners when the dispensation is sought from the Penitentiaria in formâ pauperum; when he is in any way hindered from so doing he is bound to commission a priest to sign it in his name. A false declaration of poverty henceforth does not invalidate a dispensation in any case; but the authors of the false statement are bound in conscience to reimburse any amount unduly withheld (regulation for the Roman Curia of 12 June 1908). For further information on the many points already briefly described see the special canonical works, wherein are found all necessary directions as to what must be expressed so as to avoid nullity. When a supplica is affected (in a material point) by obreption or <b>subreption</b> it becomes necessary to ask for a so-called [...] "reformatory decree" [...] in case the favour asked has not yet been granted by the Curia, or for the letters known as [...] "Perinde ac valere" [...] if the favour has already been granted. If after all this a further material error is discovered, letters known as [...] "Perinde ac valere super perinde ac valere" [...] must be applied for.|$|E
40|$|This inquiry {{seeks to}} {{establish}} the importance of <b>subreption</b> as an approach to economic and social evolution that also proves integral to the tradition of radical institutionalism. We relate subreption’s etymology and appearances in Roman, Canon and Scots Law, {{as well as in}} Philosophy, to its applications found in writings advanced by Thorstein Veblen and carried on later as William Dugger details the rise of corporate hegemony. Understood as an approach derivable from selected philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant, in social science <b>subreption</b> is suggested to occur through the introduction of an outside value that sets off a form of institutional evolution that we characterize as an évolution noire. Considering <b>subreption</b> and the rise of big business, we can mark a movement away from a past governed by comparatively noble values and towards a deteriorated, debased and degraded economic and social reality overtly influenced by comparatively ignoble, pecuniary values...|$|E
40|$|This inquiry {{considers}} {{and also}} seeks to establish theoretical {{relationships between the}} thinking and contributions of Thorstein Veblen and C. Wright Mills. Selected writings of Veblen have not only formed new approaches to the discipline of Economics, but also influenced prominent scholars, like Mills. In his contributions, Veblen employs various approaches to social science analysis, such as use of dichotomy (Veblenian Dichotomy), <b>subreption,</b> and cumulative causation {{in his efforts to}} describe social change within an evolutionary-institutionalist framework. While not being explicit, some contributions of Mills utilize similar approaches advanced earlier by Veblen. In summary, Mills’ contributions to sociology appear to be heavily influenced by Veblen’s seminal contributions to institutional thought...|$|E
30|$|What authorises an {{act that}} no longer has any {{therapeutic}} purpose, nor even is intended to improve the patient’s comfort? The risk lies in possible <b>subreption</b> by physicians. Indeed, acting on physiological signs presupposes scientific knowledge, or as Alfred Baeumler [17] explains in The Problem of Irrationality in the Aesthetics and Logic of the XVIIIth century, “As a subject of science, he [man] {{is no longer the}} living and real being, but only a theoretical being. […] subject to the general laws of the material world”. According to Baeumler, the only domain where man is recognised as himself, as a “living individuality”, is aesthetics, because he is only conscious of his uniqueness in the world of feelings. As it is effected by physicians at a moment they deem opportune, medical action intended solely to give form to a body in death is an aesthetic preoccupation with scientific methods in a person who is still living when the muscle relaxants are administered. In a sense, by way of concern for tactfulness, the purpose is to mask the truth of what is happening: the end of life of an individual, with no benefit for the dying person.|$|E
40|$|Fichte {{cannot be}} counted among the great theorists of the sublime. Even {{in his early}} summary of Kantian “Analytic of Aesthetic Judgment” he deals with the sublime and its {{peculiarity}} only in the section devoted to the beautiful. However, his contribution cannot be overlooked. First of all he shows an original analysis of the sublime in its connection with time, where the singular denotes a “universal concept” included in the repertoire of all speakers of a natural language (without actually indulging in a Platonist conception of meaning, {{based on the belief}} in a kingdom of abstract entities, present in mind and expressed in language). In his approach this contribution is characterized by the predicative use of the term in particular contexts of discourse where his formulation seems to assume an existential value. He thus led the Kantian theses to more radical consequences: not only the thesis of the unsuitability of referring the sublime to the natural object, but as well the one introducing a particular “moral sentiment” that, accompanying what is considered “sublime”, represents the “subjective condition” under which the consent by everyone is required. The result is a denaturalization of the sublime, as shown {{in the second and third}} lesson of his Bestimmung des Gelehrten and more radically in the third book of his Bestimmung des Menschen, where the use of “sublime” in relationship to the human will rectifies the “replacement (<b>Subreption)</b> ” considered by Kant at the bottom of the his predication to the nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{potential benefits}} through {{reduction of cost}} of services and improvement of business outcomes make Cloud Computing an attractive proposition these days. To make it more marketable in the wider IT user community one needs to address a variety of information security risks. In this paper, we present an extensive review on cloud computing with the main focus on gaps and security concerns. We identify the top security threats and their existing solutions. We also investigate the challenges/obstacles in implementing threat remediation. To address these issues, we propose a proactive threat detection model by adopting three main goals: (i) detect an attack when it happens, (ii) alert related parties (system admin, data owner) about the attack type and take combating action, and (iii) generate information {{on the type of}} attack by analyzing the pattern (even if the cloud provider attempts <b>subreption).</b> To emphasize the importance of monitoring cyber attacks we provide a brief overview of existing literature on cloud computing security. Then we generate some real cyber attacks that can be detected from performance data in a hypervisor and its guest operating systems. We employ modern machine learning techniques as the core of our model and accumulate a large database by considering the top threats. A variety of model performance measurement tools are applied to verify the model attack prediction capability. We observed that the Support Vector Machine technique from statistical machine learning theory is able to identify the top attacks with an accuracy of 97. 13 %. We have detected the activities using performance data (CPU, disk, network and memory performance) from the hypervisor and its guest operating systems, which can be generated by any cloud customer using built-in or third party software. Thus, one does not have to depend on cloud providers' security logs and data. We believe our line of thoughts comprising a series of experiments will give researchers, cloud providers and their customers a useful guide to proactively protect themselves from known or even unknown security issues that follow the same patterns...|$|E
