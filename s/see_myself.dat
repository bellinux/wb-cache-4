500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was {{generally}} met with positive reviews from music critics. Romanian publication Libertatea praised the refrain of [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] for being optimistic, and described its beats as [...] "explosive". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, expected the track to become a hit, although stating that the lyrics [...] "aren't exactly strong and Viper's solo in the song adds nothing. He has a unique voice but it's not something I can <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> listening to, he isn't a great singer, but I can see how his vocals change the track."

Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E

All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of [...] "Sinatra covers". Dylan explained, [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day." [...] In an interview, Dylan said he had been thinking about making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.|$|E

He has {{referred}} to himself as [...] "...too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing," [...] describing himself in 1974 as [...] "a political nothing" [...] and [...] "a moderate" [...] and in 1997 as a [...] "libertarian." [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> as conservative," [...] Eastwood has stated, while noting in the same breath that he is not an [...] "ultra-leftist," [...] either. At times, he has supported Democrats in California, including Senator Dianne Feinstein in 1994, liberal United States House of Representatives member Sam Farr in 2002, and Governor Gray Davis, whom he voted for in 1998 and 2002 and hosted pricey fundraisers for in 2002 and 2003.|$|E

500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

[...] In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times to say that the Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E

If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." [...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman".

Commenting on his idea, he said, [...] "ther bands, they make more money doing things in an unconventional fashion as opposed to doing it... with the major labels." [...] Dean was curious about Weiland's idea but was aware that the band was contractually obligated to release two more albums. Increasing the uncertainty in the future of a new album, Weiland added, [...] "I'm proud of everything we've written.

500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> doing and did." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film Souls at Sea. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper {{referred to it as}} his [...] "almost picture", saying, [...] "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." [...] In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, [...] "It {{was one of the best}} roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> as quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right." ...|$|E

Bradley Stern from the website MuuMuse analyzed how the lines [...] "The laws of the world never stopped us once 'cause together we got plenty of superpower" [...] were backed by the fact the singer {{was part of the}} world's most famous supercouples. Clash writer Mike Diver opined that the song was an [...] "anthem to blissful monogamy". Similarly, Cosmopolitan reviewer Alex Rees felt the lyrics analyzed the [...] "power" [...] of a firm relationship and its outcomes on a person's self-worth.

500|$|Judas Priest's [...] "Dissident Aggressor" [...] is {{the first}} cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman {{described}} the track as [...] "more just {{like one of those}} odd songs {{that a lot of people}} didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there."

500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
500|$|During Benefica's season-ending North American tour {{after the}} last game of 2006–07, Fernando Santos spoke to the media about {{his plans for the}} {{upcoming}} season. As promised by club president Luís Filipe Vieira, the club would spend more on new players to build a team capable of winning the title. Simão was crucial; according to Santos, [...] "I cannot <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> without Simão". In addition, he wanted to keep Fabrizio Miccoli and sign a new striker who could be a target man. The club's first addition was winger Fábio Coentrão in March, followed by defenders Marco Zoro and David Luiz in May; the latter signed a five-year contract after performing well on loan. In June, Benfica began their promised investments, spending over €9 million on Óscar Cardozo from Newell's Old Boys and a reported €2.5 million on Gonzalo Bergessio. Both added options to an offence composed solely of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, since Fabrizio Miccoli and Derlei did not renew their loan agreements. Breaking with tradition, Benfica did not tour abroad; they remained at the club's new training center, Futebol Campus. Santos also decided not to participate in the Teresa Herrera Trophy, since the tournament was too close to Benefica's first league match.|$|E
