40|$|Fiscal {{discipline}} {{is a concern}} in most countries because of a possible spending and deficit bias in present fiscal and political institutions. Recent research has turned to fiscal federalism {{as a source of}} fiscal imbalance and to exploit the variation in fiscal experience. This study allows a comparison of the control regime of decentralized government in Denmark with neighbors Norway and Sweden and with similar analyses of US states. Fiscal adjustments are investigated in the context of responses to shocks. Shocks are measured as deviations from budgeted current surplus, and they motivate an adjustment of tax rates and current expenditure to avoid fiscal imbalance. The econometric results show that local governments in Denmark respond to <b>shocks</b> by <b>compensating</b> adjustment of tax rates and expenditures. The shock responses tend to be asymmetric, in particular for the income tax. Positive shocks hardly affect the income tax rate, while negative shocks induce higher tax rates. We interpret the asymmetry as the result of spending pressure due to redistributive politics, and show that political characteristics are important for tax determination. We conclude that the Danish design of controlling the local public sector avoids fiscal imbalances, but allows a bias towards expansion.

The storage is frictionless as a supply source, but once used, it cannot be filled up instantaneously. The focus application is a power supply network in which the base supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from the base are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to friction, the random surge shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources. Storage, when available, {{can be used to}} compensate, fully or partially, for the surge in demand or loss of supply. The problem of optimal utilization of storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite horizon.

30|$|Cardiovascular {{insufficiency}} {{is characterized}} by an inadequate O 2 delivery relative to the metabolic demands. Shock can be, in the early stages, compensated by autonomic mechanisms, such regional vasoconstriction, {{in an attempt to}} maintain central blood pressure and vital organ perfusion above an anaerobic threshold. In this stage of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock,</b> microcirculatory measures, such as arterial pressure or cardiac output often are inside the range of values defined as normal and, therefore, insensitive as early predictors of subsequent decompensation due to the increased risk of tissue ischemia and subsequent development of multiorgan failure and death. However, microcirculation alterations in muscle and skin blood flow already occur during these early stages and measures of tissue cardiovascular reserve should be a sensitive early warning measure of impending cardiovascular collapse. Thus, a valid method to assess the microcirculatory status, such as the noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) when coupled with a functional hemodynamic monitoring test, such as the vascular occlusion test (VOT), may allow early identification of <b>compensated</b> circulatory <b>shock</b> and thus guide initial resuscitation efforts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} four quantitative {{studies of}} Irish financial and macroeconomic history using long time span of data. The first Chapter examines the joint behaviour of monthly stock market returns in the UK, the US and Ireland in a multivariate DCC-GARCH framework. The {{results indicate that}} UK equity returns influence local (Irish) returns, but not global (US) returns. Estimated correlations between returns in the UK and Ireland and between returns in the UK and US converge over time, pointing to increasing financial integration. The second Chapter provides a comparative study of stock price movements in Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the UK and US during the classical gold standard era. Principal component analysis is used to identify a global shock to equity returns, and the responses it elicits from national equity returns are studied in a VAR. The global shock {{had a significant effect}} on all markets, indicating that they were integrated. Greater exposure to the <b>shock</b> is <b>compensated</b> for by higher returns. The third Chapter studies the effect of UK and Irish aggregate demand and supply shocks on Irish GDP and CPI over the period 1922 - 1979 in a VAR framework. Impulse responses show that UK aggregate demand and supply shocks have large and significant effects on Irish CPI, but smaller effects on real GDP. The important role of UK shocks in the evolution of CPI is illustrated by a historical decomposition, which also indicates that real GDP was driven by idiosyncratic domestic shocks. The fourth Chapter compiles consumption and income data for Ireland from 1944 to 2014, and studies {{the relationship between the two}} series. Having established that the series are cointegrated, an error-correction model is estimated which is stable over the entire 70 -year period.

40|$|Mucosal capnometry {{involves}} the monitoring of partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} (PCO 2) in mucous membranes. Different techniques have been developed and applied for this purpose, including sublingual or buccal sensors, or special gastrointestinal tonometric devices. The primary use of these procedures is to detect <b>compensated</b> <b>shock</b> in critically ill patients or patients undergoing major surgery. Compensatory mechanisms, in the early phases of shock, lead to the redistribution of blood flow towards the vital organs, within ostensibly typical macro-haemodynamic parameters. Unfortunately, this may result in microcirculatory disturbances, which can play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of organ failure. In such circumstances mucosal capnometry monitoring, at different gastrointestinal sites, can provide a sensitive method for the early diagnosis of shock.

Gastrointestinal mucosal capnometry monitoring also helps in determining the severity of ischaemia and is a useful adjunctive in the diagnosis of occlusive splanchnic arterial diseases. The supplementary functional information increases the diagnostic accuracy of radiological techniques, assists in creating individualized treatment plans, and helps in follow-up the results of interventions.

30|$|Recently, {{increased}} interest in a more proactive use of monitoring technologies has emerged, using {{the response to the}} measured variables to a defined stress to unveil the physiological state of the subject. This entire field when applied to the assessment of cardiovascular state is referred to as functional hemodynamic monitoring. Within this context, we can define functional hemodynamic monitoring as the assessment of the dynamic interactions of hemodynamic variables in response to a defined perturbation [1]. Such dynamic responses result in emergent parameters of these commonly reported variables that greatly increase the ability of these measures to define cardiovascular state and predict response to therapy. At the present time, the primary types of functional hemodynamic monitoring for which clinical trials have shown clinical usefulness are related to predicting volume responsiveness and identifying occult cardiovascular insufficiency (<b>compensated</b> <b>shock).</b> The primary form of this approach, predicting volume responsiveness, was reviewed recently in this journal, so will only be briefly described in this article. However, like any form of monitoring parameter, its sensitivity and specificity improves if its pretest probability is higher. Thus, a fundamental concept often ignored by proponents of functional hemodynamic monitoring approaches is the integration of other clinical variables, such as the clinical condition, serum lactate levels, etc., a priori into the decision analysis of cardiovascular instability and its response to therapy. In essence, functional hemodynamic monitoring, though profoundly insightful in its values, is only another parameter that needs to be integrated into the greater view of patient care if its use is to realize its full potential.|$|R

These schemes are based on staggered space discretizations, with an upwinding performed {{with respect to the}} material velocity only. The pressure gradient is defined as the transpose of the natural velocity divergence, and is thus centered. The velocity convection term is built {{in such a way that}} the solutions satisfy a discrete kinetic energy balance, with a remainder term at the left-hand side which is shown to be non-negative under a CFL condition. In the case of the full Euler equations, we solve the internal energy balance, to avoid the space discretization of the total energy, whose expression involves cell-centered and face-centered variables. However, since the residual terms in the kinetic energy balance (probably) do not tend to zero with the time and space steps when computing <b>shock</b> solutions, we <b>compensate</b> them by corrective terms in the internal energy equation, to make the scheme consistent with the conservative form of the continuous problem. We then show, in one space dimension, that, if the scheme converges, the limit is indeed an entropy weak solution of the system. In any case, the discretization preserves by construction the convex of admissible states (positivity of the density and, for Euler equations, of the internal energy), under a CFL condition.

40|$|Introduction: Near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{is a method}} for non-invasive continuous monitoring of muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2). In trauma patients normal parameters of macrocirculation does not exclude the possibility of disturbances in regional perfusion. It {{has been suggested that}} StO 2 levels can detect microcirculatory disturbances early and select patients in states of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock.</b> The purpose of this literature review is to sum up the current literature on the use of NIRS as a diagnostic tool during hypovolemia in trauma patients. Material and methods: The following search words “(Near {{infrared spectroscopy}} OR NIRS) AND (hypovolemia OR shock) ” used in the PubMed database generated 221 articles and lead to the inclusion of 25 articles and reviews. In addition textbooks have been used and the references of the selected articles have been reviewed in order to find additional information. Results and discussion: In the reviewed articles, low StO 2 values have been associated with negative outcomes among trauma patients. Likewise, the need of transfusions and other lifesaving interventions have been related to lower StO 2 values. However, the StO 2 values did not manage to differentiate between milder levels of shock. None of the studies used NIRS as a tool to guide treatment. A major obstacle when comparing studies has been the lack of uniformity regarding application of the NIRS device and study protocols. Conclusion: NIRS technology, although promising, does not yet have enough support in literature to be routinely used as a diagnostic tool among hypovolemic trauma patients. Further studies with greater statistical power are required to determine NIRS future role in trauma care...|$|R
30|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the alterations in VOT StO 2 response {{are related to the}} outcome has been proved in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock by Creteur et al. [13]. Furthermore, when comparing hemodynamically stable patients without infection (controls) and healthy volunteers, these differences in the septic patients were striking. Using near-infrared spectroscopy VOT StO 2, they assessed the slope of increase in StO 2 release as well as the difference between the maximum StO 2 and the StO 2 baseline (Δ). Both the slope of ReO 2 and the Δ were significantly lower in septic patients than in control subjects and healthy volunteers. In the sample of septic patients, the slopes also were significantly lower in the ones who had cardiovascular insufficiency. ReO 2 slopes were higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors and also tended to increase during resuscitation in survivors but not in nonsurvivors. Finally, the ReO 2 slope was found to be a good predictor of ICU death, with a cutoff value of 2.55 %/sec (sensitivity 85 %, specificity 73 %). These data confirm that the alterations in VOT StO 2 ReO 2 are related more to the sepsis process itself and its severity than to mean arterial pressure or vasopressor agent's dose. Importantly, the magnitude of this ReO 2 slope alteration {{is directly related to the}} septic disease and their presence in the first 24 hours of septic process and their persistence of delayed ReO 2 slope is related to the patient's outcome. Still, if the StO 2 ReO 2 does reflect inadequate tissue perfusion then it also should be sensitive of an impending cardiovascular insufficiency state (<b>compensated</b> <b>shock)</b> if matched with other static measures of tissue ischemia.|$|R
40|$|Background: Fluid {{resuscitation}} is {{not only}} used to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) but fluid management is also a cornerstone of treatment for patients with established AKI and renal failure. Ultrafiltration removes volume initially from the intravascular compartment inducing a relative degree of hypovolemia. Normal reflex mechanisms attempt to sustain blood pressure constant despite marked changes in blood volume and cardiac output. Thus, <b>compensated</b> <b>shock</b> with a normal blood pressure is {{a major cause of}} AKI or exacerbations of AKI during ultrafiltration. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE, Google Scholar and PubMed searches. We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2 -day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions. In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated clinical practice recommendations and/or directions for future research. Results: We defined three aspects of fluid monitoring: i) normal and pathophysiological cardiovascular mechanisms; ii) measures of volume responsiveness and impending cardiovascular collapse during volume removal, and; iii) measured indices of each using non-invasive and minimally invasive continuous and intermittent monitoring techniques. The evidence documents that AKI can occur in the setting of normotensive hypovolemia and that under-resuscitation represents a major cause of both AKI and mortality ion critically ill patients. Traditional measures of intravascular volume and ventricular filling do not predict volume responsiveness whereas dynamic functional hemodynamic markers, such as pulse pressure or stroke volume variation during positive pressure breathing or mean flow changes with passive leg raising are highly predictive of volume responsiveness. Numerous commercially-available devices exist that can acquire these signals. Conclusions: Prospective clinical trials using functional hemodynamic markers in the diagnosis and management of AKI and volume status during ultrafiltration need to be performed. More traditional measure of preload be abandoned as marked of volume responsiveness though still useful to assess overall volume status...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is a {{major cause}} of soldier death; it must be quickly {{identified}} and appropriately treated. We developed a prototype patient monitor that noninvasively and continuously determines muscle oxygen saturation (SmO(2)), muscle pH (pHm), and a regional assessment of blood volume (HbT) using near-infrared spectroscopy. Previous demonstration in a model of progressive, central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) showed that SmO(2) provided an early indication of impending hemodynamic instability in humans. In this review, we expand the number of subjects and provide an overview {{of the relationship between the}} muscle and sublingual microcirculation in this model of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock.</b> METHODS: Healthy human volunteers (n = 30) underwent progressive LBNP in 5 -minute intervals. Standard vital signs, along with stroke volume (SV), total peripheral resistance, functional capillary density, SmO(2), HbT, and pHm were measured continuously throughout the study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: SmO(2) and SV significantly decreased during the first level of central hypovolemia (- 15 mm Hg LBNP), whereas vital signs were later indicators of impending cardiovascular collapse. SmO(2) declined with SV and inversely with total peripheral resistance throughout LBNP. HbT was correlated with declining functional capillary density, suggesting vasoconstriction as a cause for decreased SmO(2) and subsequently decreased pHm. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The monitor has been miniaturized to a 58 -g solid-state sensor that is currently being evaluated on patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Early results demonstrate significant decreases in SmO(2) similar to those observed with progressive reductions in central blood volume. As such, this technology has the potential to (1) provide a monitoring capability for both nontraumatic and traumatic hemorrhage and (2) help combat medics triage casualties and monitor patients during lengthy transport from combat areas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{an energy}} price <b>shock</b> should be <b>compensated</b> by {{a reduction in}} energy taxes to mitigate its impact on consumer prices. Such an adjustment is often debated and advocated for redistributive reasons. Our investigation {{is based on a}} model that characterizes second-best optimal taxes in the presence of an externality generated by energy consumption. Energy is used by households as a consumption good and by the productive sector as an input. We calibrate this model on US data and proceed to simulations of this empirical model. We assume that energy prices are subject to an exogenous shock. For different levels of this shock, we calculate the optimal tax mix including income, commodity and energy taxes. We show that optimal energy taxes are affected by redistributive consideration and that optimal energy tax is less than the Pigouvian tax (marginal social damage). The difference is an implicit subsidy representing roughly 10 % of the Pigouvian price. Interestingly, the simulations show that an variation in the energy price only has an almost negligible effect on this percentage. In other words, even a very large oil price increase will only have a small effect on the optimal tax on energy. Nevertheless, it appears that the energy tax is used to mitigate the impact of the energy shock. However, this result is not explained by redistributive consideration but {{by the fact that the}} Pigouvian tax (rate) decreases as the price of energy increases. This is a purely arithmetic adjustment due to the fact that the marginal social dammage does not change. Consequently, the marginal dammage as a percentage of the energy price (which defines the Pigouvian tax rate) decreases as the price increases. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the value of}} ramp-constrained storage in securing reliability and mitigating risk in energy systems with uncertain supply and demand, and friction in the main supply source. Reliability {{is defined as the}} expected discounted cost of energy deficits over an infinite horizon, whereas risk is defined as the probability of incurring a large energy deficit. The nominal supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from the nominal values are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to friction, the random shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources. Storage, on the other hand, is assumed frictionless as a supply source and can be used to compensate for the energy deficit shocks, though it cannot be filled up instantaneously. The storage control problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with the objective of maximizing system reliability. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear {{in the size of the}} energy deficit, the optimal control policy is myopic in the sense that all deficit <b>shocks</b> will be <b>compensated</b> up to the available level of storage. However, when the stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to accept a small energy deficit in the interest of maintaining a higher level of reserve, which can help avoiding a large energy deficit in the future. The value of storage capacity in improving reliability, as well as the effects of the associated optimal policies under different stage costs on risk, i. e., the tail distribution of large energy deficits are examined.

40|$|Systemic infection, major surgery, {{trauma and}} many other causes can lead to {{impaired}} organ function. <b>Compensated</b> <b>shock</b> is not detected by global hemodynamic and oxygen measurements, as they take no account for regional variations. Focus has therefore gradually turned from looking at systemic changes to selective investigations of regional blood flow and ischemia. This thesis presents a series of experiments evaluating new application and validation of various monitoring techniques. An experimental porcine model with anesthetized and invasively monitored animals was used. The circulatory interventions included endotoxin infusion (septic shock), aortic constriction and selective clamping of splanchnic arteries. The aim was to compare air with saline tonometry, to validate the intraperitoneal use of tonometry and to reexamine the use of endoluminal reflectance pulse oxymetry. To investigate the relative contributions of regional blood flow and detection of ischemia, measurements of hepatic venous oxygen saturation (ShvO 2), lactate concentrations and PCO 2 gap were used. Our findings {{support the use of}} air instead of saline as the preferred technique for tonometric measurements. With the intraperitoneal application of tonometry we gain more information on regional aspects of the splanchnic circulation, and {{it appears to be a}} reliable monitoring option for early detection of ischemia in the small intestine. Measurements of ShvO 2 will give an overall reflection of the intestinal circulation. The sigmoid colonic pulse oximetry showed a non-linear response in relation to regional blood flow, and will therefore not be able to detect gradual changes in oxygen saturation. Determination of the regional to endtidal PCO 2 gap might prove valuable for monitoring of the intestinal circulation. Because of sophisticated interactions between portal and hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic compensation for regional ischemia, a combination of monitoring techniques might be needed. The results of this study will hopefully encourage clinical evaluation of intraperitoneal tonometry and endtidal PCO 2 gap recordings for non-invasive, semi-continuous, trend monitoring of the splanchnic circulation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine whether}} {{hypovolemia}} {{is an important}} cause of the acidosis in children with severe malaria. DESIGN: Prospective phase 1 study examining the safety of volume expansion using detailed hemodynamic monitoring. SETTING: High-dependency unit of Kilifi District Hospital {{on the coast of}} Kenya. PATIENTS: Kenyan children admitted with clinical features of severe malaria (impaired consciousness or deep breathing) complicated by acidosis (base excess of less than - 8). Three groups were considered: severe malarial anemia plus acidosis if hemoglobin of < 5 mg/dL and base excess less than - 8; moderate malaria acidosis if the base excess was between - 8 and - 15; severe malaria acidosis if the base excess was less than - 15. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received between 10 and 40 mL/kg of either 0. 9 % normal saline or 4. 5 % human albumin solution. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 53 children were recruited, and all had evidence of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock</b> at admission, with tachycardia, tachypnea, and prolonged capillary refill time. Mean central venous pressure (se) at admission was 2. 9 cm H(2) O (0. 5 cm H(2) O); in the severe malaria acidosis group, 44 % had hypotension (systolic blood pressure of < 80 mm Hg). Improvements of hemodynamic indices and a reduction in acidosis followed administration of either saline or albumin. By 8 hrs, mean central venous pressure had increased to 7. 5 cm H(2) O (0. 5 cm H(2) O, F = 34. 4, p <. 001) and was associated with a reduction in mean respiratory rate from 49 to 41 breaths/min (2 to 1 breaths/min, respectively; F = 7. 0; p =. 009), a reduction in tachycardia from 151 to 141 beats/min (5 to 3 beats/min, respectively; F = 3. 4; p =. 06), and a reduction in capillary refill time. No child developed evidence of the life threatening complications of pulmonary edema and increased intracranial pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Volume depletion is present at admission in the majority of children with severe malaria complicated by acidosis. Volume expansion corrects the hemodynamic abnormalities and is associated with improved organ function and reduction in acidosis. Formal trials of volume expansion are needed to determine whether volume expansion will reduce mortality...|$|R
40|$|The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1 - 4) {{cause the}} most {{prevalent}} mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans worldwide. In 2009, Nicaragua experienced the largest dengue epidemic in over a decade, marked by unusual clinical presentation, as observed in two prospective studies of pediatric dengue in Managua. From August 2009 -January 2010, 212 dengue cases were confirmed among 396 study participants at the National Pediatric Reference Hospital. In our parallel community-based cohort study, 170 dengue cases were recorded in 2009 - 10, compared to 13 - 65 cases in 2004 - 9. In both studies, significantly more patients experienced "compensated shock" (poor capillary refill plus cold extremities, tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or weak pulse) in 2009 - 10 than in previous years (42. 5 % [90 / 212] vs. 24. 7 % [82 / 332] in the hospital study (p< 0. 001) and 17 % [29 / 170] vs. 2. 2 % [4 / 181] in the cohort study (p< 0. 001). Signs of poor peripheral perfusion presented significantly earlier (1 - 2 days) in 2009 - 10 than in previous years according to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In the hospital study, 19. 8 % of subjects were transferred to intensive care, compared to 7. 1 % in previous years - similar to the cohort study. DENV- 3 predominated in 2008 - 9, 2009 - 10, and 2010 - 11, and full-length sequencing revealed no major genetic changes from 2008 - 9 to 2010 - 11. In 2008 - 9 and 2010 - 11, typical dengue was observed; only in 2009 - 10 was unusual presentation noted. Multivariate analysis revealed only " 2009 - 10 " as a significant risk factor for Dengue Fever with <b>Compensated</b> <b>Shock.</b> Interestingly, circulation of pandemic influenza A-H 1 N 1 2009 in Managua was shifted such that it overlapped with the dengue epidemic. We hypothesize that prior influenza A H 1 N 1 2009 infection may have modulated subsequent DENV infection, and initial results of an ongoing study suggest increased risk of shock among children with anti-H 1 N 1 - 2009 antibodies. This study demonstrates that parameters other than serotype, viral genomic sequence, immune status, and sequence of serotypes {{can play a role}} in modulating dengue disease outcome...|$|R
