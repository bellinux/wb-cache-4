5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking</b> of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracking</b> caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

40|$|The <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> {{is one of}} the {{fracture}} phenomena for the major structure components in nuclear power plant. During the operation of a power plant, <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> are initiated and grown especially in dissimilar weldment of primary loop components. In particular, <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> usually occurs when the following three factors exist at the same time: susceptible material, corrosive environment, and tensile stress (residual stress included). Thus, residual stress becomes a critical factor for <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> when it is difficult to improve the material corrosivity of the components and their environment under operating conditions. In this study, <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> were artificially produced on STS 304 pipe itself by control of welding residual stress. We used the instrumented indentation technique and 3 D FEM analysis (using ANSYS 12) to evaluate the residual stress values in the GTAW area. We used the custom-made device for fabricating the <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> in the inner STS 304 pipe wall.

25|$|Protective films can {{be applied}} to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to {{increase}} corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed.

A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.|$|E

In order to improve the defect signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for the crack-tip echoes, we have applied the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). Three welded specimens of austenitic stainless steel have been examined, where <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> with different depth had been artificially introduced.

40|$|Eddy current {{testing has}} become a widely used {{nondestructive}} technique for material testing and evaluation. This technique depends on {{the interaction between the}} impedance of the test coil and the material as the probe scans the surface of a material under investigation. By measuring the change in impedance of the test coil, the size of an imperfection in the material can be determined. In this project, the first aim of the research was to investigate and develop the use of the eddy current technique to detect <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> (SCC) in the bore of fastener holes. Specimens were scanned with the probe moving in and out the hole to produce a signal of the eddy current response. In addition, due to the skin depth effect, the operating frequency was also taken into consideration as an important parameter. A calibration standard test piece was prepared to represent SCC around a fastener hole, with the cracks lying in a plane parallel to the surface. Data from eddy current tests on real <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> has been used to develop an eddy current calibration curve for predicting <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> lengths in larger components. The second aim of the project was to use the eddy current technique to study SCC crack growth in high strength aluminium alloy 7075 -W under both tensile and compressive loading conditions. The importance of parameters such as heat treatment, grain shape, grain aspect ratio, component of stress, threshold stress intensity and microstructure were all taken into consideration. The SCC development was found to follow an intergranular path, which strongly depended on the microstructure of the material. Tests were carried out using double cantilever beam specimens to measure the threshold stress intensity, Kiscc, below which SCC would not occur. The specimens showed evidence of exfoliation corrosion at the surface and corrosion product wedging within the <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks,</b> which caused further crack growth at the low applied <b>stresses.</b> <b>Stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> were found to grow in 7075 -W under high compressive loading, whereas control tests without compressive test stress produced only exfoliation <b>corrosion</b> and no <b>crack</b> growth. The mechanism of SCC in both tensile and compressive loading was thought to be anodic dissolution of metal at the crack tip, with protective films being disrupted by dislocation movement with the formation of active slip-steps.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new testing apparatus tor <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> research. In this linearly increasing stress test (LIST) method, plain un-notched specimens are simultaneously exposed to an environment {{and subjected to}} an applied stress increasing linearly at a controlled rate. Experiments are repeated at various applied stress rates and the parameters measured include SCC initiation stress (the stress at which <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> start to propagate), fracture stress and average crack velocity. The LIST test {{is similar to the}} constant extension rate test (CERT) test, with the essential difference that the LIST test is load-controlled whereas the CERT test is displacement-controlled. The LIST test is particularly aimed at service conditions of loaded parts and structures; that is, service conditions described as load-controlled. This paper describes the design, construction and operation of the test apparatus and some typical results are given to illustrate its performance. Experiments have been conducted using as-quenched 3. 5 Ni-Cr-Mo-V turbine rotor steel specimens in aerated distilled water at 90 -degrees-C at stress rates varying from 0. 00034 MPa s- 1 to 2. 08 MPa s- 1. The crack velocity increased with increasing applied stress rate. The fracture surfaces produced by scc were predominantly intergranular. The scc initiated at stresses significantly below yield stress. Up to initiation stress, the CERT and LIST test are essentially identical. Thereafter, once a <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> has initiated, there is every advantage in quickly finishing the test. This is seen as an advantage of the LIST test. In the LIST test, once <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> have initiated, the time to failure is controlled only by the crack propagation rate and when the crack reaches a critical length, rapid failure occurs, whereas there can be quite a long period in a CERT test after crack initiation while the <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> yaw open. Thus the LIST method may be quicker than the CERT tests. An electronic servocontrol system was incorporated into the LIST apparatus to remove small load and strain transients...|$|R
