25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> is {{identified}} as a potential key chemical intermediate for production of fuels from biomass resources. Carbohydrate fractions in biomass such as cellulose undergo sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation {{in the presence of}} metal catalysts to produce <b>sorbitol.</b> Complete reduction of <b>sorbitol</b> opens the way to alkanes, such as hexane, which {{can be used as a}} biofuel. Hydrogen required for this reaction can be produced by aqueous phase catalytic reforming of <b>sorbitol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> is a sugar substitute, {{and when}} used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. <b>Sorbitol</b> is about 60% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> {{often is}} used in modern {{cosmetics}} as a humectant and thickener. It is also used in mouthwash and toothpaste. Some transparent gels can be made only with <b>sorbitol,</b> because of its high refractive index.|$|E
25|$|People with {{untreated}} {{celiac disease}} often present <b>sorbitol</b> malabsorption, {{as a result}} of the small bowel damage. <b>Sorbitol</b> malabsorption is an important cause for persisting symptoms in patients already on a gluten-free diet. The <b>sorbitol</b> hydrogen breath test has been suggested as a tool to detect celiac disease because of a strict correlation between cut-off value and intestinal lesions. Nevertheless, although it may be indicated for research purposes, it is not yet recommended as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{classified}} as a sugar alcohol; that is, it {{can be derived from}} a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and <b>sorbitol.</b> Mannitol and <b>sorbitol</b> are isomers, the only difference being the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> based polyols {{are used}} in the {{production}} of polyurethane foam for the construction industry.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} <b>sorbitol</b> and {{potassium}} nitrate has found some success {{as an amateur}} solid rocket fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> is {{also used}} in the {{manufacture}} of softgel capsules to store single doses of liquid medicines.|$|E
25|$|Sugar alcohols, such as maltitol, erythritol, <b>sorbitol,</b> {{mannitol}} and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, are sweeteners made {{by reducing}} sugars.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> is {{fermented}} in {{the colon}} and produces short- chain fatty acids, which are beneficial to overall colon health.|$|E
25|$|It {{is being}} studied along with {{naltrexone}} and <b>sorbitol</b> for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} {{calories}} {{in a piece}} of 5 gum. The gum contains aspartame (with phenylalanine), acesulfame-potassium, soy lecithin, <b>sorbitol,</b> mannitol and other sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|Even polyols {{prepared}} from {{renewable sources}} like vegetable oils, derivatives of vegetable oil, <b>sorbitol,</b> cellulose, etc. are also reported for preparing polyurethane coatings.|$|E
25|$|The above {{chemical}} reaction is exothermic, and 1.5 moles of <b>sorbitol</b> generate approximately 1 mole of hexane. When hydrogen is co-fed, no {{carbon dioxide is}} produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of sugar substitutes approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including <b>sorbitol</b> and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to <b>sorbitol.</b> Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{can bind to}} {{agents in}} the {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate with <b>sorbitol</b> (Kayexalate) has been approved for this use and can be given by mouth or rectally. However, careful clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of sodium polystyrene are lacking, and use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate, particularly if with high <b>sorbitol</b> content, is uncommonly but convincingly associated with colonic necrosis. There are no systematic studies (>6 months) looking at the long-term safety of this medication. Another medication {{by the name of}} patiromer was approved in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Aldose reductase is {{the first}} enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway {{responsible}} for the reduction of glucose to <b>sorbitol,</b> {{as well as the}} reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much <b>sorbitol</b> trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Aldose reductase inhibitors, which are substances that prevent or slow the action of aldose reductase, are currently being investigated as a way to prevent or delay these complications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> {{is used as}} a {{cryoprotectant}} additive (mixed with sucrose {{and sodium}} polyphosphates) in the manufacture of surimi, a processed fish paste. It is also used as a humectant in some cigarettes.|$|E
25|$|A stool {{culture can}} detect the bacterium, {{although}} it is not a routine test and so must be specifically requested. The sample is cultured on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar, or the variant cefixime potassium tellurite sorbitol-MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC). On SMAC agar O157 colonies appear clear due to their inability to ferment <b>sorbitol,</b> while the colonies of the usual sorbitol-fermenting serotypes of E. coli appear red. <b>Sorbitol</b> nonfermenting colonies are tested for the somatic O157 antigen before being confirmed as E. coli O157. Like all cultures, diagnosis is time-consuming with this method; swifter diagnosis is possible using quick E. coli DNA extraction method plus PCR techniques. Newer technologies using fluorescent and antibody detection are also under development.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its {{use as a}} sugar {{substitute}} in reduced-sugar foods, <b>Sorbitol</b> is also used as a humectant in cookies and low-moisture foods like peanut butter and fruit preserves. In baking, it is also valuable because it acts as a plasticizer, and slows down the staling process.|$|E
25|$|Foods {{containing}} <b>sorbitol,</b> {{present in}} some diet drinks and foods, and occurring naturally in some stone fruits, or xylitol, present in some berries, and other polyols (sugar alcohols), such as erythritol, mannitol, and other ingredients that end with -tol, commonly added as artificial sweeteners in commercial foods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> is {{referred}} to as a nutritive sweetener because it provides dietary energy: 2.6 kilocalories (11 kilojoules) per gram versus the average 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates. It is often used in diet foods (including diet drinks and ice cream), mints, cough syrups, and sugar-free chewing gum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> may be {{synthesised}} via a glucose reduction {{reaction in}} which the aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by aldose reductase. Glucose reduction {{is the first step}} of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications.|$|E
25|$|Cathartics were {{postulated}} {{to decrease}} absorption {{by increasing the}} expulsion of the poison from the gastrointestinal tract. There {{are two types of}} cathartics used in poisoned patients; saline cathartics (sodium sulfate, magnesium citrate, magnesium sulfate) and saccharide cathartics (<b>sorbitol).</b> They do not appear to improve patient outcome and are no longer recommended.|$|E
25|$|Agents {{are added}} to {{suppress}} the tendency of toothpaste to dry into a powder. Included are various sugar alcohols, such as glycerol, <b>sorbitol,</b> or xylitol, or related derivatives, such as 1,2-propylene glycol and polyethyleneglycol. Strontium chloride or potassium nitrate is included in some toothpastes to reduce sensitivity. Sodium polyphosphate is added to minimize the formation of tartar.|$|E
25|$|Preventing {{recurrence}} of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or {{the addition of}} a diuretic (such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide). Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and <b>sorbitol</b> (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} {{consequences of}} fructose malabsorption include increased osmotic load, rapid bacterial fermentation, altered gastrointestinal motility, {{the formation of}} mucosal biofilm and altered profile of bacteria. These effects are additive with other short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates such as <b>sorbitol.</b> The clinical significance of these events depends upon {{the response of the}} bowel to such changes. Some effects of fructose malabsorption are decreased tryptophan, folic acid and zinc in the blood.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the <b>sorbitol</b> added to sodium {{polystyrene}} sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Fructose {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25–50g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose malabsorption absorb less than 25g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of fructose and <b>sorbitol</b> seems to increase malabsorption of fructose. Fructose {{that has not been}} adequately absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids. This abnormal increase in hydrogen may be detectable with the hydrogen breath test.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{is used as}} a novel {{approach}} for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One hypothesis is that chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. However, chewing gum is sometimes considered to {{contribute to the development of}} stomach ulcers. It stimulates the stomach to secrete acid and the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes that aren't required. In some cases, when consuming large quantities of gum containing <b>sorbitol,</b> gas and/or diarrhea may occur.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{commonly}} produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, {{the transformation of}} starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers <b>sorbitol</b> and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. <b>Sorbitol,</b> an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of {{infectious}} diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding {{for at least}} six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS are not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases; however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as <b>sorbitol</b> (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g. milk, <b>sorbitol)</b> is stopped.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener <b>sorbitol</b> has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
25|$|Flavor {{delivery}} is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components {{due to the}} physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum’s ingredients. Entropy is {{a key player in}} the process of flavor delivery; because some gum components are more soluble in saliva than gum base and because over time flavor components desire to increase their entropy by becoming dispersed in the less ordered system of the mouth than in the more ordered system of the gum bolus, flavor delivery occurs. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or <b>sorbitol</b> and maltitol have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers’ saliva and slide down the esophagus, they are no longer retained in the gum base or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved and chewed out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10-15 minute into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the gum base longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum {{and the end of the}} chew.|$|E
500|$|A {{short-lived}} {{increase in}} seizure frequency may occur during illness or if ketone levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or {{the child is}} losing weight. Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even [...] "sugar-free" [...] food can contain carbohydrates such as maltodextrin, <b>sorbitol,</b> starch and fructose. The <b>sorbitol</b> content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.|$|E
