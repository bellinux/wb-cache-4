40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} {{developing}} negative µ and negative refraction (NRI) 3 D isotropic <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials is addressed. First {{of all the}} necessary symmetries required to guar-antee an isotropic behavior are analyzed. Secondly an homogenization procedure taking into account spatial dispersion is developed for magnetic <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials. It is shown that this homogenization also accounts for all kind of waves (electromagnetic and magnetoinductive) previously reported in negative-µ <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials. Finally, the possibility of developing isotropic NRI metamaterials from chiral <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> resonators (SRRs) is discussed in detail In spite of many efforts in this direction (see e. g. [1], [2], [3]) the depelopment of practical 3 D isotropic metamaterials is still a challenging issue. This issue will be addressed during the presentation, starting from the generalization of the well known <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> resonator (SRR) configuration. Cubic arrangements of such elements will be considered, and the necessary spatial symetries that guarantee an isotropic behavior in three dimensions will be discussed. From this analysis some proposals to develop periodic and isotropic negative-µ <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials will come out [4], [5].
