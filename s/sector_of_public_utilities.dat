40|$|The {{high quality}} of local public {{services}} represents a far off goal, despite the efforts towards modernisation that for over two decades have involved the entire public apparatus. Administrative modernisation in Italy has been driven mainly by the legislator, that has introduced numerous and contradictory laws and regulations over the past twenty-five years, thus creating confusion that still undermines the efficiency of this branch of law. Moreover, as legislation is external to organisations (in this case public administrations), it cannot be deemed in its specificity as a determining factor {{with a view to}} continuous improvement. Indeed, considering that the Public Administration was created in order to exercise functions of public interest as well as to satisfy the basic needs of citizens, the real process of change aimed at finding the connection between public services and fundamental interests, between local government bodies and citizens, between the state organisation and general well-being must take into consideration that regulatory intervention does not in itself guarantee the commencement of innovation and modernisation processes. The general crisis regarding efficiency that, today more than ever, affects the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> shows, among other things, that the logical law-making process in the field has often disregarded broader boundaries and new policy areas, {{to the detriment of the}} general interest that should be sought when exercising and organising any public service. Indeed, notwithstanding the apparent goal of efficiency, the main issue determining the various regulatory interventions in this field has almost exclusively been concerned with the question of whether public intervention in the management and modalities of appointment of the same public utilities was appropriate or not. Said sector, in Italy as in England, has thus become a battlefield between supporters of the supremacy of market and competition on the one hand, and supporters of control and of the indispensable role of the public power on the other hand; between those who believe public law tools and institutions should be applied and those who believe that private law tools should be applied; between instances to open up to global markets and barriers for the protection of municipal traditions; between the need for uniform rules and instances of decentralisation. The analysis on the complex framework concerning local public services shows that the paradoxical dilemma of our country, even today, is managing to combine the principles of legality and efficiency, since the excessive formalism and exasperation of procedures of administrative activities have led to a substantial lack of interest in the results of the management thereof. On the contrary, quality can become a key factor within an organisation only if all the persons concerned at different levels are willing and actually involved and, most importantly, provided that greater attention is given to the needs expressed by the community. The point of view of the private user of the service is, indeed, the resource on which the public entity in charge of the provision of services can actually base the improvement of the service provided. In this field, citizen satisfaction should be the guiding star for good administration and it should also be instrumental for the improvement of the public service representing a supporting factor in the organisation and provision of the services entrusted to the public administration. Computerization could represent a valuable aid in said field: it offers an opportunity for a change of perspective within the organisation of the public sector by providing a relocation of the central needs of the "machine" from which public services originate, and through which they are provided. It is well known that e-government is the result of the application of Information and Communication Technologies to the processes of change within the Government and it enables a transparent digitisation of the same: it is not only a matter of technology, but also a matter of service, a new way of providing old services and an opportunity to provide new ones with the aim of attaining a higher degree of efficiency by improving performance standards. Therefore, e-government is a tool for reforming the public sector, intended to confer a new role to the public administration different from the traditional role forged on the top-down structure that has led it to be superior and detached from local communities and citizens. Through the use of ICTs, the administration can dismantle traditional barriers, which for decades have hindered the actual implementation of the principles of transparency, economy, efficiency, effectiveness and simplicity, as well as the implementation of programs apt to provide public services inspired by a result-driven logic. ...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation is {{a widely}} used but much contested concept. This contestation has a large variety of {{dimensions}} and on-going debates. One of the debates focuses on economic globalisation and a rebalancing of {{the relations between the}} private and public sector that is taking place during the last three decades. Neo-liberalism, dominant in the policy agenda of the leading world powers during this period of time, advocates the necessity of privatisation, including privatisation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> services. However, the international outcomes of privatisation policies associated with the promotion of market relations and private investments in the public sector have not been sufficiently examined in empirical research. Although globalisation debates refer to international regulation, competition and the concentration of capital, there is a paucity of detailed empirically focused study on patterns of ownership and what they mean to a changing international order, especially with respect to privatised utilities. The thesis opens up these themes in a focused way, analysing outcomes of water privatisation and electricity privatisation worldwide. It draws on a comprehensive database held by the Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) that enables an empirically based analysis of arguments about the outcomes of utilities' privatisation {{in the light of the}} globalisation debate. The main methodology used as a basis for a critical assessment of theories of globalisation is social network analysis. The thesis is mostly concerned with the international aspects of the privatisation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities.</b> It begins by arguing that the privatisation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> services worldwide should be located within debates on globalisation. The thesis then presents a reinterpretation of main globalisation trends, specifically the processes related to the internationalisation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> services, as an emerging modern form of economic colonialism. To develop this argument the thesis comprises a variety of dimensions. First, three sets of debates are reviewed, globalisation, the internationalisation of capital and colonialism. In the course of this analysis attention is drawn to the concentration of economic power and the international dominance of three economic blocs - the North America, Western Europe and Japan. The second dimension of the thesis is the presentation of an analytic framework to analyse the recent developments of privatisation worldwide. Drawing on the achievements of social network analysis a methodology for examining the outcomes of privatisation in relation to ownership and the patterns of concentration that have emerged is developed. This part of the thesis transforms the research questions that arise from the examination of debates about globalisation and privatisation and related developments. Here a set of hypotheses is developed to examine the process of privatisation worldwide, with reference to the electricity and water sector. With this methodology outlined, the third dimension is present. In this section of the thesis particular explanatory dimensions of the process of globalisation are examined, specifically geography, culture, economy, and politics. Using SNA techniques that build on the first phase of the quantitative analysis which examines ownership concentration and identifies the presence of the star-like pattern of ownership in all studied <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities,</b> a rich vein of evidence of the key features of privatisation worldwide is presented. The broad themes of this analysis are then drawn together in an assessment section. This assessment shows that economic globalisation reflects economic asymmetries and is related to political status, and that historical links make a considerable impact on the global ownership structures that have emerged in public services after privatisation. A key conclusion is that public services are being transformed as part of global capitalist system and that under the cover of globalisation a particular form of economic colonialism is emerging - the neo-colonialism that is centred on a few major western economies: The United States, France and the United Kingdom...|$|R
