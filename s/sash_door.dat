2500|$|The current capitol {{building}} was built from 1850 to 1851, with Barachias Holt as supervising architect. Holt, originally from Exeter, Maine, {{was a master}} mechanic by trade.

60|$|So saying, Joshua {{conducted}} me {{to a small}} <b>sashed</b> <b>door,</b> opening under a porch amply mantled by honeysuckle and clematis, into a parlour {{of moderate}} size; the furniture of which, in plainness and excessive cleanliness, bore the characteristic marks of the sect to which the owner belonged.|$|R
60|$|Neither {{of these}} were {{precisely}} what Jimmy had hoped for, his preference really being for the general management of an automobile manufactory or possibly something in the airplane line. <b>Sash,</b> <b>door</b> and blind sounded extremely prosaic and uninteresting to Mr. Torrance. The mail-order proposition, while possibly more interesting, struck him as being too trifling and unimportant.|$|E
60|$|There {{were only}} two {{concerns}} advertising for general managers in the issue which Jimmy scanned; one ad called for an experienced executive to assume the general management of an old established <b>sash,</b> <b>door</b> and blind factory; the other insisted upon a man with mail-order experience {{to take charge of}} the mail-order department of a large department store.|$|E

60|$|As {{he formed}} this resolution, diffident {{of his own}} power to keep it, and seeking that {{firmness}} in flight which was every moment shaken by his continuing within hearing of Edith's voice, he hastily rushed from his apartment by the little closet and the <b>sashed</b> <b>door</b> {{which led to the}} garden.|$|R

60|$|Springing {{from the}} bed, she tried the other {{door of her}} room, which was level with the wainscoting, and not readily {{observed}} by a person unfamiliar with the house. It yielded to her hand, and she {{knew there was a}} whole suite of empty rooms thus communicating with one another. It was one of those summer nights that are never absolutely dark, and there was a full moon, so that she had light enough to throw off her conspicuous white habit, all scorched and singed as it was, and to put on her dark blue cloth one, with her camlet cloak and hood. She made up a small bundle of clothes, took her purse, which was well filled with guineas and silver, and moved softly to the door. Hide and seek had taught her all the modes of eluding observation, and with her walking shoes in her hand, and her feet slippered, she noiselessly crept through one empty room after another, and descended the stair into her own lobby, where she knew how to open the <b>sash</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

50|$|Early in the 20th century August H. Stange, {{owner of}} the Stange <b>Sash,</b> <b>Door,</b> and Blind Company in Merrill, Wisconsin, began to {{understand}} that the forests around Merrill could no longer support his need for lumber. For economic reasons, loggers had clear-cut their land without reforestation, and the demand for timber was approaching its supply. On average, the Merrill plant needed 125,000 board feet of lumber each day. Stange may also have known that the United States Forest Service had begun to award large timber contracts to lumber companies in the Pacific Northwest. For example, the Oregon Lumber Company would soon receive an award of sale of 124 million board feet of lumber in 1916.|$|E
