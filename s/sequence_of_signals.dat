We investigate this claim using a simple model of Bayesian learning. Two individuals with di. erent priors observe the same infinite <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> about some underlying parameter.

In contrast, we look at {{an environment in which}} individuals are uncertain about the inter- pretation of signals, meaning that they have non-degenerate probability distributions over the conditional distribution of signals given the underlying parameter. When priors on the parameter and the conditional distribution of signals have full support, we show the following: (1) Individuals will never agree, even after observing the same infinite <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals.</b> (2) Before observing the signals, they believe with probability 1 that their posteri- ors about the underlying parameter will fail to converge. (3) Observing the same (infinite) <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> may lead to a divergence of opinion rather than the typically-presumed convergence. We then characterize the conditions for asymptotic agreement under “approx- imate certainty”–i. e., {{as we look at the}} limit where uncertainty about the interpretation of the signals disappears. When the family of probability distributions of signals given the parameter has rapidly-varying tails (such as the normal or the exponential distributions), approximate certainty restores asymptotic agreement. However, when the family of proba- bility distributions has regularly-varying tails (such as the Pareto, the log-normal, and the t-distributions), asymptotic agreement does not obtain even in the limit as the amount of uncertainty disappears. We also discuss how lack of common priors implied by the type of learning in this paper interacts with economic behavior in various different situations, including games of common interest, coordination, asset trading and bargaining. asymptotic disagreement, Bayesian learning, merging of opinions. ...|$|E

In this paper we present an efficient fault simulator for template-based asynchronous circuits which is based on checking <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> in templates.
