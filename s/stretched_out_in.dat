25|$|Lucero was {{connected}} to the Mk. VIII transmitter, and triggered its own 5µs signal every fifth transmission of the radar. The IFF Mk. III in the remote aircraft contained a receiver circuit fed into a transmitter, causing any received signal to be amplified and <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> time. This signal was received by the responder side of Lucero, which mixed it in with the signal from the Mk. VIII's own receiver. Since the Lucero antenna was omni-directional, the returns were continuous around the entire face of the display and unrelated to the position of the main dish. The result was a series of line segments, spaced every 10 degrees around the display.|$|E
500|$|A {{documentary}} film, Moscow Strikes Back, ( [...] , [...] "Rout of the German Troops near Moscow"), {{was made}} during the battle and rapidly released in the Soviet Union. It was taken to America and shown at the Globe in New York in August 1942. The New York Times reviewer commented that [...] "The savagery of that retreat is a spectacle to stun the mind." [...] As well as the Moscow parade and battle scenes, the film included images of German atrocities committed during the occupation, [...] "the naked and slaughtered children <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> ghastly rows, the youths dangling limply in the cold from gallows that were rickety, but strong enough." ...|$|E

It is woman for half its length; {{but the other}} half, from thighs to feet, <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a fish's tail. But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove, for they believe it is holy. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the Egyptians some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." ...|$|E

2500|$|In CPA, on {{the other}} hand, an ultrashort laser pulse is <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> time prior to {{introducing}} it to the gain medium using a pair of gratings that are arranged so that the low-frequency component of the laser pulse travels a shorter path than the high-frequency component does. After going through the grating pair, the laser pulse becomes positively chirped, that is, the high-frequency component lags behind the low-frequency component, and has longer pulse duration than the original {{by a factor of}} 103 to 105. Then the stretched pulse, whose intensity is sufficiently low compared with the intensity limit of gigawatts per square centimeter, is safely introduced to the gain medium and amplified by a factor 106 or more. [...] Finally, the amplified laser pulse is recompressed back to the original pulse width through the reversal process of stretching, achieving orders of magnitude higher peak power than laser systems could generate before the invention of CPA.|$|E

[...] The report went on to describe abuse of the prisoners {{at the hands of}} their American captors: [...] "'They confined us like sheep,' the newly freed Saad Naif, 38, said of the Americans. 'They hit people. They humiliated people.'" [...] In response, U.S. Brigadier-General Janis Karpinski, at the time in charge of all U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, claimed that prisoners were being treated [...] "humanely and fairly." [...] The AP report also stated that as of November 1, 2003, there were two legal cases pending against U.S. military personnel, one involving the beating of an Iraqi prisoner, the other about the death of a prisoner in custody.|$|E

On this trek, near the Wadi el Kefrein, a group of Arabs joined the light horse units.|$|E
