40|$|Although many herbal {{medicines}} {{are effective}} {{in the treatment of}} hyperpigmentation, the potency of different constituents remains unknown. In this work, more than 20, 000 herbal ingredients from 453 herbs were docked into the crystal structures of adenylyl cyclase and a human homology tyrosinase model using Surflex-Dock. These two enzymes are responsible for melanin production and inhibition of them may attain a skin-whitening effect superior to currently available agents. The essential drug properties for topical formulation of the herbal ingredients, including skin permeability, sensitization, irritation, corrosive and carcinogenic properties were predicted by Dermwin, Skin Sensitization Alerts (SSA), <b>Skin</b> <b>Irritation</b> <b>Corrosion</b> Rules Estimation Tool (SICRET) and Benigni/Bossa rulebase module of Toxtree. Moreover, similarity ensemble and pharmacophore mapping approaches were used to forecast other potential targets for these herbal compounds by the software, SEArch and PharmMapper. Overall, this study predicted seven compounds to have advanced drug-like properties over the well-known effective tyrosinase inhibitors, arbutin and kojic acid. These seven compounds have the highest potential for further in vitro and in vivo investigation with the aim of developing safe and high-efficacy skin-whitening agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of tyrosinase inhibitors is important, {{not only for}} the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation disorders, such as melasma, but also for the production of cosmetic whitening effects. The aim of this study was the in silico prediction of the naturally occurring lead compounds in three commonly used skin-whitening herbs: Ampelopsis japonica, Lindera aggregata, and Ginkgo biloba. The active ingredients responsible for the whitening effect of these herbs remain largely unknown. The tyrosinase binding affinities and skin permeation, skin irritancy, and corrosive properties of 43 natural constituents of the three herbs were predicted by docking simulations using Surflex-Dock and the QSAR-based Dermal Permeability Coefficient Program (DERMWIN (TM)) and <b>Skin</b> <b>Irritation</b> <b>Corrosion</b> Rules Estimation Tool (SICRET) implemented in Toxtree. Nine constituents of the three herbs were found to have more advanced binding energies than the gold standard whitening agents, arbutin and kojic acid, but 40 were indicative of at least one skin sensitization alert, and many exhibited poor skin permeability. Linderagalactone c and (+) -n-methyllaurotetanine were found to have the strongest prospects for use in topical formulations, as they achieved high predicted tyrosinase binding scores and displayed good skin permeation properties and minimal potential for skin sensitization and irritation...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{cosmetic}} compounds with preservative properties {{available in}} the market pose some risks concerning safety, such as the possibility of causing sensitization. Due {{to the fact that}} there are few options, the proper development of new molecules with this purpose is needed. Xylitol is a natural sugar, and the antimicrobial properties of xylitol-derived compounds have already been described in the literature. C- 8 xylitol monoester and xylitol phosphate esters may be useful for the development of skincare products. As an initial screen for safety of chemicals, the combination of in silico methods and in vitro testing can aid in prioritizing resources in toxicological investigations while reducing the ethical and monetary costs that are related to animal and human testing. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of C- 8 xylitol monoester and xylitol phosphate esters regarding carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, skin and eye irritation/corrosion and sensitization through alternative methods. For the initial safety assessment, quantitative structure-activity relationship methodology was used. The prediction of the parameters carcinogenicity/mutagenicity, skin and eye irritation/corrosion and sensitization was generated from the chemical structure. The analysis also comprised physical-chemical properties, Cramer rules, threshold of toxicological concern and Michael reaction. In silico results of candidate molecules were compared to 19 compounds with preservative properties that are {{available in the}} market. Additionally, in vitro tests (Ames test for mutagenicity, cytotoxicity and phototoxicity tests and hen's egg test - chorioallantoic membrane for irritation) were performed to complement the evaluation. In silico evaluation of both molecules presented no structural alerts related to eye and <b>skin</b> <b>irritation,</b> <b>corrosion</b> and sensitization, but some alerts for micronucleus and carcinogenicity were detected. However, by comparison, C- 8 xylitol monoester, xylitol phosphate esters showed similar or better results than the compounds available in the market. Concerning experimental data, phototoxicity and mutagenicity results were negative. As expected for compounds with preservative activity, xylitol-derived substances presented positive result in cytotoxicity test. In hen's egg test, both molecules were irritants. Our results suggested that xylitol-derived compounds appear to be suitable candidates for preservative systems in cosmetics...|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} has been the development of test methods that use cultured human cells. Human epidermal keratinocytes have been cultured to mimic the human epidermis, and are used to measure <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and dermal <b>corrosion.</b> This method has been accepted by the EU and is intended to replace the Draize rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> test.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{refer to}} {{localized}} toxic effects {{resulting from a}} topical exposure of the skin to a substance. Human skin equivalent tests {{can be used to}} replace animal-based corrosive and irritative studies. EpiDerm from Mattek and EpiSkin and SkinEthic RHE model are derived from human skin cells which have been cultured to produce a model of human skin. These methods are currently accepted replacements in Canada and the European Union (EU). In August 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published the Test Guideline 439 which describes the new procedure for in vitro hazard identification of irritant chemicals.|$|R
40|$|The ECVAM <b>Skin</b> <b>Irritation</b> Task Force was {{established}} in November 1996, primarily to prepare {{a report on the}} current status of the development and validation of alternative tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> and, in particular, to identify any appropriate non-animal tests for predicting human <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> which were sufficiently well-developed to warrant ECVAM supporting their prevalidation/validation. The task force based its discussions around the proposed testing strategy for skin irritation/corrosion emanating from an OECD workshop held in January 1996. The following have been reviewed: a) structure-activity and structure-property relationships for <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> and <b>irritation,</b> b) the use of pH and acid/alkaline reserve measurements in predicting skin corrosivity; c) in vitro tests for skin corrosion; d) in vitro tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> (keratinocyte cultures, organ cultures, and reconstituted human skin models), and e) human patch tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation,</b> It was apparent that, although several promising candidate in vitro tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> (for example, reconstituted human skin methods, and human and animal skin organ culture methods) were under development and evaluation, a test protocol, a preliminary prediction model and supporting data on different types of chemicals were only available for a method employing EpiDerm™. Thus, it is proposed that this EpiDerm test undergoes prevalidation during 1998. In addition, since it was felt preferable to be able to include other in vitro tests in such a prevalidation study, it is recommended that a "challenge" be set to anyone interested in taking part. This involves submitting data on ten test chemicals selected by the task force, obtained according to a standard protocol with a preliminary prediction model, for review by the task force by 31 May 1998...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{similarity}} {{forms the}} underlying {{basis for the}} development of (Quantitative) Structure¿Activity Relationships ((Q) SARs), expert systems and chemical groupings. Recently a new software tool to facilitate chemical similarity calculationsnamedToxmatch was developed. Toxmatch encodes anumberof similarity indices to help in the systematic development of chemical groupings, including endpoint specific groupings and read-across, and the comparison of model training and test sets. Two rule-based classification schemes were additionally implemented, namely: the Verhaar scheme for assigning mode of action for aquatic toxicants and the BfR rulebase for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion.</b> In this study, a variety of different descriptorbased similarity indices were used to evaluate and compare the BfR training set with respect to its test set. The descriptors utilised in this comparison were the same as those used to derive the original BfR rules i. e. the descriptors selected were relevant for skin irritation/corrosion. The Euclidean distance index was found to be the most predictive of the indices in assessing the performance of the rules. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|R
40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to {{investigate}} the integrated use of physicochemical and in vitro data for predicting the toxicological hazard of chemicals in animals. This was achieved in two stages: firstly, by developing two types of model for acute dermal and ocular toxicity - structure-activity relationships (SARs) based on easily calculated physicochemical properties, and prediction models (PMs) based on experimentally derived physicochemical or in vitro data; and secondly, by evaluating the tiered testing approach to hazard classification, in which different classification models (CMs) are applied sequentially before animal testing is conducted. The thesis therefore reports the development and assessment of CMs for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation,</b> <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> and eye <b>irritation,</b> as well as the outcome of simulations in which these models were incorporated into tiered testing strategies for these toxicological endpoints. The results show that the tiered testing approach to hazard classification provides a reliable means of reducing and refining the use of animals, without compromising the ability to classify chemicals. In addition to developing the above-mentioned CMs, regression models for corneal permeability were developed, and the relationship between corneal permeability and eye irritation was investigated. The thesis also describes the development and assessment of a novel statistical method called embedded cluster modelling (ECM), which generates elliptic models of biological activity from embedded data sets. The combined use of this method with the existing method of cluster significance analysis (CSA) is illustrated through the development of SARs for eye irritation potential. Finally, novel applications of the bootstrap resampling method were investigated. In particular, algorithms based on this method are shown to provide a means of assessing: a) the minimal variability associated with the Draize rabbit tests for skin and eye irritation; and b) the variability in Cooper statistics (commonly used to summarise the performance of two-group CMs) that arises from chemical variation...|$|R
40|$|Validated {{in vitro}} methods for <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> and <b>irritation</b> were adopted by the OECD and by the European Union during the last decade. In the EU, Switzerland and {{countries}} adopting the EU legislation, these assays may allow the full replacement of animal testing for identifying and classifying compounds as skin corrosives, skin irritants, and non irritants. In order to develop harmonised recommendations {{on the use of}} in vitro data for regulatory assessment purposes within the European framework, a workshop was organized by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health together with ECVAM and the BfR. It comprised stakeholders from various European countries involved in the process from in vitro testing to the regulatory assessment of in vitro data. Discussions addressed the following questions: (1) the information requirements considered useful for regulatory assessment; (2) the applicability of in vitro skin corrosion data to assign the corrosive subcategories as implemented by the EU Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation; (3) the applicability of testing strategies for determining <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> and <b>irritation</b> hazards; and (4) the applicability of the adopted in vitro assays to test mixtures, preparations and dilutions. Overall, a number of agreements and recommendations were achieved in order to clarify and facilitate the assessment and use of in vitro data from regulatory accepted methods, and ultimately help regulators and scientists facing with the new in vitro approaches to evaluate <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> hazards and risks without animal data...|$|R
40|$|The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{developed}} a Decision Support System (DSS) to assess certain hazardous properties of pure chemicals, including skin and eye irritation/corrosion. The BfR DSS is a rule-based system {{that could be used}} for the regulatory classification of chemicals in the European Union. The system is based on the combined use of two predictive approaches: exclusion rules based on physicochemical cut-off values to identify chemicals that do not exhibit a certain hazard (e. g. skin irritation/corrosion), and inclusion rules based on structural alerts to identify chemicals that do show a particular toxic potential. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the structural inclusion rules implemented in the BfR DSS for the prediction of <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and <b>corrosion.</b> The following assessments were performed: a) a confirmation of the structural rules by rederiving them from the original training set (1358 substances), and b) an external validation by using a test set of 200 chemicals not used in the derivation of the rules. It was found as a result that the test data set did not match the training set relative to the inclusion of structural alerts associated with skin irritation/corrosion, albeit some skin irritants were in the test set.

The MSKE-loaded microemulsions were prepared by using the spontaneous emulsification method. Isopropyl myristate (IPM) was selected as the oil phase. A polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate and sorbitan monododecanoate (1 : 1, w/w) system was used as the surfactant phase; an aqueous mixture of different cosurfactants (absolute ethanol, 96. 3 % v/v ethanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -propanol or 1, 2 -propanediol) at a weight ratio of 1 : 1 was used as the aqueous phase. Among the cosurfactants studied, the 1 -propanol aqueous mixture had the largest microemulsion region (48. 93 %) in the pseudo-ternary phase diagram. Microemulsions containing 1 % MSKE demonstrated good physicochemical stability during a six-month study period at 25 ± 2 °C/ 60 % ± 5 % RH.
