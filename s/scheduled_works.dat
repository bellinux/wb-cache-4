5000|$|The {{work of an}} {{academic}} librarian can vary {{from that of a}} professional ensemble's librarian in many ways. For example, university ensembles tend to employ part rotation for educational purposes, whereas professional groups more often have one designated player per part or string seating position. Consequently, librarians at educational institutions must develop different types of part distribution systems than may be used at the professional level. In addition, the academic librarian may be obligated to coordinate greater circulation of materials to faculty, rotating and guest conductors, student recitals, and community organizations. This can present additional work to mark and re-mark parts each time they are to be used by the primary ensemble. [...] Educational institutions may also provide significantly more practice parts and allow the check-out of parts much earlier by students in order to provide ample practice time, whereas professional musicians may not require this provision for as many of the <b>scheduled</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} private sector {{participation}} {{in water and}} sanitation is a controversial topic. While the public perception of the mostly international concessionaires is overwhelmingly negative in Argentina, some studies show positive impacts. For example, a 2002 study assessed the impact of privatization on child mortality based on household survey data, finding that child mortality fell 5 to 7 percent more in areas that privatized compared to those that remained under public or cooperative management. The authors estimate that the main reason is the massive expansion of access to water. According to Suez, the private concession in Buenos Aires extended access to water to 2 million people and access to sanitation to 1 million people, despite a freeze in tariffs imposed {{by the government in}} 2001 in violation of the concession agreement. The government argues that the concessionaire did not fully comply with its obligations concerning expansion and quality, saying that the supplied water had high levels of nitrate, pressure obligations were not kept and <b>scheduled</b> <b>works</b> were not carried out.|$|E

Successful longwall salvages rely on geotechnically controlled conditions, which allow for rapid shield recovery, often in dynamic environments. Recent longwall salvage at Mine A in Queensland experienced long operational delays, abnormal strata conditions, weighting events and shield convergence, culminating in a significant fall of ground outbye of the e-frame.

To effectively monitor and manage the disease, we have previously developed a rapid virus detection kit based on the monoclonal antibodies against the HA protein of avian influenza virus H 5 subtype for the on-site operations of the front-line workers. To further test the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid detection kit with clinical samples, we propose to collaborate with Animal Health Research Institute to perform the virus challenge assays with H 5 N 2 and H 6 subtypes of AIV under Bio-Safety Level 3 environments. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>works</b> includes the production of monoclonal antibodies against H 5 proteins, the purification of antibodies from the ascitic fluid, and the clinical evaluation for the sensitivity, specificity of the rapid virus detection kits.

40|$|Spain, {{as other}} south-Mediterranean countries, is {{characterized}} for {{the predominance of}} split <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> Split <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> typically consist of 5 hours {{of work in the}} morning (typically from 9 am to 2 pm), followed by a 2 hour break and another 3 hours of work in the afternoon/evening (typically from 4 pm to 7 pm). Because of the evening work hours, split <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> are contributing to work-family conflicts in the midst of significantly higher female labor force participation. Our purpose is to examine who has a split <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> and why. We focus on full-time working women with full-time working partners, for whom the need to reconcile work and family responsibilities is likely to be more pressing.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the association between parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> that fall outside the span of 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. and children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes, {{using data from the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and its Child Supplement on 5, 089 children who were followed from birth to age 13 or 14. With a concern about the potential adverse impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children, previous research tended to paint a negative image of the toll related to parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> However, this study, based on fixed-effect regression models, found that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement may differ by parents who undertake nonstandard schedules, children 2 ̆ 7 s developmental stages, types of nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> and family structure. For early childhood children (age 3 or 4) in two-parent families, maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly varying hours, were associated with better academic outcomes, while paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly rotating shift and varying hours, were associated with lower academic outcomes. However, the positive impact of maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> disappeared for early childhood children in single-parent families. For middle childhood children (age 5 - 10), maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were found to have no impact on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement both in two-parent and single-parent families, whereas paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly evening shift, had a negative effect in two-parent families. For early adolescents (age 11 - 14), both maternal and paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> had no impact. These findings suggest that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes are not uniformly negative or positive, implying that parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> have a dual potential to become a family-unfriendly schedule and {{to be used as a}} family-friendly work option.
