John W. Fox, from the University of Northern Colorado, conducted a study in 1990 that looked at previous studies concerning the relationship between social class and mental illness. These studies he looked at supported the drift hypothesis, but when he examined them, he found their conclusions were [...] "based on assumptions and methods that lacked empirical support." [...] Another statement in Fox's study was, in studies done on social class and mental illness, [...] "identify drift as an individual's downward intergenerational social mobility after the onset of mental illness, rather than as residential drift from higher to lower class status areas". So depending on what one's definition of drift hypothesis is, there will be data either to support or refute the validity of it.|$|E

Social work student researchers interviewed 30 college students at a Midwestern public university and asked them to tell stories about women in two different <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>positions.</b> The results revealed that <b>social</b> <b>class</b> differences are constructed based on factors related to family of origin, personality, structural inequities, personal choices and relationships, as well as other intersecting experiences.

The structural functional sociologist Robert Dreeben (1968 On What is Learned in School) similarly concluded that the curriculum of schooling taught students to [...] "form transient social relationships, submerge much of their personal identity, and accept the legitimacy of categorical treatment". Dreeben argued that formal schooling indirectly conveyed to students values such as independence and achievement, essential for their later membership in society. [...] Since then, Curriculum Studies researchers ranging across the spectrum of paradigms [...] - [...] from conservative structural-functionalists, to neo-Marxists to narrative- and arts-based researchers [...] - [...] have examined formal curricula, experienced curricula, and hidden curricula.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 69 - 78). The consumption practice itself or {{a characteristic of}} a consumption practice tells {{a lot about the}} (re) production of social boundaries and inequalities in the societies. That makes the social class a fertile field to study in consumption studies. How consumers define and practice their <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>position</b> is answered by three research streams. The first research stream focuses on consumers who define their <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>position</b> within a specific class boundary by exhibiting a tendency towards consumption practices aligned with the taste of their social class, and an aversion towards consumption practices of other social classes. The second research stream focuses on consumers who define their <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>position</b> by emulating consumption practices of upper classes. The last research stream focuses on consumers who define their <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>position</b> by participating consumption practices of different social classes undulatingly. These three distinct streams of research concentrate on inter-class relationships of consumers to define their <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>position</b> and, to distance themselves from other social classes. However, the rise of new middle classes since the 1960 s in emerging economies turn the middle class into an accumulation of different middle classes instead of one homogeneous group. In this research, I aim to understand jockeying of new middle classes for positioning by focusing on how new middle class consumers attempt to mark their middle class positions and to distance from others they deem to be of a lesser status with the help of consumption practices. I chose to look at a documentary show called Ayna because it carries both established middle class qualities as a genre and new middle class sensibilities with its content. I conducted an ethnographic research to look at how middle class consumers watch, interpret, and comment on Ayna. According to the findings, middle class consumers attempt for distancing either by acquiring cultural capital or engaging in critical mockery, and these attempts happen by consuming the same product – watching the same documentary. The findings also suggest that consumers may evaluate Ayna as being a “normal” example of documentary genre or not. If they think that a scene is “normal” by providing new or interesting information, they acquire cultural capital; and if they think it is not, they engage in critical mockery. Therefore, consumers may switch between these two styles of consumption while watching the show. by Gülay Taltekin Güzel. M. S...|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> inequalities is a salient regularity in modern societies. In this paper {{we argue that}} there are mechanisms that link early health status and late socioeconomic achievement. Our discussion is based on well-established results in the social stratification literature, on recent investigations about determinants of wages and income in labor economics, and on life-course theories of adult health status. We suggest that early health status may be a non-trivial mechanism for the intergenerational transmission {{of social and economic}} inequalities. If so, it is also responsible for a process of health selection that may partially account for observed health and mortality differentials during adulthood. Our empirical work consists of providing new estimates from NLSY-C and ECLS-K of the effects of early health status on market and non-market traits related to wages. We find that the effects are non trivial and, in many cases, are large and significant. Although this does not prove that early health status exerts a strong influence on social and economic inequalities nor that it is a contributor to the heritability of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>positions,</b> it does provide support for the idea that it constitutes a mechanism that deserves more attention than what it has been given to it in the past. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the pattern of social {{inequality}} in self-rated health among the employed using the Wright’s <b>social</b> <b>class</b> location indicator, and to assess the roles of material, behavioral, psychosocial, and workplace environmental factors as mediating factors in explaining the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> inequality in self-rated health in South Korea. Methods This study used data from the 4 th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2009. Study subjects included the employed population of 4392 men and 3309 women aged 19 – 64  years. Subjects were classified into twelve <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>positions</b> based on the Wright’s <b>social</b> <b>class</b> map. The health outcome was self-rated health. Material, psychosocial, behavioral, and workplace environmental factors were considered as potential mediators in explaining <b>social</b> <b>class</b> health inequality. We calculated prevalence ratios of poor self-rated health according to <b>social</b> <b>class,</b> adjusted for age and mediating factors using Poisson regression models. Results Nonskilled workers and petty bourgeoisie reported worse self-rated health than other <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> among men. The age-adjusted prevalence of petty bourgeoisie and nonskilled workers were about four-fold greater than that of managers. Expert supervisors in the contradictory class location had a greater prevalence of poor self-rated health than experts in men. In women, the prevalence of poor self-rated health was greater in most <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> than their male counterparts, while the differences among <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> within women were not statistically significant. Workplace environmental factors explained the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> inequality by from 24 to 31 % in nonskilled and skilled workers and nonskilled supervisors, respectively, and material factors showed an explanatory ability of about 8 % for both nonskilled workers and petty bourgeoisie in men. Conclusions We showed the inequality in self-rated health according to the Wright’s <b>social</b> <b>class</b> in an industrialized Asian country. Policy efforts to improve workplace environments in nonskilled and skilled workers and nonskilled supervisors would have a moderate effect on reducing the magnitude of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> inequality in self-rated health.

40|$|National {{political}} and educational agendas have been reshaped by {{the processes of}} European integration. European policies, such as the 1988 Resolution by the Council of Ministers of Education, have encouraged educators to develop a European dimension in education and {{have contributed to the}} institutionalisation of education at European level. Drawing upon qualitative data from documentary sources, focus groups and semi-structured interviews, this paper compares the German and English educational responses to Europe and discusses how these different historical engagements affect contemporary student responses. It shows that Europe has been central for the organisation of the German educational system whereas English policy-makers and politicians have been more Eurosceptic, and refrained from including a European dimension in the National Curriculum. This resulted, for instance, in English students having lower levels of knowledge about Europe than their German peers. However, student responses within one country also differ from school to school, depending on issues such as <b>social</b> <b>class</b> <b>positioning</b> and institutional interpretations of macro-level policies. This paper suggests that developing European educational standards may be one way of addressing these knowledge gaps and disparities between national educational systems in Europe without violating the autonomy of nation-states in education policy...|$|R
