5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is <b>said</b> <b>you</b> have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

You have been told that this will have an international ramification and will affect the image of Mauritius… this is not your role, Fekna <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> must not allow yourself to be influenced by this, you are not politicians, you have to base yourself on what has happened.|$|E

Joan, my wife, <b>said</b> <b>you</b> better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E

Because Christ <b>said</b> <b>you</b> have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E

On Maundy Thursday 6 April 1710, Anne and Sarah saw {{each other for the}} last time.

500|$|... "Illegal" [...] is a ballad with lyrics {{revolving}} around mourning {{for the loss}} of a lover, as seen in the lines, [...] "It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart". It contains elements of pop and country music. Spence D. of the website IGN felt that Shakira adopted an [...] "almost modern day country-styled pop aesthetic". Throughout the song, her vocals are subdued, complete with [...] "rolling delivering, breathy accentuations, and... trill". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the lyrics [...] "You <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would love me until you died/And as far as I know you're still alive" [...] were similar to Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] (1995).|$|E

Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, [...] "It's {{a lot harder than}} you'd think to make something seem this effortless. Like I <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> can accuse Kesha of many things— but don't ever say she's not smart." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown's {{partnership}} with Fingleton {{was regarded as}} one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history. In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1000 runs. Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike. Of his batting, Brown joked that [...] "My wife <b>said</b> <b>you</b> could always tell when I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground". During a domestic match at the Adelaide Oval in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.|$|E
500|$|The {{neutrino}} {{accounted for}} the missing energy, but Fermi's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that {{would be difficult to}} observe directly. In a 1934 paper, Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, and concluded [...] "there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino." [...] In 1951, {{at the conclusion of the}} Greenhouse test series, Reines received permission from the head of T Division, J. Carson Mark, for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics. Reines and his colleague Clyde Cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos. [...] "So why did we want to detect the free neutrino?" [...] he later explained, [...] "Because everybody <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> couldn’t do it." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} in lyrics between the version used in [...] version and the one released on Shades of Purple. The Shades of Purple version includes the line [...] "then you start kissing me, what's that about?" [...] In the Pokémon version, the lyric is [...] "then you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> love me, what's that about?" [...] When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied [...] "the Pokémon people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for younger kids. We think [...] was stupid. The original version is on , and that's the one {{we wanted to go}} with." [...] M2M had not heard of Pokémon until the song was chosen for the soundtrack, as the franchise was not yet popular in Norway.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] was {{released}} in October 1999 as the lead song from the [...] soundtrack. There was a minor lyric change between the versions, as the original version contained the lyrics [...] "then you start kissing me", which was deemed inappropriate for Pokémon's young viewers and was changed to [...] "then you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> love me". The original version was retained on Shades of Purple. Promoted by a [...] "nonstop marketing effort", advanced airing on Radio Disney and the affiliation with Pokémon, the single was successful. It charted at No. 2 in Norway, No. 4 in both Australia and New Zealand, No. 16 in the UK and No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was certified gold in both Australia and the US, and was nominated for the year's best song at the 2000 Spellemannprisen awards.|$|E
500|$|While Millett was {{speaking}} about sexual liberation at Columbia University, {{a woman in}} the audience asked her, [...] "Why don't you say you're a lesbian, here, openly. You've <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were a lesbian in the past." [...] Millett hesitantly responded, [...] "Yes, I am a lesbian". A couple of weeks later, Time December 8, 1970 article [...] "Women's Lib: A Second Look" [...] reported that Millett admitted she was bisexual, which it said would likely discredit her as a spokesperson for the feminist movement because it [...] "reinforce the views of those skeptics who routinely dismiss all liberationists as lesbians." [...] In response, two days later a press conference was organized by feminists Ivy Bottini and Barbara Love in Greenwich Village in which they spoke of their [...] "solidarity with the struggle of homosexuals to attain their liberation in a sexist society" [...] to Kate Millett and other attendees.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] blends {{pulsating}} {{industrial and}} dance beats with elements of trance. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast {{them with the}} hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If I <b>Said</b> <b>You</b> Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated {{in an interview that}} the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.|$|E
