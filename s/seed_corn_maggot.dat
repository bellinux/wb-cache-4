50|$|Flea beetles do {{not survive}} in the {{northern}} half of Illinois due to low winter temperatures. Those found in late spring or summer have migrated from the south. Snow or other winter cover apparently provides insufficient shelter to enhance survival of the overwintering flea beetles. Prolonged periods of wet summer weather are unfavorable for beetle multiplication and feeding, while dry weather is favorable. Consequently, although this disease has been found throughout the world, the bacterium has never survived and spread other than in North America, because the disease depends on where C. pulicaria occurs. In North America, Stewart’s wilt {{is found in the}} mid-Atlantic and the Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. This region includes parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia. Stewart’s wilt can also be found in eastern and midwestern states and portions of Canada, but this depends on whether or not the corn flea beetles survive the winters. Corn flea beetles can transmit the bacteria northward during the summer, but if the insect vectors cannot survive the harsh winter temperatures, then the bacteria cannot be spread. The toothed flea beetle, adult 12-spotted cucumber beetle, <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> <b>maggot,</b> wheat wireworm, white grubs, and larvae of corn rootworms can also carry P. stewartii from one plant to another during the summer.

Although these pests are capable of causing extensive damage, they can be managed effectively The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. with scouting and well-timed control procedures. Specifics for cucumbers: Cucumbers grow best in sandy soil and warm weather. However, they do need 1 - 2 inches of water every week, with more needed in hot or dry weather. Plastic mulch and drip irrigation can improve yields and earliness. Good drainage is also important in the production of good fruit. Raised 18 -inch wide beds on 48 -inch centers are often used to provide a level planting surface and good drainage. The height of the bed depends on how well the soil drains. Planting depth is 1 / 2 to 1 inches. Rows are usually 38 - 48 inches apart with 6 - 8 inches between plants. Soil temperatures should be at least 60 ° F to ensure proper growth.

40|$|Minnesota ranked fourth {{nationally in}} the {{production}} of dry edible beans during the 2000 growing season, with 150, 000 acres harvested. Dry edible beans (mostly navy and pinto) provide a relatively consistent source of income, and an excellent fit within the crop rotation systems of this area, typically small grains and corn. In 2000, total value of production was estimated at $ 42. 7 million. In addition to the direct value of this crop to growers in the central and northwest regions of our state, the crop provides to the processing industry, snap bean contracts between processors and growers assist in adding economic diversification for traditional corn and soybean growers in southern and west-central Minnesota. The high value of this crop, along with the potential for economic losses from insect, disease and weed pests, continue to create demand for effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In response to new IPM information needs generated by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), this profile was developed to a) summarize current IPM practices for insect, disease and weed pests, b) highlight pesticides under review by US-EPA, c) estimate the impact of the loss of selected pesticides, and d) assess alternatives for such losses. Insect Pests: Insect pests are usually the most damaging and difficult pests to control in dry edible beans, affecting either bean quality or yield. The most important insect pests include <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> <b>maggot</b> and the potato leafhopper. <b>Seed</b> <b>corn</b> <b>maggot</b> (SCM), and other soil-borne insect pests such as white grubs and wireworms, can do considerable damage, resulting in uneven plant stands, and/or by causing delayed maturity.

Fresh market and processing sweet corn are produced for local, regional, and national markets.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intraspecific}} and interspecific competition, host plant, and prior host plant experience on fecundity, rate of oviposition and mortality of adults and larval survival of Delia radicum Bouche (Cabbage Maggot (CM)), D. antiqua Meigen (Onion Maggot (OM)), and D. platura Meigen (<b>Seed</b> <b>Corn</b> <b>Maggot</b> (SCM)), were studied on cabbage, onion and bean plants. An optimum density for maximum fecundity per female was observed when the four experimental densities were compared. This optimum density was higher on host than on non-host plants. CM females were host specific {{and did not}} oviposit on non-host plants. Rates of oviposition and mortality over a 30 -day period were calculated for each density. The rate of oviposition was slower at higher densities on host plants for CM, OM and SCM. The rate of mortality increased at the highest density for CM (cabbage), OM (bean) and SCM (cabbage), but remained unaffected for OM on onion and cabbage and for SCM on onion and bean, when densities were compared. For OM, a delay {{in the rate of}} oviposition and mortality on cabbage (non-host plant) when compared with onion (host plant), suggests that cabbage was not as readily accepted as an oviposition site. Interspecific competition experiments at six density ratio's of SCM:OM indicated increased fecundity, or an increase in the rate of oviposition for OM, at the lower densities when single and mixed species were compared. For SCM no effects on fecundity were recorded, but the rate of oviposition was slower and rate of mortality faster at the lowest density in the presence of OM. Similar studies with SCM and CM showed no such effects of competition. Host plant exposure of SCM females during the pre-oviposition period resulted in a delay in initial acceptance of subsequent host plants as oviposition sites. This happened only when females were exposed to a secondary host during the pre-oviposition period. Once oviposition began, host discrimination ceased and a switch in oviposition sites to the preferred host did not alter the rate of oviposition. In CM, the rate of larval development increased at density 6 (optimum density). Above this density a decrease in the rate of development and a significant reduction in pupal weight was observed. Time required for fly emergence was not affected by increasing larval densities...|$|E

40|$|In 1957, 1567 {{acres of}} hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> were {{approved}} for certification. This was the smallest annual number of acres reported {{during the period}} 1948 through 1957. Two of the factors responsible for this decline were:(1) intensive price competition between certified grower-sellers had resulted in low prices and elimination of many certified growers, and (2) most of the certified grower-sellers had very small seed volumes and could not finance adequate advertising and sales promotion programs. The marketing problems of certified growers were discussed during {{the annual meeting of}} Nebraska Certified Hybrid <b>Seed</b> <b>Corn</b> Producers Association in March 1958 and in June 1958 the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association was formed and incorporated as a marketing cooperative of certified growers. The objectives of this study are: To describe the marketing system of hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> in Nebraska, including the channels of distribution for certified hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> and commercial hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn,</b> and the importance of the various distributors. To describe the hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> market in Nebraska with respect to: its structure, supply and demand, production, processing, and marketing cots, average seed prices, and marketing margins. To evaluate the success of the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association in resolving the marketing problem of certified hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> growers. Certified growers have been doing an excellent job of producing and processing hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn.</b> Although the quality of the certified growers’ processing operations is high, costs could be reduced by hiring custom operators to perform these operations. In addition, marketing operations of some of the certified grower-sellers have not been too effective. From the limited marketing information obtained in the survey of certified growers, there were indications that small volume (200 to 1000 bushels) certified grower-sellers still have marketing problems which were prevalent in 1957.
