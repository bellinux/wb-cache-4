40|$|We {{present a}} Raman study of liquid and {{polycrystalline}} dioxolane, together with data for a solid dioxolane/argon film. Observed bands {{are assigned to}} the bent conformer {{on the basis of}} ab initio calculated vibrations, accompanied with potential energy distribution. Two internal modes were calculated at 658 and 720 cm(- 1) for the bent form. These were observed at 665 and 722 cm(- 1) in liquid, and split into four bands (at 694, 697, 725, and 728 cm(- 1)) in the crystal at 10 K. In the solid dioxolane/argon film an additional band appears at 705 cm(- 1) (between the bands at 675 and 726 cm(- 1)). A search for an additional dioxolane conformer trapped in argon was undertaken by performing molecular dynamics simulations of dioxolane/argon solid film and averaging overall molecular conformations. The resulting conformation did not correspond to an energy minimum, but indicated that changes of only a few degrees in dihedral angles could <b>shift</b> <b>ring</b> deformation and O-C-O bending modes for more than 10 cm(- 1). Differential scanning calorimetric measurements gave evidence of solidification upon cooling at 146 K, and two phase changes on heating (one at 158. 3 K, and a melting transition at 180. 3 K).

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The thermal and anionic rearrangements of {{substituted}} 1 -vinyltrans- cyclotridec- 3 -en-l-ol compounds {{have been}} studied to determine what effects substituents {{would have on the}} sigmatropic shift when placed on the two positions of the 1 -vinyl group. For the thermal rearrangements, the a-substituted vinyl-trans-cyclotridecenols gave both the [3, 3] and [1, 3] shift products of rearrangement. On the other hand the β-methyl and trimethylsilyl groups gave a high periselective control favoring the [1, 3] shift siloxy-Cope ring expansion relative to the [3, 3] shift. A rather unusual result was obtained for the β-isopropyl case. The products obtained from its rearrangement were trienes resulting from loss of the trimethylsiloxy group. The effect of substituents on the control of periselectivity in the case of anionic rearrangements was much less than for the thermal ones. The α-substituted vinyl-trans-cyclotridecenols gave products of rearrangement comparable to that of the unsubstituted case, studied earlier. However the study of the anionic rearrangements of the β-substituted alcohols were found to be of interest, since their products of rearrangement would throw considerable light {{on the nature of the}} mechanism as to whether it is concerted or non-concerted. Thus treatment of cis and trans β-methyl vinyl-cyclotridecenols with KH in HMPA, gave along with the [1, 3] shift product, both the [3, 3] shift diastereomers. The formation of both diastereomers from the rearrangement of either the cis or trans alcohols indicates that for a concerted mechanism, both the chair and the boat transition states would be involved. On the other hand the possibility of the mechanism being non-concerted could not be ruled out, since substantial evidence pointing towards a nonconcerted ring fragmentation-recombination mechanism was obtained from the rearrangement of the 0 -isopropyl substituted alcohol. Finally, the synthetic utility of the [1, 3] <b>shift</b> <b>ring</b> expansion product, obtained from the thermal rearrangements of alcohols 2 c and 2 d was demonstrated by its conversion to a natural product, muscone...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{resonant}} microcavities with ultra {{high quality}} factors {{are widely used}} for biosensing. Until now, the primary method of detection has been based upon tracking the resonant wavelength shift {{as a function of}} biodetection events. One of the sources of noise in all resonant-wavelength shift measurements is the noise due to intensity fluctuations of the laser source. An alternative approach is to track the change in the quality factor of the optical cavity by using phase <b>shift</b> cavity <b>ring</b> down spectroscopy, a technique which is insensitive to the intensity fluctuations of the laser source. Here, using biotinylated microtoroid resonant cavities, we show simultaneous measurement of the quality factor and the wavelength shift by using phase <b>shift</b> cavity <b>ring</b> down spectroscopy. These measurements were performed for disassociation phase of biotin-streptavidin reaction. We found that the disassociation curves are in good agreement with the previously published results.

40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} pushes feature dimensions {{beyond the}} sub-wavelength threshold, {{the effect of}} lens aberrations in the imaging system becomes more relevant. Therefore, it becomes important that the optical engineer completely understands the effects lens aberrations have on aerial image and resist profile. It {{is also important to}} have a tool and a process that can accurately describe and measure the aberrations in the exposure system. With full characterization of the lens systems and through use of a lithographic simulator, it becomes possible to predict the imaging effects and ultimately critical dimensions and pattern placement. In any exposure system there exists a unique set of aberrations, which will {{have an effect on the}} aerial image. These aberrations can cause focus shifts dependant on pattern orientation, asymmetric imaging, degradation of image contrast, edge slope, pattern fidelity, resolution, and additional imaging artifacts.

40|$|Metamaterials {{have opened}} a new field of optics in science and engineering. Negative {{refraction}} has been achieved by manipulating permittivity and permeability to be negative using the combination of SRRs (split ring resonators) and metal wires and the fishnet structure. However, the fishnet design suffers two significant disadvantages: anisotropy and scalability. The fishnet metamaterial needs a specific polarization direction because {{of the limitations of}} anisotropic design. In addition, the conventional projection photolithography approach to nanoscale manufacturing is facing possibly insurmountable challenges in economically producing the next generation of semi-conductor integrated circuits. Maskless nanolithography is a potentially agile and cost effective approach, but most of the current solutions have throughputs that are too low for viable manufacturing purposes. This dissertation presents novel isotropic and chiral metamaterials as well as a plasmonic lithography approach to mass metamaterial manufacturing. This dissertation reports two new designs of metamaterial which have a negative index of refraction and overcome the disadvantage of conventional metamaterials. The design of a chiral metamaterial is proposed, fabricated, and measured to prove negative index of refraction. Furthermore, a tunable chiral metamaterial is proposed, which is able to switch left and right circular polarized light dynamically by an external control beam. Also <b>shifted</b> bars and <b>rings</b> create a negative refractive metamaterial which is isotropic and randomly distributed. In this thesis, two <b>shifted</b> <b>rings</b> structure are proved to have a negative index of refraction independent of the direction of polarized light or without polarization. Beside applications of negative refraction, other applications are studied. The split ring resonator is one of the basic structures of metamaterial and this structure can be used to measure mode volume and single molecule detection by far field method. For the nano manufacturing method, using the plasmonic nanolithography (PNL) approach, 22 -nm half-pitch direct pattern writing was successfully demonstrated using ultra-fast laser assisted nanoscale heat management and advanced plasmonic airbearing flying head designs. In addition, the details of micro and nano fabrication methods are introduced and they cover all of the structures proposed in this thesis...|$|R
