The President's entrances are usually quite spectacular. In 1996 he rode in on a seven-ton elephant, in 1999 he entered in a huge air balloon that landed at a house roof on the square and in 2000 he <b>surfed</b> <b>over</b> the crowd <b>to</b> the stage. After his speech the entire crowd sings the Jamtlandic anthem: Så tåga vi tillsammans bort or as it is known in Jamtlandic; Mæ går på stigom å leit oss opp. Though the Swedish (and original) version of the song is the one that's usually sung.|$|R
40|$|Informal science {{education}} {{is an important}} and rewarding activity for scientist and scientists‐in‐training. We are fortunate at the University of Nebraska <b>to</b> have <b>over</b> 90 of faculty research group working with materials and nanoscience, and involving hundreds of students, post‐docs, and visitors. Some of us have banded together to develop an extensive nanoscience outreach effort that reaches nearly every corner of our community, with activities {{in a wide range}} of venues – in the schools, at the mall, at summer camps, with civic groups, at Science Cafés, at the Big Red Road Show, and many others – wherever you might find people who are curious about science. We reach hundreds of Nebraskans each year and think that we are having a significant impact on science literacy, as well as helping to recruit future STEM professionals. We hope that some of our experiences, both successful and not‐so‐successful, will show how you can contribute effectively to informal {{science education}}, often for a very small investment of time and effort. This work is done under the substantial sponsorship of the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience, and with support and encouragement from our own departments, the National Science Foundation, Nebraska EPSCoR, and professional societies.

40|$|Cross-shore {{exchange}} between the surf zone {{and the inner}} shelf is investigated using Lagrangian and Eulerian field measurements of rip current flows on a rip-channeled beach in Sand City, California. Surface drifters released on the inner shelf during weak wind conditions moved seaward due to rip current pulses and then returned shoreward in an arcing pattern, reentering the <b>surf</b> zone <b>over</b> shoals. The cross-shore velocities of the seaward- and shoreward-moving drifters were approximately equal in magnitude and decreased {{as a function of}} distance offshore. The drifters carried seaward by the rip current had maximum cross-shore velocities as they exited the surf zone and then decelerated as they moved offshore. The drifters moving shoreward accelerated as they approached the surfzone boundary with maximum cross-shore velocities as they reentered the <b>surf</b> zone <b>over</b> shoals. It was found that Stokes drift was not solely responsible for the onshore transport across the surfzone boundary. The cross-shore diffusivity on the inner shelf was greatest during observations of locally contained cross-shore exchange. These field observations provide evidence that the cross-shore {{exchange between}} the surf zone and inner shelf on a rip-channeled beach is due to wave-driven rip current circulations and results in surface material being contained within the nearshore region.

5000|$|Frank Guan of Vulture stated [...] "'Summer Bummer' {{is about}} love. But {{the music on}} 'Bummer' carries with it an {{unprecedented}} charge. Boi-1da and T-Minus, A-list producers renowned for their work with Drake and other rap artists, have laced Lana with a heat-dazed, shade-cooled beat, a banger situated halfway between beach and trap. It's a track that any rapper would be proud <b>to</b> <b>surf</b> <b>over,</b> and Rocky knows it, delivering a calmly boastful, well-tailored verse punctuated by a choice, subdued set of A$AP affiliate Playboy Carti's ad-libs. Meanwhile Lana's voice, passionate and aching yet effortless and chill, sings to a lover free to change yet fated to accept her love. Racial subtext slips in through lines about 'white lines and black beaches', though the real poetic highlight is the 'blood-red sangrias'. After years in the dark, Lana's love with hip-hop {{is out in the}} open again, and like any love, it feels as if no time has passed at all." [...] The Washington Posts Chris Richards claimed [...] "The album's most narcotic single, 'Summer Bummer', is an echo of Del Rey's trademark hit, 'Summertime Sadness', only more evocative. Picture the singer idling around in the July heat, slowly typing out a telepathic love letter inside her skull. She's listening to the radio, and her mind is drifting between external sensation and internal desire. We hear the voices of Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky splashing around the background—they're 'hip-hop in the summer', the song on the airwaves." ...|$|R

The format of your presentation was engaging and I especially enjoyed the preview of the Jonathon Jansen collection.

They have an interesting component to their repository. They are archiving not only the scholarly output of one of their major scholars, Jonathan Jansen, but also all of his television/radio interviews, columns in the popular press, university lectures, and so forth. He truly exemplifies the idea of a public intellectual, and UPSpace is collecting his public presence in all its forms. I've never heard of using a university repository {{to do this kind of}} archiving work, and it is truly fascinating. It also requires very unique copyright negotiations to make it happen, and these negotiations are the responsibility of library personnel on behalf of the university. [URL] There are also the standard components to their repository-a digital repository of the university's scholarly output. Also, there are research collections which are housed in the repository.

Must it really be neck or nothing? Did she care enough to break through all barriers, fling herself into midstream? When they could see each other every day, it was so easy to live for the next meeting--not think of what was coming after.
