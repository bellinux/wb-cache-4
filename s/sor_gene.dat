The native enzyme is a 550, 000 -molecular-weight oligomer composed of single 40, 000 -molecular-weight subunits; this oligomer is capable of the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of sulfur (A.

The <b>sor</b> <b>gene</b> encoded a protein with 309 amino acid residues (molecular weight, 35, 317). The transcript length was determined by Northern RNA hybridization to be 960 to 1, 020 nucleotides, and the transcriptional start site was mapped by primer extension analysis.

Superoxide reductase (SOR) is a novel antioxidant enzyme from Pyrococcus furiosus and is employed by this anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon for efficient detoxification of ROS. In this study, SOR was introduced into a flowering plant Cornus canadensis to enhance its heat tolerance and reduce heat induced damage. A fusion construct of the <b>SOR</b> <b>gene</b> and Green Fluorescent Protein gene (GFP) was introduced into C. canadensis using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Heat tolerance of the GFP-SOR expressing transgenic plants was investigated by observing morphological symptoms of heat injury and by examining changes in photosynthesis, malondialdehyde (MDA), and proline levels in the plants. Our {{results indicate that the}} expression of the P. furiosus <b>SOR</b> <b>gene</b> in the transgenic plants alleviated lipid peroxidation of cell membranes and photoinhibition of PS II, and decreased the accumulation of proline at 40 °C. After a series of exposures to increasing temperatures, the SOR transgenic plants remained healthy and green whereas most of the non-transgenic plants dried up and were unable to recover. While it had previously been reported that expression of SOR in Arabidopsis enhanced heat tolerance, this is the first report of the successful demonstration of improved heat tolerance in a non-model plant resulting from the introduction of P. furiosus SOR. The study demonstrates the potential of SOR for crop improvement and that inherent limitations of plant heat tolerance can be ameliorated with P. furiosus SOR...|$|E

The genes were mapped by restriction analysis, by deletion mapping, and by insertion mutagenesis with Tn 1725. Seven <b>sor</b> <b>genes</b> with their corresponding gene products have been identified.

Deletion clones were constructed with deletions within the open reading frames. Translation products of these clones reacted differentially with anti- 3 '-orf and anti-sor rabbit immune sera and human sera from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related disorders. Apparently, recombinant 3 '-orf and sor polypeptides used to immunize rabbits express many more immunogenic epitopes and/or different set of epitopes than is the case for the native proteins in humans infected with HIV.

40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type III or lymphoadenopathy {{associated}} virus (HTLV-III/LAV) is {{the cause}} of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition to the conventional retroviral genes involved in virus replication, namely, gag, pol, and env genes, DNA sequence analysis of HTLV-III genome predicted two additional open reading frames termed by us short open reading frame (sor) and 3 ' open reading frame (3 ' orf). Furthermore, functional analysis revealed another gene with transactivating function, termed tat. We have now structurally identified and functionally characterized these HTLV-III specific genes by way of cDNA cloning. DNA sequence analysis of the clones shows that the tat and 3 ' orf genes contain three exons and their transcription into functional mRNA involves two splicing events and that the <b>sor</b> <b>gene</b> contains at least two exons. In vitro transcription and translation of the cloned spliced sequences show that the sor, tat, and 3 ' orf genes code for polypeptides with apparent mobility of 24 - 25 kDa, 14 - 15 kDa, and 26 - 28 kDa, respectively. All three polypeptides are immune reactive and are immunogenic in the natural host. The results demonstrate that the three extra open reading frames of HTLV-III, two of which are unique to HTLV-III, are in fact genes that function in vivo and further allow the identification of three new and previously unrecognized HTLV-III antigens with differential immunogenicity in individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and related disorders...|$|E

Transport and phosphorylation of L-sorbose was catalyzed by membrane-bound enzyme IIsor of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system, specific for and regulated by this ketose and different from all other enzymes II described thus far. Two soluble enzymes, an L-sorbose- 1 -phosphate reductase and a D-glucitol- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, {{were involved in the}} conversion of L-sorbose- 1 -phosphate to D-fructose- 6 -phosphate.

We measured Sor activity in crude extracts from Sb. thermosulfidooxidans DSM 9293 T. The optimum temperature for its oxygenase activity was achieved at 75 °C, confirming the “thermophilic” nature of this enzyme. Additionally, a search for genes probably involved in sulfur metabolism in the genome sequence of Sb. thermosulfidooxidans DSM 9293 T was done. Interestingly, no sox genes were found.

Conformational stability studies showed that the apparent unfolding free energy in water is approx.   5  kcal·mol− 1 (1  kcal= 4. 184  kJ), at pH  7. The analysis of the quaternary structures showed a ball-shaped assembly with a central hollow core probably consisting of 24 subunits in a 432 symmetry. The subunits form homodimers as the building blocks of the holoenzyme. Iron was found in the wild-type enzyme at a stoichiometry of one iron atom/subunit. EPR spectroscopy of the colourless SOR resulted in a single isotropic signal at g= 4. 3, characteristic of high-spin ferric iron. The signal disappeared upon reduction with dithionite or incubation with sulphur at elevated temperature. Thus both EPR and chemical analysis indicate the presence of a mononuclear iron centre, which has a reduction potential of − 268  mV at pH  6. 5. Protein database inspection identified four SOR protein homologues, but no other significant similarities.

However, assembling long TALE tandem repeats remains a big challenge precluding wide use of this technology. Although several new methodologies for efficiently assembling TALE repeats have been recently reported, all of them require either sophisticated facilities or skilled technicians to carry them out. Here, we described a simple and efficient method for generating customized TALE nucleases (TALENs) and TALE transcription factors (TALE-TFs) based on TALE repeat tetramer library.

In this study, the sulfur metabolism pathways of S. acidophilus TPY with redox cycles were proposed via comparative transcriptomic analysis and confirmed by SOR overexpression in vivo and subsequent mRNA abundances analysis of sulfur metabolism related genes. Comparative transcriptomic {{analysis of this}} strain cultured {{in the presence of}} ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) or elemental sulfur (S 0) was employed to detect differentially transcribed genes and operons involved in sulfur metabolism. The mRNA abundances of sulfur metabolism-related genes decreased when grown in S 0 culture and increased in FeSO 4 culture, which owed to sulfite reductase (SiR) involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR), whose mRNA abundances increased in S 0 culture was suggested {{to play an important role}} in the initial sulfur oxidation. Sulfur metabolism pathways were proposed based on the transcriptome results. In order to confirm the pathways, overexpression of SOR in S. acidophilus TPY and subsequent mRNA abundances analysis of sulfur metabolism related genes were carried out. Conjugation-based transformation of pTrc 99 A derived plasmid from heterotrophic E. coli to facultative autotrophic S. acidophilus TPY despite their considerable differences in culture conditions was developed in this study.

Pooled next generation sequencing (Pool-seq) was used to characterise genetic diversity within and between 108 adult female worms differing in ivermectin treatment history and response. Genome-wide analyses revealed genetic variation that significantly differentiated good responder (GR) and sub-optimal responder (SOR) parasites. These variants were not randomly distributed but clustered in ~ 31 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), with little overlap in putative QTL position and gene content between the two countries. Published candidate ivermectin <b>SOR</b> <b>genes</b> were largely absent in these regions; QTLs differentiating GR and SOR worms were enriched for genes in molecular pathways associated with neurotransmission, development, and stress responses.

This study is one of the first genome-wide association analyses in a parasitic nematode, and provides insight into the genomics of ivermectin response and population structure of O. volvulus. We argue that ivermectin response is a polygenically-determined quantitative trait (QT) whereby identical or related molecular pathways but not necessarily individual genes are likely to determine the extent of ivermectin response in different parasite populations.

40|$|The {{microbial}} oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds and elemental sulfur to sulfate {{is one of}} the major reactions in the global sulfur cycle. Despite its importance, only limited information is available about molecular details of the enzymes involved. The present work was aimed to contribute to the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms by investigating the function and structure of the sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR) from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeote Acidianus ambivalens. The expression of the <b>sor</b> <b>gene</b> in Escherichia coli resulted in active, soluble SOR and in inclusion bodies from which active SOR could be refolded as long as ferrous ions were present in the refolding solution. The wild type and recombinant SOR preparations possessed indistinguishable properties when analyzed for activity and by gel permeation chromatography, CD spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The analysis of the quaternary structure showed a multi-subunit shell-like assembly with a central hollow core. The subunits formed homodimers as the building blocks of the holoenzyme, as shown by denaturation experiments. Conformational stability studies showed that the apparent unfolding free energy in water was ~ 5 kcal mol- 1, at pH 7. Iron was found in the wild type enzyme at a stoichiometry of one iron per subunit. EPR spectroscopy of the colorless SOR resulted in a single isotropic signal at g = 4. 3 characteristic of high-spin ferric iron. The signal disappeared upon reduction with dithionite or incubation with sulfur at elevated temperature. The iron center had a reduction potential of E 0 ´ = - 268 mV at pH 6. 5. Protein database inspection identified five SOR protein homologues which allowed the prediction of amino acids putatively involved in catalysis. The recombinant SOR was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The crystal structure was determined at 1. 7 Å resolution. The homo-icosatetrameric holoenzyme was a highly symmetrical hollow protein particle with 432 point group symmetry and a molecular mass of 871 kDa. The subunits were αβ-proteins and comprised a central β-barrel surrounded by α-helices. Each monomer contained one mononuclear non-heme iron site with the ligands H 85, H 89, E 113 and two water molecules in an octahedral arrangement. The protein ligands formed a 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate facial triad for iron binding. The cysteines C 30, C 100 and C 103 were in the vicinity of the iron site and located along the same cavity within the interior of the subunit, therefore defining the enzyme´s active site. C 30 was persulfurated. The 24 active sites were spacially separated from each other, making an electronic interaction during catalysis unlikely. They were accessible solely via the inner compartment. Access of substrate to the inner compartment is most probably provided by six hydrophobic channels along the four-fold symmetry axes of the particle. Furthermore, the structure suggested that a linear polysufide species and not the cyclic α-S 8 is the substrate of the SOR. Crystal structures of the SOR in complex with the inhibitors p-hydroxy-mercury-benzoic acid and iodoacetamide identified the cysteines as the inhibitor binding sites. The iron-binding residues H 85, H 89 and E 113 and the three cysteines C 30, C 100 and C 103 were altered by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutant proteins were analyzed for activity and iron content. Mutations of the iron ligands and C 30 resulted in inactive enzyme, whereas mutations of C 100 and C 103 resulted in a reduced activity. All mutations affected the oxygenase and reductase partial reactions to a similar degree. These analyses allowed the first detailed insight into the mode of action of this self-compartmentalizing metalloenzyme. C 30 is most probably the sulfur binding residue which aligns the substrate for the initial oxygenation catalyzed by the Fe site. The role of C 100 and C 103 is not clear, but they might act in the subsequent sulfur disproportionation reaction. The comparison of the SOR with SoxAX, the only other sulfur compound oxidizing enzyme from prokaryotes for which a high resolution structure is available, showed no structural similarity. SoxAX and other sulfur oxidizing enzymes contain different cofactors, demonstrating the diversity of mechanistic approaches utilized for sulfur compound oxidation. In contrast, a basic functional principle seems to be the central role of cysteine residues, acting as covalent binding sites for the substrate...|$|E

Consequently, the mutant shows soil-surface rooting {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions. A 33 -bp deletion in the <b>sor</b> 1 mutant <b>gene</b> compromises the gravitropic response; the results of our complementation analysis indicate that the gravitropic response can be restored by a functional <b>SOR</b> 1 <b>gene.</b> The protein encoded by this gene contains the RING and vWFA domains (Figure  4 B). Proteins containing the RING domain are involved in auxin signaling (Xie et al. 2002), photomorphogenesis (Hardtke et al. 2002; Holm et al. 2002), plant defense (Serrano and Guzman 2004), brassinosteroid and pathogen responses (Molnȧr et al. 2002), light signaling (Hu et al. 2002), secretory pathways (Matsuda et al. 2001), seed development (Xu and Li 2003), and cellular regulation (Stone et al. 2005). Proteins containing the vWFA domain are involved in transcription, DNA repair, ribosomal and membrane transport, and proteasome regulation (Whittaker and Hynes 2002). The vWFA and RING domains are conserved in yeast, plants, and animals. However, proteins that contain both RING and vWFA domains have been found only in plants, and their physiological functions are unclear. Recently, wavy growth 3 (WAV 3), which encodes a protein containing both RING and vWFA domains, was isolated as the causal gene for the wav 3 mutant of Arabidopsis (Sakai et al. 2012). The roots of the wav 3 mutant show a short-pitch pattern on inclined agar media and a positive gravitropic response. A total of eight genes encoding proteins with both RING and vWFA domains found in the Arabidopsis genome were classified into two subfamilies. Four of these genes, EMBRYO SAC DEVELOPMENT ARREST 40 (EDA 40), WAV 3, WAV 3 HOMOLOG 1 (WAVH 1), and WAV 3 HOMOLOG 2 (WAVH 2), belong to the same group. Surprisingly, although the wav 3 wavh 1 wavh 2 triple mutant had abnormal root gravitropic response, the single and double mutants were comparatively normal. In the present study, mutation of a single <b>gene</b> in rice, <b>sor</b> 1, led to the observed deficiency in root gravitropic response (Figures  1, 2, 3). The molecular mechanisms that control root gravitropism are likely to be considerably different between rice and Arabidopsis; this difference may be caused by the functional redundancy between the Arabidopsis proteins that contain both RING and vWFA domains. In rice, six genes encoding proteins containing both RING and vWFA domains were found (Figure  5). Only one of these proteins, SOR 1, belongs to the same group as WAV 3, WAVH 1, and WAVH 2 (Figure  5). Thus, in rice, the control of abnormal gravitropic responses by a single <b>gene</b> (<b>sor</b> 1) differs from that in Arabidopsis, in which three related genes control this response.|$|R

Furthermore, we propose that genetic drift rather than genetic selection of SOR is the underlying driver of population differentiation, which has significant implications for the emergence and potential spread of SOR within and between these parasite populations. Author summary Onchocerciasis is a human parasitic disease endemic across large areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 99 % of the estimated 100 million people globally at-risk live. The microfilarial stage of Onchocerca volvulus causes pathologies ranging from mild itching to visual impairment and ultimately, irreversible blindness. Mass administration of ivermectin kills microfilariae and has an anti-fecundity effect on adult worms by temporarily inhibiting the development in utero and/or release into the skin of new microfilariae, thereby reducing morbidity and transmission. Phenotypic and genetic changes in some parasite populations that have undergone multiple ivermectin treatments in Cameroon and Ghana have raised concern that sub-optimal response to ivermectin's anti-fecundity effect may increase in frequency, reducing the impact of ivermectin-based control measures. We used next generation sequencing of small pools of parasites to define genome-wide genetic differences between phenotypically characterised good and sub-optimal responder parasites from Cameroon and Ghana, and identified multiple regions of the genome that differentiated the response types. These regions were largely different between parasites from these two countries but revealed common molecular pathways that might be involved in determining the extent of response to ivermectin's anti-fecundity effect. These data reveal a more complex than previously described pattern of genetic diversity among O. volvulus populations that differ in their geography and response to ivermectin treatment...|$|R

Moench against weeds were studied by semiquantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} and intercropping management, respectively. To quantify sor 1 expression, seeds were sown in pots and RNA was collected from the roots at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 days after emergence (DAE). In the inhibition assay, cotton and three weeds were evaluated during single cropping and during intercropping with S. bicolor. The assay was completely randomized, with eight replications. We found early expression of sor 1 in most S. bicolor accessions by 5 DAE, and a gradual reduction thereafter. Only one of the accessions showed sor 1 expression up to 30 DAE. In the inhibition assay, the most significant effects {{were related to the}} dry matter production (shoots and roots) of the weeds Cenchrus echinatus and Cynodon dactylon. The intercropping of cotton and S. bicolor had no apparent deleterious effects...|$|R

Its active site contains an unusual mononuclear ferrous center, which is very efficient during electron transfer to O(2) (*) (-) [Lombard, M., Fontecave, M., Touati, D., and Nivière, V. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 115 - 121]. The reaction of the enzyme from Desulfoarculus baarsii with superoxide was studied by pulse radiolysis methods. The first step is an extremely fast bimolecular reaction of superoxide reductase with superoxide, with a rate constant of (1. 1 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (9) M(- 1) s(- 1). A first intermediate is formed which is converted to a second one at a much slower rate constant of 500 +/- 50 s(- 1). Decay of the second intermediate occurs with a rate constant of 25 +/- 5 s(- 1). These intermediates are suggested to be iron-superoxide and iron-peroxide species. Furthermore, the role of glutamate 47 and lysine 48, which are the closest charged residues to the vacant sixth iron coordination site, has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of glutamate 47 into alanine {{has no effect on}} the rates of the reaction. On the contrary, mutation of lysine 48 into an isoleucine led to a 20 - 30 -fold decrease of the rate constant of the bimolecular reaction, suggesting that lysine 48 plays an important role during guiding and binding of superoxide to the iron center II. In addition, we report that expression of the lysine 48 <b>sor</b> mutant <b>gene</b> hardly restored to a superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli mutant the ability to grow under aerobic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Acclimation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{cells to}} {{low levels of}} singlet oxygen, {{produced}} either by photoreactive chemicals or high light treatment, induces a specific genetic response that strongly increases the tolerance of the algae to subsequent exposure to normally lethal singlet oxygen-producing conditions. The genetic response includes the increased expression of various oxidative stress response and detoxification genes, like the glutathione peroxidase homologous gene GPXH/GPX 5 and the σ-class glutathione-S-transferase gene GSTS 1. To identify components involved in the signal transduction and activation of the singlet oxygen-mediated response, a mutant selection was performed. This selection led to {{the isolation of the}} singlet oxygen resistant 1 (sor 1) mutant, which is more tolerant to singlet oxygen-producing chemicals and shows a constitutively higher expression of GPXH and GSTS 1. Map-based cloning revealed that the <b>SOR</b> 1 <b>gene</b> encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, which controls its own expression and the expression {{of a large number of}} oxidative stress response and detoxification genes. In the promoter region of many of these genes, a highly conserved 8 -bp palindromic sequence element was found to be enriched. This element was essential for GSTS 1 induction by increased levels of lipophilic reactive electrophile species (RES), suggesting that it functions as an electrophile response element (ERE). Furthermore, GSTS 1 overexpression in sor 1 requires the ERE, although it is unknown whether it occurs through direct binding of SOR 1 to the ERE. RES can be formed after singlet oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation, indicating that RES-stimulated and SOR 1 -mediated responses of detoxification genes are part of the singlet oxygen-induced acclimation process in C. reinhardtii...|$|R

30|$|The sor 1 mutant has {{relatively}} thick roots (data not shown) that elongate {{above and}} {{just below the}} soil surface beginning at the seedling stage. In recent years, root research in cereals has focused on designing root system architecture to optimize nutrient acquisition and enable sustainable production (Hodge et al. 2009; King et al. 2003; Lynch and Brown 2012; Lynch 2013; Rich and Watt 2013). Shallow root systems contribute to efficient absorption and accumulation of nutrients from the soil surface; {{they are able to}} reach shallow soil horizons, thus enhancing phosphorus acquisition (Ge et al. 2000; Lynch 2011). Untilled fields gradually accumulate fertilizers and nutrients from decomposing crop residue near the soil surface (Boone 1988). In over-fertilized fields, phosphorus significantly accumulates in the topsoil (Phupaibul et al. 2004). In paddy fields in reclaimed tidal flats, more than 10 % of the nutrients supplied by chemical fertilizers are lost due to surface runoff (Cho et al. 2008). Excessive Fe 2 + content in the reduced layer is produced by waterlogging (Ponnamperuma et al. 1967; Yoshida 1981). The oxidation-reduction potential decreases in paddy soils, because gaseous oxygen is not supplied under swamp condition (Kohno et al. 1995). When oxygen is used up, Fe is reduced; consequently excess Fe 2 + toxicity is produced in paddy soil solution (Kohno et al. 1995). There is less Fe 2 + in the upper layers of submerged paddy soils, and soil-surface roots decrease the uptake of iron. Therefore, the mutant <b>sor</b> 1 <b>gene</b> and other genes for soil-surface rooting may be useful for increasing the efficiency of absorption of nutrients accumulated at the soil surface in untilled culture systems and for increasing tolerance to some of the problematic soil types.|$|R
40|$|Background: Acidithiobacillus caldus (A. caldus) {{is widely}} used in bio-leaching. It gains energy and {{electrons}} from oxidation of elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) for carbon dioxide fixation and growth. Genomic analyses suggest that its sulfur oxidation system involves a truncated sulfur oxidation (Sox) system (omitting SoxCD), non-Sox sulfur oxidation system similar to the sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans, and sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR). The complexity of the sulfur oxidation system of A. caldus generates a big obstacle on the research of its sulfur oxidation mechanism. However, the development of genetic manipulation method for A. caldus in recent years provides powerful tools for constructing genetic mutants to study the sulfur oxidation system. Results: An A. caldus mutant lacking the sulfur oxygenase reductase <b>gene</b> (<b>sor)</b> was created and its growth abilities were measured in media using elemental sulfur (S 0) and tetrathionate (K 2 S 4 O 6) as the substrates, respectively. Then, comparative transcriptome analysis (microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR) of the wild type and the Dsor mutant in S 0 and K 2 S 4 O 6 media were employed to detect the differentially expressed genes involved in sulfur oxidation. SOR was concluded to oxidize the cytoplasmic elemental sulfur, but could not couple the sulfur oxidation with the electron transfer chain or substrate-level phosphorylation. Other elemental sulfur oxidation pathways including sulfur diooxygenase (SDO) and heterodisulfide reductase (HDR), the truncated Sox pathway, and the S 4 I pathway for hydrolysis of tetrathionate an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Conditional gene {{activation}} is an efficient strategy for studying gene function in genetically modified animals. Among the presently available gene switches, the tetracycline-regulated system has attracted considerable interest {{because of its}} unique potential for reversible and adjustable gene regulation. Results To investigate whether the ubiquitously expressed Gt(ROSA) 26 Sor locus enables uniform DOX-controlled gene expression, we inserted the improved tetracycline-regulated transcription activator iM 2 together with an iM 2 dependent GFP gene into the Gt(ROSA) 26 <b>Sor</b> locus, using <b>gene</b> targeting to generate ROSA 26 -iM 2 -GFP (R 26 t 1 Δ) mice. Despite the presence of ROSA 26 promoter driven iM 2, R 26 t 1 Δ mice showed very sparse DOX-activated expression of different iM 2 -responsive reporter genes in the brain, mosaic expression in peripheral tissues and more prominent expression in erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid lineages, in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in olfactory neurons. Conclusions The finding that gene regulation by the DOX-activated transcriptional factor iM 2 in the Gt(ROSA) 26 Sor locus has its limitations is of importance for future experimental strategies involving trans{{gene activation}} from the endogenous ROSA 26 promoter. Furthermore, our ROSA 26 -iM 2 knock-in mouse model (R 26 t 1 Δ) represents {{a useful tool for}} implementing gene function in vivo especially under circumstances requiring the side-by-side comparison of gene manipulated and wild type cells. Since the ROSA 26 -iM 2 mouse allows mosaic gene activation in peripheral tissues and haematopoietic cells, this model will be very useful for uncovering previously unknown or unsuspected phenotypes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The protein {{superfamily}} of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR), including {{members of}} the atypical type (aSDR), covers a huge range of catalyzed reactions and in vivo substrates. This superfamily also comprises isoflavone reductase-like (IRL) proteins, which are aSDRs highly homologous to isoflavone reductases from leguminous plants. The molecular function of IRLs in non-leguminous plants and green microalgae has not been identified as yet, but several lines of evidence point at their implication in reactive oxygen species homeostasis. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii IRL protein IFR 1 was identified in a previous study, analyzing the transcriptomic changes occurring during the acclimation to sulfur deprivation and anaerobiosis, a condition that triggers photobiological hydrogen production in this microalgae. Accumulation of the cytosolic IFR 1 protein is induced by sulfur limitation {{as well as by}} the exposure of C. reinhardtii cells to reactive electrophile species (RES) such as reactive carbonyls. The latter has not been described for IRL proteins before. Over-accumulation of IFR 1 in the singlet oxygen response 1 (sor 1) mutant together with the presence of an electrophile response element, known to be required for <b>SOR</b> 1 -dependent <b>gene</b> activation as a response to RES, in the promoter of IFR 1, indicate that IFR 1 expression is controlled by the SOR 1 -dependent pathway. An implication of IFR 1 into RES homeostasis, is further implied by a knock-down of IFR 1, which results in a diminished tolerance toward RES. Intriguingly, IFR 1 knock-down has a positive effect on photosystem II (PSII) stability under sulfur-deprived conditions used to trigger photobiological hydrogen production, by reducing PSII-dependent oxygen evolution, in C. reinhardtii. Reduced PSII photoinhibition in IFR 1 knock-down strains prolongs the hydrogen production phase resulting in an almost doubled final hydrogen yield compared to the parental strain. Finally, IFR 1 knock-down could be successfully used to further increase hydrogen yields of the high hydrogen-producing mutant stm 6, demonstrating that IFR 1 is a promising target for genetic engineering approaches aiming at an increased hydrogen production capacity of C. reinhardtii cells...|$|R
40|$|The genome of Sulfolobus sp. A 20 {{isolated}} from a hot spring in Costa Rica was sequenced. This circular genome of the strain is 2, 688, 317 bp {{in size and}} 34. 8 % in G+C content, and contains 2, 591 open reading frames (ORFs). Strain A 20 shares ~ 95. 6 % identity at the 16 S rRNA gene sequence level and less than 30 % DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values with the most closely related known Sulfolobus species (i. e., S. islandicus and S. solfataricus), suggesting that it represents a novel Sulfolobus species. Comparison of the genome of strain A 20 {{with those of the}} type strains of S. solfataricus, S. acidocaldarius, S. islandicus and S. tokodaii, which were {{isolated from}} geographically separated areas, identified 1, 801 genes conserved among all Sulfolobus species analyzed (core genes). Comparative genome analyses show that central carbon metabolism in Sulfolobus is highly conserved, and enzymes involved in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the CO 2 fixation pathways are predominantly encoded by the core genes. All Sulfolobus species encode genes required for the conversion of ammonium into glutamate/glutamine. Some Sulfolobus strains have gained the ability to utilize additional nitrogen source such as nitrate (i. e. S. islandicus strain REY 15 A, LAL 14 / 1, M 14. 25 and M 16. 27) or urea (i. e. S. islandicus HEV 10 / 4, S. tokodaii strain 7 and S. metallicus DSM 6482). The strategies for sulfur metabolism are most diverse and least understood. S. tokodaii encodes sulfur oxygenase/reductase (SOR), whereas both S. islandicus and S. solfataricus contain genes for sulfur reductase (SRE). However, neither <b>SOR</b> nor SRE <b>genes</b> exist in the genome of strain A 20, raising the possibility that an unknown pathway for the utilization of elemental sulfur may be present in the strain. The ability of Sulfolobus to utilize nitrate or sulfur is encoded by a gene cluster flanked by IS elements or their remnants. These clusters appear to have become fixed at a specific genomic site in some strains and lost in other strains during the course of evolution. The versatility in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism may represent adaptation of Sulfolobus to thriving in different habitats...|$|R
