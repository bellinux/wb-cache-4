500|$|I quaked {{a little}} as we began our quartet 'A Right-down Regular Royal Queen.' [...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who could so well as <b>she</b> <b>see</b> the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do you suppose was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E

500|$|In Shuffle! Essence+, {{there are}} four new storylines {{available}} in the game. Tsubomi is Kareha's younger sister, and like Kareha, she {{has a tendency to}} space out when <b>she</b> <b>see</b> something romantic or cute. Her catchphrase is [...] "Kya! Kya! Kya!". She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher. She's quite self-confident, firmly stepping on the ground, single, attractive and is frequently the victim of pickup lines, including from the Lord of Devils and Itsuki. It appears she has some martial arts training (being able to slice a bottle with her bare hand). She has a habit of dealing out very strong punishments such as writing 100-page reports and dragging a tire around the track for minor offenses. However when it comes speak about romantic relationship or cuteness she can become shy, specially when someone speaks so about her. Daisy is Sia's cousin. When they were kids they used to play a lot together, but because of some circumstances between their fathers both of them stopped playing together. Daisy remember the precious for her time she spend with Lisianthus, but Sia seems to forgotten the old days, when they were together.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{has said}} he {{believes}} the underlying emotion of Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would <b>she</b> <b>see</b> through the bars of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] with the idea of [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E

2500|$|What was the {{youthful}} charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did <b>she</b> <b>see</b> in {{him to make}} her put up with being called [...] "the gladiator's moll"? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.|$|E
2500|$|Tohru survives {{the fall}} and is hospitalized. As she recovers, Akito accepts Tohru's friendship, and comes to accept both the person she is, instead of the god she has {{believed}} her father wished her to be, and the woman she was born as, instead of the man she was raised to be.

2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. She glared at him hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could <b>she</b> <b>see</b> his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the context within which Milroy was operating.|$|E
