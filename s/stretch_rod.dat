40|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) bottles, {{especially the}} ones with petaloid shaped base are {{the most widely used}} containers for carbonated soft drink (CSD) packaging. Occasionally, cracks develop in the base of the bottles due to the internal stresses generated by the carbonation pressure of the content. To eliminate the stress cracking problem, the process parameters as well as the bottle design need to be optimised. In this study, the effects of process parameters on the distribution of stresses in the bottle base will be studied. In particular, the timing of the <b>stretch</b> <b>rod</b> in relation to the blow pressure activation, the preform temperature and weight will be considered...|$|E

In this work, the blowing air to inflate the PET preform was modelled via two different approaches; a direct pressure input (as measured in the blowing machine) and a constant mass flow rate input (based on a Pressure-Volume-time relationship). These two methods were tested with a simplified stretch blow moulding process where a preform was blown with and without a <b>stretch</b> <b>rod</b> in free air (no mould). The results clearly show that simulation with a constant mass flow rate as input gave an excellent prediction of volume vs. time curve and preform shape evolution {{when compared with the}} direct pressure approach.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the behaviour of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) in the injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) process where it is typically bi-axially stretched to form bottles for the packaging industry.

40|$|Plastics bottles {{made out}} of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are usually {{produced}} by injection stretch blow molding. Optimization of the process parameters is necessary to achieve bottles with adequate top load and burst strength. However, doing so experimentally is time-consuming and costly. To overcome this difficulty, simulation packages based on finite element analysis methods have been developed. In this study, process optimization of a 350 -mL PET fruit juice bottle {{was carried out by}} means of BlowView and ANSYS simulation packages. BlowView was used for the ISBM process simulation and ANSYS for structural analysis of the bottles. The bottles were produced under different process conditions where the timing of the <b>stretch</b> <b>rod</b> movement was varied in relation to the activation of the blow pressure. The simulation results obtained through the both simulation packages were compared with experimental results. It was found that bottles of highest quality were produced if the sequencing of axial stretching and radial inflation results in simultaneous biaxial deformation of the preform. Truly biaxial orientation of PET molecules improved both top-load and burst resistances of the bottles.

40|$|Abstract: In X-type bracing {{structures}} generally it {{does not}} take into account the structural contribution of the compressed member, since it is assumed to have a negligible compressive strength; it considered that the stretched member takes the total stress. In the following we analyse as the stretched diagonal, joined in the middle to the compressed one, improves the structural behaviour of this both with respect to the buckling in-plane or out-of-plane of the structure. First we recall the link between the Euler buckling load of a rod free and braced depending on the stiffness k of the brace. Then we analyse the in-plane and out-of-plane buckling of the rod and, for the two situations, we value the increase of the buckling load due to the elastic brace. In the end for both cases we show in what condition the <b>stretched</b> <b>rod</b> causes that the compressed one buckles in the second mode...|$|R
40|$|Stability of {{equilibrium}} of {{a circular}} cylinder under homogeneous axial stretching is investigated {{in the frame}} of 3 -D nonlinear elasticity. The axisymmetric buckling modes describing developing of a "neck" on the <b>stretched</b> <b>rod</b> are studied. The isotropic incompressible material of the rod is described through the logarithmic strain tensor. The constitutive equations for the rod correspond to the power-law hardening of elastic-plastic materials. Solving the linearized stability equations of the stretched cylinder, we find the spectrum of critical values of longitudinal deformation and buckling eigenmodes of the rod. The bifurcation modes relating with the neck formation arise when the elongation of the rod insignificantly exceeds the maximum point on the diagram of stretching. It is noted that different buckling modes have close eigenvalues. This accumulation of the eigenvalues describes formation of the neck {{as a result of the}} superposition of many buckling modes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The stretch-blow {{molding process}} of poly(ethylene terephthalate) bottles generates some im-portant modications in the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} material. Considering, the range of temperature (T> Tg) that is usually used, the material has a very high viscosity and shows a strain hardening effect linked to the microstructure evolution. A simple visco-plastic model had been identied from experimental results of uniax-ial and biaxial tensile tests [1]. In the present work, we use this model and a numerical technique to simulate the ination of a preform under an internal pressure and also submitted to the elongation of a <b>stretch</b> <b>rod.</b> The nite elements method has a poor efciency in the stretch-blow molding process because the nal material strain is up to 300 %. This strain level generates strong element distortions and necessitates to often re-mesh. In order to carry out simulations with strain higher than 300 %, the constrained natural elements method (C-NEM [2]) is used. In fact, the C-NEM method allows simulation with high strain level without re-meshing. The original mesh can be use {{from the beginning to}} the end of the simulation. So the properties of the material can be recorded in each node, without loss of information. In a rst approach C-NEM are applied to simulate and opti-mize stretch-blowing of a PET preform by using axis symmetric assumption, the mold is not taking into account...|$|E
40|$|Injection stretch {{blow moulded}} PET bottles {{are the most}} widely used {{container}} type for carbonated soft drinks. PET offers excellent clarity, good mechanical and barrier properties, and ease of processing. Typically, these bottles have a petaloid-shaped base, which gives good stability to the bottle and it is the most appropriate one for beverage storage. However, the base is prone to environmentally induced stress cracking and this a major concern to bottle manufacturers. The object {{of this study is to}} explain the occurrence of stress cracking, and to prevent it by optimising both the geometry of the petaloid base and the processing parameters during bottle moulding. A finite element model of the petaloid shape is developed in CATIA V 5 R 14, and used to predict the von Mises stress in the bottle base for different combinations of three key dimensions of the base: foot length, valley width, and clearance. The combination of dimensions giving the minimum stress is found by a statistical analysis approach using an optimisation and design of experiments software package ECHIP- 7. A bottle mould was manufactured according to the optimum base geometry and PET bottles are produced by injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM). In order to minimise the stresses at the bottom of the bottle, the ISBM process parameters were reviewed and the effects of both the <b>stretch</b> <b>rod</b> movement and the temperature profile of the preform were studied by means of the process simulation software package (Blow View version 8. 2). Simulated values of the wall thickness, stress, crystallinity, molecular orientation and biaxial ratio in the bottle base were obtained. The process parameters, which result in low stress and uniform material in the bottle base, are regarded as optimum operating conditions. In the evaluation process of the optimum bottle base, bottles with standard (current) and optimized (new) base were produced under the same process conditions via a two-stage ISBM machine. In order to compare both the bottles, environmental stress crack resistance, top load strength, burst pressure strength, thermal stability test as well as crystallinity studies ¬¬¬via modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and morphology studies via environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and optical microscopy were conducted. In this study carried out, the new PET bottle with the optimised base significantly decreased the environmental stress cracking occurrence in the bottom of the bottle. It is found that the bottle with optimised base is stronger than the bottle with standard base against environmental stress cracking. The resistance time against environmental stress cracking are increased by about % 90 under the same operating process conditions used for standard (current) bottles; and by % 170 under the optimised process conditions where the preform re-heating temperature is set to 105 oC...|$|E

The optical properties of these materials were studied by using both steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. A new series of pure, nanometer-sized and highly-soluble homocoupled oligodiacetylenes (HODA) consisting of two symmetrical oligodiacetylene units was synthesized with high yield and on a multi-milligram scale under mild, catalytic Sonogashira conditions.

The max converges to 450 nm for the longest members of the series at micromolar concentration and to 462 nm for thin drop-casted films. An additional red-shifted absorption is observed in the solid state and in solution at low temperatures, which is caused by aggregation. The max of the fluorescence emission increases with the chain length and reaches 492 nm for the longest oligomer.
