5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue <b>straggler</b> is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Sailing to Senegal {{and then}} Cayenne, La Meillerie's {{operations}} {{had little effect}} and by 18 May he {{was already on the}} return journey to France, hoping to anchor in the Biscay port of Rochefort. On 27 July, the frigates were spotted by HMS Mars, a ship of the line of the British blockade squadron, and chased with the frigate Rhin rapidly falling behind. Declining to support the <b>straggler,</b> La Meillerie ran on towards France while Mars took possession of Rhin, and the surviving ships found safe ports along the Biscay coast.|$|E
5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly {{visible to the naked}} eye. The star's metal abundance is ten times higher than the Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely {{visible to the naked eye}} is HD 172365, a likely post-blue <b>straggler</b> in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{there is}} {{evidence}} in favor of both collisions and mass transfer between binary stars. In M3, 47 Tucanae and NGC 6752, both mechanisms seem to be operating, with collisional blue <b>stragglers</b> occupying the cluster cores and mass transfer blue <b>stragglers</b> at the outskirts. The discovery of low-mass white dwarf companions around two blue <b>stragglers</b> in the Kepler field suggests these two blue <b>stragglers</b> gained mass via stable mass transfer.|$|R

25|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the existence of blue <b>stragglers.</b> The simplest is that blue <b>stragglers</b> formed later {{than the rest of}} the stars in the cluster, but evidence for this is limited. Another simple proposal is that blue <b>stragglers</b> are either field stars which are not actually members of the clusters to which they seem to belong, or are field stars which were captured by the cluster. This too seems unlikely, as blue <b>stragglers</b> often reside at the very center of the clusters to which they belong. Another theory is that blue <b>stragglers</b> are the result of stars that come too close to another star or similar mass object and collide.|$|R
5|$|During {{her short}} career, U-104 sank one enemy vessel and damaged another {{on her first}} and only war patrol in the North Sea, off the {{northern}} coast of Ireland and Great Britain. She went to sea on her first and only war patrol on 12 November 1940. For a period of 17 days, she roamed the North Sea and eventually the northern coast of Scotland and Ireland in search of any Allied convoys heading to Great Britain. During that time she attacked two enemy vessels, sinking one and damaging the other. On 27 November 1940, U-104 torpedoed and sank the British merchant vessel Diplomat, a <b>straggler</b> of convoy HX 88, {{with the loss of}} 14 of her crew. The other merchant vessel was the British motor tanker Charles F. Meyer, of convoy HX 87, which survived the attack. The next day, U-104 went missing just north of neutral Ireland. She is presumed to have been sunk by a mine from the SN 44 minefield, which was laid on 8 November 1940, just 20 days prior to U-104s disappearance. All of her crew are presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|As at Pulo Aura, the Indiamen formed line in {{preparation}} for Linois's attack, and once again Linois refused to engage them directly: Blenheim was a powerful ship capable of inflicting fatal damage on Marengo even if the French managed to defeat her, an uncertain outcome given {{the presence of the}} heavily armed merchant ships. Instead, Linois swung in behind the convoy, hoping to cut off a <b>straggler.</b> These manoeuveres were too complex for the poorly manned Brunswick, and she fell out of the French formation and was soon left behind, disappearing over the horizon. At 17:30, Marengo pulled within range of the rearmost East Indiaman and opened a long-range fire, joined by Belle Poule. The rear ship Cumberland, a veteran of the Battle of Pulo Aura, was unintimidated and returned fire as Blenheim held position so that the convoy passed ahead and the French ships rapidly came up with her. Opening a heavy fire with the main deck guns, Troubridge was able to drive the French ships off, even though his lower deck guns were out of service due to the heavy seas that threatened to flood through the lower gunports. Linois, concerned for the safety of his masts, pressed on all sail and by 18:00 had gone beyond range of Blenheims guns and overtaken the convoy, remaining within sight until nightfall.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 1941 Fighter Command {{conducted}} Circus Number 44. 12 Group flew as {{the lower}} echelon with Spitfire squadrons 452, 65 and 266. Two 11 Group wings from RAF Biggin Hill encompassing 72, 92 and 609 Squadrons and the incomplete RAF Kenley wing with 485 and 602. There {{was so much}} competition in the squadron to fly on its first Circus operation that Finucane had to draw lots. The squadron re-fuelled at West Malling after staging down to the coast through England. Flying as the middle-squadron at 18,000ft Finucane's flight crossed the coast east of Dunkirk at 14:45 GMT. Over Poperinghe the wing split into four groups and headed to Cassel. The sole charge was a Bristol Blenheim of No. 60 Group RAF which was {{to act as a}} decoy. Five miles west of Lille at 15:00 GMT they were engaged by elements of Jagdgeschwader 2 and JG 26. Finucane engaged 8 Bf 109s and other units engaged three flights of 10 Bf 109s in total. Finucane was able to position himself behind a <b>straggler</b> after firing 90 rounds the Bf 109 was hit and the pilot bailed out. Fighter Command claimed seven destroyed, two probably destroyed and seven damaged for three Spitfires. Circus 45 took place 40 minutes later. Finucane's success was the first victory for the squadron.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} gain some intuition, let us start by {{considering}} the two simplest distinct formation channels for blue <b>stragglers</b> in globular clusters. First, blue <b>stragglers</b> may form {{in the same way}} in clusters as they do in the Galactic field, i. e. via mass transfer or coalescence in binary systems. In this case, we may expect the number of blue <b>stragglers</b> in any given cluster (NBSS) to scale with the number of binary stars in the cluster (Nbin), NBSS ∝ Nbin ∝ fbinMtot, (13. 1) where fbin is the fraction of binaries among the cluster members and Mtot is the total mass of the cluster. In reality, fbin should really be the fraction of close binaries (since only these can be the progenitors of blue <b>stragglers),</b> but let us assume for the moment that these two quantities track each other, so that we can ignore this subtlety. The second possibility is that blue <b>stragglers</b> in globular clusters form primarily via dynamical encounters. Here, the simplest possibility is that the most important encounters are direct collisions between two single stars. In this case, the number of blue <b>stragglers</b> should scale with the 1 + 1 collision rate (Γcoll, 1 + 1), which is deter-mined by the conditions in the dense cluster core vi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Combination of high-precision {{photometry}} and spectroscopy {{allows the}} {{detailed study of}} the upper main sequence in open clusters. We are carrying out a comprehensive study {{of a number of}} clusters containing Be stars in order to evaluate the likelihood that a significant number of Be stars form through mass exchange in a binary. Our first results show that most young open clusters contain blue <b>stragglers.</b> In spite of the small number of clusters so far analysed, some trends are beginning to emerge. In younger open clusters, such as NGC 869 and NGC 663, there are many blue <b>stragglers,</b> most of which are not Be stars. In older clusters, such as IC 4725, the fraction of Be stars among blue <b>stragglers</b> is very high. Two Be blue <b>stragglers</b> are moderately strong X-ray sources, one of them being a confirmed X-ray binary. Such objects must have formed through binary evolution.

25|$|One way to {{test this}} {{hypothesis}} is to study the pulsations of variable blue <b>stragglers.</b> The asteroseismological properties of merged stars may be measurably different from those of typical pulsating variables of similar mass and luminosity. However, the measurement of pulsations is very difficult, given the scarcity of variable blue <b>stragglers,</b> the small photometric amplitudes of their pulsations and the crowded fields in which these stars are often found. Some blue <b>stragglers</b> have been observed to rotate quickly, with one example in 47 Tucanae observed to rotate 75 times faster than the Sun, which is consistent with formation by collision.|$|R

Whisner, now a captain, rejoined the 487th Squadron {{in the fall}} of 1944. On Nov. 2, he downed a Bf-109 using the new K-14 gunsight. On Nov. 21 he led a flight of P-51s on an escort mission to Merseburg, Germany. As the bombers left their target, a large formation of enemy fighters struck. Commanding officer of 487th Fighter Squadron, John C. Meyer (now a lieutenant colonel) told Whisner to take a <b>straggler</b> in one of the enemy's three six-ship cover flights. In a linked series of attacks, Whisner shot down four FW-190s in the cover flight and probably got another.|$|E

After massive hype in the off-season, the Tigers had a terrible start to the 2007 season, losing their first 9 matches (this included suffering their biggest ever defeat, at the hands of eventual premiers Geelong, by a whopping 157 points). Their first premiership points came in a draw against the Brisbane Lions in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn't come until Round 12 against fellow <b>straggler</b> Melbourne. After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season.

25|$|A blue <b>straggler</b> is a {{main-sequence star}} {{in an open}} or {{globular}} cluster that is more luminous and bluer than stars at the main-sequence turn-off point for the cluster. Blue stragglers were first discovered by Allan Sandage in 1953 while performing photometry of {{the stars in the}} globular cluster M3. Standard theories of stellar evolution hold that the position of a star on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram should be determined almost entirely by the initial mass of the star and its age. In a cluster, stars all formed at approximately the same time, and thus in an H–R diagram for a cluster, all stars should lie along a clearly defined curve set by the age of the cluster, with the positions of individual stars on that curve determined solely by their initial mass. With masses two to three times that {{of the rest of the}} main-sequence cluster stars, blue stragglers seem to be exceptions to this rule. The resolution of this problem is likely related to interactions between two or more stars in the dense confines of the clusters in which blue stragglers are found.|$|E
25|$|The 33rd and {{its sister}} regiments {{advanced}} cautiously toward the Federals, who by now {{had opened up}} on them from {{the far side of}} the field, with the Confederates returning fire. At one point about halfway across, the commander of the 16th Alabama ordered his regiment to halt; Adams ordered the 33rd to stop, as well. The two regiments resumed their advance after about ten minutes or so, though in the darkness they now had to deal with stragglers firing on them from behind, as well as the enemy shooting at them to their front. One incident of friendly fire claimed the life of Lieutenant Alfred Moore: he was accidentally shot in the neck from behind by a <b>straggler,</b> who was roundly cursed by his comrades and ordered to cease fire. A few companies of the 33rd began to fall back, but Adams quickly corralled them and got them back into the fight. With the attack beginning to stall, artillery batteries were brought up in the darkness together with supporting troops under Brigadier General John Jackson; these finally drove the Federals back, with the 33rd Alabama crossing their breastworks on {{the far side of the}} field, and heading straight for the nearby 6th Indiana.|$|E
