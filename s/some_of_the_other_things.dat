60|$|This is not {{difficult}} {{in the case of}} new names; of the technical terms created by scientific inquirers for the purposes of science or art. But when a name is in common use, the difficulty is greater; the problem in this case not being that of choosing a convenient connotation for the name, but of ascertaining and fixing the connotation with which it is already used. That this can ever be a matter of doubt, is a sort of paradox. But the vulgar (including in that term all who have not accurate habits of thought) seldom know exactly what assertion they intend to make, what common property they mean to express, when they apply the same name to a number of different things. All which the name expresses with them, when they predicate it of an object, is a confused feeling of resemblance between that object and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> which they have been accustomed to denote by the name. They have applied the name Stone to various objects previously seen; they see a new object, which appears to them somewhat like the former, and they call it a stone, without asking themselves in what respect it is like, or what mode or degree of resemblance the best authorities, or even they themselves, require as a warrant for using the name. This rough general impression of resemblance is, however, made up of particular circumstances of resemblance; and into these it is the business of the logician to analyze it; to ascertain what points of resemblance among the different things commonly called by the name, have produced in the common mind this vague feeling of likeness; have given to the things the similarity of aspect, which has made them a class, and has caused the same name to be bestowed upon them.|$|E

For reasons that is yet to be known the Bureau of Reclamation did leave behind a bridge crossing over Putah Creek although that bridge is far deep under water by now.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 18) Because my Master's show {{does not}} follow a traditional craft format, I think {{it is necessary to}} preface its physical description with a brief explanation of my influences and present thinking. I have been involved seriously with ceramics for about fifteen years. Clay has become an unconscious part of my being. As in all long-standing relationships, ours has had its ups and downs, excitements and disilusionments. When I began teaching privately about ten years ago, it became necessary for me to familiarize myself with handwork as I had but one wheel on which to teach throwing. At that time (and even to a great extent today) hand-work was considered elementary, lowly, and totally lacking in sophistication. As I am still involved in teaching handwork, I personally find it to be the most challenging aspect of clay [...] . that which requires the most thorough knowledge of the material and a clear concept of the resultant art work. Working almost exclusively by hand has both stressed my relationship with clay to the breaking point and enhanced the intimacy of that relationship. As time goes on I realize more and more that the finished pottery or ceramic piece is not a part of my experience. Infact, the glazed and fired piece (mine at any rate) is usually repugnant to me. All the life and giving seems to have been frozen (or more correctly fired) out of it. The more I invest of myself in working on a particular piece, the less I relate to the finished, vitrified object. As co-owner of the Ross-Freeman Gallery, where we operate a ceramic studio and teach, as well as put on exhibitions, I have been responsible for doing all of the bisque firing these past three years. This entailed transporting the work to and from my kiln at home. During this time I have built up an unconscious respect for the beauty and fragility of the dry, but as yet unfired, clay. Working with clay in this state as a part of my Master's show has been an enriching experience. In addition, the size of my work was no longer limited by the size of a kiln. The clay's marvelous fragility could be utilized as a source of unpredictability; and, happily, this unfired clay would be able to be reclaimed and reused {{at the end of the}} show. As I wander off into "fragility", "unpredictability", and "reclamation", I realize that it is time to go into <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that have influenced my ideas and methodologies...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} draft of the text {{accepted}} for publication by Ashgate, but prior to copy-editing and proof correction. Details of the definitive version of this book are available at: www. ashgate. com/isbn/ 9780754655473 Introduction: This book is the first detailed study of food and feeding in Shakespeare’s plays. Its purpose is to provide modern readers and audiences of Shakespeare with an historically accurate account of the range of, and conflicts between, contemporary views that informed the representations of food and feeding in the plays, in particular views about diet. It is not an exhaustive study of the plays {{nor is it a}} definitive study of food and feeding in the early modern period. It would be neither possible nor desirable in a book–length study to provide the reader with a roller– coaster ride through Shakespeare’s treatment of food and feeding and so my aim has been to consider those plays I think most clearly signal Shakespeare’s interest in food, specifically the sliding scale from the most ordinary to the most exotic manifestations of food and feeding, and most clearly engage with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> being written about the subject prior to and during the early modern period. The book began life as a study of food in Shakespeare and Elizabethan culinary culture but {{it soon became clear that}} this was too large a topic for one book and so the main, though by no means exclusive, focus is on Shakespeare and early modern dietaries, outlined below. Also outlined below is the early modern perception of Galen’s model of humoral theory which dominated early modern thinking about how the body works and the role of diet. While it is crucial to understand the early modern view of the body and humoral theory, and reference will be made to this throughout the book’s main chapters, this is not a study of the humours or medicine per se. Readers who desire more detailed analyses of the humours are advised to consult studies by Gail Kern Paster and Jonathan Sawday who, amongst others, have located early modern ideas of selfhood in the context of that period’s understanding of the body (Paster 2004; Sawday 1995). While these studies have served to advance our understanding of the complex relationship between subjectivity, the body, and social structures regulating consumption in the Renaissance they have not attended to contemporary dietary literature, an immensely popular and influential genre. Ken Albala’s study provides an important introduction to the genre (Albala 2002) but this book is the first to explore early modern dietaries to better understand the uses of food and feeding in Shakespeare’s drama.

40|$|This is a {{snapshot}} of the EvoInfo wiki taken in June 2015. The live version of the wiki is currently at [URL] In the fall of 2006, NESCent funded a working group with a mandate to promote interoperability, based on a proposal by Rutger Vos and Arlin Stoltzfus, submitted with the support of over a dozen scientific experts in phylogenetic software development (see Participants). Purpose The growth of bioinformatics and genomics presents a wealth of opportunities for expanded application of evolutionary methods [...] expanded with respect to both the amount and the varietyof analyses. Powerful tools for evolutionary analysis already exist, but integrating evolutionary methodology into biological data analysis does not depend so much on the power of tools as it does on infrastructure. To address these infrastrutural needs, the EvoInfo working group will develop community cohesion on issues of standards and interoperability, and will facilitate (directly and indirectly) development of interoperable software and data standards. Activities and outputs In principle, working groups can generate a variety of different outputs: original analyses; documents for purposes of education, information, and policy-making; standards and specifications; outreach efforts; databases and software. The evolutionary informatics group is doing a bit of everything, but our main focus is on directly and indirectly contributing to the development of artefacts that promote interoperability. In particular, we have developed an integrated interoperability strategy based on three technologies: 	NexML, a XML-based data exchange standard for phylogenetics and comparative biology 	CDAO, a Comparative Data Analysis Ontology 	PhyloWS, a web services standard Most of the work on these technologies has been done outside of the working group members outside of meetings. The working group provides a forum to coordinate activities within and between the nexml, CDAO and phyloWS enthusiasts. For instance, as an example of nexml-CDAO coordination, this year the working group instigated and coordinated discussions about how to integrate metadata references (using CDAO terms) into nexml using RDFa. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> the working group has done include 	documenting Use Cases and terminology in evolutionary analysis 	developing a Transition Model Language for evolutionary models used in statistical inference 	developing validation and interconversion software to support legacy formats Background evolution, informatics and comparative biology The term "evolutionary informatics" emphasizes the informatics aspects of evolutionary analysis, which is a kind of comparative analysis. Most inferences in genomics, for instance, come from comparative analysis: interpreting similarities and differences between different organisms, e. g., inferring the locations of genes and regulatory sites in the human genome by comparing it with the chimp and mouse genomes. Evolutionary analysis (or "evolutionary comparative analysis") is comparative analysis undertaken within the framework provided by evolutionary theory. Unlike heuristic machine-learning approaches borrowed from computer science, evolutionary analysis treats the items to be compared as homologs that have evolved along paths of common descent (a tree) according to dynamics that reflect evolutionary genetics. Ideally this framework converts questions about interpreting similarities and differences into theoretically well posed questions about evolutionary transitions in the states of characters along the branches of a tree. Evolutionary comparative analysis has a long and colorful history, rooted in the early efforts of "numerical taxonomists" and "cladists" (working on the problems of organismal classification) to replace personal judgment with rigorous principles. The informatics part of evolutionary informatics emphasizes technologies to address needs that emerge when sets of data to be analyzed become very large, diverse, or dispersed. When an individual user is curating and analyzing a small data set, it may suffice to store the data in a text file and to maintain a lab notebook describing the analysis. When dozens of individuals at different institutions are working together to annotate a genome, or to assemble the tree of life, we experience new needs for standards, automation, traceability, validation, and so on. interoperability The main focus of the EvoInfo working group is to promote interoperability. An operational definition (see business process interoperability) of interoperability is that interoperability exists when objectives can be achieved automatically, using human labor or "mind work" only where absolutely essential (e. g., for tasks that cannot or should not be automated, like fighting fires or answering the phone) ...|$|E
