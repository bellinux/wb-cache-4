[...] The controller said, [...] "affirmative sir turn left heading zero four zero." [...] At 21:30:12, the controller cleared another aircraft for landing. Klotz briefly thought the clearance was directed at Avianca and began to tell Captain Caviedes to change course before the controller corrected him. The controller then asked Avianca to climb to [...] Klotz replied, [...] "negative sir we just running out of fuel we okay three thousand now okay." [...] The controller continued to direct the flight northward, away from the airport.

500|$|The {{second season}} of Homicide drew several {{comparisons}} to NYPD Blue, an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received {{a large amount}} of publicity and better ratings than Homicide, which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like Homicide, NYPD Blue featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support Homicide. Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to NYPD Blue because Homicide debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described NYPD Blue as [...] "the television version of Homicide". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: [...] "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [...] to be mimicked by someone else. <b>So,</b> <b>thank</b> you, NYPD Blue, because it's the knockoff of Homicide." [...] NYPD Blue co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish Homicide the best [...] and they should be so lucky as to do as well as we're doing right now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Russian fans {{gathered}} outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow to mourn. One told Russia's Novosti newspaper, [...] "This is so difficult! I'm hurt, very hurt! … For us, {{this is a}} very great loss. To us, he became a symbol of the spiritual world. It's hard to convey how great a loss this is." [...] France's Minister Culture, Frédéric Mitterrand, said, [...] "We all have a Michael Jackson within." [...] Elizabeth Taylor, a long-time friend, said she can't imagine life without him. Liza Minnelli told CBS, [...] "When the autopsy comes, all hell's going to break loose, <b>so</b> <b>thank</b> God we're celebrating him now." [...] His sister La Toya claimed that his daughter said he was being overworked. La Toya is quoted as saying: [...] "She said, 'No, you don't understand. They kept working him and Daddy didn't want that, but they worked him constantly'. I felt so bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{press was}} merciless towards Silverman, {{but the two}} most savage attacks on his {{leadership}} came from within the network. The company that composed the promotional theme for NBC's [...] "Proud as a Peacock" [...] image campaign created a parody song called [...] "Loud as a Peacock," [...] which was broadcast on Don Imus' program on WNBC radio in New York. Its lyrics blamed Silverman for the network's problems ("The Peacock's dead, <b>so</b> <b>thank</b> you, Fred"). An angered Silverman ordered all remaining copies of the spoof destroyed, although some copies remain in circulation. Saturday Night Live writer and occasional performer Al Franken satirized Silverman in a sketch on the program titled [...] "A Limo For A Lame-O", where he presented a chart with the top-10 rated programs for that season and commented that there was [...] "not one N" [...] on the list. Silverman later admitted he [...] "never liked Al Franken to begin with", and the sketch ruined Franken's chance of succeeding Lorne Michaels as executive producer of SNL following his 1980 departure (with the position going to Jean Doumanian, who was fired after one season following declining ratings and negative critical reviews. Michaels would later return to the show in 1985).|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} several {{songs for}} War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Something in the Air" [...] for the compilation 1 Love. Elbow contributed the song [...] "Snowball" [...] to another compilation, , in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that we listened to in that car was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, <b>so</b> <b>thank</b> god someone's doing something about it".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2015, Capaldi {{became the}} first actor to portray the Doctor to not be shortlisted for a National Television Award since the series revival in 2005. Ahead of the British Academy Television Awards that year, Paul Flynn of The Guardian noted that Capaldi's {{portrayal}} of the Doctor {{had the effect of}} [...] "significantly reducing Doctor Whos glamour quotient". Later, Capaldi received a TV Choice Awards nomination for Best Actor. He was also nominated for a BAFTA Cymru Award in the Best Actor category for his acting in [...] "Dark Water". Steven Moffat praised his leading man stating [...] "we could argue {{for the rest of our}} lives about who's the best Doctor — but for me, the best single performance in the role is settled forever. You can only ask a solo of a virtuoso, <b>so</b> <b>thank</b> God and Scotland for Peter Capaldi". Capaldi's predecessor, Matt Smith, praised him as having [...] "reinvented" [...] Doctor Who. Colin Baker praised the 12th Doctor noting [...] " [...] is grumpy and curmudgeonly and intolerant, and gosh – I should be playing it now. I wasn't old enough when I did it. I can do intolerant!" [...] " [...] costume is less annoying! I love his style, and I love his character". In a later interview, Baker expressed that Capaldi initially had ‘a rough deal’ as fans weren’t very kind towards his incarnation, as they had been conditioned towards ‘eye candy’ in the form of dashing role models including David Tennant and Matt Smith. [...] Sylvester McCoy also expressed his admiration for Capaldi's incarnation for being portrayed as an [...] "older" [...] Doctor, as opposed to his younger predecessors, he went on to elaborate his casting helped provide a life-affirming message to serve as an inspirational role model for children.|$|E
