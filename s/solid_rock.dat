5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to take}} advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of <b>solid</b> <b>rock</b> surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from the explosion of the SN 1987A supernova.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} {{a thick layer of}} regolith, loose debris that obscures the <b>solid</b> <b>rock</b> beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several of which have been observed on the surface.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than <b>solid</b> <b>rock.</b> Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E

30|$|The {{materials}} of water soluble experiment contain powdered <b>rocks</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>rocks.</b> Powdered rocks with particle size of 200 meshes were sampled from four springs above and experimental well, while <b>solid</b> <b>rocks</b> with 1.50  ×  0.35  ×  1.40  cm 3 were sampled from experimental well. All {{of the experimental}} rock samples were placed into deionized water with the water–rock ratio of 5 : 1 in a sealed container with initial pH value of 7.1. Measurements were made daily {{during the first week}} and weekly from 2 to 30  weeks. After reaction, the solution from each container was collected using a syringe and filtered through a 0.2 -μm pore-size minisart filter. Sampled solutions were divided into two aliquots: one for SiO 2 analysis and the other for pH analysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{rocks of}} the RNA are all greywacke sandstones and shales. The greywacke has a muddy, brownish-gray sandstone appearance, ranging from rather soft and crumbly in weathered outcrops to <b>solid</b> <b>rocks</b> and boulders {{in the stream}} bed of the Rice Fork.|$|R
5|$|The four Buddha statues, which {{depict the}} Dhyana mudra, are also carved from <b>solid</b> <b>rock.</b> Two {{of them are}} more or less intact today, while only parts of the other two remain. The stupa in the middle appears to have been of the Bubbulakara (bubble shaped) design {{commonly}} seen in Sri Lanka. The upper part has been destroyed, and only the dome shaped lower part now remains. However, it has only two Pesavas (the rings found at the base of stupas) rather than the traditional three.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and <b>solid</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E

5|$|Vesuvius {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the <b>solid</b> <b>rock</b> around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing <b>solid</b> <b>rock</b> from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into <b>solid</b> <b>rock.</b> In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E
