40|$|Oil-water {{two-phase}} flow is widespread in petroleum industry processes. The study of oil-water {{two-phase flow}} in horizontal pipes and the liquid holdup measurement of oil-water two-phase flow are {{of great importance}} for the optimization of the oil production process. This paper presents a novel sensor, i. e., a mini-conductance probe (MCP) for measuring pure-water phase conductivity of oil-water <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> in horizontal pipes. The MCP solves the difficult problem of obtaining the pure-water correction for water holdup measurements by using a ring-shaped conductivity water-cut meter (RSCWCM). Firstly, using the finite element method (FEM), the spatial sensitivity field of the MCP is investigated and the optimized MCP geometry structure is determined {{in terms of the}} characteristic parameters. Then, the responses of the MCP for the oil-water <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> are calculated, and it is found that the MCP has better stability and sensitivity to the variation of water-layer thickness in the condition of high water holdup and low flow velocity. Finally, the static experiments for the oil-water <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> were carried out and a novel calibration method for pure-water phase conductivity measurements was presented. The validity of the pure-water phase conductivity measurement with <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> in horizontal pipes was verified by experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{explains}} {{the reasons behind}} the very low polydispersity index (PDI) obtained in living anionic polymerizations in microstructured reactors. From the results, it can be explained that a narrow molecular weight distribution can be obtained due {{to the presence of}} a highly <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> behavior, even in microflow conditions, provided that the mean residence time is high enough. This paper investigates the feasibility of a living anionic polymerization reaction under micro-fluidic conditions. This is accomplished using a multiphysics model that accounts for the changes in viscosity and diffusivity. These properties descend with the increase in weight of the polymer, and could not be un-coupled from hydrodynamics and mass transfer. The results of the model are used to understand the reasons behind the very low PDI that can be experimentally obtained in microflow conditions. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} increased viscosity almost 2 ̆ 2 suppresses 2 ̆ 2 the diffusion of the monomer, even at the very short characteristic lengths of a micro-device. These conditions generate a fully <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> that yields an almost monodisperse polymer regardless of the effective residence time distribution encountered in the reactor...|$|E

The correct classification (in terms of benign or malicious application) is not a concern at this point. At this stage, we want to separate flows into different clusters based on their behavior. As an example, we observed a peculiar behavior in the network traces of the Zeus botnet. Flows between two hosts switched between TCP and UDP. However, the communication over TCP was always fast but short-lived (a few hundred packets exchanged {{within a matter of}} seconds), while communication over UDP was stealthy and long-lived (two or three packets exchanged in half-an-hour duration). At this stage of flow clustering, these differing flows of Zeus are expected to get separated into different clusters.|$|R

Since it employs both approaches, PeerSharkPeerShark overcomes many limitations of past efforts. P 2 P bots which randomize port numbers and switch between TCP/UDP distort the network administrator’s view of the actual communication happening between two hosts. Flow-based techniques are insufficient for such cases. The conversation-generation scheme adopted by PeerSharkPeerShark can effectively address this issue by aggregating flows of the same cluster into a single conversation. Previous works employing conversation-based approaches could not separate P 2 P bots and apps on the same machine. By <b>segregating</b> <b>flows</b> into different clusters {{based on their}} behavior, the approach adopted by PeerSharkPeerShark can effectively separate P 2 P bot and app traffic running on the same machine.|$|R

40|$|We analyse and {{illustrate}} {{two approaches}} {{that we have}} developed for providing reservations to flows. The first approach uses the explicit reservation model: a traffic profile is negotiated between users and the network. ATM and RSVP are two examples for this approach. In this paper we describe our experience in the ACT project EXPERT (AC 094) with the explicit reservation model {{in the context of}} ATM. We show that the integration of ATM in a TCP/IP oriented operating system is easy and does not require developing applications specially for ATM. The method we have designed is called Arequipa and is described in RFC 2170. It is fully implemented in Linux. However, we are confronted with the complexity required to support a single reservation for each flow. Our analysis is that it is well suited for <b>segregating</b> <b>flows</b> in applications such as private virtual networks, but that, for multimedia networks, the cost of handling a large number of flows is too high.

40|$|A novel hybrid {{multiphase}} flow solver {{has been used}} to conduct simulations of a vertical plunging liquid jet.

It was found that the solver was able to capture the salient features of the flow phenomena under study and areas for quantitative improvement have been explored and identified.

Using a hexapod ship motion simulator and low-intrusive wire-mesh sensors, the effect of floating vessel motions on the hydrodynamic behavior of SiSiC foam packed beds operated with concurrent descending gas-liquid flow was comprehensively investigated. The response of gas-liquid distribution, overall bed pressure drop, and liquid axial dispersion to column tilts as well as translational and rotational motions was acquired and compared to their corresponding stationary (onshore) analog configuration. Maldistribution sensitivity and susceptibility of solid-foam packed beds subject to ship tilts and accelerations were interpreted in terms of fluid uniformity factor. Moreover, a stimulus-response tracer pulse technique and a macro-mixing model were used to estimate the liquid mean residence time and Péclet number. Similar to random packings, fluid maldistribution was found to prevail in solid-foam beds with deviations from uniformity greater for rotational than for translational perturbations. Vessel tilts and oscillations adversely affect open-cell foam bed hydrodynamic performance yielding transient gas-liquid <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> regimes, oscillations of pressure drop and uniformity factor, as well as notable deviation from liquid plug flow...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous media {{consisting}} of <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> regions are fractional-order systems, where the regional-scale anomalous diffusion {{can be described}} by the fractional derivative model (FDM). The standard FDM, however, first, cannot characterize the Darcy-scale dispersion through repacked sand columns, and second, the link between medium properties and model parameters remains unknown. To fill these two knowledge gaps, this study applies a tempered fractional derivative model (TFDM) to capture bromide transport through laboratory repacked sand. Column transport experiments are conducted first, where glass beads and silica sand with different diameters are repacked individually. Late-time tails are observed in the breakthrough curves (BTC) of bromide even in relatively homogeneous glass beads. The TFDM can capture the observed subdiffusion, especially the late-time BTC with a transient declining rate. Results also show that both the size distribution of repacked sand and the magnitude of fluid velocity can affect subdiffusion. In particular, a wider sand size distribution or a smaller flow rate can enhance the subdiffusion, leading to a smaller time index and a higher truncation parameter in the TFDM. Therefore, the Darcy-scale dispersion follows the tempered stable law, and the model parameters {{might be related to}} the soil size and flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{proposals}} for sharing congestion information across concurrent flows between end-systems overlook an important problem: {{two or more}} flows sharing congestion state may in fact not share the same bottleneck. In this paper, we categorize the origins of this false sharing into two distinct cases: (i) networks with QoS enhancements such as differentiated services, where a <b>flow</b> classifier <b>segregates</b> <b>flows</b> into different queues, and (ii) networks with path diversity where different flows to the same destination address are routed differently. We evaluate the impact of false sharing on flow performance and investigate how false sharing can be detected by a sender. We discuss how a sender must respond upon detecting false sharing. Our results show that persistent overload can be avoided with window-based congestion control even for extreme false sharing, but higher bandwidth flows run at a slower rate. We find that delay and reordering statistics {{can be used to}} develop robust detectors of false sharing and are superior to those based on loss patterns. We also find that it is markedly easier to detect and react to false sharing than it is to start by isolating flows and merge their congestion state afterward. 1...|$|R

In dual-mode wicking structures, liquid and vapor flow paths are integrated {{on the same}} plane and <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> of the two-phases is achieved by having networks of pores of multiple length-scales. When a mixture of a gas and a liquid flow through this media and the wick material wets the liquid, then the liquid will preferentially segregate to and flow through the mode with the smaller effective pore size. The gas will flow through the paths with the larger effective pore size. These wicks, further, have advantages in phase change heat exchange where the liquid can fill the entire channel. The interwoven liquid and vapor paths facilitate phase segregation and suppress or delay dry out of heated surfaces. Experimental results are presented showing heat transfer coefficients exceeding 25, 000 W/m 2 K. Other characteristics demonstrated include reduced pressure drop and pressure fluctuations, and lower superheat requirements when compared to empty channels. A theoretical basis for enhanced heat transfer is presented, and merits of employing the technology in energy conversion applications are discussed...|$|E

However, there is no efficient method to forecast the production performance of gas-drive reservoir. In this paper, the analysis starts from the statistics of oil/gas relative permeability data of cores experiments. Based on fundamental principles of <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> and material balance, a new analytical curve of gasflood was developed to analyze the production performance. We applied the novel analytical curve to the production data from 23 gas-drive reservoirs at home and abroad and found a better power function relation-ship between dynamic reserves (Nd) and the slope (B) as foreseen by the analytical curve. It has been shown that the slope of the new curve represents dynamic reserves value; the smaller the slope value is, the more dynamic reserves are. Fur-thermore, by introducing the economic limit gas-oil ratio and control conditions which include initial and boundary condi-tions, a chart of dimensionless fractional flow of gas vs. recovery percent of OOIP is established to evaluate oilfield de-velopment rapidly and intuitively. Finally, many examples of application confirmed strongly that the new analytical curve used in gas-drive reservoirs is practical and effective, which broadens the scope of gas-drive oilfield research...|$|E

This approach {{has often been}} undertaken numerically through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, which can be calibrated to predict accurately RTDs, enabling the assessment of disinfection facilities prior {{to the construction of}} disinfection tanks. However, a significant drawback of the conventional efficiency methodology prescribed for disinfection tanks is associated with the respective indicators, as they are predominantly linked to the internal flow characteristics developed in the reactor, rather than the disinfection chemistry which should be optimized.

This non-mechanical valve is used in thousands of CFB systems yet only a limited information is available on its working. Present research studies the flow of solids through a loop-seal and the effect of several design and operating parameters on it. This experimental study was conducted in a loop-seal 110 Â mmÂ xÂ  448 Â mmÂ xÂ  400 Â mm high connected to a riser 152 Â mm diameter and 5180 Â mm high. Majority of the experiments was done with 171 Â [mu]m sand though several other size and type of solids were studied for their flowability. It was found that for the solids to flow through the loop-seal a minimum level of aeration, in excess of that required for minimum fluidization was required. The length of the horizontal passage connecting the supply and recycle chambers of the loop-seal had an important effect on the solids flow. For example, the minimum aeration for the onset of solids flow increases with increase in this length. The pressure drop per unit length across the passage also increased with the passage length. The air fed into the supply chamber is split such that the superficial air velocity in the supply chamber (or the standpipe) remained below the minimum fluidization velocity of the particles while the remaining air conveys solids through the horizontal passage.

40|$|Co-genetic debrite–turbidite beds {{occur in}} a variety of modern and ancient turbidite systems. Their basic {{character}} is distinctive. An ungraded muddy sandstone interval is encased within mud-poor graded sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. The muddy sandstone interval preserves evidence of en masse deposition and is thus termed a debrite. The mud-poor sandstone, siltstone and mudstone show features indicating progressive layer-by-layer deposition and are thus called a turbidite. Palaeocurrent indicators, ubiquitous stratigraphic association and the position of hemipelagic intervals demonstrate that debrite and enclosing turbidite originate in the same event. Detailed field observations are presented for co-genetic debrite–turbidite beds in three widespread sequences of variable age: the Miocene Marnoso Arenacea Formation in the Italian Apennines; the Silurian Aberystwyth Grits in Wales; and Quaternary deposits of the Agadir Basin, offshore Morocco. Deposition of these sequences occurred in similar unchannellized basin-plain settings. Co-genetic debrite–turbidite beds were deposited from longitudinally <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> events, comprising both debris flow and forerunning turbidity current. It is most likely that the debris flow was generated by relatively shallow (few tens of centimetres) erosion of mud-rich sea-floor sediment. Changes in the settling behaviour of sand grains from a muddy fluid as flows decelerated may also have contributed to debrite deposition. The association with distal settings results from the ubiquitous presence of muddy deposits in such locations, which may be eroded and disaggregated to form a cohesive debris flow. Debrite intervals may be extensive (> 26 x 10 km in the Marnoso Arenacea Formation) and are not restricted to basin margins. Such long debris flow run-out on low-gradient sea floor (< 0. 1 ?) may simply be due to low yield strength (<< 50 Pa) of the debris–water mixture. This study emphasizes that multiple flow types, and transformations between flow types, can occur within the distal parts of submarine flow events...|$|E

This study investigates {{the effect of the}} Froude number and other flow and geometrical parameters {{on the nature of the}} horseshoe vortex system that develops in front of a circular cylinder. The results show horseshoe vortex dynamics dominated by cylinder diameter, Froude number and flow depth. Instantaneous vorticity fields were classified into either two or three groups of vortex formations based on their turbulence stress magnitudes with a high dependence shown upon the Froude number and cylinder diameter. The peak stress properties of the horseshoe vortex system was found to be controlled within a certain threshold of Froude numbers (Fr ≤ 0. 3 and Fr ≥ 1. 7). It was also found that a single point under the horseshoe vortex can represent the vortices better than the whole field that encompasses the whole system. The characteristics of the horseshoe vortex formed upstream of a wall-mounted circular cylinder in an open channel were studied using two dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry. Experiments were conducted for different flow conditions and focused on Froude numbers, cylinder diameters, flow depths and bulk flow velocities. Two groups of experiments were conducted. The rest consisted of twenty five experiments with a wide range of Froude numbers, including sub-critical, critical and super-critical flow conditions. This group was analysed as a whole and then the lower sub-critical experiments followed by the upper sub-critical to super-critical experiments.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. In an ammonia/water hybrid heat pump system which is a vapor compression cycle with a solution circuit, lubricating oil is commonly used for the compressor. Since Poly-Alpha-Olefin (PAO) oil which is commonly used for ammonia is immiscible with the ammonia/water solution, a proper oil recovery method is required for a smooth operation of the compressor. Although the oil separator installed at the outlet of the compressor removes most of the oil from the refrigerant vapor, some oil droplets are carried over and accumulated in the solution reservoir. Unlike the pure ammonia vapor compression system, the density of PAO oil is smaller than that of ammonia/water mixture which has the ammonia concentration of 30 - 40 %, and the oil tends to rise and gather near the liquid/vapor interface. In this study, a method for oil recovery from the solution reservoir is suggested. In the present method, the mixture of the oil and the solution is drained into an oil separator having a narrow cylinder at the top, if the oil in the reservoir is greater than a certain amount. The oil droplets in the solution rise by buoyancy and gather at this upper narrow cylinder. The gathered oil is extracted {{and returned to the}} compressor by an oil recovery pump. Since the solution has to be returned to the reservoir as soon as the separation process is finished, the process time for the separation should be as short as possible. To predict the time for the separation, experiments and simulations have been carried out. The model using the multiphase <b>segregated</b> <b>flow</b> (MSF) showed that a proper choice of droplet diameter is necessary to predict a correct separation time. Also, a simulation model which is able to consider the effect of surface tension and droplet merging is needed to be developed. dc 201...|$|E

Particle segregation regimes in the near-wall region and the micromechanical particle-wall interaction patterns on the basis of the mechanisms governing particle impact on the wall and the consequent post-impact phenomena were investigated. Experiments were carried out in a lab-scale optically accessible cold entrained-flow reactor (0. 1 m ID) where molten wax was air-atomized (droplets of 10 - 100 μm size) into an air mainstream to simulate the fate of char/ash particles in a real hot environment. The operating conditions in terms of air mainstream and wall temperature were chosen such as to simulate the interaction of solid char particles with a solid wall (“non sticky wall-non sticky particle” regime). The partitioning of the wax particles into a dilute-dispersed phase, a dense-dispersed phase and the layered material on the wall was characterized by controlled discharge at the exhaust. The effect of atomizing air flow rate, mainstream air flow rate and reactor length onto the lean-dispersed phase fraction was studied to evaluate the effect of different gas flow conditions onto both the lean-dispersed phase fraction and the particle-wall interaction patterns. Particle-wall interactions and segregation patterns were assessed by direct visual observation and analysis of snapshots captured by a CCD camera. Furthermore, micromechanical particle-wall interaction patterns were studied by means of an appropriate experimental apparatus which permitted to record a single particle/droplet impact on a flat surface. From the analysis of snapshots captured by the CCD camera, particle-wall collision was described in terms of the particle restitution coefficient. For this kind of experiments, the effect of particle impact velocity, impact angle, particle size and temperature was investigated. In particular, the particle restitution coefficient decreased with operating conditions which promote plastic deformation upon particle impact (high impact velocity and high temperature) ...|$|E

A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study, including heat transfer, is performed for an axisymmetric, confined jet impingement experiencing boiling and coupled with vapor extraction. Boiling occurs at the target surface while extraction occurs at the wall confining the radial flow. The region between the target and confining wall {{is defined as a}} confined gap. Extraction is employed to enhance heat transfer and to minimize the potential negative influence of flow instabilities resulting from two-phase flow within a confined region. A three-dimensional sector of the confined jet is employed in the simulation. A single circular impinging jet with a constant jet diameter (4 mm) and variable gap height (0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm), also known as nozzle-to-target spacing, is considered. The effect of mass flux at the confined gap entrance is also investigated (200, 400 and 800 kg/m²-s) for a range of heat flux (5 to 50 W/cm²). Fluid flow and heat transfer are simulated using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model and the wall-boiling sub-model within the Multiphase <b>Segregated</b> <b>Flow</b> (MSF) model. The boiling sub-model in the VOF model applies the Rohsenow boiling correlation, while in the MSF model, the Kurul-Podowski boiling sub-model is used. Also, vapor extraction is realized by different mechanisms for these two models. For the VOF model, a specific phase "wall porosity" can be assigned to a wall to make it porous. Over a range of pressure differentials across this porous wall such that the inertial transport influence is negligible, vapor transport should agree with Darcy's law. For the MSF model, a wall can be made permeability to one substance or phase while remaining impermeable to the other substance or phase. However, a portion of the substance or phase reaching the boundary allowed to pass through the surface must be specified. A pressure drop cannot be applied across the wall, thereby prohibiting Darcy flow modeling. The solutions of both models are at steady state. The boiling curves without vapor extraction from both models are provided and compared to experiments. Simulations matching experimental wall temperatures under-predict theoretical vapor generation and those matching vapor generation over-estimate wall superheat. For cases with no extraction, local temperature and velocity profiles from the VOF model are provided at several radial locations within the confined gap. Scalar temperature and pressure distributions and velocity vectors are presented to explain observations in profiles...|$|E
40|$|Granular {{materials}} {{constitute a}} class of complex systems that can exhibit global behaviors that are reminiscent of solids, liquids, gases, or otherwise uniquely their own. The macroscopic size of individual grains tends to render the standard tools of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics inapplicable, while opening the possibility of directly measuring and probing individual particle motion. This thesis details three investigations in which the characterization of microscopic motion provides a bridge to understanding bulk phenomena. The first study explores size-segregation in a cyclically shear-driven granular system, as observed using the refractive index matched scanning (RIMS) technique for three-dimensional (3 D) imaging. While convective flows are implicated in many granular segregation processes, the associated particle-scale rearrangements are not well understood. A bidisperse mixture segregates under steady shear, but the cyclically driven system either remains mixed or segregates slowly. Individual grain motion {{shows no signs of}} particle-scale segregation dynamics that precede bulk segregation. Instead, we find that the transition from non-segregating to <b>segregating</b> <b>flow</b> is accompanied by significantly less reversible particle trajectories, and the emergence of a convective flow field. A granular system undergoing cyclic forcing is also seen to undergo subdiffusion beneath some threshold shear amplitude. The transition from subdiffusive to diffusive motion is rigorously tested in a simulated two-dimensional (2 D) granular system. Motion in the subdiffusive regime is also seen to exhibit some behavior reminiscent of cage-breaking models, which had developed in the context of thermal systems. However, analysis of local displacements of a grain relative to its cage of neighbors reveals key distinctions from thermal systems. Finally, we have made progress in the measurement of rotational motion of individual grains. While 2 D experimental systems readily yield both translational and rotational motion, a challenge in 3 D experiments is the tracking of rotational motion of spherically symmetric particles. We propose an extension of the RIMS technique as a method of simultaneously measuring particle-scale translation and rotation. Partial measurements of 3 D rotations indicate that shear-driven rotational motion may stem from gear-like motion within the shear zone. This suggests that the prevalence of collective rotation between grains can {{play a significant role in}} dictating bulk phenomena such as reversibility and segregation...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{mechanics}} of air-water slug flows in horizontal circular pipes is investigated using detailed, transient, 3 -dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The inhomogeneous two-phase or mixture model {{combined with the}} interface sharpening (free surface) algorithm, implemented in the commercial CFD code CFX- 5. 7, {{has been used to}} predict the transition of a <b>segregated</b> air-water <b>flow</b> into slug flow regime. Several cases have been investigated, where the length of the circular pipe segment, the applied boundary conditions (periodic vs. inlet/outlet BC’s) and the initial/transient perturbation of the free surface have been varied. With the developed CFD model the slug formation and propagation along the circular pipe can successfully be predicted and can be studied in great detail. Typical slug flow characteristics like e. g. slug frequency, slug length and slug propagation speed have been determined from numerical simulations and are compared to available experimental data. Despite still existing uncertainties in both the experimental data and the numerical model the obtained numerical slug flow characteristics are in reasonably good agreement with the experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} E-curve for the {{laminar flow}} of non-Newtonian fluids in circular tubes {{may not be}} accurate for real tubular systems with diffusion, mechanical vibration, wall roughness, pipe fittings, curves, coils, or corrugated walls. Deviations from the idealized laminar flow reactor (LFR) cannot be well represented using the axial dispersion or the tanks-in-series models of residence time distribution (RTD). In this work, four RTD models derived from non-ideal velocity profiles in <b>segregated</b> tube <b>flow</b> are proposed. They were used to represent the RTD of three tubular systems working with Newtonian and pseudoplastic fluids. Other RTD models were considered for comparison. The proposed models provided good adjustments, and {{it was possible to}} determine the active volumes. It is expected that these models can be useful for the analysis of LFR or for the evaluation of continuous thermal processing of viscous foods.
