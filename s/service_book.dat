5|$|In 1542, Calvin adapted a <b>service</b> <b>book</b> used in Strasbourg, {{publishing}} La Forme des Prières et Chants Ecclésiastiques (The Form of Prayers and Church Hymns). Calvin recognised {{the power}} of music and he intended that it be used to support scripture readings. The original Strasbourg psalter contained twelve psalms by Clément Marot and Calvin added several more hymns of his own composition in the Geneva version. At the end of 1542, Marot became a refugee in Geneva and contributed nineteen more psalms. Louis Bourgeois, also a refugee, lived and taught music in Geneva for sixteen years and Calvin {{took the opportunity to}} add his hymns, the most famous being the Old Hundredth.|$|E

25|$|Lutheran worship books usually include {{orders for}} Morning and Evening Prayer {{as well as}} Compline. Liturgies {{published}} by immigrant Lutheran communities in North America were based at first on the Book of Common Prayer. In recent years, under {{the impact of the}} liturgical movement, Lutheran churches have restored the historic form of the Western office. Both Evangelical Lutheran Worship published by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada as well as the Lutheran <b>Service</b> <b>Book</b> of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod provide daily offices along with a complete psalter.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the failure of the 1928 book was salutary: no further {{attempts}} were made to revise the Book of Common Prayer. Instead a different process, that of producing an alternative book, led to the publication of Series 1, 2 and 3 in the 1960s, the 1980 Alternative <b>Service</b> <b>Book</b> and subsequently to the 2000 Common Worship series of books. Both differ substantially from the Book of Common Prayer, though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service, largely along the lines proposed for the 1928 Prayer Book. Order One follows the pattern of modern liturgical scholarship.|$|E

25|$|The Lutheran Calendar of Saints is {{a listing}} which {{specifies}} the primary annual festivals {{and events that}} are celebrated liturgically by some Lutheran Churches in the United States. The calendars of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) are from the 1978 Lutheran Book of Worship and the 1982 Lutheran Worship. Elements unique to the ELCA have been updated from the Lutheran Book of Worship to reflect changes resulting from the publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship in 2006. The elements of the calendar unique to the LCMS have also been updated from Lutheran Worship and the Lutheran Book of Worship to reflect the 2006 publication of the Lutheran <b>Service</b> <b>Book.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Alternative <b>Service</b> <b>Book</b> 1980 (ASB) was {{the first}} {{complete}} prayer book produced by the Church of England since 1662. Its name derives {{from the fact that}} it was proposed not as a replacement for the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) but merely as an alternative to it. In practice, it was so popular that the various printers had to produce several editions very quickly and churches which retained the BCP drew attention to this fact as something to be noted. The Prayer Book Society was soon complaining that it was becoming hard to find a church which used the old prayer book and that theological colleges were not introducing students to it. It has now been replaced by Common Worship.|$|E

25|$|The Missouri Synod's {{original}} constitution {{stated that}} one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice, while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity. The synod requires that hymns, songs, liturgies, and practices be in harmony with the Bible and Book of Concord. Worship in Missouri Synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical, utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal, and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano. The contents of LCMS hymnals from the past, such as The Lutheran Hymnal and Lutheran Worship, and those of its newest hymnal, Lutheran <b>Service</b> <b>Book,</b> highlight the synod's unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy. More traditional LCMS Lutherans point to the Lutheran Confessions in their defense of liturgical worship.|$|E
25|$|In Venice, the Ljubavić {{brothers}} procured a {{press and}} began printing a hieratikon (priest's <b>service</b> <b>book),</b> copies {{of which were}} finished on 1July 1519 either in Venice or at the Church of Saint George {{in the village of}} Sopotnica near Goražde. After Đurađ Ljubavić died in Venice on 2March 1519, it is unclear whether his brother transported the press to Goražde before or after finishing the work on the hieratikon. At the Church of Saint George, Teodor organised the Goražde printing house, one of the earliest printing houses among the Serbs, and the first such facility in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The printing house was run by Božidar Goraždanin, who, in 1521, instructed Teodor (Ljubavić) to print a psalter. Teodor managed the work, which included the redaction of the psalter's text, the design and carving of the decorative woodcuts, typesetting, preparation of ink and paper, printing, drying and gathering of the printed sheets, and other tasks; the books were not bound at the printing house. The copies of the Goražde Psalter were finished on 25October 1521.|$|E
25|$|The Rochester Bestiary is a {{parchment}} manuscript {{dating from}} c. 12301240. Its principle contents are a bestiary, {{but it also}} contains a short lapidary (a treatise on stones) in French prose and, as the flyleaves, two leaves of a 14th-century <b>service</b> <b>book.</b> It is illustrated with 55 finished miniatures of various animals, each {{at the end of}} the passage describing that animal. On some pages, instructions to the illuminator are visible, briefly describing what the planned picture should depict. About a third of the way through the manuscript (f. 52v and following, after the vulture), the illustrations cease: while spaces remain where they were intended to be placed, no illustrations were ever added. The style of the miniatures shows some evidence that the illustrations were made as much as a decade or more after the initial production of the text, and it is possible that the artist did not fully understand the projected plan envisioned by the scribe: by adding a fourth picture of a lion, instead of the planned three, he forced subsequent illustrations to be placed after the animals they described, instead of before. Three other extant manuscripts feature illuminations by this artist: Cambridge, University Library, MS. Ee.2.23 (a Bible), Peterborough, Cathedral Library, MS. 10 (a Bible), and Stockholm, National Museum, MS. B. 2010 (a psalter). A fourth manuscript (Turin, Biblioteca Nazionale, Cod. L.IV.25) contained two full-page miniatures from this artist, but was destroyed in 1904.|$|E
