40|$|When using 100 % self-fluxed pellets in {{the blast}} furnace burden, top charged fluxes, {{especially}} the BOF-slag, may cause irregularities in operation. The major reason has been theoretically attributed to the problematic slag formation in the furnace. As the melting of pellets {{is the first step}} of the slag formation process, the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets with and without addition of fluxes are studied experimentally. The results show that the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of the two types of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets are quite suitable for blast furnace operation. Contrarily, the melting-down characteristics of BOF-slag are variable and harmful to the slag formation under a reducing atmosphere. Adding 5 % BOF-slag to the self-fluxed pellets can considerably worsen the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of pellets.

40|$|A novel {{method to}} produce metal in glass preform and fibre with complex non-circular cross section is presented. The method {{involves}} firstly using conventional glass cutting facilities to cut glass pieces into various key shapes.

The paper focuses on chemical, technological and quality characteristics of ash from the combustion of lignite from Polish deposits. Ash content on a dry ash-free basis for the samples from 9 deposits varies from 1 to 50 %. The most commonly observed ash content in the studied samples of lignite is in the range between 10 – 20 %. The measured ash <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> from the collected lignite samples have shown that the sintering, <b>softening,</b> <b>melting</b> and flow <b>temperatures,</b> determined in an oxidizing atmosphere (air), are higher than those determined in a reducing atmosphere. In the majority of Polish lignite deposits, the dominant component of ash was SiO 2, followed by CaO. When evaluating the suitability of coal in energy production, with particular emphasis on the combustion and gasification processes, it is also necessary to study the behavior of ash at high temperatures and the impact of ash on the gasification and combustion facilities.

40|$|Stable operation, {{in other}} words the {{achievement}} of a succession of uniform filtration cycles of reasonable length is a key issue in high-temperature gas filtration with ceramic media. Its importance has rather grown in recent years, as these media gain in acceptance due to their excellent particle retention capabilities. Ash properties have been {{known for some time}} to affect the maximum operating temperature of filters. However, softening and consequently ''stickiness'' of the ash particles generally depend on composition in a complex way. Simple and accurate prediction of critical temperature ranges from ash analysis [...] and even more so from coal analysis [...] is still difficult without practical and costly trials. In general, our understanding of what exactly happens during break-down of filtration stability is still rather crude and general. Early work was based on the concept that ash particles begin to soften and sinter near the <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> of low-melting, often alkaline components. This softening coincides with a fairly abrupt increase of stickiness, that can be detected with powder mechanical methods in a Jenicke shear cell as first shown by Pilz (1996) and recently confirmed by others (Kamiya et al. 2001 and 2002, Kanaoka et al. 2001). However, recording {sigma}-{tau}-diagrams is very time consuming and not the only off-line method of analyzing or predicting changes in thermo-mechanical ash behavior. Pilz found that the increase in ash stickiness near melting was accompanied by shrinkage attributed to sintering. Recent work at the University of Karlsruhe has expanded the use of such thermo-analytical methods for predicting filtration behavior (Hemmer 2001). Demonstrating their effectiveness is one objective of this paper. Finally, our intent is to show that ash <b>softening</b> at near <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> is apparently not the only phenomenon causing problems with filtration, although its impact is certainly the ''final catastrophe''. There are other significant changes in regeneration at intermediate temperatures, which may lead to long-term deterioration...|$|R

A notable difference in the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the base metals may result in rupture of the lower-melting-temperature metal (Hayes, et al., 2011). For instance, in a friction welded joint, Al melts more than Cu, due to the lower <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of Al compared to Cu (Sahin, 2009). Moreover, the study of Bisadi, et al. (2013) on the friction-stir welding process shows that joints with a significant difference in base metal <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> welded with a high welding temperature have cavities in the transition zone of Al and Cu. Previous study showed that residual thermal stresses and misfit strains are produced in Al-Cu joints because of the significant difference in the <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> of Al and Cu (Mai & Spowage, 2004). Significant difference in <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> also affects the surface appearance of the joint. Lap laser welding with Al (topside) and Cu resulted in problems such as large weld bead formation and a large heat-affected zone on the Al side, due to the low <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> and the high absorptivity of the laser wavelength by Al (Weigl, et al., 2011; Sujin, et al., 2014). The above studies show that the difference in <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> has effects on defects and the surface appearance of Al-Cu joints and thus influences weld mechanical properties.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and improve a new method for {{investigating}} how different parameters affect the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> of quartz. The method should give quantitative results. Quartz is the stable phase of silica at room temperature, and is used as raw material for silicon production. When silica starts to <b>soften</b> and <b>melt</b> it can react with the surroundings in a furnace. This is undesirable too high in the furnace, because it can cause a more compact charge leading to decreased gas permeability. Softening of silica can also alter the reaction rates. A {{deeper understanding of the}} <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of silica can lead to a more thorough selection of new raw materials and efficient furnace operations. Costs and energy consumptions can be decreased. This study has focused on the following parameters effect on softening and heating: temperature, heating rate, quartz type, holding time and particle size. The method used for the investigation was based on the stationary charge in controlled environment (S. C. I. C. E) technique. Carbon crucibles were filled with quartz and silicon carbide, and then heated in an induction furnace. Temperature control was important, and therefore several experiments were performed to establish the uncertainty. After cooling, the crucibles were cut into two halves, so each surface could be studied and the areas of <b>softened</b> and <b>melted</b> silica measured. The new method for investigating <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of silica was adequate. Results from the experiments show that a more impure quartz type will <b>soften</b> and <b>melt</b> at a lower temperature than a purer type. Increasing the holding time at maximum temperature also causes the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> to increase.

Agarose exhibits the phenomenon of thermal hysteresis in its liquid-to-gel transition, i.e. it gels and <b>melts</b> at different <b>temperatures.</b> The gelling and <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{vary depending on the}} type of agarose. Standard agaroses derived from Gelidium has a gelling temperature of 34 - 38 C and a <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of 90 - 95 C, while those derived from Gracilaria, due to its higher methoxy substituents, has a gelling temperature of 40 - 52 C and <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of 85 - 90 C. [...] The <b>melting</b> and gelling <b>temperatures</b> may be dependent on the concentration of the gel, particularly at low gel concentration of less than 1%. The gelling and <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> are therefore given at a specified agarose concentration.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Melting</b> <b>temperature</b> {{analysis}} of products amplified with SYBR I Green chemistry is a cheap and effective method for identification of sequence differences. When used in conventional quantitative real-time PCR instruments (qPCR), {{this method is}} limited by temperature variations over the heating block and low numbers of fluorescence measurements during the dissociation step, which hamper the ability of most instruments to report accurate and precise <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures.</b> METHODS: We designed a molecular beacon-based temperature indicator probe (Tm-probe) to control for variations in temperatures over the heating block of the instrument. In addition, we wrote an automated curve-fit analysis algorithm of dissociation data to use multiple data points with a gaussian curve fit to extrapolate precise <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures.</b> RESULTS: Use of the Tm-probe {{in conjunction with the}} analysis algorithm and multiple dissociations improved SDs of <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> over a 96 -well plate from 0. 19 to 0. 06 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Melting</b> <b>temperature</b> analyses with SYBR I Green chemistry on conventional qPCR instruments can be improved by the use of a Tm-probe in conjunction with curve-fit {{analysis of}} data. Resolution improvement up to 3 -fold is possible and allows additional <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> to be identified...|$|R
30|$|As a {{first step}} to {{understand}} the mechanism underlying the protection of a biological tissue by trehalose, we measured the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the dried lens tissue under the presence or the absence of trehalose or cyclic tetrasaccharide {{in our previous study}} (Sun et al. 2011). That study was unique in that the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of a biological tissue as a whole, even in the dried condition, was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (Sun et al. 2011). In that study, the presence of trehalose, but not cyclic tetrasaccharide, led to an elevation of the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the dried lens tissue (Sun et al. 2011). As an ideal condition of experiments, the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> should be measured in the natural state of a biological tissue with water. However, the presence of water leads to the evaporation of water in the process of rising temperature, and hence, the evaporation hinders the measurement of the <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> in an accurate manner.|$|R
40|$|NOVELTY - To sinter {{polymers}} {{with narrow}} <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> range and high melt index, {{at least two}} different portions of similar polymer type with differing melting properties are employed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Different types of polymer may be used and mixed together. One type coats the other, the former having the lower <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> range. Portion(s) may be mixed with radiation-absorbent additive. A portion is co-extruded and/or granulated. The portion with the lower <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> range lies outside. USE - To sinter or meld plastics of the same type with a high melt index and narrow <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> range, forming a porus structure. A wide range of filter materials is cited. ADVANTAGE - If a plastic with narrow <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> range is heated, {{it is likely to}} collapse suddenly into a liquid, rendering sintering attempts futile. Using two types of the same plastic, which have different melting behavior, ensures one softens before the other; ideal for sintering. Given good mixing, a very uniform product results...|$|R
