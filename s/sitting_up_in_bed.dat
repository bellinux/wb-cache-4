5|$|Yousafzai {{had come}} out of her coma by 17 October 2012, was {{responding}} well to treatment, and was said to {{have a good chance of}} fully recovering without any brain damage. Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, but was still battling an infection. By 8 November, she was photographed <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
25|$|Early {{ambulation}} also prevents venous stasis {{and physicians}} order OOB {{activities on the}} same day of surgery. This is accomplished in increments. The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by: raising the head of the bed, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> moving {{to the edge of the}} bed, dangling the legs off the bed and then ambulating to a close chair.|$|E
6000|$|... “Some villain has betrayed us,” {{cried out}} my lady, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed,</b> showing herself full dressed under her night-rail.|$|R
6000|$|... "O uncle," [...] cried Ned, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> and {{regarding}} his knuckles with a perplexed expression of countenance, [...] "I've {{had such an}} extraordinary dream!" ...|$|R
60|$|I held my {{ears and}} {{crouched}} low, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> my <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the dark. But the dream {{seemed to go}} on still: it remained with me distinctly.|$|R
25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} week of his life, he {{concluded}} this retreat on Tuesday, November 12, worked with a student artist to complete a statue of Amitabha, talked with many of his students, and led a training in phowa (transference of consciousness at the moment of death) for more than two hundred people. He continued teaching with great vigor until about 9 pm on Saturday night November 16. Then on Sunday morning of the 17th, at about 4:15a.m., Brazilian daylight time, he suffered massive heart failure while <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that {{to a certain extent}} this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{trouble if}} YOU are late," [...] said Prothero, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> {{with a red}} resentful face and {{crumpled}} hair. [...] "I wasn't born yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|Foster by {{this time}} was broad awake, and <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> asked Varney the meaning of so {{untimely}} a visit. [...] "It augurs nothing good," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] said Gwendolen, impetuously, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her <b>bed.</b> [...] "Haven't {{children}} {{reason to}} be angry with their parents? How can they help their parents marrying or not marrying?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Simon Hoggart, {{writing in}} The Guardian, related an anecdote of Soames' childhood: [...] "He {{gave me the}} true version of what I had always {{suspected}} was an apocryphal story. In or around 1953, when Soames was five, he didn't know how important his grandfather was until someone told him. So {{he walked up to}} the old man's bedroom, managed to get past the valets and the secretaries, and found him <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{last part}} of the novel is devoted to the {{circumstances}} of Norkus' (or Heini Völker's) death. According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a [...] "thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection": When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there [...] "suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> his eyes wide open. He is singing. They don't recognise the words, but they know the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here." ...|$|E
60|$|Cicely {{returned}} to Christopher {{to find him}} <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> drinking a bowl of broth.|$|E
60|$|They {{all turned}} {{in to the}} other bed at last, 'arf afraid to move for fear of {{disturbing}} Bill, and when they woke <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning and see 'im <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 'is <b>bed</b> they lay as still as mice.|$|R
60|$|I kept quite {{still and}} said nothing. For a whole hour I {{did not move}} a muscle, and in the {{meantime}} I did not hear him lie down. He was still <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed</b> listening;--just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} way out of all this," [...] said Ann Veronica, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her little <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the {{darkness}} and biting at her nails.|$|R
60|$|She turned round quickly. He was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and the sunbeam was {{traveling}} up toward him.|$|E
60|$|In {{the night}} I found myself <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> {{listening}} to a running and stamping near the cabin.|$|E
60|$|Lane {{found himself}} <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> wet and shaking. The room was dark. Some one was {{pounding}} on the door.|$|E
50|$|Masseria {{survived the}} point-blank hit attempt unscathed {{and was found}} by police in his upstairs bedroom shell-shocked. He was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> dazed, his ears were ringing from the {{proximity}} of the weapon fire, and there were two bullet holes through his straw hat, which he was still wearing on his head.|$|R
60|$|After supper, {{when she}} reached her bedroom, they were all present. A light was burning, and each damsel was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> whitely <b>in</b> her <b>bed,</b> {{awaiting}} Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts.|$|R
60|$|Ghirlandajo's St. Anne (I {{ought to}} have told you to notice that,--you can afterwards) is <b>sitting</b> {{strongly}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> watching, if not directing, all that is going on. Giotto's lying down on the pillow, leans her face on her hand; partly exhausted, partly in deep thought. She knows that all will be well done for the child, either by the servants, or God; she need not look after anything.|$|R
60|$|Nibs had {{to knock}} twice {{before he got}} an answer, though Tink had really been <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{listening}} for some time.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Mike, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{and staring}} through the {{darkness}} in the direction whence the numismatist's voice was proceeding. [...] "Do what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Give {{him credit}} for the best until the worst is proved,' said I, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> smoking, with my letters {{littered}} about in front of me.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was late}} before she slept, and Idella's voice broke upon her dreams. The child was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her <b>bed,</b> gloating upon the dress and hat hung and perched upon the chair-back {{in the middle}} of the room. [...] "Oh, whose is it? Whose is it? Whose is it?" [...] she screamed; and as Annie lifted herself on her elbow, and looked over at her: [...] "Is it mine? Is it mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you will, wife, as you will," [...] Jan answered, {{somewhat}} sharply, [...] "but I {{doubt if}} we shall {{get rid of}} our danger thus, for with you I think that the tide of our lives has turned, and that it sets towards sorrow. Ay," [...] he went on, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed,</b> [...] "and I will tell you when it turned; it turned upon the day that you lied to the Englishmen." ...|$|R
60|$|Cook {{was entirely}} pacified, {{and talked about}} roast chicken, and {{presently}} the little sisters were <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their <b>beds,</b> each <b>in</b> her wrapper, being fed by turns with delicately-buttered slices, Mary standing between like a mother-bird feeding her young, and pleased to find the eyes grow brighter and less hollow, the cheeks less wan, the voices less thin and pipy, and a little laugh breaking out when she mistook Minna for Ella.|$|R
6000|$|Cecil was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> very thin, {{but with}} eager eyes and flushed cheeks, {{as she held}} out her hands. [...] "Rosamond! Oh! But aren't you afraid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ugh," [...] said Faith, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> with a shiver. [...] "It's raining. I do hate a rainy Sunday. Sunday is dull enough {{even when}} it's fine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "WHAT has happened?" [...] asked Miss Keene impatiently, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> more {{alarmed at}} the unusual {{circumstance}} of Mrs. Brimmer's unfinished toilet than at her incomplete speech.|$|E
60|$|Early in {{the morning}} she crept down the ladder from the loft; her father had looped his cot up against the cabin wall and gone out. Nancy was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed</b> she had made for herself on the floor, coiling a rope of her black hair into a knot at her neck. The baby lay cooing and kicking in her lap. The morning air came in fresh and sweet at the open door.|$|R
60|$|This is what Hugh saw. At {{the far end}} of {{the room}} was a bed, near to which stood a lamp that showed, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed,</b> a {{beautiful}} young woman, whose dark hair fell all about her. Her face was flushed but not wasted or made dreadful by the sickness, as happened to so many. There she sat staring before her with her large dark eyes and a smile upon her sweet lips, like one that muses on happy things.|$|R
6000|$|While {{living on}} thus quietly {{she heard the}} news that Henchard had caught cold and was {{confined}} to his room--possibly a result of standing about the meads in damp weather. She went off to his house at once. This time she {{was determined not to}} be denied admittance, and made her way upstairs. He was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed</b> with a greatcoat round him, and at first resented her intrusion. [...] "Go away--go away," [...] he said. [...] "I don't like to see 'ee!" ...|$|R
