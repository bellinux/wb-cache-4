25|$|In {{the second}} Test match of India's 2001 tour of South Africa, at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness {{suspended}} Sachin Tendulkar for one game {{in light of}} alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar was involved in <b>scuffing</b> the seam of the cricket ball. While he was actually just removing the piece of grass stuck in the seam of ball, allegations were made against him that he tampered the ball.|$|E
25|$|Under Law 42, {{subsection}} 3 of the Laws of Cricket, the ball may be polished {{without the use}} of an artificial substance, may be dried with a towel if it is wet, and have mud removed from it under supervision; all other actions which alter the condition of the ball are illegal. These are usually taken to include rubbing the ball on the ground, <b>scuffing</b> with a fingernail or other sharp object, or tampering with the seam of the ball.|$|E

500|$|Cricket has {{a strong}} {{following}} in Northern England, and three counties are represented by first-class county cricket teams: Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The Roses Match (named for the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York) between Lancashire and Yorkshire {{is one of the}} hardest fought rivalries in the sport – the pride of both sides, and their determination not to lose, resulted in the teams developing a slow, stubborn and defensive style that proved unpopular elsewhere in the country. The London-based Marylebone Cricket Club, which controlled the game at the time, selected few Northern players for Test matches, and this was perceived as a snub to their playing style – the anger united Lancashire and Yorkshire against the South and helped cast a shared Northern identity that transcended the Roses rivalry. This divide was illustrated in the 1924 County Championship, when Yorkshire beat London-based Middlesex to claim the title. Surrey accused Yorkshire of <b>scuffing</b> the pitch and intimidating the bowlers, while the match with Middlesex was so vicious that the team threatened to never play in Yorkshire again. The Lancashire captain Jack Sharp on the other hand was quoted as saying [...] "I'm real glad a rose won it. Red or white, it doesn't matter." [...] Durham are a recent addition to top-flight cricket, having only achieved first-class status in 1992, but have won the County Championship three times.|$|E

Afridi later pleaded guilty to a level three breach of the ICC code of conduct relating {{to the spirit of}} the game.

2500|$|With the {{electrification}} of American {{cities in}} the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science—specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family's carpet, the five-year-old's imagination was sparked. Robert experimented, believing he could jump higher if the zinc from a battery could be charged by <b>scuffing</b> {{his feet on the}} gravel walk. But, holding the zinc, he could jump no higher than usual. Goddard halted the experiments after a warning from his mother that if he succeeded, he could [...] "go sailing away and {{might not be able to}} come back." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1934 {{was perhaps}} the best season of Paige's career, as he went 14–2 in league games while {{allowing}} 2.16 runs per game, recording 144 strikeouts, and giving up only 26 walks. On July 4, Paige threw his second no-hitter, this time against the Homestead Grays. He struck out 17, and only a first inning walk to future Hall of Famer Buck Leonard and an error in the fourth inning prevented it from being a perfect game. Leonard, unnerved by the rising swoop of the ball, repeatedly asked the umpire to check the ball for <b>scuffing.</b> When the umpire removed one ball from play, Paige hollered, [...] "You may as well thrown 'em all out 'cause they're all gonna jump like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|While fielding {{on during}} {{the third day of}} the 2nd Test, in Dubai, cameras {{captured}} footage of South Africa fielder Faf du Plessis <b>scuffing</b> the ball against the zip on his trousers. The on-field umpires penalised South Africa by adding 5 runs to Pakistan's total, and changing the ball. The match referee imposed a 50% match fee fine on du Plessis after the fielder pleaded guilty, although the team manager Mohammad Mosajee maintained that penalty was [...] "harsh", and the team decided not to challenge to finding as it may have led to heavier sanctions. Despite the [...] "guilty" [...] plea, team vice-captain AB de Villiers maintained that [...] "we are not cheats" [...] and team captain Graeme Smith denied that their participation in ball tampering tainted the series-levelling win as South Africa went on to record an innings-victory during the Dubai test, to tie the series 1-1.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} for Yorkshire, he {{struggled}} for form and was {{left out of}} the England Test and ODI squads to face Sri Lanka. In the County Championship he managed 25wickets at an average of 41.00. In September, Shahzad was reprimanded for <b>scuffing</b> the pitch during the penultimate Championship match against Warwickshire and fined £750. The club was relegated from the First Division in the final match of the season. Shahzad regretted the incident, explaining [...] "It's not the way I want to play my game. I don't {{want to be seen as}} a cheat, or a pitch-damager.... It's one mistake I've made in an eight- or nine-year career so far. It's out of the blue for me, and I definitely would never do anything like it again. It was just a random, stupid act." [...] Despite a trying year, Shahzad was selected in the England Performance Programme held over the English off-season.|$|E
2500|$|Also in {{the autumn}} of 1955, Perkins wrote [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] after seeing a dancer get angry with his date for <b>scuffing</b> up his shoes. Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band {{recorded}} the song during a session at Sun Studio in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics ("Go, cat, go"), and the band changed the end of the song to a [...] "boogie vamp". Presley left Sun for a RCA in November, and on December 19, 1955, Phillips, who had begun recording Perkins in late 1954, told Perkins, [...] "Carl Perkins, you're my rockabilly cat now." [...] Released on January 1, 1956, [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] was a massive chart success. In the United States, it reached number 1 on Billboard magazine's country music chart (the only number 1 success he would have) and number 2 on the Billboard Best Sellers popular music chart. On March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to reach number 3 on the rhythm and blues charts. That night, Perkins performed the song on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee, his television debut (Presley performed it for the second time that same night on CBS-TV's Stage Show; he'd first sung it on the program on February 11).|$|E
2500|$|Because {{baseball}} hitting is difficult, baseball rules {{prohibit the}} deliberate scratching or <b>scuffing</b> of a ball, or {{the application of}} any foreign substance that could conceivably affect the flight or visibility of a ball. Balls that are deliberately made more difficult to hit by applying foreign substances are often known as spitballs, regardless of the specific substance applied (such as Vaseline). Both spitballs and those that become scuffed or scratched through normal game play are immediately removed from play and never reused. The current rules regarding the condition of baseballs did not come into effect until 1920, {{after the death of}} Ray Chapman from being hit with a Carl Mays spitball. Before that point, the rules were similar to those still present in cricket. However, the new rules were not consistently enforced for several decades afterwards, and several pitchers (most notably Gaylord Perry) built careers around skirting these rules, doing such things as hiding nail files in their gloves or putting Vaseline {{on the underside of the}} peaks of their caps. In modern baseball, however, the prohibition against modifying the baseball in almost any way is strictly enforced and players found to be in violation of this rule are not only ejected from the game in which the infraction occurred, but are also subject to a suspension. The only substance applied to a baseball is the Delaware River mud formula that umpires rub in before a game to remove the [...] "shine" [...] from the ball and improve its grip. The pitcher is also allowed to use rosin on his hands (via a rosin bag) to improve his grip, and to blow on his hands in cold weather.|$|E

2500|$|Bob Willis {{opened the}} bowling {{with a stiff}} breeze behind him, but Peter Lever found it too much going into the wind and Mike Hendrick (2/64) {{replaced}} him after one over. Hendrick got Wally Edwards to mis-hook a short ball to a tumbling Dennis Amiss. At the other end Ian Redpath was backing away to leg to avoid Willis's bouncers, but exposed his off-stump and was yorked for 5, leaving Australia 10/2. The Chappell brothers recovered the innings with a stand of 100 runs in 155 minutes with Denness rotating his bowlers every four overs so they could rest. Ian Chappell was out of form and took 97 minutes to make 11 runs, but after lunch the fast bowlers were replaced by Tony Greig, who suffered as the brothers took advantage of his poor length. In {{the end it was}} Derek Underwood who dismissed Greg Chappell for 58 with the best ball of the day, a leg-spinner which clipped the edge of his bat and was taken by Keith Fletcher at slip. The Australian captain started arguing with Greig as the lanky bowler's footmarks were in line with the stumps and obliterating Chappell's block mark. Greig kept <b>scuffing</b> the block mark to even the ground so he would not trip and Chappell kept re-marking his block until they looked like schoolboys kicking dirt at each other. Chappell built up another partnership of 87 with Ross Edwards until the captain reached 90, decided to attack the bowling in the last hour of play and hooked Willis (4/56) into the hands of Greig, soon followed by Doug Walters who hooked him to Lever. Edwards was caught behind by another deadly delivery from Underwood (2/54) and 197/3 became 205/6 and 216/6 at stumps. The overnight batsmen Rod Marsh and Terry Jenner had to face Willis with the new ball and Jenner mis-hooked him to square-leg, where Lever ran 22 yards to take the catch. Marsh was beaten by Hendrick's swing and was caught by Denness to leave Australia 228/8 and in real trouble when they were saved by a wagging tail. The 6'4" [...] Max Walker started swinging the bat for 41 not out and added 29 with Dennis Lillee, who fell over trying to hook a medium-paced bouncer from Greig (1/70) and gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, who had missed a chance off Walker at 242/8. After Lillee had given Greig a few words of discouragement and walked off Jeff Thomson hit 23 and added 52 runs for the last wicket until he was run out by a brilliant pick up and throw from the England captain and Australia were all out for 309.|$|E
