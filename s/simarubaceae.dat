5000|$|The flora {{consist of}} three main types, namely; beach, kerangas, {{a type of}} {{tropical}} moist forest, and mixed dipterocarp forest, which is home to various species of plants, trees and wildlife. The Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia), belonging {{to the family of}} <b>Simarubaceae,</b> is a small and slender tree, and can grow as high as 15 m. It produces a cluster of finger-sized reddish fruits which taste bitter. On maturity its fruits turn black, similar to coffee berries. This tree is more common here than in any other national park in Sarawak. The Bintangor (Barringtonia asiatica) belongs to the Guttiferae, and can be found in both the hills and swamp forests of Sarawak.|$|E
40|$|Foi estudada a morfologia dos grãos de pólen de dez espécies de plantas de várzea e igapó provenientesda Ilha da Marchantaria e Tarumã-Mirim, localizadas a 20 Km da cidade de Manaus (AM), coletadas nos períodos de abril a agosto de 2000 e agosto de 2001. As espécies descritas foram Cassia leiandra Benth. (Caesalpiniaceae), Campsiandra comosa var. laurifolia (Benth.) Cowan (Caesalpiniaceae), Hevea spruceana (Benth.) Müll. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae), Piranhea trifoliata Baill. (Euphorbiaceae), Laetia corymbulosa Spruce ex Benth. (Flacourtiaceae), Eschweilera tenuifolia (O. Berg) Miers (Lecythidaceae), Acacia polyphylla DC. (Mimosaceae), Inga micradenia Spruce ex Benth. (Mimosaceae), Simaba orinocensis Kunth (<b>Simarubaceae),</b> Vitex cymosa Bert. ex Spreng. (Verbenaceae). A análise polínica constatou que estas espécies possuem grãos de pólen com características morfológicas bastante variadas. The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the pollen grain morphology of ten floodplain plant species from Ilha da Marchantaria and Tarumã-Mirim located 20 Km from Manaus (AM). The species were collected from April to August 2000 and August 2001. The following species were described: Cassia leiandra Benth. (Caesalpiniaceae), Campsiandra comosa var. laurifolia (Benth.) Cowan (Caesalpiniaceae), Hevea spruceana (Benth) Müll. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae), Piranhea trifoliata Baill. (Euphorbiaceae), Laetia corymbulosa Spruce ex Benth. (Flacourtiaceae), Eschweilera tenuifolia (O. Berg) Miers (Lecythidaceae), Acacia polyphylla DC. (Mimosaceae), Inga micradenia Spruce ex Benth. (Mimosaceae), Simaba orinocensis Kunth (<b>Simarubaceae),</b> Vitex cymosa Bert. ex Spreng. (Verbenaceae). The pollen analysis established that these species presented pollen grains of a great variability of morphological characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the antiallergic and anti-inflammatory properties of the methanolic extract from stem bark of Ailanthus excelsa Roxb (AEME). Herbal medicines are assuming greater importance in the primary health care of individuals and communities in many developed as well as developing countries and there has been an increase in international trade in herbal medicines. Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. is a tree belonging to family <b>Simarubaceae,</b> indigenous to central and southern India, commonly known as a plant of Heaven. In Indian system of medicine A. excelsa is used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, cough, cold, pain and inflammation. AEME was evaluated by using passive paw anaphylaxis, mast cell degranulation, bronchoalveolar lavage and histopathology of lungs in rat models. Dose response studies of AEME were conducted at 100, 200 and 400 mg kg- 1 p. o., showing significant reduction in sign and severity of symptoms. The results reveals that AEME showed antiallergic and anti-inflammatory potential...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the three species of Cneorurm is {{described}} qualitatively and quantitatively. The species differ in features related to ecology and form a clear series in this regard. The wood features of the family can all be matched by some Rutaceae and <b>Simarubaceae,</b> and the characteristics of Cneoraceae are listed in this connection. Nearly as many features are shared by Cneoraceae with Anacardiaceae and Sapindaceae; certain distinctive features {{may be found in}} somewhat more distant families, such as Oxalidaceae. Resemblances between Cneoraceae and Euphorbiaceae are attributed at least in part to the fact that Euphorbiaceae comprise a highly heterogeneous family with respect to wood anatomy. Wood {{anatomy of the}} three species of Cneorurm diverges markedly. These differences when tabulated show that the Cuban species C. trimerum is the most distinctive. Cneorum pulverulentum (Canary Islands) and C. tricoccon (northwestern Mediterranean coasts), although distinct in wood anatomy, resemble each other more closely than they resemble C. trimerum. Despite the distinctive tetramerous flowers and hexacolpate pollen of C. pulverulentum, a single genus seems advisable; C. trimerum cannot be readily segregated on the basis of gross morphology...|$|E
40|$|All the assays {{were done}} with an aqueous {{preparation}} of dry wood from Quassia amara (<b>Simarubaceae).</b> For the hippocratic assay, 12 female SDN rats were used, with an average weight of 144 g and separated in three groups of four individuals each. The dose used were 500 mglkg and 1 000 mglkg and the control group received 0. 5 mi of destilIed water. The extraet administration and the observation of the animals were done daily during nine days. Acute toxicity of the preparation was studied with 25 male NGP mice with an average weight of 20. 13 g, in groups of five individuals per dose. The oral administration was carry out with the following doses: 250, 500, 750 and 1 000 mglkg, the control group received 0. 5 mi of destilled water. No sigu of acute toxicity was observed at any dose. For the toxicity analysis via intraperitoneal inyeetion 15 male NGP mice were assigned to five groups (5 animals each) with doses of 500 and 1 000 mglkg and a control group with 0. 5 mI of destilled water. The group with the dose of 500 mglkg, presented acute toxicity signs with a 24 hr recovery, and the 1 000 mglkg dose was letal to a 100 % within 24 hr. The measuring of the peristaltie activity (movement of the intestinal content) were performed on 30 NGP male miee with an average weight of 22 g assigued to three groups of ten individual s each. One dose of 500 mglkg and 1 000 mglkg were orally adnñnistrated to each experimental group and 0. 5 ml of destilled water to the control group. The marker used was activated carbon, orally supplied to every mice 30 min after {{the administration of the}} aqueous extract. The animals are decapitated and the measurement of the carbon motion in the small intestine was done after 30 min. Both dose increased the intestinal movement compared to the control group, but only the. 1 000 mglkg dose showed a statistically significant difference (p :S;O. 05).
