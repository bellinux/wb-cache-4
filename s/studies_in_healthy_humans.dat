40|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (rTMS) {{is emerging}} as a potentially valuable intervention to augment the effects of behavioral therapy for stroke. When {{used in conjunction with}} other therapies, rTMS embraces the concept of metaplasticity. Due to homeostatic mechanisms inherent to metaplasticity, interventions known in isolation to enhance excitability can interact when applied successively under certain timing conditions and produce enhanced or opposite effects. It will be shown that similar to “muscular wisdom”, with its self-protective mechanisms, there also appears to be synaptic wisdom in neural networks with homeostatic processes that prevent over- and under-excitability. These processes hold implications for both enhancing and suppressing the desired effects from behavioral therapy. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to relate the concept of metaplasticity, as derived from <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans,</b> to stroke rehabilitation and consider how it can be leveraged to maximize stroke outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{body of evidence}} in animals indicating that elevated oxidative stress impairs baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) function, however <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> have yielded equivocal results. One potential reason for this discrepancy is that previous studies have used individual antioxidant treatments (e. g., Vitamin C only) to investigate the effect of oxidative stress on BRS. Recent <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> have demonstrated significant reductions in reactive oxygen species using an antioxidant cocktail (AOC; Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Co-enzyme Q 10) suggesting {{the effectiveness of this}} treatment. Whether this AOC induced reduction in oxidative species affects BRS in young, healthy adults remains unknown. PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that AOC will improve cardiac BRS in young healthy adults. METHODS: Five young men were studied on two separate days: placebo (sugar pills) and AOC (2000 mg Vitamin C, 150 IU Vitamin E and 100 mg Co-enzyme Q 10) performed in random order. Resting heart rate (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (automated sphygmomanometer and finger photoplethysmography) were measured 90 minutes after AOC or placebo (a time period this AOC has been shown to have peak effects on oxidative stress). Spontaneous cardiac BRS was determined for all sequences combined (overall BRS), and also separately for up (increase systolic blood pressure: increase R-R interval) and down (decrease systolic blood pressure: decrease R-R interval) sequences. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure on AOC day tended to be lower relative to the placebo day (127 ± 4 vs. 131 ± 5; p= 0. 098). However, no differences in overall cardiac BRS were found between placebo and AOC (18. 0 ± 2. 7 vs. 17. 3 ± 2. 6 ms/mmHg; p= 0. 59). Likewise, up sequences (17. 02 ± 2. 9 vs 14. 04 ± 4. 0 ms/mmHg; p= 0. 51) and down sequences (18. 0 ± 2. 7 placebo vs. 18. 0 ± 2. 6 ms/mmHg AOC; p= 0. 98) were not different between conditions. Equal number of sequences were found between the placebo and AOC days. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that antioxidant treatment does not affect resting cardiac BRS in young, healthy men...|$|E

The importance of understanding the emotional brain has motivated hundreds of neuroimaging <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> and patients with psychological disorders.

In a study published this week in PLOS Biology, Luke Chang and Tor Wager of the Universi-ty of Colorado at Boulder and their collaborators used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and machine-learning algorithms to identify a sensitive and specific brain signature that predicts the intensity of negative emotion in individuals [1]. Strikingly, this signature en-compasses multiple widely distributed neural networks rather than a few individual emotion-related brain regions. According to the authors, the neural signature could be used to diagnose mental illness, predict responses to treatment, and guide the development of new brain-based therapies.

40|$|Many {{situations}} in our everyday life {{call for a}} mechanism deputed to outright stop an ongoing course of action. This behavioral inhibition ability, known as response stopping, is often impaired in psychiatric conditions characterized by impulsivity and poor inhibitory control. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently been proposed {{as a tool for}} modulating response stopping in such clinical populations, and previous <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> have already shown that this noninvasive brain stimulation technique is effectively able to improve response stopping, as measured in a stop-signal task (SST) administered immediately after the stimulation. So far, the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) has been the main focus of these attempts to modulate response stopping by the means of noninvasive brain stimulation. However, other cortical areas such as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) have been implicated in inhibitory control with other paradigms. In order to provide new insight about the involvement of these areas in response stopping, in the present study, tDCS was delivered to 115 healthy subjects, using five stimulation setups that differed in terms of target area (rIFG or rDLPFC) and polarity of stimulation (anodal, cathodal, or sham). The SST was performed 15 min after the offset of the stimulation. Consistently with previous studies, only anodal stimulation over rIFG induced a reliable, although weak, improvement in the SST, which was specific for response stopping, as it was not mirrored in more general reaction time measures...|$|E

When cell’s capacity {{to protect itself}} fails, oxidative stress occurs. Because of bioactive components vegetables are now considered helpful in preventing chronic pathologies in which oxidative damage is an important etiologic factor. Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) fruit contains substantial amounts of vitamin C, biothiols, and taurine, and redox-active betalain pigments.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to formulate gastro retentive floating drug delivery systems (GRFDDS) of propranolol HCl by central composite design and to study the effect of formulation variables on floating lag time, D 1 hr (% drug release at 1 [*]hr) and t 90 (time required to release 90 % of the drug). 3 factor central composite design was employed {{for the development of}} GRFDDS containing novel semi synthetic polymer carboxymethyl ethyl cellulose (CMEC) as a release retarding polymer. CMEC, sodium bicarbonate and Povidone concentrations were included as independent variables. The tablets were prepared by direct compression method and were evaluated for in vitro buoyancy and dissolution studies. From the polynomial model fitting statistical analysis, it was confirmed that the response floating lag time and D 1 hr is suggested to quadratic model and t 90 is suggested to linear model. All the statistical formulations followed first order rate kinetics with non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. The desirability function was used to optimize the response variables, each having a different target, and the observed responses were highly agreed with experimental values. Statistically optimized formulation was characterized by FTIR and DSC studies and found no interactions between drug and polymer. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the model in the development of GRFDDS containing a propranolol HCl. Statistically optimized formulation was evaluated for in vivo buoyancy <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> for both fed and fasted states.

Paralysis of limb movement after stroke {{is a major}} cause of disability. Recovery of function is linked to favorable brain reorganization. The brain is primed for neuroplastic reorganization after stroke but the rehabilitation interventions must be well designed. Forced use of the paretic limb as a training regimen {{has been shown to be}} effective; however, the optimal kinematic parameters are not known. Studies in primates have shown that motor cortical neurons are coded for velocity of limb movement. <b>Studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> have shown a relationship between velocity of limb movement and cortical activation. Thus, we hypothesize that higher-velocity finger movement training will be significantly more effective than lower-velocity and that the improved finger function will correlate significantly with brain reorganization. Multiple data points were collected using single-subject cross over design with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and function tests. Subjects were trained at home, assisted by telerehabilitation devices supervised by a remote physical therapist. Subjects performed 28, 800 repetitions of finger extension and flexion movements at lower-velocity and 28, 800 at higher-velocity separated by a 3 -week baseline phase. Fast-velocity training had significantly greater functional improvement compared to the slow-velocity training in the Box and Block Test, but not consistently in the Jebsen-Taylor and finger force tests. Fast-velocity training did not show significantly greater cortical reorganization compared to the slow-velocity training by TMS or fMRI testing.

40|$|Folate is a {{water soluble}} vitamin {{required}} for optimal health, growth and development. It occurs naturally {{in various states}} of oxidation of the pteridine ring and with varying lengths to its glutamate chain. Folates function as one-carbon donors through methyl transferase catalyzed reactions. Low-folate diets, especially by those with suboptimal methyltransferase activity, are associated with increased risk of neural tube birth defects in children, hyperhomocysteinemic heart disease, and cancer in adults. Rapidly dividing (neoplastic) cells have a high folate need for DNA synthesis. Chemical analogs of folate (antifolates) that interfere with folate metabolism are used as therapeutic agents in cancer treatment. Although much is known about folate chemistry, metabolism of this vitamin in vivo in humans is not well understood. Since folate levels in blood and tissues are very low and methods to measure them are inadequate, the few previous studies that have examined folate metabolism used large doses of radiolabeled folic acid in patients with Hodgkin�s disease and cancer (Butterworth et al. 1969, Krumdieck et al. 1978). A subsequent protocol using deuterated folic acid was also insufficiently sensitive to trace a physiologic folate dose (Stites et al. 1997). Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is an emerging bioanalytical tool that overcomes the limitations of traditional mass spectrometry and of decay counting of long lived radioisotopes (Vogel et al. 1995).

BackgroundPatients with liver cirrhosis and chronic heart failure (CHF) have a reduced capacity to excrete water. <b>Studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> {{have shown that}} an acute water load reduces the excretion of aquaporin- 2 in urine (u-AQP- 2). We wanted {{to test the hypothesis}} that an acute water load reduces u-AQP- 2 less in patients with liver cirrhosis or CHF than in healthy humans. MethodsFourteen healthy subjects, 14 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 14 patients with CHF were given an oral water load of 20 mL/kg. Urine was collected every 30 minutes for 4 hours for analysis of u-AQP- 2. Blood samples were drawn at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study for analysis of arginine vasopressin (AVP). u-AQP- 2 was determined by radioimmunoassay. ResultsDuring the study period, urinary output was 22. 8 % higher than water intake in the healthy controls and increased 14 -fold from baseline, but in patients with liver cirrhosis and CHF urinary output was 14 % and 24 % less than the intake, while urinary output increased 7 - and 19 -fold from baseline, respectively. u-AQP 2 decreased significantly more in patients with CHF (39 %) than in healthy controls (17 %) but it was unchanged in those with liver cirrhosis. AVP decreased 46 % in patients with CHF, but was unchanged in healthy controls and those with liver cirrhosis. A 24 -hour urinary excretion of AQP- 2 was significantly elevated in patients with CHF (median, 25. 7 nmol/mol creatinine) compared to healthy controls (15. 7 nmol/mol creatinine) and those with liver cirrhosis (17 nmol/mol creatinine). ConclusionThe excretion of AQP- 2 in urine is abnormal both in liver cirrhosis in which we find less suppression of u-AQP 2 by an acute water load and in CHF in which we find a high baseline level and an exaggerated suppression of u-AQP 2 by an acute water load...|$|E
40|$|In the {{majority}} of patients with type 2 diabetes, who have reasonably good glycemic control (HbA₁C ~ 7. 5 % or less), it is postprandial glycemia which predominates over fasting blood glucose in contributing to HbA₁C; postprandial glycemia may therefore represent an independent risk factor for diabetic complications and adverse cardiovascular events (Monnier et al., 2003). Also, at the same HbA₁C level, subjects with larger fluctuations in the blood glucose levels postprandially carry a higher cardiovascular risk (Del Prato, 2002 b). The magnitude of postprandial glycemic excursions is largely determined by the rate of gastric emptying of nutrients to the small intestine which in turn regulates various metabolically important neurohumoral responses set off mainly by the release of incretin hormones from the enteroendocrine cells of the intestine. Conversely, acute glycemic excursions can regulate gastric emptying through feedback mechanisms. This thesis highlights the pivotal role of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the regulation of postprandial glycemia and attendant cardiovascular risks in health and type 2 diabetes, and the capacity for interventions aimed at modulation of upper gut function {{to be effective in}} the treatment of diabetes. Following is a brief outline of the experimental studies described in this thesis: 1. Changes in meal composition and duration affect postprandial endothelial function in healthy humans Impaired endothelial function is now well-recognized as a forerunner of atherosclerosis (Juonala et al., 2004), and is predictive of long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Vogel, 2001). The endothelial dysfunction after an oral glucose load is related to the degree of rise in blood glucose in both health and type 2 diabetes (Title et al., 2000, Kawano et al., 1999), with the duration of dysfunction being greater in the latter (Akbari et al., 1998). The rate of gastric emptying is a major determinant of postprandial glycemic increments (Chaikomin et al., 2006, Marathe et al., 2013) and modulating gastric emptying and/or nutrient absorption from the upper gut can be achieved non-pharmacologically by modifying the composition of a meal, for example by adding soluble fiber such as guar gum (Holt et al., 1979, Torsdottir et al., 1989), or by decreasing the rate of meal ingestion (Zhu et al., 2013). Though the effects of such dietary manipulations on glycemia have been described previously, their influence on postprandial endothelial function had not been investigated. We therefore evaluated the effects of dietary modifications designed to slow gastric emptying and/or small intestinal nutrient absorption on postprandial endothelial function in healthy humans. 2. The glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) receptor agonist, exenatide, inhibits small intestinal motility, flow, transit and absorption of glucose in health and type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial. The presence of glucose in the small intestine stimulates the release of several peptides, including glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) (Schirra et al., 1996); the latter has a critical role in determining postprandial insulin and glycemic responses, mainly via its ability to slow gastric emptying and regulate nutrient delivery to the small intestine, though other factors such as its insulinotropic property could also be involved. Lately, GLP- 1 receptor agonists have been used widely in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, (Holst and Gromada, 2004, Elahi et al., 1994). Exenatide belongs to this class of medications and is resistant to degradation by the plasma enzyme di-peptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) that rapidly degrades endogenous GLP- 1. Previous <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> have demonstrated that intravenous exogenous GLP- 1 slows gastric emptying (Little et al., 2006 b, Nauck et al., 1997 b), but the effects of GLP- 1, or agonists of its receptor, on small intestinal flow events and transit have not yet been evaluated in humans. Data from animal studies have shown that exogenous GLP- 1 inhibits small intestinal motility and transit (Tolessa et al., 1998 b, Tolessa et al., 1998 a), which could represent an additional mechanism in the lowering of postprandial glycemia. This chapter describes the effects of the GLP- 1 receptor agonist, exenatide on duodenal pressure waves, flow events, small intestinal transit time, and the rate of small intestinal glucose absorption in healthy humans as well as in those with type 2 diabetes. 3. Effects of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) receptor agonist, exenatide, on blood pressure and heart rate in response to intraduodenal glucose infusion in type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial. It is well recognised that the magnitude of postprandial hypotension depends largely on the rate of gastric emptying (Trahair et al., 2012 b); hence glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) receptor stimulation, which slows gastric emptying, could potentially be used as a treatment for postprandial hypotension. As exogenous GLP- 1 has been found to increase blood pressure in some human studies, albeit not consistently (Edwards et al., 1998, Halbirk et al., 2010, Bharucha et al., 2008), and attenuate the hypotensive effect of both oral (Trahair et al., 2015) and intraduodenal (Trahair et al., 2014 b) glucose loads, mechanisms other than just slowing of gastric emptying could potentially be involved. In this chapter, we present the effects of an intravenous infusion of a GLP- 1 receptor agonist, exenatide, on systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate, measured in the course of Study 2 (above), during and after the intraduodenal glucose infusion. 4. Effects of hydroxycitrate (HCA) on intestinal glucose absorption and incretin release in healthy subjects and in type 2 diabetes. It is now well-recognised that patients with greater fluctuations in blood glucose carry a greater cardiovascular risk than those with lesser excursions, even if HbA₁C levels are similar (Del Prato, 2002 a). Therefore, there has been an emerging interest in exploring the therapeutic potential of inhibiting/delaying postprandial small intestinal carbohydrate absorption in order to dampen the glycemic spikes (Qualmann et al., 1995). Extracts from the fruit Garcinia cambogia, in which hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is the active ingredient, have been widely marketed for weight loss, but may also reduce postprandial glycemia. The latter claim is based mainly on findings from rodent studies, where HCA was associated with a delay in glucose absorption, and stimulation of GLP- 1 release from the distal gut. In this chapter, we describe the effects of small intestinal pre-treatment with HCA on glucose absorption and incretin release in healthy humans and in patients with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes. 5. Effects of 5 weeks resveratrol supplementation on GLP- 1 secretion, gastric emptying, and postprandial glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, found in plant foods including red grapes, improves glycemic control in experimental animals with type 2 diabetes by uncertain mechanisms (Vang et al., 2011) and could be attractive as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes in humans because it is safe and relatively inexpensive. In a high fat diet mouse model of diabetes, supplementation with resveratrol for 5 weeks was associated with a reduction in the glycemic excursion after an oral glucose tolerance test, together with an enhanced insulin response and substantially increased concentrations of GLP- 1 in the portal vein (Dao et al., 2011), as well as increases in the proglucagon mRNA and GLP- 1 content in the colon. However, effects of resveratrol on GLP- 1 secretion have not previously been evaluated in humans with diabetes. This chapter describes the effects of 5 weeks of resveratrol supplementation on GLP- 1 secretion, gastric emptying, and postprandial glycemia in patients with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes. 6. Comparative effect of intraduodenal and intrajejunal glucose infusion on the gut-incretin axis response in healthy males Bariatric surgical procedures such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are known to result in improvements in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, which is associated with an enhanced incretin response. In this chapter, we examined whether bypassing the duodenum would elicit a greater response of the gut-incretin axis to small intestinal glucose infusion, by comparing plasma GLP- 1, GIP, insulin and glucagon, and blood glucose responses to a standardised glucose infusion into the proximal jejunum and duodenum in healthy humans. 7. Mechanism of increase in plasma intact GLP- 1 by metformin in type 2 diabetes: stimulation of GLP- 1 secretion or reduction in plasma DPP- 4 activity? The critical role of GLP- 1 in glucose homeostasis is being increasingly recognised. In this chapter, we describe the effects of the widely used anti-diabetic medication, metformin, on total and intact GLP- 1 concentrations, and on the activity of plasma dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 (DPP- 4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of GLP- 1, before and during an intraduodenal glucose infusion in patients with type 2 diabetes.

At 0.54 mg/kg (just under 3xED95 dose), one of four volunteers experienced histamine release with associated hypotension (30% maximum decrease in blood pressure and 13% maximum increase in heart rate) but no cutaneous flushing. At the highest administered dose of 0.72 mg/kg, three of four volunteers experienced histamine release with associated hypotension (17% to 34% maximum decrease in blood pressure and 16% to 25% increase in heart rate) and cutaneous flushing. These effects were transient and lasted no more than two minutes and did not require any adjunctive treatment to address the changes in blood pressure or heart rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of phenylpropanolamine {{have been}} <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> volunteers following the oral administration of an aqueous {{solution of the}} drug (50 mg/ 200 ml). Blood and urine samples collected throughout the trial were assayed using HPLC with UV detection. The drug was shown to be rapidly absorbed with a mean tmax of 1. 47 ± 0. 49 h and a mean elimination half-life of 4. 0 ± 0. 5 h. Phenylpropanolamine is predominantly excreted via the kidney with a mean renal clearance of 0. 646 ± 0. 089 liter/kg/h and 90. 2 ± 1. 7 % excreted unchanged in the urine. The data were not well described using conventional one or two body compartment models. However, the incorporation of a discontinuous absorption phase into the models resulted in an improved overall fit with better characterisation of the absorption phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of various test meals and fluid volumes {{on the relative}} bioavailability of commercial formulations of doxycycline hyclate and tetracycline hydrochloride was <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> volunteers. Serum levels of tetracycline were uniformly reduced by approximately 50 % by all test meals, whereas serum levels of doxycycline were reduced by 20 %. The reduction of tetracycline serum levels will likely be of clinical significance. The bioavailability of each drug was almost identical from an oral solution and from capsules in fasted subjects. The rate of doxycycline absorption was reduced when capsules were administered with a small volume of water, but the overall efficiency of absorption of both drugs was essentially independent of co-administered fluid volume. The use of 8 -h serum data provides a reliable estimate of drug bioavailability for tetracycline and, to a lesser extent, for doxycycline...|$|R
40|$|The {{stereoselective}} {{disposition of}} carbenicillin epimers was <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> volunteers. There {{was a difference}} between the two epimers in the extent of plasma protein binding in vitro, with the unbound fraction of the R epimer being greater than that of the S epimer. Renal clearance (CLR) of each epimer was greater than the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting renal tubular secretion of both epimers. Although the CLR was greater for the R epimer, renal tubular secretion was greater for the S epimer. When probenecid was coadministered, the CLR of each epimer was significantly reduced and was approximately equal to the glomerular filtration rate. The difference in CLR between the two epimers was simply due to differences in plasma protein binding. The observations <b>in</b> the present <b>study</b> suggest that both carbenicillin epimers are secreted by an organic anion transport system in the renal proximal tubule in humans and that the two epimers may be distinguished in the secretion process, resulting in the differences in the secretion rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunogenicity}} {{and safety}} of a heat-inactivated hepatitis B vaccine (HB-vaccine) were <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> volunteers (n = 471) at a low risk to be infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and in patients on chronic haemodialysis (n = 227), who were treated in hepatitis B free centres. After vaccination with 3 injections of 3 micrograms heat-inactivated HBsAg adsorbed to A 1 PO 4, given at monthly intervals, 93 % of the healthy low risk volunteers had formed anti-HBs. The haemodialysis patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, which were vaccinated with 3 monthly injections of 3 micrograms and 27 micrograms heat-inactivated HBsAg, respectively. It appeared, that this 9 -fold increase of the vaccine-dosage enhanced the anti-HBs response from 77 % in the 3 micrograms vaccinees to 94 % in the 27 micrograms recipients. Side-effects of the vaccination were negligible, formation of autoantibodies in consequence of the vaccine treatment was not demonstrated {{in any of the}} vaccinee...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that protein hydrolysates providing mainly di- and tripeptides are superior to intact (whole) proteins and free amino acids in terms of skeletal muscle protein anabolism. This review provides a critical examination of protein hydrolysate <b>studies</b> conducted <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> with special reference to sports nutrition. The effects of protein hydrolysate ingestion on blood amino acid levels, muscle protein anabolism, body composition, exercise performance and muscle glycogen resynthesis are discussed. </p...|$|R
50|$|A small, {{double blind}} <b>study</b> was done <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> to {{determine}} the analgesic effects. CR665 was dosed at 0.36 mg/kg I.V., and was compared to 15 mg oxycodone orally. CR665 had analgesic effects on visceral pain, but produced a hyperalgesic response in a skin pinch test.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop and {{optimize}} floating-bioadhesive bilayer gastroretentive drug delivery system (GRDDS) exhibiting a unique combination of floatation and bioadhesion to prolong residence in the stomach using captopril (CP) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as a model drug. Captopril being unstable in intestinal pH and HCTZ has specific absorption from duodenum and the first part of the jejunum and to a small extent in the stomach are suitable candidate for GRDDS. 32 factorial design was employed in formulating and optimizing the GRDDS for bilayer tablet of CP and HCTZ matrix tablet. The main effect and interaction terms were quantitatively evaluated using a mathematical model. The gastroretentive ability of the tablets was evaluated by X-radiographic <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> volunteer. The tablet releases CP and HCTZ for extended period up to 24 h in controlled manner. The predicted values agreed well with the experimental values and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the optimization methodology in the development of GRDDS. The tablet was buoyant for up to 16 h in human stomach. Development of once a day gastroretentive formulation of CP and HCTZ improves the patience compliance and bioavailability of drugs...|$|R
40|$|While spinal {{manipulation}} is {{widely seen as}} a reasonable treatment option for biomechanical disorders of the spine, such as neck pain and low back pain, the use of {{spinal manipulation}} to treat non-musculoskeletal complaints remains controversial. This controversy {{is due in part}} to the perception that there is no robust neurobiological rationale to justify using a biomechanical treatment of the spine to address a disorder of visceral function. This paper therefore looks at the physiological evidence that spinal manipulation can impact visceral function. A structured search was conducted, using PubMed and the Index to Chiropractic Literature, to construct of corpus of primary data <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> subjects of the effects of spinal manipulation on visceral function. The corpus of literature is not large, and the greatest number of papers concerns cardiovascular function. Authors often attribute visceral effects of spinal manipulation to somato-autonomic reflexes. While this is not unreasonable, little attention is paid to alternative mechanisms such as somato-humoural pathways. Thus, while the literature confirms that mechanical stimulation of the spine modulates some organ functions in some cohorts, a comprehensive neurobiological rationale for this general phenomenon has yet to appear...|$|R

40|$|GLUTAMINE AND ARGININE are two {{amino acids}} that have {{received}} inexhaustible attention by different research groups {{all over the}} world over the past decades. This attention is justified by their potential to enhance recovery of surgical and critically ill patients. The beneficial potential of glutamine and arginine is furthermore supported by numerous trials and an ongoing meta-analysis in surgical and critically ill patients who re-ceived a supplemental amount of glutamine or arginine (www. criticalcarenutrition. com). In this issue of this Journal, Tomlinson et al. (28) present the results of a <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>humans</b> about the precursor relation between glutamine and arginine. Apart from the clin-ical importance of glutamine and arginine as addressed above, {{the relationship between the two}} amino acids has gained interest due to the assumed importance of glutamine as a nitrogen and carbon donor for the synthesis of arginine. The importance of glutamine as an important precursor for the synthesis of citrulline, the sole precursor for the de novo synthesis of arginine, was previously established <b>in</b> animal <b>studies</b> by Windmueller and Spaeth and others many years ago (31 – 34) (Fig. 1). <b>In</b> addition, several <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> animals and humans confirmed the important precursor relationship be-tween glutamine, citrulline, and arginine by showing that plasma levels of citrulline and arginine increased after provi...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pentagastrin}} and the putative gastrin antagonist proglumide on interdigestive motility {{of the upper}} small bowel were <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> a randomised double blind <b>study</b> <b>in</b> 10 <b>healthy</b> <b>human</b> volunteers. Intraluminal pressures were recorded manometrically in the duodenum and jejunum for five hours. Sixty minutes after starting a pentagastrin infusion (0. 15 micrograms/kg/h) either placebo or proglumide was infused intravenously. Pentagastrin converted the normal interdigestive motility to irregular motor activity, while proglumide restored the periodic fasted pattern. We conclude that gastrin is a likely candidate involved in {{the conversion of the}} fasted to the fed motility pattern in the human upper gut...|$|R
