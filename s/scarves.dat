5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for <b>scarves</b> and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox <b>scarves</b> exceeds the total number of <b>scarves</b> made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for <b>scarves</b> and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, <b>scarves,</b> or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|The batik {{industry}} of Java flourished {{from the late}} 1800s to early 1900s, but declined during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia.

Batik has become a fashion item for many Indonesians, and may be seen on shirts, dresses, or <b>scarves</b> for casual wear; it is a preferred replacement for jacket-and-tie at certain receptions.

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's <b>scarves.</b> They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing.

5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, <b>scarves,</b> and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E
