60|$|This last {{aspect of}} the matter was speedily brought to my notice, which till then it had escaped, by a letter from her, handed to me one night at the club, where I was <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> and musing on the {{excellence}} of life in this {{best of all possible}} worlds.|$|E
60|$|This done, {{without waiting}} further orders, noting that his master was already <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> {{with one hand}} while he made a {{correction}} on the proof with the other, Oh My picked up a rosy, filmy, lacy boudoir cap from the floor and departed. His exit was noiseless. He ebbed away like a shadow through the open French windows.|$|E
60|$|Polly liked Dick to be jealous, but {{she liked}} that old {{scarecrow}} in the A.B.C. shop very much too, {{and though she}} made sundry vague promises {{from time to time}} to Mr. Richard Frobisher, she nevertheless drifted back instinctively day after day to the tea-shop in Norfolk Street, Strand, and stayed there <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> for as long as the man in the corner chose to talk.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the town}} is a tourist destination, with the seafront promenades thronged with cafes and small shops, pizzerias and restaurants, where it is {{possible}} to <b>sip</b> <b>coffee</b> or dine al-fresco on the outside terraces with views to the sea just 100 m away.|$|R
60|$|Afterward Babbitt was not angry. He was afraid. He {{did not go}} to {{the next}} lunch of the Boosters' Club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and, while he munched a ham-and-egg {{sandwich}} and <b>sipped</b> <b>coffee</b> from a cup on the arm of his chair, he worried.|$|R
60|$|Hodder <b>sipped</b> his <b>coffee,</b> {{and looked}} out at the morning-glories opening to the sun.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John, {{the major}} and Arthur {{were in the}} court, smoking and <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee.</b> The {{events of the past}} night were still being earnestly {{discussed}} by them and much speculation was indulged in concerning the rooms in the hollow wall and the uses to which they had been put during the pioneer days when Cristoval constructed them, and even afterward when his son, the last owner, had occupied the premises.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Weissmann had {{finished}} taking his notes and measurements, he {{locked the door}} of the library and joined them all in the dining-room, where they were <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> and nibbling cake. Morton was sitting beside Viola (who had entirely regained her girlish lightness of mood), and was chafing her cold hand in the effort to restore the circulation as well as to remove the deep mark the silken thread had made about her wrist.|$|E
60|$|The coffee-room was capacious, and adorned in {{a manner}} which intimated it was not kept by an Englishman, or much used by Englishmen. The walls were painted in frescoed arabesques. There were many guests, principally seated at small tables of marble, and on benches and chairs covered with a coarse crimson velvet. Some were <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee,</b> some were {{drinking}} wine, others were smoking or playing dominoes, or doing both; while many were engaged in reading the foreign journals which abounded.|$|E
60|$|Julien made no reply. He <b>sipped</b> his <b>coffee</b> for a moment. Then {{he turned}} slowly round.|$|R
60|$|Tuppence <b>sipped</b> her <b>coffee</b> with {{a deeply}} {{reflective}} air, and snubbed Tommy {{when he spoke}} to her.|$|R
50|$|Komšić {{was born}} in Sarajevo to a Bosnian Croat father, Marko, and Bosnian Serb mother Danica (née Stanić; 1941 - 1 August 1992), who {{was killed by a}} sniper as she <b>sipped</b> <b>coffee</b> in her {{apartment}} during the Siege of Sarajevo. His maternal grandfather Marijan Stanić, who was a Chetnik during World War II, died two years before Komšić was born. The Stanić family hailed from the village Kostajnica by Doboj.|$|R
60|$|The great Lord of Steyne was {{standing}} by the fire <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee.</b> The fire crackled and blazed pleasantly There was a score of candles sparkling round the mantel piece, in all sorts of quaint sconces, of gilt and bronze and porcelain. They lighted up Rebecca's figure to admiration, as she sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers. She was in a pink dress that looked as fresh as a rose; her dazzling white arms and shoulders were half-covered with a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled; her hair hung in curls round her neck; one of her little feet peeped out from the fresh crisp folds of the silk: the prettiest little foot in the prettiest little sandal in the finest silk stocking in the world.|$|E
60|$|At a small table, {{before a}} fire of English sea-coal, sat Mr. Pyncheon, <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee,</b> which {{had grown to}} be a very {{favorite}} beverage with him in France. He was a middle-aged and really handsome man, with a wig flowing down upon his shoulders; his coat was of blue velvet, with lace on the borders and at the button-holes; and the firelight glistened on the spacious breadth of his waistcoat, which was flowered all over with gold. On the entrance of Scipio, ushering in the carpenter, Mr. Pyncheon turned partly round, but resumed his former position, and proceeded deliberately to finish his cup of coffee, without immediate notice of the guest whom he had summoned to his presence. It was not that he intended any rudeness or improper neglect,--which, indeed, he would have blushed to be guilty of,--but it never occurred to him that a person in Maule's station had a claim on his courtesy, or would trouble himself about it one way or the other.|$|E
60|$|The voyage was {{pleasant}} but very slow. When {{the wind was}} favourable a great sail was hoisted; when it was not, the boat drifted down the river. The passengers passed the time away in eating many meals, consisting principally of the bread and fruit they purchased at the villages where the boat stopped, and in <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> and smoking innumerable cigarettes. Of an evening the three ladies brought out guitars, and there was much singing by them and the male passengers, several of whom {{were able to take}} a turn at the musical instruments. Lines were put over, and occasionally fish caught. So week after week passed. The passengers changed frequently, but Stephen found all to be cheerful and sociable. Twice he had to change his craft for another of precisely the same size, rig, and slowness. The shores afforded but slight amusement, being low, {{and for the most part}} wooded, and indeed the river was for a time so wide that the land on either hand was invisible. Once or twice they met with strong winds, and the waves got up rapidly. The craft rolled heavily, and the passengers were for the most part prostrated by terror and sea-sickness.|$|E
50|$|Young-min and Yujin {{walked out}} of the library as they <b>sipped</b> some <b>coffee.</b> Yujin talked about her past experiences.|$|R

50|$|Test track {{trials of}} SARTRE {{platooning}} {{took place at}} the Volvo Proving Ground near Gothenburg, Sweden and in a public road in Spain. In January 2011 the first successful trial took place at Volvo's test track in Sweden, in which a single car followed behind a rigid truck. With control being taken by the truck, the driver of the slaved car was able to take his hands off the wheel, read a newspaper, and <b>sip</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|R

[p.11]The {{better to}} blind the {{inquisitive}} eyes of servants and visitors, my friend, Larking, lodged {{me in an}} out-house, where I could revel in the utmost freedom of life and manners. And although some Armenian Dragoman, a restless spy like all his race, occasionally remarked voila un Persan diablement degage, none, except those who were entrusted with the secret, had any idea of the part I was playing. The domestics, devout Moslems, pronounced me an 'Ajami,[FN#16] a kind of Mohammedan, not a good one like themselves, but, still better than nothing. I lost no time in securing {{the assistance of a}} Shaykh,[FN#17] and plunged once more into the intricacies of the Faith; revived my recollections of religious ablutions, read the Koran, and again became an adept in the art of prostration. My leisure hours were employed in visiting the baths and coffee-houses, in attending the bazars, and in shopping,-an operation which hereabouts consists of sitting upon a chapman's counter, smoking, <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee,</b> and telling your beads the while, to show that you are not of the slaves for whom time is made; in fact, in pitting your patience against that of your adversary, the vendor. I found time for a short excursion to a country village {{on the banks of the}} canal; nor was an opportunity of seeing [...] "Al-nahl," [...] the [...] "Bee-dance;" [...] neglected, for it would be some months before my eyes might dwell on such a pleasant spectacle again.

50|$|In 1987, Burlington-based music {{producer}} Todd Lockwood was <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> at Leunig's Bistro {{when he came}} up {{with the}} idea to approach the city's mayor, Bernie Sanders, to record a musical project at his studio, White Crow Audio. Lockwood wrote a letter to Mayor Sanders and a meeting was arranged at the mayor's office. Lockwood originally imagined the album as an audio portrait of Bernie Sanders, but Sanders saw it as an opportunity to tell a much larger story.|$|E

60|$|To my delight {{she never}} once {{looked toward the}} beach, and I {{maintained}} the banter with such success all unconsciously she <b>sipped</b> <b>coffee</b> from the china cup, ate fried evaporated potatoes, and spread marmalade on her biscuit. But it could not last. I saw the surprise that came over her. She had discovered the china plate from which she was eating. She looked over the breakfast, noting detail after detail. Then she looked at me, and her face turned slowly toward the beach.|$|R

50|$|While the {{university}} is in session, The Corner is especially active at lunchtime, when faculty, staff, and students adjourn there for the midday meal. Patrons of the Corner's sidewalk cafés can be found spending time over a good book or simply <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> and people watching. Of the 67 businesses in the district, all but sixteen are locally owned, though {{there has been an}} increase in chain stores recently. The Corner is encompassed by a Charlottesville historic district, limiting redevelopment and demolition.|$|E
50|$|On October 22, 1940, Ignacio Antinori was <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> at the Palm Garden Inn in Tampa with {{a friend}} and a young female companion.

The gunman was allegedly sent by one of Antinori's dissatisfied customers, the Chicago Outfit criminal organization. Antinori had sent the Outfit a poor quality shipment of narcotics. When the Outfit complained, Antinori refused a refund. At that point, the Outfit put a murder contract on Antinori.|$|E

50|$|The Cigar Box Method {{has been}} {{developed}} by Olivier van Lieshout and Orlando van Geuns, and is actively being used by agro-entrepreneurs worldwide. Recent examples are from EBRD-sponsored projecys in Morocco, Ukraine, Egypt, Montenegro and Bosnia as well from ITC-sponsored projects in Romania, Armenia, Central Asia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Guinea, Benin, Kenya, Tanzania, Jamaica and Argentina. The method derived its name from Dutch pioneers in the 17th Golden Century who were discussing foreign business deals while <b>sipping</b> <b>coffee</b> and smoking a cigar. When they needed to make quick business calculations, they often used the bottom side of the cigar box to convince investors about the profitability of their business ideas in a quick, concise and convincing manner..|$|E
50|$|Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung was so keen {{on taking}} the fort {{in a sudden}} assault, he sent his father {{in charge of the}} {{storming}} party.
