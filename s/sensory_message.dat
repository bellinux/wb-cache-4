The vomeronasal organ, the olfactory system, the trigeminal system and the gustatory system will be reviewed in succession. For each of these systems, we will provide a description of the anatomy of the pathways sending the <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> from the peripheral receptor to the cortical areas, passing through different relays in the nervous system. Particular emphasis will be paid to the anatomical features of the structures involved in chemosensory perception. This will help us to understand better how these systems interact and influence our social lives, our memories and our behaviour, and to evaluate patients with chemosensory dysfunction better...|$|E

The functional utility of these multiple systems are only partially understood, but it appears that (a) they may act individually to alter different aspects of the nociceptive <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> (b) they could be used synergistically to reduce the incidence of side effects by reducing the dose of agents required to yield analgesic effects, and (c) they may function variably in animals made tolerant to classes of receptor agonists.

40|$|International audienceThe monosynaptic stretch reflex is a {{fundamental}} feature of sensory-motor organization in most animal groups. In isolation, it serves largely as a negative feedback devoted to postural controls; however, when it is involved in diverse movements, it can be modified by central command circuits. In {{order to understand the}} implications of such modifications, a model system has been chosen that has been studied at many different levels: the crayfish walking system. Recent studies have revealed several levels of control and modulation (for example, at the levels of the sensory afferent and the output synapse from the sensory afferent, and via changes in the membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron) that operate complex and highly adaptive sensory-motor processing. During a given motor task, such mechanisms reshape the <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> completely, such that the stretch reflex becomes a part of the central motor command...|$|E

This emphasis on the verbal correlates of pain restricts our understanding of pain to the context of adult human consciousness. In this paper we instead support the idea that our understanding of pain originates in neonatal experience and is not merely a verbally determined phenomenon. We also challenge the definition of pain as a merely <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> related to peripheral tissue trauma. We aim to move beyond this definition by considering the relationship between the centre (Central Nervous System) and periphery, taking into account certain phenomena such as phantom limbs and interoception. We show that pain helps an individual to develop a sense of awareness of himself immersed in a social context, and is thus a complex and adaptive phenomenon, that supports bodily integrity and social behavior...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{is often}} {{thought to be}} {{something}} brought from outside to act upon the visual messages received from the eye in a 'top-down' fashion, {{but this is a}} misleadingly narrow view. First, the visual system is a multilevel heterarchy with connections acting in all directions so it has no 'top'; and second, knowledge is provided through innately determined structure and by analysis of the redundancy in sensory messages themselves, as well as from outside. This paper gives evidence about mechanisms analysing sensory redundancy in biological vision. Automatic gain controls for luminance and contrast depend upon feedback from the input, and there are strong indications that the autocorrelation function, and other associations between input variables, affect the contrast sensitivity function and our subjective experience of the world. The associative structure of <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> can provide much knowledge about the world we live in, and neural mechanisms that discount established associative structure in the input messages by recoding them can improve survival by making new structure more easily detectable. These mechanisms may be responsible for illusions, such as those produced by a concave face-mask, that are classically attributed to top-down influences...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{responses}} to sensory stimuli {{are not only}} driven by feedforward sensory pathways but also depend upon intrinsic factors (collectively known as the network state) that include ongoing spontaneous activity and neuromodulation. To understand how these factors together regulate cortical dynamics, we recorded simultaneously spontaneous and somatosensory-evoked multiunit activity from primary somatosensory cortex and from the locus coeruleus (LC) (the neuromodulatory nucleus releasing norepinephrine) in urethane-anesthetized rats. We found that bursts of ipsilateral-LC firing preceded by few tens of milliseconds increases of cortical excitability, and that the 1 - to 10 -Hz rhythmicity of LC discharge appeared to increase the power of delta-band (1 – 4 Hz) cortical synchronization. To investigate quantitatively how LC firing might causally influence spontaneous and stimulus-driven cortical dynamics, we then constructed and fitted to these data a model describing the dynamical interaction of stimulus drive, ongoing synchronized cortical activity, and noradrenergic neuromodulation. The model proposes a coupling between LC and cortex that can amplify delta-range cortical fluctuations, and shows how suitably timed phasic LC bursts can lead to enhanced cortical {{responses to}} weaker stimuli and increased temporal precision of cortical stimulus-evoked responses. Thus, the temporal structure of noradrenergic modulation may selectively and dynamically enhance or attenuate cortical responses to stimuli. Finally, using the model prediction of single-trial cortical stimulus-evoked responses to discount single-trial state-dependent variability increased by ∼ 70 the sensory information extracted from cortical responses. This suggests that downstream circuits may extract information more effectively after estimating {{the state of the}} circuit transmitting the <b>sensory</b> <b>message...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper emphasises the {{complementary}} {{of social interaction}} and multimodality and how they facilitate each other. In a conceptual model of the intermodal social interaction, agents are seen as dynamical systems which exchange energy via different channels. To make the interaction be the attractor of this two agents system, each agent must be both interamodal-synchrony and contingency dependent. A second model, of the social agent, aims {{to account for the}} previous conceptual model and to allow easy implementation on robotic systems. Dynamic Fields enable to benefit from both intermodal-synchrony and contingency. Two experiments with 6 –month-old infants and mother test these two models. Results show that infants prefer a bimodal interaction to a unimodal one, but that they prefer a unimodal interaction rather than receiving two disconnected social sensory signals, one interactive and the other not. These results meet the prediction of our models and this shows that interaction is a main way to attribute coherence to <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> and that coherent <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> are a main way to convey social interaction messages...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} advertising {{images of}} fashion brands in {{vertical social network}} site (SNS) from the viewpoints of message strategies. Vertical social network sites are types of social curation systems applied to social networking, where information is selected, organized, and maintained. Fashion brands communicate with consumers by presenting images on vertical SNSs, anticipating improvements in brand image, popularity, and loyalty. Those images portray content for particular brands and seasonal concepts, thus creating paths for product sales information. Marketing via SNSs corresponds to relationship marketing, which refers to long-term interrelationship and value augmentation between the company and consumer, and viral advertising, which relies on word of mouth distribution via social network platforms. Taylor’s six-segment message strategy wheel, often used for analyzing viral ads, was applied to conduct a content analysis of the images. A total of 2, 656 images of fashion brands advertised on Instagram were selected and analyzed. Results indicated that brand values were somewhat related {{to the number of}} followers. Follower rankings and comment rankings were also correlated. In general, fashion brands projected <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> most often. Acute need and rational messages were less common than other messages. Sports brands and luxury brands presented <b>sensory</b> <b>messages,</b> whereas fast fashion brands projected routine images most often.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore the lasting effects of a tactile {{sensitivity}} enhancement induced by spike insoles on the control of stance in the elderly. Healthy elderly subjects (n = 19, mean age = 68. 8) and young adults (n = 17, mean age = 24. 3) were instructed to stand or to walk for 5 minutes with sandals equipped with spike insoles. Postural control was evaluated four times during unperturbed stance: (1) before putting on the sandals equipped with spike insoles, (2) 5 minutes after standing or walking with them, (3) immediately after placing thin, smooth, and flexible insoles (no spike insoles) into the sandals to avoid the cutaneous contact with the spikes, and (4) after a sitting rest of 5 minutes with the no spike insoles. Sway parameters such as surface area, mean speed and root mean square were recorded. The present results suggest that (1) whatever the session (i. e. standing or walking) and the population, the artificial <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> elicited by the spikes improved postural sway and, (2) the elderly were particularly perturbed when the tactile sensitivity enhancement device was removed. Whatever the age, the enriched sensory context provided by this tactile sensitivity enhancement device led to a better postural control; its suppression entailed a reweighting of the plantar cutaneous information. The difficulty that the elderly had to adjust the relative contribution of the different inputs probably reflected their poorer central integrative mechanisms for the reconfiguration of the postural set. A reduced peripheral sensitivity may also explain these postural deficits...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecordings {{from the}} central {{branches}} of single identified dactyl sensory afferent (DSA) neurons in a crayfish in vitro preparation were performed to study modifications of the <b>sensory</b> <b>message</b> occurring before the first central synapse. These afferents comprised hairs and force-sensitive mechanoreceptors with phasic and phasotonic response characteristics in the terminal segment (dactyl) of the crayfish leg. More than one afferent spike size was often observed in intracellular recordings from these afferents, thus indicating the presence of electrical coupling between the central processes of DSA fibers. Additionally, in identified DSA fibers with large spike sizes, primary afferent depolarizations (PADs) of up to 15 mV were observed, which sometimes triggered antidromic spikes in the afferent. Nevertheless, PADs were clearly inhibitory, because they shunted the afferent spikes. They exhibited the following properties. First, each PAD was preceded by an afferent spike from a neighboring hair, indicating that the PADs had a sensory rather than central origin. Second, PADs could follow high frequencies of afferent discharges without failure, a property suggestive of monosynaptic connections, but because PAD latencies varied by +/- 0. 5 ms {{it is more likely}} that they were mediated by a disynaptic pathway. Third, although PADs were evoked in an extremely reliable manner, their amplitude varied in a quantal manner. Most unitary PADs were the result of the release of < 12 quanta, the mean quantal content lying between 4 and 5; quantal size was large, approximately 1 mV. Fourth, PADs showed facilitation in some fibers, whereas in others they became much smaller when occurring at brief intervals. We suggest that PADs may be an efficient and parsimonious way to limit sensory inflow in space and time, allowing the crayfish to identify precisely both weak and strong mechanical stimuli...|$|E

Glutamate acts through both fast ionotropic receptors, which appear to carry the main <b>sensory</b> <b>message,</b> and slower, modulatory metabotropic receptors (mGluRs). In this study, we asked whether mGluR 5 relates in distinct ways to the K, M, and P LGN axons in V 1. To answer this question, we used light microscopic immunocytochemistry and preembedding electron microscopic immunogold labeling to determine the localization of mGluR 5 within the layers of V 1 {{in relation to the}} K, M, and P pathways in macaque and squirrel monkeys. These pathways were labeled separately via wheat germ agglutinin–horseradish peroxidase (WGA–HRP) injections targeting the LGN layers. mGluR 5 is of interest because it: 1) {{has been shown to be}} expressed in the thalamic input layers; 2) appears to be responsible for some types of oscillatory firing, which could be important in the binding of visual features; and 3) has been associated with a number of sensory-motor gating-related pathologies, including schizophrenia and autism. Our results demonstrated the presence of mGluR 5 in the neuropil of all V 1 layers. This protein was lowest in IVCa (M input) and the infragranular layers. In layer IVC, mGluR 5 also was found postsynaptic to about 30 % of labeled axons, but the distribution was uneven, such that postsynaptic mGluR 5 label tended to occur opposite smaller (presumed P), and not larger (presumed M) axon terminals. Only in the K pathway in layer IIIB, however, was mGluR 5 always found in the axon terminals themselves. The presence of mGluR 5 in K axons and not in M and P axons, and the presence of mGluR 5 postsynaptic mainly to smaller P and not larger M axons suggest that the response to the release of glutamate is modulated in distinct ways within and between the parallel visual pathways of primates.

40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates visual {{narrative}} {{contents and}} expression {{of commercial and}} editorial food photographs, and explores the process of visual perception and sensory imagery creation among consumers. Originality: Despite the proliferation of food pictures in commercials and food media, little has been known about how consumers respond to different food pictures. We also know little about how the narrative power of food photographs affects their anticipated pleasure, desire to eat, and behavioural motivations. Key literature/theoretical perspective: This paper introduces the Immersed-Inferred-Induced (3 Is) Model. We suggest that when consumers are exposed to food photographs they feel immersed in the visual narrative world. This leads to the stage when the multi-sensory experiences are inferred. These two mechanisms mediate to what extent consumers are induced. Our framework is grounded in theories of narrative (Barbatsis, 2005; Green and Brock, 2000, 2002) and mental imagery (Kosslyn, 1996). Design/methodology/approach: We interview 30 emerging and internationally renowned food stylists and photographers including those from the U. S. A., the U. K., and Australia. This interview investigates visual narrative contents and expression encoded by these professionals. After that, we interview 30 Australian consumers to examine their process of decoding <b>sensory</b> <b>messages.</b> Findings: Our study uncovers similarities and differences in <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> encoding and decoding between the creative professionals and consumers. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides insights into: the narration from the professionals to consumers, and the narration within the mind of consumers. Practical and social implications: This paper discusses practical guides on possible ways to maximise appetite appeal in food photographs, and implications for future research in sensory marketing. 2 page(s...|$|R

Can we now judge whether there is anything in this idea, and can we see where it should direct our thinking? This paper argues that the original hypothesis was wrong in over-emphasizing the role of compressive coding and economy in neuron numbers, but right in drawing attention to the importance of redundancy. Furthermore there is a clear direction in which it now points, namely to the overwhelming importance of probabilities and statistics in neuroscience. The brain has to decide upon actions in a competitive, chance-driven world, and to do this well it must know about and exploit the non-random probabilities and interdependences of objects and events signalled by <b>sensory</b> <b>messages.</b> These are particularly relevant for Bayesian calculations of the optimum course of action.

40|$|Following {{numerous}} recent {{reviews of}} the cutaneous senses, the present effort may appropriately emphasize a particular aspect of sensory function. The underlying concept will be that all <b>sensory</b> <b>messages,</b> on their passage through nerves from the periphery to the center, must consist of patterns of non-specific nerve impulses. The consequent problem is then to correlate {{the pattern of the}} impulses with the sensation induced, considering the nerve impulses as the coin in terms of which we may evaluate sensation on the one hand, and stimulation on the other. These patterns can vary only in limited respects to account for varia-tions in sensation. First, different fibers, for instance large and small, may carry impulses of differ-ent energy value, i. e., of different denominations as coins. The significance of this is little understood. Second, any one fiber may fire at different frequencies, and for different durations, resulting in an accumulation or increase of sensory value in terms of temporal summation. Third, fibers ending at different points of the skin or even at the same point may be activated together, at the same or a...|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} glimpses {{the face of}} a famous actor, sniffs a {{favorite}} food or hears the voice of a friend, recognition is instant. Within {{a fraction of a second}} after the eyes, nose, ears, tongue or skin is stimulated, one knows the object is familiar and whether it is desirable or dangerous. How does such recognition, which psychologists call preattentive perception, happen so accurately and quickly, even when the stimuli are complex and the context in which they arise varies? Much is known about the way the cerebral cortex, the outer rind of the brain, initially analyzes <b>sensory</b> <b>messages.</b> Yet investigations are only now beginning to suggest how the brain moves beyond the mere extraction of features-how it combines <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> with past experience and with expectation to identify both the stimulus and its particular meaning to the individual. My own group's studies, carried out over more than 30 years at the University of California at Berkeley, suggest that perception cannot be understood solely by examining properties of individual neurons, a microscopic approach that currently dominates neuroscience research. We have found that perception depends on the simultaneous, cooperative activity of millions of neurons spread throughout expanses of the cortex. Such global activity can be identified, measured and explained only if one adopts a macroscopic view alongside the microscopic one. There is an analogy to this approach in music. To grasp the beauty in a choral piece, it is not enough to listen to the individual singers sequentially. One must hear the performers together, as they modulate their voices and timing in response to one another. Our studies have led us as well to the discovery in the brain of chaos- complex behavior that seems random but actually has some hidden order. The chaos is evident in the tendency of vast collections of neurons to shift abruptly and simultaneously from one complex activity pattern to another in response to the smallest of inputs. This changeability is a prime characteristic of many chaotic systems. It is not harmful in the brain. In fact, we propose it is the very property that makes perception possible. We also speculate that chaos underlies the ability of the brain to respond flexibly to the outside world and to generate novel activity patterns, including those that are experienced as fresh ideas. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{evidence}} suggests that oxytocin (OT), secreted in the superficial spinal cord dorsal horn by descending axons of paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) neurons, produces antinociception and analgesia. The spinal mechanism of OT is, however, still unclear and requires further investigation. We have used patch clamp recording of lamina II neurons in spinal cord slices and immunocytochemistry {{in order to identify}} PVN-activated neurons in the superficial layers of the spinal cord and attempted to determine how this neuronal population may lead to OT-mediated antinociception. Results We show that OT released during PVN stimulation specifically activates a subpopulation of lamina II glutamatergic interneurons which are localized in the most superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (lamina I-II). This OT-specific stimulation of glutamatergic neurons allows the recruitment of all GABAergic interneurons in lamina II which produces a generalized elevation of local inhibition, a phenomenon which might explain the reduction of incoming Aδ and C primary afferent-mediated <b>sensory</b> <b>messages.</b> Conclusion Our results obtained in lamina II of the spinal cord provide the first clear evidence of a specific local neuronal network that is activated by OT release to induce antinociception. This OT-specific pathway might represent a novel and interesting therapeutic target for the management of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. </p...|$|R
40|$|Deafness affects {{approximately}} 40 {{million people}} in the United States. However, little is known about how the brain reorganizes itself in response to this major loss of inputs. Preliminary studies of neonatally deafened cats reveals that the auditory cortical area, the auditory field of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (FAES), is reorganized as a visual area and is involved in the control of visual orientation behaviors. The plastic changes in neuronal connectivity that underlie this cortical reorganization are not known, but it is our hypothesis that sensory driving via thalamocortical inputs must change from auditory to visual thalamic origins. The present study used neuroanatomical tracing techniques in two hearing adult cats and two adult cats deafened at birth to determine the thalamic origin of projections to the FAES. When tracer was injected into the FAES of hearing animals, MGm, MGv, Pom, and dorsal thalamic nuclei showed retrogradely labeled cell bodies indicative of their projection to the FAES. When tracer was injected into the FAES of the neonatally deafened animals, MGm, MGv, Sgl, Pom, and dorsal thalamic nuclei also showed retrogradely labeled cells. In the deafened animals, no retrogradely labeled neurons were identified in the primary visual thalamic areas. Because essentially the same thalamic regions project to the FAES but relay different <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> in hearing and deafened animals, it must be concluded that neuronal plasticity occurred prior to the thalamocorticals projection. Therefore, therapeutic efforts to ameliorate the effects of deafness might best address thalamic rather than cortical mechanisms of plasticity and neuronal reorganization...|$|R
40|$|Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is, as {{proposed}} by Vidal in 1973, a multitechnology discipline able to use signals generated by the brain to dialogue with intelligent devices {{in order to support}} the person in controlling external apparatus as e. g. : prosthetic devices. Also, it could permit to have a better knowledge of neurophysiological phenomena that govern the production and the control of observable neuroelectric events. A non invasive way to capture brain signals is to measure the electric voltage between one electrode placed on the scalp and a reference point, by the so called Electroencephalogram (EEG). The signals we are revealing are sustained by fluctuation of either electrical potential or current generated by neurons. Looking at EEG we note that when the person is in a relaxed state there is an almost periodic signal due to the spontaneous brain activities. If the person is subject to <b>sensory</b> <b>messages,</b> such as sounds, light, etc., this periodic signal almost disappear and is substituted by a short waveforms that are evoked from the <b>sensory</b> <b>messages.</b> In order to detect these signals, which have a duration of 0, 5 - 2 seconds, we need to know other information like: the area of brain where they have been generated; the standard parametered signal shapes, if any, the typical signal bandwidth, etc. Many papers treated in the past these topics but they do not reach a fully complete result. For example many papers try to get the position inside the brain of the point where the evoked potential has been generated. In order to solve the, so called, inverse problem, first the electric field on the skull, generated by either a dipole or a current source in a known position within the brain, has been computed. In doing this computation the brain has been considered as a homogeneous material with known and linear electric characteristics. In the analysis two discontinuities made by two layers of homogeneous materials have been considered. The first one represents the cerebral cortex, which appears as a good conductor compared to the brain and, the second is the skull which appears as a good insulator compared to the brain. The result is that the electric field measured on the scalp is deterministically related to the position and the intensity of the source. To solve the inverse problem the knowledge of the electric field all over the scalp is required. Also, we remark that to the received signals generated by the brain overlap noise and interference. To solve the inverse problem is a challenging engineering task, but, is this the problem we want to solve? Specific points of the brain devoted to perform specific tasks depend on several factors; most of them are still unknown. What is known is that a given task is done in a volume of the brain, while the specific point where it is done depends on the organization of the brain of the person considered. Then, in many cases we are interested to the know area where the signal originated not to the specific point. In the following we limit our analysis to EEG signals and, moving from the study done we introduce new ideas in order to apply to EEG the results of MIMO and radar technologies for a further improvement in the analysis of EEG signals...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{physiology}} of the corpus callosum, the greatest cerebral commissure, has made striking progress in recent years. Electrobiological, neurosurgical, and psychophysiological studies have demonstrated its functioning as an apparatus of immediate transmission of elementary <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> and of interhemispheric transfer of organized unilateral learnings. The symptoms which, in animal and in man, follow its complete section are now well known. These symptoms {{can be described as}} the manifestations of a disruption of mental unity, contrasting with the maintenance of a surprisingly good behavioural cohesion, and characterized, in conflicting situations, by the shifting dominance of one or the other hemisphere. Furthermore, the dependence of the bilateral synchrony of cortical electrical activity on the callosum has been confirmed by the long-term study of split-brain cats. In a discussion of the fundamental biological significance of the great cerebral commissure, the author stresses the theoretical importance of the recently demonstrated continuous interhemispheric exchange of callosal impulses, which reflects faithfully the fluctuations of the attention level of the waking brain and disappears completely in deep sleep and in barbiturate narcosis. The experimental data underline the essentially dynamogenic character of this tonic activity, but a more refined analysis may reveal its inhibitory components as well. By analogy with the rostral (rhinencephalic) portion of the anterior commissure which connects the two olfactory bulbs, it is suggested that the original function of corpus callosum may have been the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between the two neo-cortices. Its operation as a mechanism of interhemispheric communication and of duplication of memory traces would have been super-imposed on this primitive activity {{in the course of the}} phylogenetic evolution of the brain, culminating in the dominance of the right hemisphere in man. © 1966 Birkhäuser-Verlag.

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the medium, the study of film has predominantly been a study of communication (Stifano, 2009). With the many symbolic and <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> associated with the cinema, a plethora of questions arise concerning how creators (directors, actors, and editors) interact with audiences, and how these interactions specifically impact reception of films and other educational and behavioral outcomes arising from the medium. With scant prior empirical measures for studying the sender-receiver relationship in film communication, the developmental-interactionist theory (Buck, 1984; Buck 2 ̆ 6 VanLear, 2002; Stifano, 2009) posits two simultaneous dimensions that shape viewer attitudes: Comprehension (symbolic understanding arising from reason) and Empathy (emotional communication arising from biologically-shared signal systems. Where prior research has evidenced a central role of emotional communication in shaping attitudes (e. g. Stifano, 2009; Stifano, 2010 c), the present dissertation puts forth four quantitative studies examining how such emotional communication interacts with rational thought in cinema. In conducting this research, a complete full-length narrative independent feature film (Belief) was conceptualized, produced, and screened as a measure for examining the entire communication process. Results suggest: That emotional communication among content creators improves creative experiences; that creators utilizing more affective processing tend to better appraise their work; that across an entire film, both symbolic and emotional communication with creators helps to improve evaluations of the film; that audiences utilize emotional communication as a basis for identification with anti-hero characters, and for judging their transgressions less harshly; and that audience attention patterns can largely replicate the traditional three-act dramatic structure, complete with attention firmly rooted in seminal moments within the narrative. These results are discussed in detail as a potential window towards a better analysis of film as a medium of interaction, and moreover, a new approach towards media effects research that investigates traditional outcome variables through the lens of a true (though mediated) sender-receiver interaction. ...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to orthodromic spikes {{that are}} {{generated}} in sensory organs and conveyed to CNS, antidromic spikes are {{generated in the}} axon terminals of the sensory neurons within the CNS and are conveyed to the peripheral sensory organ. Antidromic discharges are observed in primary afferent neurons of both vertebrates and invertebrates and seem {{to be related to}} the rhythmic activity of central neural networks. In this study, we analyzed the effect of antidromic discharges on the sensory activity of a leg proprioceptor in in vitro preparations of the crayfish CNS. Intracellular microelectrodes were used both to record the orthodromic spikes and to elicit antidromic spikes by injecting squares pulses of depolarizing current at various frequencies. Experiments were performed on the three types of identified sensory afferents (tonic, phasotonic, and phasic). The main results showed a reduction of the firing frequency of the orthodromic activity in 82 % of the tested afferents. In tonic afferents, during their occurrences and according to their frequency, antidromic spikes or bursts reduced or suppressed the orthodromic activity. Following their terminations, they also induced a silent period and a gradual recovery of the orthodromic activity, both of which increased as the duration and the frequency of the antidromic bursts increased. In phasotonic and phasic afferents, antidromic bursts reduced or suppressed the phasic responses as their frequency and durations increased. In phasotonic afferents, if elicited prior to the movements, long-duration bursts with increasing frequency reduced more rapidly the tonic background activity than the phasic one whereas short-duration bursts at high frequency produced strong decreases of both. The effect of antidromic bursts accumulated when they are repetitively elicited. Antidromic bursts induced a much larger decrease of the sensory activity than adaptation alone. The occurrences of antidromic spikes or bursts may have a functional role in modulating the incoming <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> during locomotion. The mechanisms by which antidromic spikes modulate the firing sensitivity of the primary afferents may well lie in modifications of the properties of either mecanotransduction and/or spike initiation...|$|R
40|$|Constructing {{ideas for}} writing is an {{important}} stage in the writing process. If students cannot brainstorm ideas for writing, they cannot start writing. Moreover, writing a composition with rich content demands greatly on students’ ability of making deep observation and experiencing life. How to enhance students’ ability to brainstorm ideas for writing has raised concerns in teaching writing. Previous research indicated that taking in information through all senses is helpful in arousing one’s deep feelings and generating more ideas for writing. Therefore, this study focused on using a multisensory approach in writing to enhance students’ ability in constructing ideas for writing. The researcher guided students to use multiple sensory modalities (sense of sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste) to observe and experience daily life {{in the hope that}} they can describe things and express emotions in writing. This was an action research which aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a multisensory approach in enhancing students’ ability in constructing ideas for writing. A total of nine Form one students from a local band two school participating in the research. This study adopted quantitative methods, including marking pre-test and protest writings and questionnaires, and qualitative methods, including the evaluation of pre-test and pro-test writings and interviews. First, conducted a questionnaire to find out writing difficulties of students. Then, examined the effectiveness of using a multisensory approach in writing by comparing students’ writing performance in the pre-test and pro-test. Finally, conducted a questionnaire and interviews to collect students comments towards using a multi-sensory approach in writing. The results showed that a multi-sensory approach could effectively enhance students’ ability in constructing ideas for writing and descriptive ability. Using a multi-sensory approach in writing helped students take in <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> and hence generate ideas for writing. There were improvements of students’ writing performance in pro-test. Students could write more and also describe something at multiple aspects. Findings of questionnaire and interviews indicated a multi-sensory approach could enhance students’ observation awareness and boost their interests and confidence in writing. 寫前構思是寫作思維過程中重要的階段，學生能否動筆寫作，繼續整個寫作思維過程，取決於他們能否根據題目提取寫作素材，產生寫作意念。而且，要寫作一篇意念完整﹑內容豐富具體的文章，學生更需具備仔細觀察及體會生活的能力。故如何提升學生寫作構思的能力，是寫作教學關注的問題。而根據學者的研究，透過不同感官的資訊輸入，能幫助學生積累個人對不同事物的觀感，產生更多的寫作意念，解決題材記取的困難，使寫作內容更豐富充實。因此，本研究將教授學生運用五感觀察法寫作，引導學生運用五感(視覺﹑聽覺﹑嗅覺﹑觸覺﹑味覺) 去體驗周遭的生活事物，把輸入的感官資訊及個人體會作為寫作的素材，細緻﹑具體地描述出來。 本研究為行動研究，旨在探討利用五感觀察教學法提升學生的寫作構思能力的成效。研究共有九位來自第二組別中文中學的中一級學生參與，並以寫作前測﹑後測﹑問卷調查和個人訪談四個方式收集資料，作量化及質性分析。首先以寫作困難問卷調查了解學生的寫作困難，然後以量表評改的方法對寫作前測與後測進行量化及質性的分析，量度出學生寫作表現的變化。最後以學習成效問卷及個人訪談收集學生對五感觀察法提升寫作構思能力﹑描述能力﹑觀察意識﹑寫作興趣與信心的看法，全面探討運用五感觀察教學法寫作的成效。 研究結果顯示，運用五感觀察教學法寫作能提升學生的寫作構思能力及描述能力。學生透過運用五感觀察法，能從不同感官輸入豐富的寫作素材。前﹑彼測的量化及質性分析顯示，學生寫作的篇幅增加了，並能運用感官描寫手法從多角度描寫人﹑事﹑物。另外，問卷及訪談結果顯示，運用五感觀察法寫作亦能提升學生觀察日常事物的意識及寫作的興趣與信心。published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor of Education in Language Educatio...|$|R

In current Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS) systems, warnings can only be sent when there is a direct risk of a collision, in which case it can already be too late to prevent. Sharing of infrastructure sensor information and adding destination information to the CAM can be used for preventive measures.

5000|$|Although {{there is}} not an {{overwhelming}} amount of research surrounding how the union between craniopagus twins leads to different personality, cognitive and motor traits, there have been some studies exploring what it actually means to share a brain. In the case of Tatiana and Krista as mentioned above, {{it is possible that the}} twins shared some conscious thought. Studies of the thalamus’ role in the brain provide neurological data that help explain these behavioral observations that these two twins experience. Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits are the looped neural pathways that connect the thalamus to the cerebral cortex, and then the cerebral cortex back to the thalamus. Because the thalamus is mainly responsible for relaying <b>sensory</b> <b>messages</b> from the body to the brain, it is possible that there is a lot of overlap between the twins’ sensory reception and the actual response it creates within the brain. One study examines this by studying the thalamus when it is at a persistent vegetative state that is when the patient is awake but not conscious. This study proved that the cortical activity on its own is not conscious and that all the activity between the loops of the thalamus, the cerebral cortex and the thalamus itself are all conscious actions. Another study of the thalamus reaffirms that the thalamus does not answer yes/no questions but instead acts as a mediator between different parts of the cerebral cortex and systemic sensory reception.These loops actually may account for the relationship between Tatiana and Krista. At the neuronal level, communication is dense network of neurons linked between themselves and the coordinator (in this case the thalamus) that finally sends a message to the cortex. On top of this, there are links between the cortex that send messages back through the coordinator and finally to the rest of the body. The brain’s ability to function through loops and circuits is a good model to explain why Tatiana “consciously” feels what Krista is “physically” experiencing. Additionally there is some level of synchronization between the two twins. Another study found that for craniopagus twins, their connection to each other is comparable to our normal appendages and that their bodies have obvious overlapping physically and psychologically. [...] Because most cases of craniopagus twins are unique, the research outlining general connections between craniopagus twins is limited. However, this example provides insight into the effects of a union between twins who essentially share the same sensory relay system in the thalamus.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSoon {{after they}} {{segregate}} from the neural tube, trunk neural crest cells disperse on two spatially and temporally distinct pathways. Only crest cells that migrate early and ventromedially {{give rise to}} neurons of the peripheral nervous system. It is also known that neural crest cell-derived populations require appropriate environmental cues early in development in order to generate neurons, and for the subsequent survival of differentiated neurons. We examined whether neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), a survival factor for subsets of peripheral neurons, is also involved in the regulation of neurogenesis by neural crest cells. First, we found that premigratory and migrating neural crest cells on the medial migration pathway of Embryonic Day 2. 5 (E 2. 5) embryos express mRNAs encoding multiple isoforms of the NT- 3 receptor,trkC, as do cells in the neural tube and epithelial dermamyotome. On E 4, a subpopulation of neurons in nascent <b>sensory</b> ganglia expresstrkC <b>message.</b> Second, we demonstrate thattrkC mRNA is only expressed in neural crest cell populations that possess neurogenic potential. Third, we show {{that the presence of}} NT- 3, during the initial development of cultured neural crest cells, is required for neurogenesis by a subpopulation of neurogenic neural crest-derived cells. These results suggest that a subpopulation of neurogenic neural crest cells expresses functionaltrkC receptors and requires the timely availability of NT- 3 for their development before reaching their final embryonic locations. We suggest that developmental heterogeneity exists in the identity and requirements of neural crest cell subsets that harbor neurogenic potential. We also suggest that the “paradoxical” expression oftrkC receptors by the somitic dermamyotome may, in fact, {{play a role in the}} exclusive development of crest-derived neurogenic precursors on the medial pathway by limiting the availability of NT- 3 on the lateral pathway...|$|R
