500|$|Given Kimball's {{history of}} health problems, many people, {{including}} Kimball himself, {{did not anticipate}} him living long enough {{to become president of}} the LDS Church. However, on December 23, 1973, Harold B. Lee, who was four years younger than Kimball and had long been in much better health, unexpectedly died, leaving Kimball as the most senior apostle and thus the presumptive new church president. Kimball was ordained church president on December 30, 1973, the day after Lee's funeral, choosing N. Eldon Tanner and Marion G. Romney as his first and second counselors. Boyd K. Packer recalled shortly afterward discovering Kimball sitting alone in the church president's office and quietly weeping: [...] "I am <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> man for such a big responsibility!" ...|$|E

She had never realized before that he was pitiful.... Had she perhaps feared him too much, disliked him too much to deal fairly with him? Could she have helped him? Was there anything she {{could have done that}} she had not done? Might she not at least have saved him his suspicion? Behind his rages, perhaps he had been wretched.|$|R

500|$|Adelaide Anne Procter {{was born}} at 25 Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury {{district}} of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet Bryan Waller Procter and his wife Anne (née Skepper). The family had strong literary ties: novelist Elizabeth Gaskell enjoyed her visits to the Procter household, and Procter's father was friends with poet Leigh Hunt, essayist Charles Lamb, and novelist Charles Dickens, {{as well as being}} acquainted with poet William Wordsworth and critic William Hazlitt. Family friend Bessie Rayner Belloc wrote in 1895 that [...] "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow {{in and out of the}} house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens , the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place." [...] Author and actress Fanny Kemble wrote that young Procter [...] "looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... a preter-naturally [...] thoughtful, mournful expression for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> child".|$|E

The hosts are Daniel Domenjó and Emilio Pineda, and Australia is used as location. The show was cancelled on its second week due to the lack of audience. According to Telecinco, it was unbearable to produce a weekly show from Australia with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> market share (9.0%). Natalia was then revealed to be the mole and the rest of the contestants shared the €10,000 in the group's pot.|$|E

[...] According to Dupré, she then toured and recorded with Cooper's band, networking {{with people in the}} music industry. In 2005, she formed a company named Pasche New York, an entertainment business intended to promote her music career.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Hanina deduced from [...] that {{everything}} is in the hand of Heaven except the fear of Heaven, for [...] says: [...] "What does the Lord your God ask of you, but only to fear the Lord your God." [...] The Gemara asked whether the fear of Heaven was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing that [...] says [...] "only." [...] Rabbi Hanina said in the name Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that God has in God's treasury nothing but a store {{of the fear of}} Heaven, as [...] says: [...] "The fear of the Lord is His treasure," [...] and thus the fear of Heaven must be a great thing. The Gemara responded that for Moses, the fear of Heaven was a small thing, for he had it. Rabbi Hanina illustrated with a parable: If a man is asked for a big article and he has it, it seems like a small article to him; if he is asked for a small article and he does not have it, it seems like a big article to him.|$|E
