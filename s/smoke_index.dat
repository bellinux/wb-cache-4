40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{study the}} {{exposure}} of Parisian taxi drivers to automobile air pollutants during their professional activity.  METHODS—A cross sectional study was carried out from 27  January to 27  March 1997, with measurements performed in the vehicles of 29  randomly selected drivers. Carbon monoxide (CO) content was measured over an 8  hour period by a CO portable monitor. The fine suspended particles were measured according to the black <b>smoke</b> <b>index</b> (BS), with a flow controlled portable pump provided with a cellulose filter. The nitrogen oxides, NO and NO 2 were measured with a passive sampler.  RESULTS—These drivers are exposed during their professional activity to relatively high concentrations of pollutants (mean, median (SD) 3. 8,  2  (1. 7) ppm for CO, 168,  164  (53) µg/m 3 for BS, 625,  598  (224) µg/m 3 for NO, and 139,  131  (43) µg/m 3 for NO 2.) For CO the concentrations were clearly lower than the threshold values recommended by the World Health Organisation. The situation is less satisfactory for the other pollutants, especially for the BS index. All concentrations of pollutants recorded were noticeably higher than concentrations in air recorded by the ambient Parisian air monitoring network and were close to, or slightly exceeded, the concentrations measured at the fixed stations close to automobile traffic. Pollutant concentrations were also influenced greatly by weather conditions.  CONCLUSION—This first French study conducted in taxi drivers shows that they are highly exposed to automobile pollutants.

40|$|Background: The {{determination}} of the smoking status {{should be part of}} the initial as-sessment, as preventive measures might reduce longterm morbidity. Next to self report (not always possible or reliable) the use of biomarkers such as carbon monoxide (CO) has been recommended. Point-of-care (POC) CO-Hb determination is routinely used in trauma settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and the best Cut-off of CO-Hb in order to determine the smoking status in subcritical injured patients in the emergency department (ED). Methods: After informed consent and ethical committee approval 1283 subcritically injured patients were assessed in the ED immediately after admission with a computer based questionnaire including the Heaviness To <b>Smoke</b> <b>Index</b> Questionnaire. Venous blood sampling and POC-Oximetry including CO-Hb was performed. For statistical analysis we used Youden-Index and the Receiver Operated Characteristics (ROC). Results: The median age of all patients (smokers: males: 399, females: 176; non-smokers: males: 420, females: 288) was 33 years. According to the receiver operating characteristics CO-Hb had an excellent ability to differ between smokers and non-smokers: AUC males: 0. 949, females 0. 932.

40|$|Estimates of fire {{emissions}} remain uncertain due {{to limited}} {{constraints on the}} variations in fire characteristics. Here we demonstrate the utility of space-based observations of smoke constituents in addressing this limitation. We introduce a satellite-derived <b>smoke</b> <b>index</b> (SI) {{as an indicator of}} the dominant phase of large-scale fires. This index is calculated as the ratio of the geometric mean of observed fractional enhancements (due to fire) in carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth to that of nitrogen dioxide. We assess the usefulness of this index on fires in the Amazon. We analyze the seasonal, regional, and interannual joint distribution of SI and fire radiative power (FRP) in relation to fire hotspots, land cover, Drought Severity Index, and deforestation rate estimates. We also compare this index with an analogous quantity derived from field data or emission inventories. Our results show that SI changes from low (more flaming) to high (more smoldering) {{during the course of a}} fire season, which is consistent with the changes in observed maximum FRPs from high to low. We also find that flaming combustion is more dominant in areas where deforestation fires dominate, while smoldering combustion has a larger influence during drought years when understory fires are more likely enhanced. Lastly, we find that the spatiotemporal variation in SI is inconsistent with current emission inventories. Although we recognize some limitations of this approach, our results point to the utility of SI as a proxy for overall combustion efficiency in the parameterization of fire emission models...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Apoptosis plays {{a central}} role in the {{pathogenesis}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and this process can be regulated by mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA). Epigenetics is involved in the regulation and modification of the genes involved in lung cancer and COPD. In this study, we determined the expression of mtTFA and its methylation levels in the COPD patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Twenty-one squamous cell lung cancer patients, 11 with COPD and 10 without COPD, undergoing pneumonectomy were enrolled. The apoptotic index (AI) of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells was analyzed by transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling assay. The expression of mtTFA mRNA and protein was measured using PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western-blot. Methylation of the mtTFA promoter was detected using bisulfite sequencing PCR. RESULTS: Compared to the non-COPD group, the AI was higher, and expression of mtTFA mRNA and protein was lower in the COPD group (P< 0. 001). Expression of the mtTFA protein was positively correlated with FEV 1 /Pre (r = 0. 892, P< 0. 001), and negatively correlated with AI (r = - 0. 749, P< 0. 001) and <b>smoke</b> <b>index</b> (r = - 0. 763, P< 0. 001). Percentage of mtTFA promoter methylation in the COPD patients was significantly higher compared to the non-COPD patients (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the expression of mtTFA mRNA and protein is down-regulated in the lung tissue from the COPD patients with squamous cell lung cancer, and the level of mtTFA protein is related to apoptosis of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. Aberrant mtTFA methylation may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD...|$|E

Different experiments have been conducted in an empty dwelling situated in a polluted area in Paris during winter and summer periods. The measured pollutants were indoor and outdoor CO, SO 2, NO, NO 2, O 3, VOC, PM 2. 5 particles and black <b>smoke</b> <b>index.</b> Additional measurements have been performed as meteorological conditions (wind speed and direction, external and internal temperature and humidity). The pollutants sampling time steps were comprised between two minutes and one hour depending on pollutant. The transfer of the pollutants has been tested as regards different ventilation strategies.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate whether deprivation index modifies the acute effect of black smoke on cardiorespiratory mortality. Generalised linear Poisson regression models were used to investigate whether deprivation index (as measured by the Carstairs deprivation index) modified the acute effect of black smoke on mortality in two largest Scottish cities (Glasgow and Edinburgh) between January 1981 and December 2001. Lag periods of up to 1 month were assumed {{for the effects of}} black <b>smoke.</b> Deprivation <b>index</b> significantly modified the effect of black smoke on mortality, with black smoke effects generally increasing as level of deprivation increased. The interaction coefficient from a parametric model assuming a linear interaction between black smoke (μg/m− 3) and deprivation in their effect on mortality—equivalent to a test of ‘linear trend’ across Carstairs categories—was significant for all mortality outcomes. In a model where black smoke effects were estimated independently for each deprivation category, the estimated increase in respiratory mortality over the ensuing 1 -month period associated with a 10 μg/m 3 increase in the mean black smoke concentration was 8. 0 % (95 % CI 5. 1 to 10. 9) for subjects residing in the ‘most’ deprived category (Carstairs category 7) compared to 3. 7 % (95 % CI − 0. 7 to 8. 4) for subjects residing in the ‘least’ deprived category (Carstairs category 1).

Pts were screened for PAOD a/o other atherothrombotic episodes and evaluated for: traditional cardiovascular risk factors (TCRF) (Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, Blood Pressure, Body Mass <b>Index,</b> <b>Smoke,</b> Familiarity); sCD 40 L, Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP); oxidized LDL (oxLDL) level; IL 6, IL 10 and TNFα pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines network; intron 4 IVS 4 - 14 A>G polymorphisms of OLR 1 (rs 3736235), encoding for the oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX 1) to evaluate the distribution of genotypes AA (cardiovascular low risk), AG and GG (cardiovascular high risk). Results: The distribution of classical risk factors showed a slight prevalence of dyslipidemia in the NIL cohort. Similarly, the presence of 3 or more TCRF was more frequent in the NIL group. In the IM cohort 3 / 58 (5...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective: The {{impact of}} ambient wood smoke and traffic-related air {{pollution}} on adult asthma {{has not been}} well studied. This paper aims to investigate associations between exposure to ambient wood smoke, traffic-related air pollution and current asthma/asthma severity in middle age, and whether any associations are modified by atopic status. Methods: Using data from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, associations between ambient wood <b>smoke</b> and two <b>indices</b> of traffic-related air pollution (frequency of heavy vehicles near the home and frequency of intense traffic noise) and current asthma/asthma severity were investigated. Unconditional logistic regression to examine current asthma and ordinal logistic regression to examine asthma severity was used. Results: For asthmatics, both exposure to ambient wood smoke (odds ratio 1. 11; 95 % confidence interval 1. 02 - 1. 20) and being frequently exposed to heavy vehicles (odds ratio 1. 80; 95 % confidence interval 1. 09 - 2. 96) were associated with increased asthma severity. Neither association varied by atopic status. Conclusions: In middle-aged adults, ambient wood smoke and traffic pollution were associated with increased asthma severity. These findings suggest that avoiding or limiting exposure to traffic pollution and wood smoke may help to reduce asthma. Future studies to replicate this finding are recommended and should examine specific biological mechanisms for this effect...|$|R
40|$|The authors used a {{population-based}} {{birth cohort}} of 3, 253 children (52 % males) born in Brisbane, Australia, between 1981 and 1984 to prospectively examine whether maternal smoking during pregnancy {{was associated with}} offspring overweight and obesity. The authors compared mean body mass indexes (weight (kg) /height (m) 2) and levels of overweight and obesity at age 14 years among offspring by patterns of maternal smoking (never smoked, smoked before and/or after pregnancy but not during pregnancy, or smoked during pregnancy). Adoles-cent body mass index and prevalences of overweight and obesity were greater in offspring whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy than in those whose mothers had never <b>smoked.</b> Body mass <b>index</b> and levels of overweight and obesity among adolescent offspring whose mothers stopped smoking during pregnancy but smoked at other times in the child’s life {{were similar to those}} among offspring whose mothers had never smoked. These results were independent of a range of potentially confounding factors and suggest a direct effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on adolescent overweight and obesity. They provide yet another incentive for pregnant women to be persuaded not to smoke and for young women to be encouraged to never take up smoking. body mass index; obesity; overweight; pregnancy; smoking Abbreviation: BMI, body mass index...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAn {{association}} between chronic marginal periodontitis and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) has been suggested. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether chronic marginal periodontitis is more prevalent in very severe COPD than in other very severe respiratory diseases, and whether periodontitis in COPD is related to risk factors for periodontitis that are often present in COPD subjects. Orthopantomograms were collected from 130 patients with COPD and 50 patients with non-COPD evaluated for lung transplantation. Chronic marginal periodontitis was defined as a general marginal bone level ⩾ 4 mm. The prevalence of periodontitis was 44 % in the COPD group vs. 7. 3 % in the non-COPD group. All oral measurements differed significantly between the groups. The difference in mean marginal bone level remained statistically significant when adjusting for age, gender and pack years smoked. In logistic regression analysis mean marginal bone level ⩾ 4 mm was identified as a factor significantly associated with severe COPD. This study demonstrates that chronic marginal periodontitis is common in patients with severe COPD. The high prevalence of periodontitis in COPD patients appears to be independent of possible risk factors for periodontitis such as age, pack years <b>smoked,</b> body mass <b>index,</b> use of corticosteroids and bone mineral density...|$|R
