The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic <b>sliding</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic <b>sliding</b> <b>bearing</b> works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic sleeve bearings can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic sleeve bearings, little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated sleeve bearings. The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} sleeve bearings. The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated sleeve bearings are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.
