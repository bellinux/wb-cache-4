When the choice proportion between the alternatives matched their respective relative reinforcement frequencies, the obtained probabilities of reinforcement (reinforcer per peck) were approximately equal.

Finally it is discussed how the project manager can monitor the depletion of allocated contingency and exercise a management control over the total project cost and over individual BOQ items.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{increase}} the unit rate utilization as a contracting strategy and to improve the efficiency of contractor expenses and performance by reducing the qualitative issues that directly affect the daily working relationship between XYZ and the contractor workforce and through the implementation of a unit rate management system at the refinery XYZ. In order to evaluate refinery XYZ's current contracting strategy, it is necessary to analyze it by examining historical data as weU as industry averages. This study also examined the potential cost benefit on current time and material spends per year. It was concluded that unit rate contracting is a better style to use at the refinery XYZ because the supplier is drawn into driving productivity to achieve or improve his profitability and in the process, the owner gains too.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} ‘component-based’ {{approach}} {{to guide the}} choice of the social discount rate in natural resources damage assessment, where time and discounting are key features. It is a multi-rate discounting scheme, which draws on concepts from dual-rate and time-declining approaches. Each damage component is discounted at a component-specific constant rate, related to its time-trajectory. Assuming a normatively defined declining <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> as a starting reference, components with longer time profiles – generally represented by welfare losses – are discounted at lower rates than short-term damage components – mainly remedial costs. The rationale behind this choice is that the longer the duration of the damage component, the higher the related non incident-specific uncertainty on the resource values and the more relevant the equity issues. When estimating the total damage, the resulting implicit average discount rate depends on the duration of each component and its relative relevance in the total damage in each moment. From an operational point of view, anchoring the rates to government prescriptions would support the robustness of the damage estimates in a court of law, whereas the dual-based environmental discount rate is based on ad-hoc assumptions that are more difficult to justify...|$|E
