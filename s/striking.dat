2500|$|A {{small number}} of bowling fans have {{recognized}} that naming each <b>strike</b> in a consistent manner adds to the enjoyment and excitement of the game. Based on this, {{a growing number of}} bowlers subscribe to the [...] "Duck, Duck, Turkey" [...] method of titling consecutive <b>strikes.</b> In keeping with the tradition that the third consecutive <b>strike</b> is called a [...] "Turkey," [...] every third <b>strike</b> references turkeys and all <b>strikes</b> under this method have been named after birds as follows: <b>Strike</b> 1 - Duck; <b>Strike</b> 2 - Duck; <b>Strike</b> 3 - Turkey; <b>Strike</b> 4 - Goose; <b>Strike</b> 5 - Chicken; <b>Strike</b> 6 - Turducken; <b>Strike</b> 7 - Penguin; <b>Strike</b> 8 - Flamingo; <b>Strike</b> 9 - Turkey Vulture; <b>Strike</b> 10 - Woodpecker; <b>Strike</b> 11 - [...] Eagle; <b>Strike</b> 12 - Turkey Hawk.|$|R
40|$|Some {{theories}} of <b>strike</b> activity {{suggest that the}} settlement probability of a <b>strike</b> depends {{on the number of}} workers involved in the <b>strike.</b> Additionally, much recent empirical research on <b>strikes</b> has been constrained by data availability to look only at <b>strikes</b> in large bargaining units. It is natural to ask, therefore, whether <b>strike</b> size systematically influences <b>strike</b> duration, and whether this question poses problems of interpretation for studies confined to samples of large <b>strikes.</b> This paper uses Canadian <b>strike</b> data to examine these questions. We find that size is an important determinant of <b>strike</b> duration and also that studies of <b>strike</b> duration based only on large <b>strikes</b> can yield results that are not representative of the influences for all <b>strikes.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Few nickels had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for <b>striking</b> into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow <b>striking</b> at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began <b>striking</b> nickels in 1912.|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the <b>striking</b> of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is {{automatic}} reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the <b>striking</b> of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
40|$|This {{examination}} of the Stock Market’s responsiveness to <b>strikes</b> looks specifically at <b>strike</b> actions that labor historians generally view as the major ones occurring in the United States in the years 1925 – 37. The authors find that <b>strikes</b> had large, negative effects on industry stock value. Longer <b>strikes,</b> violent <b>strikes,</b> <b>strikes</b> in which unions “won,” industry-wide <b>strikes,</b> <b>strikes</b> that led to union recognition, and <b>strikes</b> that led to large wage increases were associated with larger negative share price reactions than were other <b>strikes.</b> Much of the “news” generated by the typical <b>strike</b> {{seems to have been}} registered by the Stock Market very early in the <b>strike.</b> However, there were also some fairly large stock price reactions to news that could be fully revealed only {{at the end of a}} <b>strike...</b>|$|R
40|$|The “joint costs” model {{states that}} {{increasing}} union and firm <b>strike</b> costs leads to fewer <b>strikes.</b> This paper shows that <b>strike</b> incidence need not decrease when joint <b>strike</b> costs increase. The innovation {{is to raise}} union and firm joint <b>strike</b> costs in an asymmetric way. The results indicate that increasing either party’s <b>strike</b> costs can have ambiguous effects on <b>strike</b> incidence. This ambiguity explains why higher <b>strike</b> costs need not always lead to fewer <b>strikes,</b> and thus accounts for the mixed success observed in studies that empirically test the joint costs model with <b>strike</b> incidence data...|$|R

Total <b>strike</b> frequency exhibits significant procyclicality, to which within-contract <b>strikes</b> contribute appreciably.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} for the formulation of <b>strike</b> contingency plans to assist school administrators and boards of school trustees during a teacher <b>strike.</b> The study was designed to secure and evaluate <b>strike</b> contingency plan items currently being utilized by school administrators as well as ideas suggested through published literature by authorities in the field. An initial survey was conducted to collect <b>strike</b> contingency plans and to determine teacher <b>strike</b> experience of 286 Indiana school superintendents and of superintendents throughout the nation identified as having experienced a teacher <b>strike</b> during August and September of 1975. Data collected were used to determine the number of <b>strike</b> contingency plans in existence in Indiana and in school districts outside Indiana included in the survey, and the experience level of Indiana superintendents in dealing with teacher <b>strikes.</b> The tactical ideas, suggestions, and guideline statements secured from the review of the literature and analysis of <b>strike</b> contingency plan material received in response to the initial survey were developed into a form for evaluating <b>strike</b> contingency plan items. The evaluation form was divided into six sections designed to elicit responses relative to <b>strike</b> contingency planning. One hundred eighty-seven statement items relative to the board of education, superintendent, communication center, transportation, security, and building procedures were included. Superintendents were asked to indicate if the <b>strike</b> plan items should be included in a <b>strike</b> contingency plan- as well as to indicate the degree of importance of each <b>strike</b> plan item in maintaining the operational capacities of a school district during a teacher <b>strike.</b> Ten Indiana superintendents identified as having had experienced one or more teacher <b>strikes</b> and having developed a <b>strike</b> contingency plan for use should a <b>strike</b> situation develop served as evaluators. The findings of the study were developed into a set of guidelines for the development of a <b>strike</b> contingency plan. <b>Strike</b> plan items were classified as items essential to every <b>strike</b> contingency plan and as items which should be considered for inclusion in a <b>strike</b> contingency plan while the <b>strike</b> plan is being developed. The <b>strike</b> plan items provide a nucleus around which a <b>strike</b> contingency plan could be developed to adequately meet the need for advance <b>strike</b> contingency planning. Thesis (D.

5|$|The stipulations {{contained}} in the Act caused significant controversy during debates over NATO's military command structure. Both <b>Striking</b> Fleet Atlantic and the United States Sixth Fleet have never been allowed to be placed anywhere but directly under American commanding officers—the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe—because the dominant legal interpretation of the McMahon Act has been that nuclear <b>striking</b> forces cannot be controlled by non-US commanders. This {{was the reason for}} the formation of <b>Striking</b> Fleet Atlantic as an independent entity, instead of being operationally subordinated to the UK Admiral serving as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, in October–November 1952. This was also the reason why the Sixth Fleet, in its NATO guise as Naval <b>Striking</b> and Support Force, South, was placed under American control rather than Allied Forces Mediterranean when the European commands were agreed at the same time.|$|E
