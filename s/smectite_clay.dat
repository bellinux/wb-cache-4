5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface <b>smectite</b> <b>clay</b> and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{data for}} <b>smectite</b> <b>clays,</b> {{particularly}} for montmorillonite, which contain various adsorbed ions and are {{measured in the}} UV, VIS, and NIR ranges are analyzed and compared with Martian soil and dust spectra. It is shown that the structural octahedral iron in <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> affects their light absorbance in the UV at 240 - 260 nm, which results from an O(2 -) to Fe(3 +) charge transfer, similar to one observed in the Martian spectrum. Adsorbed iron affects, via crystal field absorptions, the reflectance of montmorillonite in the VIS and NIR ranges, resulting in stronger absorption and higher opacity in the range 0. 40 - 0. 65 micron. Both in spectral contrast and presence of (or lack of) spectral features, the Fe-montmorillonite spectra in the VIS and NIR are in reasonable agreement with the Martian spectrum. It is found that the spectral characteristics of iron-saturated <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> cannot be used to preclude the presence of clays in Martian soils and dust...|$|R

30|$|The highest {{temperature}} {{recorded by}} DOSECC in the corehole was 59.3  °C {{at a depth}} of 1824  m. The geothermal gradient was only 4.5  °C/km above 935  m, but increased dramatically to 72 – 75  °C/km below 980  m. Extrapolating this gradient, the projected temperature at TD would be approximately 94  °C. This is consistent with the observation that the temperature since the formation of the <b>smectite</b> <b>clays,</b> the deepest sample of which was obtained from core at 1829  m, has remained below 90  °C. The suppression of the gradient above 860  m is due to the cold, fresh water of the SRPA (e.g., Smith 2004). Furthermore, the swelling <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> clog pore spaces in the basalts, creating a natural seal for rising thermal waters below the SRPA.|$|R

50|$|It is a clay or {{soil that}} {{is prone to}} large volume changes (swelling and shrinking) that are {{directly}} related to changes in water content. Soils with a high content of expansive minerals can form deep cracks in drier seasons or years; such soils are called vertisols.

50|$|Attapulgite clays are a {{composite}} of smectite and palygorskite. Smectites are expanding lattice clays, of which bentonite is a commonly known generic name for <b>smectite</b> <b>clays.</b> The palygorskite component is an acicular bristle-like crystalline form that does not swell or expand. Attapulgite forms gel structures in fresh and salt water by establishing a lattice structure of particles connected through hydrogen bonds.|$|R
50|$|Launched in 2005 this orbiter carried {{multiple}} instruments {{which found}} the mineralogy {{to be dominated}} by mafic minerals such as olivine, mica, pyroxene and <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> such as kaolinite. The HiRISE was used in determining the landing site for the Phoenix Lander. Using the CTX (camera) and CRISM instruments it was able to find phyllosilicate minerals, carbonate minerals, and oxides. The SHARAD was used to detect carbonate dust layers.|$|R
50|$|These {{minerals}} {{indicate that}} water was present for a time. Evidence of <b>smectite</b> <b>clay</b> was found around the central uplift {{of the crater}} in a geologic unit that was probably formed {{as a consequence of}} the impact. The heat of the impact allowed liquid water to be present long enough to turn minerals into clay. Researchers at Brown University discovered impact melt deposits containing clay minerals in Ritchey Crater. Impact melt forms when rock melted during an impact cools and hardens. Clay minerals found within these deposits probably formed after the impact event.|$|E

It forms soft earthy bluish white to red-brown monoclinic crystals typically massive to micaceous in habit. It has a Mohs hardness of 1 to 2 and a specific gravity of 2.45. Optically it is biaxial positive with refractive index values of nα = 1.550 - 1.580, nβ = 1.590 - 1.620 and nγ = 1.590 - 1.620.It is found in vugs and seams in the oxidized zones of zinc and copper deposits. It occurs in association with hemimorphite, smithsonite, chrysocolla, coronadite and various iron oxides.|$|E
50|$|The ML cluster {{consists}} of volcaniclastic rocks that are interpreted as representing volcanic crater or diatreme deposits. They include euhedral to broken and pellet-shaped grains of olivine that are supported in a fine-grained groundmass, along with xenoliths derived from sedimentary rocks, crystalline Precambrian rocks, {{and a variety}} of types of volcanic rocks. In many examples both the olivine and the groundmass have been totally altered to <b>smectite</b> <b>clay,</b> and in some specimens the clay has been further altered to zeolite minerals and quartz. Although they include diamond indicator minerals such as chromite and several types of garnet (G5, G9, G11 and spessartine), the ML rocks are not considered to have a high potential for diamonds.|$|E
40|$|Evidence for the {{presence}} of <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> in Martian soils is reviewed and results of experiments with certain active clays simulating the Viking biology experiments are reported. Analyses of Martian soil composition by means of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and dust storm spectroscopy and Martian geological history strongly suggest {{the presence}} of a mixture of weathered ferro-silicate minerals, mainly nontronite and montmorillonite, accompanied by soluble sulphate salts, as major constituents. Samples of montmorillonite and nontronite incubated with (C- 14) -formate or the radioactive nutrient medium solution used in the Viking Labeled Release experiment, were found to produce patterns of release of radioactive gas very similar to those observed in the Viking experiments, indicating the iron-catalyzed decomposition of formate as the reaction responsible for the Viking results. The experimental results of Hubbard (1979) simulating the results of the Viking Pyrolytic Release experiment using iron montmorillonites are pointed out, and it is concluded that many {{of the results of the}} Viking biology experiments can be explained in terms of the surface activity of <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> in catalysis and adsorption...|$|R
40|$|Converging {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that a}} significant portion of the Martian surface fines may consist of salts and <b>smectite</b> <b>clays.</b> Salts can form stoichiometric hydrates as well as eutectic solutions with depressed freezing points; clays contain bound water of constitution and adsorb significant quantities of water from the vapor phase. The formation of ice may be suppressed by these minerals in some regions on Mars, and their presence in abundance would imply important consequences for atmospheric and geologic processes and the prospects for exobiology...|$|R
40|$|Water and {{methanol}} transport behavior, solvents adsorption and electrochemical {{properties of}} filler-free Nafion and nanocomposites {{based on two}} <b>smectite</b> <b>clays,</b> were investigated using impedance spectroscopy, DMFC tests and NMR methods, including spin-lattice relaxation and pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) diffusion under variable temperature conditions. Synthetic (Laponite) and natural (Swy- 2) <b>smectite</b> <b>clays,</b> with different structural and physical parameters, were incorporated into the Nafion {{for the creation of}} exfoliated nanocomposites. Transport mechanism of water and methanol appears to be influenced from the dimensions of the dispersed platelike silicate layers as well as from their cation exchange capacity (CEC). The details of the NMR results and the effect of the methanol solution concentration are discussed. Clays particles, and in particular Swy- 2, demonstrate to be a potential physical barrier for methanol cross-over, reducing the methanol diffusion with an evident blocking effect yet nevertheless ensuring a high water mobility up to 130 °C and for several hours, proving the exceptional water retention property of these materials and their possible use in the DMFCs applications. Electrochemical behavior is investigated by cell resistance and polarization measurements. From these analyses it is derived that the addition of clay materials to recast Nafion decreases the ohmic losses at high temperatures extending in this way the operating range of a direct methanol fuel cell...|$|R
50|$|The {{deposits}} {{are primarily}} trench-wedge turbidites (Spinelli et al., 2007). There are indications of {{an increase in}} the retention of porosity within the rock. Typically porosity reduces with increasing depth. However, there is an anomalous preservation of porosity at depth at drill site 1173. This has been attributed to post-depositional opal cementation that is preserving the porosity (Spinelli et al., 2007).The detrital clays, primarily smectite, display variation over time and location in the Nankai Trough as well as the Shikoku basin. At depth there is an increase in the <b>smectite</b> <b>clay</b> content in the sediments, inferring {{that there has been a}} change in the deposition source rock (Steurer et al., 2003). Furthermore, there is a geothermal alteration of the smectite, converting it to illite clay (Steurer et al., 2003).|$|E

50|$|Attapulgite clays {{found in}} the Meigs-Quincy {{district}} are bundles of palygorskite clay particles between 2 and 3 μm long and below 3 nm in diameter. The bundles are surrounded by a matrix of <b>smectite</b> <b>clays</b> that are slightly swellable.

Anionic softeners can combine with anionic surfactants directly. Other anionic softeners can be based on <b>smectite</b> <b>clays.</b> Some compounds, such as ethoxylated phosphate esters, have softening, anti-static, and surfactant properties.|$|R
