25|$|This fission stage made fusion weapons {{considerably}} more dirty {{than they were}} made out to be. This {{was evident in the}} towering cloud of deadly fallout that followed the Bravo test. When the Soviet Union tested its first megaton device in 1955, the possibility of a limited nuclear war <b>seemed</b> <b>even</b> more remote in the public and political mind. Even cities and countries that were not direct targets would suffer fallout contamination. Extremely harmful fission products would disperse via normal weather patterns and embed in soil and water around the planet.|$|E
500|$|Diocletian and Maximian {{resigned}} on May 1, 305. Constantius and Galerius became Augusti (senior emperors), {{while two}} new emperors, Severus and Maximinus, became Caesars (junior emperors). According to Lactantius, Galerius had forced Diocletian's {{hand in the}} matter, and secured the appointment of loyal friends to the imperial office. In this [...] "Second Tetrarchy", it seems that only the Eastern emperors, Galerius and Maximinus, continued with the persecution. As they left office, Diocletian and Maximian probably imagined Christianity to be in its last throes. Churches had been destroyed, the Church leadership and hierarchy had been snapped, and the army and civil service had been purged. Eusebius declares that apostates from the faith were [...] "countless" [...] (μυρίοι) in number. At first, the new Tetrarchy <b>seemed</b> <b>even</b> more vigorous than the first. Maximinus in particular was eager to persecute. In 306 and 309, he published his own edicts demanding universal sacrifice. Eusebius accuses Galerius of pressing on with the persecution as well.|$|E

500|$|Sophiatown was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Waterfall farm. Over time it included the neighbouring areas of Martindale and Newclare. It was purchased by a speculator, Hermann Tobiansky, in 1897. He acquired 237acres four miles or so west of the centre of Johannesburg. The private leasehold township was surveyed in 1903 and divided into almost 1700 small stands. The township was named after Tobiansky's wife, Sophia, {{and some of the}} streets were named after his children Toby, Gerty, Bertha and Victoria. Before the enactment of the Natives Land Act, 1913, black South Africans had freehold rights, and they bought properties in the suburb. The distance from the city centre was seen as disadvantageous and after the City of Johannesburg built a sewage plant nearby, the area <b>seemed</b> <b>even</b> less attractive. [...] Because of these and other reasons most of the whites had moved out by 1920, leaving behind a vibrant multi-racial community. By the late 1940s Sophiatown had a population of nearly 54000 Black Africans, 3000 Coloureds, 1500 Indians and 686 Chinese.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} the Sugababes' fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways, it was announced in December 2005 that founding group member Mutya Buena had left the band. Two singles were subsequently released from the album featuring new group member Amelle Berrabah, who was announced as Buena's replacement 24 hours after her departure. In June 2006, the Sugababes began working on their fifth studio album which was confirmed for release in 2007. However, group member Heidi Range also revealed that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas 2006, which would include all of the group's hits. When rumours arose that {{the release of the}} album was premature, band member Keisha Buchanan stated that the group had already started to plan a greatest hits album. She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena's departure, saying: [...] "When Mutya left, we decided it was even more important, we should do this as closure so we don't have to relive history all the time." [...] Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this, saying: [...] "When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned for this time anyway. But when she left it <b>seemed</b> <b>even</b> more appropriate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{believe that}} mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science {{according to the}} definition of Karl Popper. However, in the 1930s Gödel's incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that [...] "most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it <b>seemed</b> <b>even</b> recently." [...] Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.|$|E
