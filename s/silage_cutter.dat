40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was to determine}} effects from adding glucose, sucrose and starch to forage sorghum (DeKalb FSla) immediately prior to ensiling, on the feeding value of the subsequent silage. When the forage sorghum grain was at medium-to-hard dough stage, it was field chopped with a conventional <b>silage</b> <b>cutter.</b> Dry matter the forage was determined at harvesting and equalized by adding water. Each additive {{was added to the}} forage prior to ensiling. The sorghum forage was ensiled in 40 -ton concrete stave silos...|$|E
40|$|The Hereford heifers used in {{this test}} were of good to choice quality from the Brite Ranch at Marfa, Texas. They were {{delivered}} to Manhattan, Kansas, November 3, 1952, {{at a cost of}} 23 cents per pound. From that date until started on test December 22, 1952, they were fed prairie hay and 1 pound of soybean pellets per head daily. The first cutting alfalfa fed to Lots 1, 2, and 3 came from the same field. No preservative was used in making the silage. The wilted alfalfa was left in the field from 30 minutes to 3 hours. The non-wilted was cut, raked, picked up with H <b>silage</b> <b>cutter,</b> and hauled to the silo as rapidly as possible. The special supplement fed to Lot 5 at the rate of 3 pounds per head daily was of the following; composition: soybean oilmeal, 2. 25 pounds; molasses, 0. 50 pound; steamed bonemeal, 0. 18 pound; salt, 0. 06 pound; vitamin supplement, 0. 01 pound (2, 250 A and 400 D per gram) ...|$|E
