There is one exception to this rule: <b>single</b> <b>drive</b> and mirrored vdevs can be expanded to larger (but not smaller) capacities, without affecting the vdev's operation, by adding larger disks and replacing/removing smaller disks, {{as shown in the}} example below.|$|E
25|$|A {{direct field}} is {{generated}} by audio drivers arranged to encircle the test article. Two different control schemes {{can be used to}} perform a direct field test. One method, known as single-input-single-output or SISO, uses a <b>single</b> <b>drive</b> signal to all acoustic drivers with multiple control microphones averaged to produce the control measurement. This method will produce a set of correlated plane waves that may combine to produce large magnitude variations creating local fluctuations on the test article surface. Magnitude variations as much as +/−12dB can be experienced. The second method, known as MIMO, uses multiple independent drive signals to control multiple independent microphone locations. This method produces a more uncorrelated field that is much more uniform than the SISO field. Magnitude variations in the range of +/-3dB are typical when using MIMO control.|$|E
25|$|As {{bit cell}} size decreases, more {{data can be}} put onto a <b>single</b> <b>drive</b> platter. In 2013, a {{production}} desktop 3TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an areal density of about 500Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (electrothermal instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known write head materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium. Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as flash memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs).|$|E

25|$|If {{the disks}} are {{connected}} to a RAID controller, it is most efficient to configure it as a HBA in JBOD mode (i.e. turn off RAID function). If a hardware RAID card is used, ZFS always detects all data corruption but cannot always repair data corruption because the hardware RAID card will interfere. Therefore, the recommendation is to not use a hardware RAID card, or to flash a hardware RAID card into JBOD/IT mode. For ZFS {{to be able to}} guarantee data integrity, it needs to either have access to a RAID set (so all data is copied to at least two disks), or if one single disk is used, ZFS needs to enable redundancy (copies) which duplicates the data on the same logical drive. Using ZFS copies is a good feature to use on notebooks and desktop computers, since the disks are large and it at least provides some limited redundancy with just a <b>single</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

2500|$|For RAID subsystems, data {{integrity}} and fault-tolerance requirements {{also reduce the}} realized capacity. For example, a RAID1 array has about half the total capacity {{as a result of}} data mirroring, while a RAID5 array with [...] drives loses [...] of capacity (which equals to the capacity of a <b>single</b> <b>drive)</b> due to storing parity information. RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user, but provide fault tolerance. Most RAID vendors use checksums to improve {{data integrity}} at the block level. Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors of 520 bytes to contain 512 bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes, or by using separate 512-byte sectors for the checksum data.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：With two {{upper and}} nether {{piezoelectric}} vibrators to provide excitation {{in the same}} time, vertical double driven piezoelectric feeder (vertical double driven feeder for short in the paper) has smaller piezoelectric ceramics (PZT), and lower driving voltage to prolong the lifetime of the PZT, meanwhile, its carrying capacity gets stronger, compared with vertical <b>single</b> <b>driven</b> piezoelectric feeder (vertical <b>single</b> <b>driven</b> feeder for short in the paper). Vibration analysis was carried out on the feeder system, and the affection factors on the system natural frequency and feeder tray amplitude were received. Based on the modal analysis, the system theoretical resonant frequency was got as 135. 95 Hz. In the end, the prototype was tested to analyze the relationships among the feeding speed, feeder tray amplitude, driving voltage and driving frequency...|$|R
