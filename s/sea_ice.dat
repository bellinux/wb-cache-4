5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>ice</b> extent expands {{annually}} in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The extent of <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.|$|E

5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For <b>sea</b> <b>ice,</b> which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|Rohling's 2004 Bipolar model {{suggests}} that sea level rise lifted buoyant ice shelves, causing their destabilisation and destruction.

5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} {{about how}} much danger the production encountered during the 1932–33 winter season. The Hollywood Reporter said in October 1932 that the Nanuk {{was caught in the}} ice off Alaska and sled dog teams had to be used to rescue the film crew. However, crew on the film noted that the Nanuk wintered in Grantley Harbor at Teller. A press release by MGM in November 1932 claimed that the Nanuk reported via radio that it was frozen in the <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> and drifting with 35 people aboard, unable to continue shooting until the spring. A report by the New York Times in February 1933 also claimed the Nanuk was locked in <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> between Teller and Barrow. Peter Freuchen also relates that the Nanuk was blown off course by heavy winds several times.|$|E

5|$|A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{study in}} January 2009 found that emperor {{penguins}} could be {{pushed to the}} brink of extinction by the year 2100 due to global climate change.

5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as Arctic <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E

By 1972, it opened up service to east Greenland with a helicopter based in Tasiilaq, and established Greenlandair Charter. Mining at Maamorilik in the Uummannaq Fjord required still more helicopters, and the airline purchased Bell 206s for the route.

5|$|In June 2014 a {{study by}} the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{concluded}} that emperor penguins are at risk from global warming, which is melting the <b>sea</b> <b>ice.</b> This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of emperor penguins will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat. Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill, which is a primary food for emperor penguins.|$|E

Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter <b>sea</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years.
