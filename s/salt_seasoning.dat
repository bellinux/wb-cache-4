40|$|ABSTRACT The {{microbiological}} quality of poultry meat patties as {{affected by the}} incorporation of 10 % broiler giblets was evaluated. The major meat component was skinless broiler thigh meat. An emulsion consisting of broiler skin, <b>salt,</b> <b>seasoning,</b> water, and a soy concentrate was added to constitute 20 % of the product. Total aerobic, coliform, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and KF streptococcal counts and Salmonella analyses were determined on ingredients and patty products initially and after storage at 2 and — 10 C. The average log 10 values of the total plate counts (TPC) of the ingredients were: thigh meat 7. 0, hearts 4. 0, livers 4. 4, gizzards 4. 7, and emulsion 5. 4. The initial TPC of the four patty products was approximately log 7. 0 and patties spoiled in 2 to 4 days at 2 C. Coliform counts were greater than log 3. 4 /g in both ingredients and products, whereas the averages, coli, S. aureus, and KF strepto-coccal counts were log 1. 6, 1. 5, and 2. 4 in the ingredients and 1. 3, 1. 8, and 2. 9 in the products, respectively. Salmonella was isolated from all ingredients except skinless thigh meat and from 75 % of all four patty products before, during, and after storage at — 10 C.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Seasoning</b> <b>salts</b> {{have now}} {{replaced}} local condiments {{in the kitchen}} of virtually every Nigerian home thus prompting this comparative study on mineral availability from Nigerian vegetables. The iron content of both <b>seasoning</b> <b>salts</b> (Maggi and A-one) was higher than that in the vegetables. Fermentation decreased the iron content of African locust bean while that of melon seed was unaffected. The availability of iron was generally high (21 - 35 %) while Maggi, iru and ogiri enhanced iron availability in Amaranthus composite diets but iron availability from Corchorus composite diets was inhibited. Tannin content in both vegetables was similar but phytate in Corchorus was 300 % greater than in Amaranthus. Fermentation reduced the level of magnesium by 50 % in locust bean but increased that of melon seed. The <b>seasoning</b> <b>salts</b> enhanced magnesium availability in Corchorus vegetable and was inhibited by locust bean and melon seed. Fermentation improved magnesium availability in condiment-Corchorus composite diets. Copper content was high in the plant foods, low but with high availability in the <b>seasoning</b> <b>salts.</b> Fermentation reduced the copper availability in locust bean but increased that of melon seed. Availability of copper was virtually inhibited in all the composite diets. Zinc content of iru and ogiri was 250 % greater than the level in <b>seasoning</b> <b>salts</b> and the vegetables. Zinc availability was high in the vegetables, Maggi and low in iru and was depressed in Corchorus composite diets but enhanced in most Amaranthus composite diets...|$|R
