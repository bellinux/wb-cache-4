40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigation into the possibility of employing the groove rolling process to produce round Mg/Al bimetallic bars. The feedstock were round 22, 5 mm Mg/Al bars that had been produced using the explosive welding method. The average thickness of the aluminium layer amounted to 1, 7 mm. The Mg/Al bars were rolled in the <b>stretching</b> <b>rolling</b> passes. The theoretical analysis was done using the Forge 2011 Â® computer program. Based on the theoretical and experimental analysis it has been found that one of the main rolling process parameters influencing the quality of bond between the bimetal components is the initial feedstock temperature...|$|R

Happily their memories are short. They seem prone to enjoy the present, forgetful of the past and regardless of the future--happily, I say, for those humpy and hairy creatures are not unacquainted with man's devices--the sudden surprise, the twang of the red-man's bow and the crack of the hunter's rifle.|$|R

60|$|I wrought again; {{and when}} I {{had made a}} good deal of fire-dust I emptied it into a handful of dry brown grass, {{intending}} to carry it home and keep it always and play with it; but the wind struck it and it sprayed up and spat out at me fiercely, and I dropped it and ran.

60|$|Near Pieter-Maritzburg the {{population}} was comparatively thick.

Vast <b>stretches</b> of <b>rolling</b> grass everywhere met the eye. This was now beautifully green, for it was winter. In the summer and autumn the grass becomes dry and burnt up; fire is then applied to it, and the whole country assumes a black mantle. But the first shower of rain brings up the young grass and {{in a very short time}} the country is covered with fresh verdure.|$|R

60|$|On {{either side}} of the road at this point are long <b>stretches</b> of <b>rolling</b> plain, part of it yellow with corn and part of it rich grass land watered by the Sambre.

60|$|The knife was forthcoming, and {{presently}} {{they all}} turned their faces homeward.

60|$|To return--after this I confessed myself {{beaten and}} gave up {{until such time as}} it should please Providence to turn off the water-tap. Trekking out of sight of that infernal river which annoyed me with its {{constant}} gurgling, I camped on a comparatively dry spot that overlooked a beautiful <b>stretch</b> of <b>rolling</b> veld. Towards sunset the clouds lifted and I saw a mile or two away a most extraordinary mountain on the lower slopes of which grew a dense forest. Its upper part, which was of bare rock, looked exactly like the seated figure of a grotesque person with the chin resting on the breast. There was the head, there were the arms, there were the knees. Indeed, the whole mass of it reminded me strongly of the effigy of Zikali which was tied about my neck, or rather of Zikali himself.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} dark when Blake and Harding led two packhorses through a thin spruce wood, with Benson lagging a short {{distance}} behind. They had spent some time crossing a wide <b>stretch</b> of <b>rolling</b> country, dotted with clumps of poplar and birch, which was still sparsely inhabited, and now they had reached {{the edge of the}} timber belt that cuts off the prairie from the desolate barrens. The spruces were gnarled and twisted by the wind, a number of them were dead, and many of the rest leaned unsymmetrically athwart each other. The straggling wood had no beauty and in the fading light wore a dreary, forbidding look. Fortunately, however, it was thin enough for the travellers to pick their way among the fallen branches and patches of muskeg, for the ground was marsh and their feet sank among the withered needles.|$|R
40|$|The unique lattice {{structure}} and properties of graphene has drawn tremendous interests recently. By combining continuum and atomistic approaches, this paper investigates the mechanical properties of single-atomic-layer graphene sheets. A theoretical framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics is developed for graphene under both in-plane and bending deformation. Atomistic simulations {{are carried out}} to deduce the effective mechanical properties. It is found that graphene becomes highly nonlinear and anisotropic under finite-strain uniaxial stretch, and coupling between stretch and shear occurs except for stretching in the zigzag and armchair directions. The theoretical strength (fracture strain and fracture stress) of perfect graphene lattice also varies with the chiral direction of uniaxial <b>stretch.</b> By <b>rolling</b> graphene sheets into cylindrical tubes of various radii, the bending modulus of graphene is obtained. Buckling of graphene ribbons under uniaxial compression is simulated and the critical strain for the onset of buckling is compared to a linear buckling analysis...|$|R

60|$|On {{the evening}} in {{question}} the faintest trace of thin blue vapor etherealized its clustering roofs and stately towers, {{and the great}} river, spanned by its famous bridge, gleamed athwart the flat champaign, a wide silver highway to the distant sea.

Still, Weston, who was jaded and cast down, frowned at the city and {{felt that he had}} a grievance against it. During the last week or two he had, for the most part vainly, endeavored to interview men of importance connected with finance and company promoting. Very few of them would see him at all, and those with whom he gained audience listened to {{what he had to say}} with open impatience, or with a half-amused toleration that was almost as difficult to bear. Perhaps this was not astonishing, as most of them already had had somewhat costly experiences with what they called wild-cat mining schemes.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the acute effects of static <b>stretching</b> or foam <b>rolling</b> on range of motion and 1 RM {{hamstring}} strength. Even though static stretching has been the main method for increasing flexibility, it has also been associated with reductions in strength gains. Foam rolling is a form of self-myofascial release which facilitates restricted fascia. Ten college students participated in this study. Five participants were in the Static Stretching Group, and five participants were in the Foam Rolling Group. Participants met on two separate days. On day one, the Modified Sit and Reach Box was used for all participants to access their range of motion. The Iso-lateral kneeling Leg Curl machine was used to determine the 10 RM for hamstring strength for every participant so that they could be evenly matched into the Static Stretching Group or the Foam Rolling Group. On day two the Static Stretching Group performed five minutes of intense stretching and five minutes of cycling before the final testing of their range of motion and 1 RM hamstring strength. The Foam Rolling Group performed five minutes of intense foam rolling before the final testing of their range of motion and 1 RM were performed. The data collected indicate that there were significant improvements in range of motion for both the Static Stretching Group and the Foam Rolling Group. However, the 1 RM hamstring strength for both the Static Stretching Group and the Foam Rolling Group did not significantly change from pretest to posttest. In conclusion, flexibility increased for both groups, but isotonic muscular strength was unaffected by acute static <b>stretching</b> or foam <b>rolling...</b>|$|R
60|$|But lonely, conspicuous, and superb, rose that {{wonderful}} upright wedge, the Matterhorn. Its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow, {{and the upper}} half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to cobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a veil. A little later the Matterhorn took to himself the semblance of a volcano; he was stripped naked to his apex--around this circled vast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away slantwise toward the sun, a twenty-mile <b>stretch</b> of <b>rolling</b> and tumbling vapor, and looking just {{as if it were}} pouring out of a crater. Later again, one of the mountain's sides was clean and clear, and another side densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which feathered off and flew around the shaft's sharp edge like the smoke around the corners of a burning building. The Matterhorn is always experimenting, and always gets up fine effects, too. In the sunset, when all the lower world is palled in gloom, it points toward heaven out of the pervading blackness like a finger of fire. In the sunrise--well, they say it is very fine in the sunrise.|$|R

60|$|If a {{beautiful}} and fertile country were alone necessary to make a state and its inhabitants happy and prosperous, happiness and prosperity would rain upon the Transvaal and the Dutch Boers. The capabilities of this favoured land are vast and various. Within its borders {{are to be found}} highlands and lowlands, vast <b>stretches</b> of <b>rolling</b> veldt like gigantic sheep downs, hundreds of miles of swelling bushland, huge tracts of mountainous country, and even little glades spotted with timber that remind one of an English park. There is every possible variety of soil and scenery. Some districts will grow all tropical produce, whilst others are well suited for breeding sheep, cattle and horses. Most of the districts will produce wheat and all other cereals in greater perfection and abundance {{than any of the other}} South African colonies. Two crops of cereals may be obtained from the soil every year, and both the vine and tobacco are cultivated with great success. Coffee, sugar-cane and cotton have been grown with profit in the northern parts of the State. Also the undeveloped mineral wealth of the country is very great. Its known minerals are gold, copper, lead, cobalt, iron, coal, tin and plumbago: copper and iron having long been worked by the natives. Altogether there is little doubt that the Transvaal is the richest of all the South African states, and had it remained under English rule it would, with the aid of English enterprise and capital, have become a very wealthy and prosperous country. However there is little chance of that now.|$|R

At length after half an hour or so of this game we reached a <b>stretch</b> of open, <b>rolling</b> ground, and there not fifty yards ahead of us was the animal still going like a hare, though how it could do so on three legs I am sure I do not know.

40|$|Continuous {{extrusion}} {{and rolling}} technology was proposed {{as a new}} strip production technology. It conducts a hot rolling process using waste heat after continuous extrusion. The continuous extrusion and rolling forming was simulated with DEFORM- 3 DT. Influences of extrusion wheel velocity and rolling reduction on the continuous extrusion and rolling forming were analyzed. It was shown that as extrusion wheel velocity increases, torque of extrusion wheel, chamber force and rolling force, will drop; temperature of the billet {{in the area of}} abutment which is highest will increase. As the rolling reduction is increased, torque of the extrusion wheel and force acting on the chamber decrease, while torque and force of the rolls increase. The experimental results showed that a homogeneously distributed and equiaxed grains microstructure can be formed in copper strip billets with an average grain size of about 80 Â Î¼m, after continuous extrusion. Grains of the copper strips are <b>stretched</b> clearly, during <b>rolling,</b> along the rolling direction, to form a stable orientation.

[...] We also came to Fort Bragg up the coast from Fort Ross, keeping our coast journey intact from the Golden Gate. The coast weather was cool and delightful, the coast driving superb. Especially in the Fort Ross section did we find the roads thrilling, while all the way along we followed the sea. At every stream, the road skirted dizzy cliff- edges, dived down into lush growths of forest and ferns and climbed out along the cliff-edges again. The way was lined with flowers--wild lilac, wild roses, poppies, and lupins. Such lupins!--giant clumps of them, of every lupin-shade and--colour. And it was along the Mendocino roads that Charmian caused many delays by insisting on getting out to pick the wild blackberries, strawberries, and thimble-berries which grew so profusely. And ever we caught peeps, far down, of steam schooners loading lumber in the rocky coves; ever we skirted the cliffs, day after day, crossing <b>stretches</b> of <b>rolling</b> farm lands and passing through thriving villages and saw-mill towns. Memorable was our launch-trip from Mendocino City up Big River, where the steering gears of the launches work the reverse of {{anywhere else in the}} world; where we saw a stream of logs, of six to twelve and fifteen feet in diameter, which filled the river bed for miles to the obliteration of any sign of water; and where we were told of a white or albino redwood tree.
