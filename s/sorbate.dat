2500|$|Geranium taint, as {{the name}} suggests, is a flavour and aroma taint in wine {{reminiscent}} of geranium leaves. The compound responsible is 2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene, which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1ng/L. In wine it is formed during the metabolism of potassium <b>sorbate</b> by lactic acid bacteria. Potassium <b>sorbate</b> is sometimes added to wine as a preservative against yeast, however its use is generally {{kept to a minimum}} due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of sorbic acid to the alcohol sorbinol. The alcohol is then isomerised in the presence of acid to 3,5-hexadiene-2-ol, which is then esterified with ethanol to form 2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene. [...] Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation {{with a high level of}} residual sugars still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.|$|E

40|$|Sorption {{interactions}} between selected hydrophobic organic pollutants as <b>sorbates</b> and various natural sorbents in two-phase systems sorbent - water were experimentally tested {{by means of}} both batch (static) and column elution (dynamic) methods. Relatively persistent priority pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthalene, anthracene and fluoranthene), organochlorinated pesticides (methoxychlor, hexachlorobenzene and lindane) and triazine herbicides (simazine and atrazine) were used as model hydrophobic <b>sorbates.</b> The collection of the examined natural sorbents included lake sediments, soils, reference samples of subsoil sedimentary rocks and some technical products as synthetic reference materials. By using batch methods, the distribution/sorption coefficients KD and/or parameters KF and 1 /n of the Freundlich isotherm equation for the respective sorption systems were determined. In the case of natural sorbents with significant contents of organic matter, the corresponding normalised distribution/sorption coefficients KOC or KOC(F) were calculated and compared with known reference values of these parameters. On the basis of some observed differences between experimental and expected data, the role of organic matter and some other factors affecting the sorption processes, limitations of the simple model of hydrophobic sorption and reliability of sorption data are discussed. Elution sequences and phase distribution balances of the pollutants, determined by elutions of the <b>sorbates</b> with water from sorbent columns, also reflected differences in their sorption parameters in detail.

50|$|Sorbic {{acid and}} its salts, such as sodium <b>sorbate,</b> {{potassium}} <b>sorbate,</b> and calcium <b>sorbate,</b> are antimicrobial agents {{often used as}} preservatives in food and drinks to prevent the growth of mold, yeast, and fungi. In general the salts are preferred over the acid form {{because they are more}} soluble in water, but the active form is the acid. The optimal pH for the antimicrobial activity is below pH 6.5. Sorbates are generally used at concentrations of 0.025% to 0.10%.

5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "wine stabilizer", {{potassium}} <b>sorbate</b> produces sorbic acid when added to wine. It serves two purposes. When active fermentation has ceased {{and the wine}} is racked for the final time after clearing, potassium <b>sorbate</b> renders any surviving yeast incapable of multiplying. Yeast living at that moment can continue fermenting any residual sugar into CO2 and alcohol, but when they die, no new yeast will be present to cause future fermentation. When a wine is sweetened before bottling, potassium <b>sorbate</b> is used to prevent refermentation when {{used in conjunction with}} potassium metabisulfite.

The carbonized parts were pulverized; both carbonized and uncarbonized sorbents were sieved into two particle sizes of 325 µm and 625 µm using mechanical sieve. 1. 5 g protein wastes and cellulosic wastes were each used {{to mop up}} spilled crude oil, diesel, kerosene and petrol (separately before combining) by encasing them in a sac like boom of 2 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm dimension so as to determine the efficacy of waste sorbents in cleaning hydrocarbon spills. Results of Tables 1 (a) - 4 (a), 1 (b) - 4 (b) and 5 - 8 shows that the sorbents mopped, desorbed and retained an average of more than 500 %, 350 % and 300 % of their weight of the hydrocarbon <b>sorbates</b> within average of 90 mins contact time, the volume of <b>sorbates</b> mopped up increased significantly when equal weight of activated and unactivated sorbents were combined, the results of equal combination of activated and unactivated sorbents at each particle size and contact time were {{compared with that of}} calculated values, high percentage retention observed were a function of mechanism of absorption/adsorption. Each sorbent have a distinct feature that enhances its mopping ability. Large volumes of the hydrocarbon liquids were recovered by mere pressing, the <b>sorbates</b> were mopped up in the order; crude oil > diesel > kerosene > petrol. Protein sorbents with oleophilic and aqua phobic properties absorbed more of all the hydrocarbon liquids than cellulosic sorbents at any particle size and contact, the later tend to be more abundant and therefore cost effective; it was observed that both carbonized and uncarbonized sorbents are good hydrocarbon mops and therefore good alternative to synthetic polyurethane foam already in use. Combination, particle size, activation of sorbents, contact time, viscosity and chain length of hydrocarbon determined the amount of <b>sorbates</b> absorbed/adsorbed, recovered or retained. The residual leachable oil (kerosene) in the sorbents were below 5 % and does not constitute serious environmental menace when left in an open dump to decay being biodegradable waste, but a brighter application is that the waste sorbent can be used in making logs as alternative to fire wood or in making particle board for furniture...|$|R
40|$|The Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) Program (formerly {{referred}} to as the Modular Salt Processing (MSP) Project) seeks to deploy equipment to remove the {sup 134, 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, and alpha-emitting radionuclides (principally {sup 238, 239, 240 }Pu and {sup 237 }Np) from the high level waste salt solutions. The equipment is installed within a high level waste tank {{to take advantage of the}} shielding provided by the waste tank. The process will involve adding monosodium titanate (MST) to the waste tank (i. e., Tank 41 H) to sorb the Sr and select actinides, removing the MST and entrained sludge with in-riser rotary microfilters, and subsequently using ion-exchange columns containing crystalline silicotitanate (CST) to remove the Cs. After being loaded with Cs, the CST will be ground to reduce the particle size and then transferred into another waste tank (e. g., Tank 40 H). The MST and sludge solids stream will be transported to a sludge batch preparation tank (i. e., Tank 42 H or Tank 51 H) once the SCIX batch is processed. Both streams, MST/solids and CST, will ultimately be transported into and vitrified inside the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). A series of experiments were performed to examine desorption from monosodium titanate (MST), modified monosodium titanate (mMST), and crystalline silicotitanate (CST) under various conditions. The first two experiments examined desorption from MST and CST under two different sludge treatment processes, aluminum dissolution and sludge washing. Desorption of all <b>sorbates</b> was observed to varying degrees under the aluminum dissolution conditions. The extent of desorption ranged from < 3 % to about 50 % after 4 weeks, with Pu exhibiting the lowest desorption. At the end of the experiment, the temperature was reduced from 65 C to 25 C and the tests monitored for an additional two weeks. After reducing the temperature, partial resorption of the <b>sorbates</b> was observed with both MST and CST. Under the sludge washing conditions, no desorption of <b>sorbates</b> was observed with MST; however, some additional sorption did occur. For CST, a small amount of Cs leached from the material during the first day of testing, but no further leaching was observed over the remaining test period. The final test was designed to examine the possibility of desorption from both MST and mMST upon increasing the solid to liquid phase ratio. The results of these tests indicated some desorption of Pu from MST within the first two weeks after changing the phase ratio, then resorption of some of the leached Pu over the remaining 4 weeks of the experiment.
