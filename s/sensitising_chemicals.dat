40|$|The KG 1 myeloid leukaemia {{was used}} as source of {{dendritic}} cells (DC) to discriminate between respiratory and contact <b>sensitising</b> <b>chemicals.</b> A cocktail of cytokines was used to differentiate KG 1 to dendritic like cells (termed dKG 1) {{and the effects of}} nine chemicals (respiratory and contact sensitisers) and an irritant control on surface marker expression, 'antigen presenting' function and cytokine expression investigated. The stability of these chemicals when dissolved was characterised using MALDI ToF MS. A Hill plot model was used with the cellular viability data to quantify the lethal dose 50 % (LD 50) and a maximum sub toxic concentration of each chemical defined. Cytokine expression by the treated dKG 1 was quantified using multiplex immunobead analysis. Whilst dKG 1 cells were morphologically similar to DCs, expression of specific surface markers was not typical for DCs derived from healthy precursor cells. When the chemicals were applied at defined sub toxic doses no effects on dKG 1 phenotype, function, or cytokine expression, attributable to the sensitisation properties were discriminated. However, dKG 1 cells were much more sensitive to the toxic effects of these chemicals compared to the parent KG 1 cells. Only 4 of the 9 chemicals tested were stable when dissolved indicating that the effect of <b>sensitising</b> <b>chemicals</b> on antigen presenting cells may be related to species other than the parent compound...|$|E
40|$|Occupational asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common lung {{diseases}} in developed countries. Risk assessment for potentially <b>sensitising</b> <b>chemicals</b> is performed in animal models. With an increasing public demand to limit the number of animals used in respiratory research and to reduce the distress to the animals, several models have been developed. Human PCLS are an ex vivo model where all relevant cell types are present in their natural position. We use PCLS to test for modifications of local immune responses assessing a variety of immunological endpoints. Human PCLS were prepared from lung lobes of cancer patients. Tissue was exposed to LPS, dexamethasone, respiratory and contact allergens. Viability of PCLS was determined with WST- 1, LDH and LIVE/DEAD staining for confocal microscopy. Cytokine contents were detected with Luminex technology and ELISA. Employing LPS and dexamethasone we were able to show that the inflammatory response in PCLS resemble the in vivo situation very closely. Repeated stimulation with LPS (intra- and inter-assay variances < 20 %) showed that human PCLS might also be suitable to characterize respiratory irritation and inflammation induced by chemicals. PCLS were exposed to 20 chemicals and IC 50 were calculated. We currently investigate cytokine patterns (e. g. IL- 1, TNF, IL- 8) for the differentiation between respiratory and contact allergens. Indeed, IL- 8 production is increased after stimulation with TMA whereas DNCB failed to induce the release of IL- 8 to the same extent. It suggests that the combination of cytokine production with cytotoxic data may represent a promising in vitro model for the screening of allergens...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the development, validation and regulatory acceptance of in chemico and in vitro test methods for skin sensitisation. Although these methods have been shown to perform relatively well (about 80 % accuracy in predicting Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) classifications) a concern was raised on the regulatory acceptability of negative results since it was questioned whether these methods are able to predict chemicals that need to be activated to act as sensitisers. In order to inform ongoing discussions at the regulatory level in the EU, EURL ECVAM held an expert meeting on 10 - 11 November 2015 to analyse the extent to which in chemical and in vitro methods are able to correctly identify chemicals that need to be activated either through abiotic activation (pre-haptens) and/or through biotic (enzyme-mediated) mechanisms (pro-haptens) to acquire skin sensitisation potential. The expert group analysed a list of 127 chemicals, with available LLNA and in vitro data, 22 % of which were considered to be pre- and/or pro-haptens. The pre-haptens, constituting the vast majority of chemicals requiring activation, where mostly correctly identified by both the in chemico and in vitro assays whereas the pro-haptens which represent a small subset of <b>sensitising</b> <b>chemicals,</b> were generally identified correctly by one of the cell-based assays. As a result, the expert group recommended that negative in vitro data should be accepted unless there is a compelling scientific argument that a substance is likely to be an exclusively metabolically activated pro-hapten.

40|$|Australian {{blackwood}} (Acacia melanoxylon RBR) is {{a valuable}} commercial timber that since 1925 has been incriminated as being injurious to health. In addition to toxic effects numerous cases of allergic contact dermatitis and bronchial asthma have been observed in woodworkers. Several constituents {{have been identified in}} recent years, but none of them could be considered as aetiological factors. Sensitizing experiments performed with blackwood heartwood extracts corroborated the described <b>sensitising</b> properties. <b>Chemical</b> studies showed the occurrence of two or possibly three quinones that produced positive skin responses in the sensitised guinea pigs. The main contact allergens were isolated and identified by x-ray analysis. The first, a yellow quinone, was identified as 2, 6 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -benzoquinone while the second, a red quinone, has the structure of 6 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 3, 5 -dihydrobenzofurano- 4, 7 -dion and was named acamelin. Whereas 2, 6 -dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone is already known from natural sources, acamelin is new and belongs to the rate group of naturally occurring furanoquinones. Though the obtained sensitising capacity of A melanoxylon RBR in respect of its quinones is not high, it should be considered as a possible source of allergic contact dermatitis, especially as greater amounts of Australian blackwood may enter European countries in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidic {{platforms}} {{enable a}} variety of physical or chemical stimulation of single or multiple cells to be examined and monitored in real-time. To date, intracellular calcium signalling research is, however, predominantly focused on observing the response of cells to a single mode of stimulation; consequently, the sensitising/desensitising of cell responses under concurrent stimuli is not well studied. In this paper, we provide an extended Discontinuous Dielectrophoresis procedure to investigate the <b>sensitising</b> of <b>chemical</b> stimulation, over an extensive range of shear stress, up to 63 dyn/cm 2, which encompasses shear stresses experienced in the arterial and venus systems (10 to 60 dyn/cm 2). Furthermore, the TRPV 4 -selective agonist GSK 1016790 A, a form of chemical stimulation, did not influence {{the ability of the}} cells&# 039; to remain immobilised under high levels of shear stress; thus, enabling us to investigate shear stress stimulation on agonism. Our experiments revealed that shear stress sensitises GSK 1016790 A-evoked intracellular calcium signalling of cells in a shear-stimulus dependent manner, as observed through a reduction in the cellular response time and an increase in the pharmacological efficacy. Consequently, suggesting that the role of TRPV 4 may be underestimated in endothelial cells-which experience high levels of shear stress. This study highlights the importance of conducting studies at high levels of shear stress. Additionally, our approach will be valuable for examining the effect of high levels of shear on different cell types under different conditions, as presented here for agonist activation...|$|R
