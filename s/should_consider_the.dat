5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' conceptions of the {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E

It is the {{prevailing}} view that, because the human subordinates the computer in a meaningful intent to win a chess game, and that the human {{is the one who}} makes the final decision about the move to be played, <b>the</b> human <b>should</b> be <b>considered</b> <b>the</b> Advanced Chess player. Some have also argued that the term [...] "computer-assisted player" [...] should not be used for an Advanced Chess player, as the key element is cooperation, not assistance.|$|R

25|$|The {{possible}} aquifer types {{suitable for}} an ASR system include fractured unconfined rock and confined sand and gravel. Detailed geological investigations {{are necessary to}} establish the feasibility of an ASR scheme. The potential low cost of ASR compared to subsurface storage can be attractive. The design process <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> protection of groundwater quality, and recovered water quality for its intended use. Aquifers and aquitards need also be protected from damaged by depletion or high pressures. Impacts of the harvesting point on downstream areas also require consideration. Careful planning is required regarding aquifer selection, treatment, injection, the recovery process, and maintenance and monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Stephen R. L. Clark, Mary Midgley, and Bernard Rollin also discuss {{animal rights}} {{in terms of}} animals being {{permitted}} to lead a life appropriate for their kind. Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes {{the interests of the}} worse off more important than those of the better off. Another approach, virtue ethics, holds that in considering how to act we <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. Rosalind Hursthouse has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics. Mark Rowlands has proposed a contractarian approach.|$|E
25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process <b>should</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E
