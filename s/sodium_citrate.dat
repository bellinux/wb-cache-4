50|$|Blue Charge is {{the brand}} name of an energy drink, {{produced}} in the UK by Cott for Asda {{as an alternative to}} such products as Red Bull and Powerade. Marketed as an energy drink to combat mental and physical fatigue, it contains, per 250 ml (8.3 U.S. fl. oz.) serving, about 27 g of sugar (glucose, sucrose), 1000 mg of taurine, 600 mg of glucuronolactone, B-complex vitamins and 80 mg of caffeine. The caffeine in one serving is less than that found in an average cup of coffee (typically 100 mg/250 ml cup) or twice as much as found in a can of Coke (40 mg/330-ml can) - around 80 mg per can. A diet version has been available since the beginning of 2003. Diet Blue Charge is sweetened with aspartame, as opposed to sucrose and glucose, as found in original Blue Charge. The drink is described as tasting of 'fruit flavours' and an alternative cranberry flavour is available. It is commonly used by the British youth and student culture as mixer in alcoholic drinks, such as with vodka. The ingredients in Blue Charge, similar to those used in Red Bull, are: carbonated water, sugar, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, taurine (0.4%), natural flavourings, acidity regulator (<b>sodium</b> <b>citrates),</b> fruit and vegetable concentrates (apple, carrot, hibiscus), glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin B12), preservative (potassium sorbate).

40|$|Epidemiological {{data have}} {{revealed}} {{a relatively low}} incidence of heart disease in Italy and other Mediterranean countries that cannot be entirely accounted for by traditional risk factors and have identified tomatoes as a component in the diet that may help explain the protective effect observed (1). Indeed, data have inversely correlated blood levels of lycopene, of which tomato products contribute approximately 80 % to the diet, to incidence of acute coronary events, development of early atherosclerosis, and mortality from heart disease (2 – 3). Blood platelets {{play an important role}} in the development and stability of plaques. Recently, the presence of anti-platelet factor(s) in tomatoes has been reported (4). However, the active components in tomatoes and mechanism of their anti-platelet action are still unknown. To this end, the purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which an aqueous tomato extract could inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. Fasting blood samples were collected into <b>sodium</b> <b>citrated</b> tubes from healthy volunteers who had not taken medications known to affect platelet function for the previous seven days.
