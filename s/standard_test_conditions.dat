25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cells used in a photovoltaic system, in combination with latitude and climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1m2 will produce 200W at <b>Standard</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Conditions,</b> but it can produce more {{when the sun is}} high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions and when the sun is low in the sky. In central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 5.5kWh/m2/day, such a panel can be expected to produce 440kWh of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives only 3.8kWh/m2/day, annual energy yield will drop to 280kWh for the same panel. At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175kWh annual energy yield in southern England.|$|E

However, some students with disabilities (SWD) are either unable to take <b>tests</b> under <b>standard</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> or are unable to perform at their best under <b>standard</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> In many <b>testing</b> situations, accommodations to <b>standard</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> are given to SWD to improve measurement of their knowledge, skills and abilities. This practice is in the pursuit of more valid test score interpretation; however, it produces the ultimate psychometric oxymoron – an accommodated standardized test. In this paper, I review validity issues related to test accommodations and summarize some empirical studies in this area. The focus of the paper is on accommodations for reading tests because some types of accommodations on these tests are particularly controversial. The specific accommodations emphasized in this review are extended time and oral (read-aloud) accommodations. A review of professional standards, validity theory, and recent empirical research in this area suggests that extended time accommodations may be appropriate for reading tests, but read-aloud accommodations are likely to alter the construct measured. Suggestions for determining when to provide accommodations and how to report scores from accommodated test administrations are provided...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the effects of inter-modal attention and mental arithmetic on Humphrey visual field sensitivity and multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) amplitude. Four normally sighted subjects (ages ranging from 24 to 58 years) participated in this study. Monocular visual field sensitivity was measured under two conditions: (1) <b>standard</b> <b>testing</b> <b>condition</b> and (2) while the subject performed a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT). Monocular mfVEPs were recorded in response to a 60 -sector stimulus. The checkerboard pattern in each sector was contrast reversed according to a binary m-sequence. mfVEPs were recorded under two conditions: (1) <b>standard</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> and (2) while the subject performed a PASAT. We found that, when compared to the no-task condition, all subjects had locations of significantly reduced Humphrey visual field sensitivities when performing the PASAT. In contrast, there were no significant decreases in mfVEP amplitude in any sector for any of the subjects while performing the PASAT. Our findings indicate that divided attention and ongoing mental processes did not affect the mfVEP. Therefore, the mfVEP provides an objective measure of visual field function that may be useful for some patients with unreliable automated static perimetry results...|$|R
