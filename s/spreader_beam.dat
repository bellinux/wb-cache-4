Uniform loading is applied by inflating a 15 -mm thick by 100 -mm wide hard rubber pad, which is confined by the top surface of the test slab.

30|$|The {{total load}} in each figure is the applied load P plus the slab {{self-weight}} (3.6  kN/m) and the self-weight of the <b>spreader</b> <b>beams</b> and all packing plates {{used in the}} test and measured {{at the start of}} the test (i.e. P +  30.84  kN). The dashed straight lines in the figures represent the bending moments calculated by assuming constant stiffness along the slab and linear elastic behaviour of materials. The sagging (positive) moments are the values directly under the applied concentrated load and were calculated from statics using the measured reaction at the exterior support at the end of the slab. The hogging (negative) moment at the interior support was also calculated using the measured reaction at the exterior support of the failed span.|$|R

The beam pattern therefore needs a 3 -way <b>beam</b> <b>spreader.</b> An rf deflecting cavity concept was proposed that includes both superconducting and normal conducting options. We characterize the higher order modes (HOM) of these rf separator cavities and evaluate beam dynamics effects due to potential HOM excitation.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyAs large {{sections}} of production pipe are lifted and installed, forces act on the structure. If initial analyses of the structural integrity show that the pipe will fail, support elements have to be introduced. The two most used solutions are the <b>spreader</b> <b>beam</b> and the brace bar, which deals with the problem in somewhat different ways. A pipe section, called a spool, is analyzed using both of the solutions to reveal differences in the structural impact. The result {{of this is that}} the <b>spreader</b> <b>beam</b> shows considerably lower utilization of the pipe capacity, mostly due to a significant reduction of bending moments found in the brace bar analysis. The structure is also exposed to buckling issues in the areas where compression loads occur. The standard method for buckling analysis is to use the Euler theory. This basic method uses only fixed and moment free restraints for the beam members, and might not be sufficient to represent the true conditions for the spool. Therefore, a method based on elastic restraints is used for the buckling analysis in this thesis. It turns out that the method in general gives higher buckling lengths for the spool than if Euler theory is used. A parametric study of varying buckling lengths shows an interesting behavior of the utilization results provided by the software program Staad. Pro. The study suggests that the program overestimates the capacity of the pipe, if the results are compared to Euler theory. Operational and economical issues are compared and discussed, highlighting advantages and disadvantages with the two solutions. Subsea...|$|E

40|$|This Engineering Note {{documents}} {{the design of}} the stand to be used to transport the CC Cryostat heads into the D-Zero clean room. Due to the width of the clean room access door, the heads will have to be upright to fit through. This head cart will hold the heads upright and wheel them into the clean room on a guided track. Before the wheels are placed on the heat cart, it will be used as a stand to place the heads on for the purpose of test fitting the super insulation. The head cart will not only be structurally sufficient to support the weight of the heads but also stiff enough to allow a maximum deflection of 1 / 2 -inch {{at the end of the}} 48 -inch cylinder. The heaviest head assembly weighs about 9000 pounds. Following A. I. S. C. specifications and using a 9000 pound design load, the head cart was initially designed and built and later modified in order to meet the deflection requirements. Bending and tension stresses were limited to two thirds the yield strength. Weld and shear stresses are limited to 0. 4 *Fy. The C 7 X 12. 25 channels, the L 2. 5 X 2. 5 X 0. 25 angles adn the 1 / 2 -inch plate are all A 36 steel. In order to validate the need for an end plate in the 48 -inch cylinder, an ANSYS model was created of the cylinder itself to determine it's rigidity under a point load applied at it's outer end. Appendix D contains the results which demonstrate the rigidity of the cylinder-end plate assembly. Also included is a Frame-Mac simulation of the head cart which was used to estimate the deflection at the cylinder end. A load test was performed to 133 % of the rated capacity, or 12, 000 pounds. The test load was incrementally applied using a crane and hook scale. A graph of deflection vs. load is shown in Appendix E. A <b>spreader</b> <b>beam</b> was designed and built to properly test the head cart. Stress calculations for this test <b>spreader</b> <b>beam</b> are included in Appendix C...|$|E
50|$|The {{accidents}} {{occurred when}} the high-power electron beam was activated instead of the intended low power beam, and without the <b>beam</b> <b>spreader</b> plate rotated into place. Previous models had hardware interlocks in place to prevent this, but Therac-25 had removed them, depending instead on software interlocks for safety. The software interlock could fail due to a race condition. The defect was as follows: a one-byte counter in a testing routine frequently overflowed; if an operator provided manual input to the machine at the precise moment that this counter overflowed, the interlock would fail.|$|R

The High Energy Beam Transfer (HEBT) is about 170 meters long and has two achromat sections, an energy corrector cavity, energy spreader cavity, and transverse and longitudinal collimators. The Ring to Target Beam Transfer (RTBT) line is about 150 meters long has an achromat, transverse collimators and a <b>beam</b> <b>spreader</b> section. It will be shown that with the available diagnostics one can first characterize the incoming beam in both lines and then, with types and locations of the diagnostics and beam tuning ''knobs'', set up to deliver an output beam with the desired properties...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} metamodel-based {{optimization}} of plated steel beams. The {{first part of}} the article explains the principle of the metamodel-based optimization approach and also provides basic information on incorporated sub-methods such as design of experiments (DOE), math ematical approximation methods and mathematical opti- mization methods. Since optimized sections tend to be slender and thus susceptible to buckling, special attention is paid to the buckling evaluation. Both linear and nonlinear buckling analyses are employed. The nonlinear buckling analysis addresses detrimental influence of imperfections on the limit load by introducing equivalent geometric imperfections into the finite element (FE) model. The s hapes and magnitudes of these imperfections are based on recommendations for plated beams given in Eurocode 3 (EC 3). The practical part of the article illustrates the approach on step by step basis using an example of <b>spreader</b> <b>beam</b> weight optimization. It is shown that simple metamodels can efficiently substitute the FE model in optimization, thereby making the process very fast. The parametric FE models are developed in the Ansys Parametric Design Language (APDL). The governing algorithm, as well as most of the mathematical sub-methods, is realized in the Matlab software...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{deals with}} {{employment}} {{of the state}} of the art methods of mathematical optimization and structural analysis in the field of load carrying steel structures of handling devices. The goal of the thesis is to compile a methodology which enables generating of optimal dimensions of conceptually designed load carrying parts of handling devices. The proposed methodology is composed of sub-methods which are successively applied to find an optimal configuration of structure according to a chosen criterion. The methodology incorporates sub-methods such as Design of Experiments, parametric finite-element modelling, the state of the art computational methods for stability assessment, mathematical approximation methods and state of the art optimization schemes based of both, heuristic and gradient principle. Recommendations from Eurocode 3 are used to introduce imperfections to the finite element model in order to perform the nonlinear buckling analysis. The practical part of this thesis is focused on optimization of welded beams. The principle of the methodology is in detail explained and demonstrated on an example of lifting <b>spreader</b> <b>beam</b> of load carrying capacity of 20 tons. The proposed methodology is practically realized by an algorithm created in Matlab software. Matlab is also utilized to implement some sub-methods including mathematical optimization schemes. Both, gradient and heuristic optimization algorithms are used for comparison and mutual verification. Structural analysis is performed by means of parametrical finite-element models which are built in the Ansys Parametric Design Language (APDL). The methodology takes into account buckling, which is inherent to thin walled structures under compressive load. The buckling analysis is performed by means of both, linear and non-linear procedures in Ansys. The output of the algorithm is an optimized configuration of the structure, which minimizes the objective function and complies with all requirements implemented in the form of design constraints...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{investigations}} of direct bonding of mono-crystalline Terbium Gallium Garnet (TGG) to sapphire {{for use as}} Faraday isolator in high power fiber laser applications. The technology of direct bonding allows joining of inorganic crystalline and non-crystalline materials without any auxiliary materials at high bonding strength. Lack of additional joining material and related absorption is very promising for high power laser applications. The ability to join different materials allows inserting sapphire as a heat <b>spreader</b> into the <b>beam</b> path for TGG cooling to avoid thermal lensing. All samples were subjected to extensive chemical cleaning and subsequent low temperature plasma activation before bonding. Bonding was performed under compressive forces in a high vacuum environment at moderate temperature. Optically transparent bonds with a very low fraction of defects were obtained. The size of the bonded area depends significantly on the samples' flatness...|$|R
