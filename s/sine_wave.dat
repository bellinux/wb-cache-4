5|$|This {{period of}} {{electronic}} music championing culminated in 1971 {{with the publication}} of Kaegi's unique record release, a 7-inch record titled Von Sinuston zur elektronischen Musik ("From <b>Sine</b> <b>Wave</b> to Electronic Music"). In the 12 pages accompanying booklet, Kaegi analyses the basic constituents of electronic music like <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> sound synthesis, ring modulation or electronic oscillator, with sound examples provided on the disc as well as excerpts from his most recent works of the time, Kyoto, 1970, Thai Clarinet, 1970, Hydrophonie I, 1969 and Illumination Expo'70 Osaka, 1969. The latter piece was commissioned by the Swiss government to be used as background music for the Swiss pavilion at the World Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan, a project he undertook with composer and contemporary music promoter André Zumbach (born 1931), then head of music at Radio Suisse Romande.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at {{the opponent}} that travels in a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when it hits the opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sine</b> <b>waves</b> are {{generally}} uncomfortable to the ear, and may cause noise-induced hearing loss at lower volumes than other noises. Sound localization {{is often more}} difficult with <b>sine</b> <b>waves</b> than with other sounds; they seem to ‘fill the room’.|$|R
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} <b>sine</b> <b>wave.</b> Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a <b>sine</b> <b>wave.</b> When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5000|$|Non-sinusoidal {{waveforms}} are waveforms {{that are}} not pure <b>sine</b> <b>waves.</b> They are usually derived from simple math functions. While a pure sine consists of a single frequency, non-sinusoidal waveforms {{can be described as}} containing multiple <b>sine</b> <b>waves</b> of different frequencies. These [...] "component" [...] <b>sine</b> <b>waves</b> will be whole number multiples of a fundamental or [...] "lowest" [...] frequency. The frequency and amplitude of each component can be found using a mathematical technique known as Fourier analysis.|$|R

For the CO 2 <b>sine</b> <b>waves,</b> the amplitudes of response agreed well with those predicted at the higher frequencies, but were less than predicted at the lower frequencies. For the hypoxic <b>sine</b> <b>waves,</b> the amplitude of response varied less with frequency than was predicted. For both the CO 2 and the hypoxic <b>sine</b> <b>waves,</b> the phase shift of response was less than expected at the higher frequencies. An attempt was made to fit parameters to a simple model, based on the wash-in and wash-out of respiratory gases into and out of a tissue compartment, and used in the literature for describing the responses to step changes. No satisfactory fit was found. It is concluded that the simple model is unsatisfactory by itself for describing the responses to sinusoidal chemical stimulation; features additional to those included in the model are required to explain fully the responses seen. The possibilities for chemoreception at the higher frequencies are discussed in the light of the low phase shifts...|$|R
