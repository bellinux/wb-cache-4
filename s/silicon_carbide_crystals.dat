Types of measurement of hardness are reviewed with special reference to static indentation tests. The optical techniques and the apparatus made and used are described, including the interferometric techniques employed. The following aspects of hardness of silicon carbide are studied: (1) The variation of hardness with load, the relation between 'recovered' and 'unrecovered' hardness and the surface distortions around the indentations. (2) The variation of hardness with direction: it is found that the [1120] and [0110] are respectively the directions of maximum and minimum hardness. An attempt is made to explain the results in terms of the shear stress on the slip plane. (3) Ring cracks formed by steady pressure made by a diamond ball: the distortions round the cracks and the profiles of sections are studied by multiple-beam interferometry and phase-contrast microscopy. Hertz's classical equation is applied to compare the results. The micro-slip lines observed on a rare trigonal pyramid face of a silicon carbide crystal due to diamond ball impacts are described.
