5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons.

The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force.

5|$|E. c. griseigularis {{is found}} in southwestern New Guinea and Cape York, and was {{described}} in 1909 by Dutch naturalist Eduard van Oort. It is much <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the other subspecies. The original name for this subspecies was harteri, but the type specimen, collected in Cooktown, {{was found to be}} an intergrade form. The new type was collected from Merauke. This subspecies intergrades with cyanotis {{at the base of the}} Cape York Peninsula, and the zone of intermediate forms is narrow. The white wing patch is larger than that of cyanotis and <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> that of albipennis. Only one bird (from Cape York) of this subspecies was sampled in a molecular study, and it was shown to be genetically close to cyanotis.|$|E
