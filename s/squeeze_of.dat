The dish is garnished with ingredients such as green onions, white onions, Thai basil (not to be confused with sweet basil), fresh Thai chili peppers, lemon or lime wedges, bean sprouts, and cilantro (coriander leaves) or culantro. Fish sauce, hoisin sauce, chili oil and hot chili sauce (such as Sriracha sauce) may be added to taste as accompaniments.|$|E
25|$|Another type of punch, {{traditionally}} served {{before the}} departure of a hunting party in England, but now served {{at a variety of}} social events such as garden parties, cricket, tennis matches, and picnics, cups are generally lower in alcohol content than other punches and usually use wine, cider, sloe gin, or liqueurs as the base. They often include quantities of fruit juices or soft drinks. One well known cup is the Pimm's Cup, using Pimm's №1 and British-style lemonade at a ratio of 1:2; a <b>squeeze</b> <b>of</b> lemon; then add orange, lemon and apple slices; a couple of cucumber wedges; and decorate with borage flowers.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, after Pro Arts Inc. {{pitched the}} idea of a poster of Fawcett to her agent, a photo shoot was {{arranged}} with photographer Bruce McBroom, who was hired by the poster company. According to friend Nels Van Patten, Fawcett styled her own hair and did her makeup without the aid of a mirror. Her blonde highlights were further heightened by a <b>squeeze</b> <b>of</b> lemon juice. From 40 rolls of film, Fawcett herself selected her six favorite pictures, and eventually the choice was narrowed to the one that made her famous. The resulting image of Fawcett in a one-piece red bathing suit is the best-selling poster in history.|$|E
40|$|We study a parametrically driven nanomechanical {{resonator}} capacitively {{coupled to}} a microwave cavity. If the nanoresonator can be cooled to near its quantum ground state then quantum <b>squeezing</b> <b>of</b> a quadrature of the nanoresonator motion becomes feasible.

After rapid expansion, Heseltine's businesses were badly hit by the Selwyn Lloyd financial <b>squeeze</b> <b>of</b> 1961 and, still not yet thirty years old, he would eventually owe £250,000 (around £4.5 million at 2016 prices). He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine joked about how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum <b>squeeze)</b> <b>of</b> the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

[...] Myles Bader, author of The Wizard of Food's Encyclopedia of Kitchen & Cooking Secrets, suggests serving angels on horseback on toast with a lemon wedge or hollandaise sauce.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} photon {{statistics and}} quadrature <b>squeezing</b> <b>of</b> the signal mode produced by one-mode subharmonic generator. It is {{found that the}} mean photon energy of the signal mode is twice of a twin signal light beam. And the energy fluctuations of the two signal light beams are four times that {{of one of the}} signal light beams. We have also shown that the photon energy quadrature <b>squeezing</b> <b>of</b> the output signal mode is exactly equal to that of the cavity signal mode. In light of this, the global quadrature <b>squeezing</b> <b>of</b> the signal mode is independent of the mean photon ener-gy.

2500|$|A single-action {{revolver}} {{requires the}} hammer {{to be pulled}} back by hand before each shot, which also revolves the cylinder. This leaves the trigger with just one [...] "single action" [...] left to perform - releasing the hammer to fire the shot - so the force and distance required {{to pull the trigger}} can be minimal. In contrast, with a self-cocking revolver, one long <b>squeeze</b> <b>of</b> the trigger pulls back the hammer and revolves the cylinder, then finally fires the shot. They can generally be fired faster than a single-action, but with reduced accuracy in the hands of most shooters.|$|E
2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a portable fire extinguisher. It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an extinguishing agent in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron. As the methanol burns off, a glassy coating of boric oxide is left {{on the surface of the}} metal, creating an air-excluding crust. These extinguishers were made by the Ansul Chemical Co. utilizing TMB agent manufactured by the Callery Chemical Company, and were modified 2.5-gallon water extinguishers (Ansul used re-branded Elkhart extinguishers at the time), with a variable-stream nozzle that could deliver a straight stream or spray at the <b>squeeze</b> <b>of</b> a lever. A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|E
