40|$|Endoscopic {{skull base}} {{reconstruction}} (ESBR) is an established option for complete {{reconstruction of the}} anterior skull base (ASB). While free mucosal grafts are still relevant for limited defects (< 10 mm), the evolution of vascular flaps has extended the limits of reconstruction with up to 94 % success in defect closure and avoidance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. This article discusses the planning and execution in ESBR for anterior fossa defects. Factors influencing the choice of reconstruction (flap location, size, influence of raised intracranial pressure, high flow CSF leak, radiotherapy) are examined. The reconstructive options are discussed, including the nasoseptal flap (NSF), inferior turbinate pedicled flap and the endopericranial flap, with particular emphasis on {{the technical aspects of}} reconstruction using the NSF. A step-by-step description, with an accompanying video, is provided. Techniques applicable to ESBR in general (subdural graft placement, graft/flap placement, barrier and <b>support</b> <b>dressing)</b> are covered. Novel flaps for ASB reconstruction are also briefly-described. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{evidence}} to <b>support</b> <b>dressing</b> standards for breast surgery wounds is empiric and scarce. This two-arm randomized clinical trial {{was designed to}} assess the effect of dressing wear time on surgical site infection (SSI) rates, skin colonization and patient perceptions. A total of 200 breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to group I (dressing removed on the first postoperative day, n = 100) or group II (dressing removed on the sixth postoperative day, n = 100). SSIs were defined and classified according to criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples collected before placing the dressing and after 1 day (group I) and 6 days (both groups) were cultured for skin colonization assessments. Patients preferences and perceptions with regard to safety, comfort and convenience were recorded and analyzed. A total of 186 patients completed the follow-up. The global SSI rate was 4. 5 %. Six patients in group I and three in group II had SSI (p = 0. 497). Before dressing, the groups were similar with regard to skin colonization. At the sixth day, there was a higher colonization by coagulase-negative staphylococci in group I (p< 0. 0001). Patients preferred to keep dressing for six days (p< 0. 0001), and considered this a safer choice (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} risk {{variables}} for surgical site infection is wound management. Understanding infection risk factors for breast operations is essential {{in order to develop}} infection-prevention strategies and improve surgical outcomes. the aim of this trial is to assess the influence of dressing wear time on surgical site infection rates and skin colonization. Patients' perception at self-assessment will also be analyzed. Methods/Design: This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Two hundred breast cancer patients undergoing immediate or delayed breast reconstruction will be prospectively enrolled. Patients will be randomly allocated to group I (dressing removed on postoperative day one) or group II (dressing removed on postoperative day six). Surgical site infections will be defined by standard criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Skin colonization will be assessed by culture of samples collected at predefined time points. Patients will score dressing wear time with regard to safety, comfort and convenience. Discussion: the evidence to <b>support</b> <b>dressing</b> standards for breast surgery wounds is empiric and scarce. CDC recommends protecting, with a sterile dressing for 24 to 48 hours postoperatively, a primarily closed incision, but there is no recommendation to cover this kind of incision beyond 48 hours, or on the appropriate time to shower or bathe with an uncovered incision. the results of the ongoing trial may support standard recommendations regarding dressing wear time after breast reconstruction.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} women’s {{underwear}} {{functions as a}} source for (re) constructing female identity, and that women’s consumption of underwear is an embodied experience through which they ‘learn’ to choose the ‘right’ underwear for the right occasion. This experience is understood here through the use of Pierre Bourdieu’s notions of habitus, taste and (embodied) cultural capital, thus expanding the limited literature on underwear and its significance in terms of identity and consumption. Through a series of focus groups and interviews, I argue that women express their taste in underwear depending on their habitus-influenced assumptions about its role and function, and that underwear works as their embodied cultural capital to support elements of female identity. The themes of my analysis include the degree to which my participants exhibit their sense of taste about the underwear they buy, and how they distinguish between the underwear that they need to wear in particular fields; the transmission of their mothers’ cultural capital and taste {{when it comes to their}} choices in underwear; and the relationship between underwear and outerwear, and how they use the former to <b>support</b> their <b>dress</b> within specific fields or contexts they move in and out of in their daily lives.
