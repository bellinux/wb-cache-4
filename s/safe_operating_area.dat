40|$|The {{effects of}} random {{variations}} during {{the manufacturing process}} on devices can be simulated as a variation of transistor parameters. Device degradation, due to temperature or voltage stress, causes a shift of device parameters, for example threshold voltage Vth, which can also be modeled as a degradation of transistor parameters. Therefore, in order to design circuits, which are robust and reliable, analysis and optimization of their sensitivity to variations in model parameters is important. Furthermore, constraints on the operating regions and voltage differences of transistors are used {{in order to keep}} operating points stable over a large temperature range. In this work, using three circuits for automotive applications and current process development kits (PDK), we show how design centering software can be used to consider both sensitivity reduction towards model parameter variation and constraints to control <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>areas</b> (SOA) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} circuit breaker used in DC microgrids {{are required to}} work within their <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>areas</b> bounded by temperature, voltage and current limits.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} discrete design optimization of a complete power electronics converter with the objective to minimize the total component cost. The design constraints are the converter specifications, such a s operating power and voltage ranges, EMI standards, size, and lifetime, {{as well as the}} component <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>areas.</b> The design variables are the switching frequency and the selection of the actual, commercially available components and materials. The genetic algorithm provides for a systematic and efficient search of the databases of preferred components, which contain all (datasheet-based) component parameters that are necessary for evaluating the constraints and objective function. The methodology is illustrated with a developed software tool for designing a low-cost boost power factor correction (PFC) front-end converter with an input EMI filter. Computationally fast and experimentally validated algebraic models of the system and its components, which include second order effects, are considered. A graphical user interface for managing the design specifications and the component databases, controlling and monitoring the optimization process, and analyzing the performance of the best designs is described. The results of a design for a 1. 15 kW unit are presented. Index Terms — Design, optimization, genetic algorithm, boost, PFC, EMI...|$|R

40|$|Exploration {{missions}} to outer planets and deep space require spacecraft, probes, and on-board data and communication systems to operate reliably and efficiently under severe harsh conditions. On-board electronics, in particular those in direct exposures {{to the space}} environment without any shielding or protection, will encounter extreme low temperature and thermal cycling in their service cycle in most of NASA s upcoming exploration missions. For example, Venus atmosphere, Jupiter atmosphere, Moon surface, Pluto orbiter, Mars, comets, Titan, Europa, and James Webb Space Telescope all involve low-temperature surroundings. Therefore, electronics for space exploration missions need to be designed for operation under such environmental conditions. There are ongoing efforts at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) to establish a database on the operation and reliability of electronic devices and circuits under extreme temperature operation for space applications. This work is being performed under the Extreme Temperature Electronics Program with collaboration {{and support of the}} NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Program. The results of these investigations will be used to establish <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>areas</b> and to identify degradation and failure modes, and the information will be disseminated to mission planners and system designers for use as tools for proper part selection and in risk mitigation.

40|$|Fast {{recovery}} diodes, {{though an}} integral part of inverter design, traditionally take a “back seat ” both at the device and equipment design levels where attention tends to focus on the controlled switch. (IGBT, IGCT or GTO). As a result, Snubber, Clamp and above all Free-Wheel Diodes (FWD) remain the Achilles Heel of optimal equipment de-sign. In recognition of this fact, together with the growing trend to eliminate voltage snubbers on diodes, semicon-ductor manufactures are developing new generations of diodes with profiled carrier life-times having enhanced <b>Safe</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Areas</b> (SOA) and controlled (soft) recovery at very high di/dt and dv/dt levels. The growing concern for SOA (ratings) and not just recovery charge or losses (characteristics) imposes new constraints on production test equipment to ensure the cost-effective delivery of robust and reliable components. In contrast to turn-off devices (transistors and GTOs), thyristors and diodes have traditionally been production-tested for their characteristics only and classified accordingly. New generations of high-performance fast diodes must now also be tested for their dy-namic ratings in production. In this paper, the design and application of rugged devices is summarised and new pro-duction test equipment capable of reproducing a wide range of SOA test-conditions is described. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of solid tantalum capacitors {{are produced by}} high-temperature sintering of a fine tantalum powder around a tantalum wire followed by electrolytic anodization that forms a thin amorphous Ta 2 O 5 dielectric layer and pyrolysis of manganese nitrite on the oxide to create a conductive manganese dioxide electrode. A contact to tantalum wire is used as anode terminal and to the manganese layer as a cathode terminal of the device. This process results in formation of an asymmetric Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 [...] MnO 2 capacitor that has different characteristics at forward (positive bias applied to tantalum) and reverse (positive bias applied to manganese cathode) voltages. Reverse bias currents might be several orders of magnitude larger than forward leakage currents so I-V characteristics of tantalum capacitors resemble characteristics of semiconductor rectifiers. Asymmetric I-V characteristics of Ta [...] anodic Ta 2 O 5 systems have been observed at different top electrode materials including metals, electrolytes, conductive polymers, and manganese oxide thus indicating that this phenomenon is likely related to {{the specifics of the}} Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 interface. There have been multiple attempts to explain rectifying characteristics of capacitors employing anodic tantalum pentoxide dielectrics. A brief review of works related to reverse bias (RB) behavior of tantalum capacitors shows that the mechanism of conduction in Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 systems is still not clear and more testing and analysis is necessary to understand the processes involved. If tantalum capacitors behave just as rectifiers, then the assessment of the <b>safe</b> reverse bias <b>operating</b> conditions would be a relatively simple task. Unfortunately, these parts can degrade with time under reverse bias significantly, and this further complicates analysis of the I-V characteristics and establishing <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>areas</b> of the parts. On other hand, time dependence of reverse currents might provide additional information for investigation of the processes under reverse bias conditions. In practice, there were instances when, due to unforeseen events, the system operated at conditions when capacitors experience periodically a relatively small reverse bias for some time followed by normal, forward bias conditions. In such a case an assessment should be made on the degree to which these capacitors are degraded by application of low-voltage reverse bias, and whether this degradation can be reversed by normal operating conditions. In this study, reverse currents in different types of tantalum capacitors were monitored at different reverse voltages below 15 %VR and temperatures in the range from room to 145 C for up to 150 hours to get better understanding of the degradation process and determine conditions favorable to the unstable mode of operation. The reversibility of RB degradation has been evaluated after operation of the capacitors at forward bias conditions. The effect of reverse bias stress (RBS) on reliability at normal operating conditions was evaluated using highly accelerated life testing at voltages of 1. 5 VR and 2 VR and by analysis of changes in distributions of breakdown voltages. Possible mechanisms of RB degradation are discussed...|$|R

This paper is focusing on the <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> condition and lifetime estimation of the p-MOSFET device with regard to NBTI effects. To explore the variation of <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> condition and lifetime estimation, p-MOSFET having EOT 1 nm was systematically simulated by varying the hydrogen species, measurement delay, stress temperature and stress gate voltage. The hydrogen species is varied based on molecular and atomic hydrogen. The measurement delay is simulated based on the measurement delay as found in literature. The stress temperature is varied from 800 C to 1000 C and the stress gate voltage is varied from - 0. 5 V to - 1 V. The simulation result shows that the <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> voltage for molecular hydrogen and atomic hydrogen is almost the same but the device lifetime estimation for molecular hydrogen is less than atomic hydrogen. For higher measurement delay, the lifetime estimation is higher compare to no delay while the <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> voltage estimated for 5 years lifetime shows no significant different. The lifetime estimation for variation of temperature shows that the higher stress temperature contributes to more reduction in the device lifetime.
