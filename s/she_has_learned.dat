5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over the years, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona {{must start}} life anew. When she is 14years old, Callie {{experiences}} a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States {{and becomes a}} midwife of her new life by teaching herself to forget what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> as a female. Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed {{and how it is}} administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.|$|E
5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth Garrow was a {{very good}} girl, but it might almost be a {{question}} whether she was not too good. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned,</b> or thought that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned,</b> that most girls are vapid, silly, and useless,--given chiefly to pleasure-seeking and a hankering after lovers; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> resolved that <b>she</b> would not be such a one.|$|R

25|$|Mrs. Coulter tricks Charles into {{revealing}} {{the secret of}} the knife and kills him.

Mrs. Coulter plans to destroy Lyra rather than risk a second Fall.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Tunstall {{recorded}} {{a song for}} the album Songs for Survival, {{in support of the}} indigenous rights organisation Survival International.

She also discusses various issues concerning our culture of consumption and greed, our relation to the earth and the importance of indigenous rights in the world today.|$|E

25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her back leg. As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to wonder why. One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> far more than she could have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E
25|$|From 2010 to 2016 {{she was one}} of {{the judges}} on BBC One's The Great British Bake Off {{alongside}} baker Paul Hollywood, who specialises in bread. Berry says that since working together, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> from him. However, some viewers were outraged during the first series when a decision was made to make the contestants use one of Hollywood's recipes for scones instead of one of Berry's. Her work on the show with Hollywood has led to The Guardian suggesting that it is the best reality TV judging partnership ever. In September 2016, Love Productions announced that a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4 instead of the BBC from 2017 had been agreed. Co-hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins announced that they would not be continuing with Bake Off on its new network. Berry announced she was also leaving Bake Off on the same day that fellow judge Paul Hollywood announced he would be staying with the show.|$|E

5000|$|Marie's {{practices}} of repeating statements {{to her daughter}} succeeded. Maureen, unconsciously, started taking interest in speaking. First, she became a special educator/ elementary teacher. Then she progressed to teaching college psychology. Finally, she used the speaking skills <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> through teaching and combined them with the skills <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> from her beloved sorority experiences [...] {{to live up to}} Marie’s expectation by becoming an internationally known speaker. Organically, people stopped calling her Maureen and began to call her—MGM, a big production.|$|R

500|$|Egwene {{returns to}} her room to find Verin Mathwin, who announces that she is of the Black Ajah. Taking {{advantage}} of a loophole in the oath Verin had sworn {{that she could not}} betray them [...] "until the hour of my death", she fatally poisons herself, allowing her to use her last hour to reveal everything <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> to Egwene. Verin explains that although she was forced to swear to them or face death, she used the position to research the Ajah. She gives Egwene a journal detailing the group's structure and nearly every member before succumbing to the poison.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn also {{returned}} to the stage in 1981. She received a second Tony nomination for her portrayal in The West Side Waltz of a septuagenarian widow with a zest for life. Variety observed that the role was [...] "an obvious and entirely acceptable version of [...] own public image." [...] Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote of Hepburn and her performance, [...] "One mysterious thing <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines." [...] She hoped {{to make a film}} out of the production, but nobody purchased the rights. Hepburn's reputation as one of America's best loved actors was firmly established by this point, as she was named favorite movie actress in a survey by People magazine and again won the popularity award from People's Choice.|$|E
500|$|Everyone {{is pleased}} to welcome the new {{neighbours}} at first, but things soon get out of control. [...] The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything (especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution). Then, after a confrontation with them at a picnic ("Get a Lot") Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears; they soon abuse the star's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear, a mud pie for Messy Bear, and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear. [...] Once the new bears finally realise their problem, they try to fix it with more wishes, but to no availCare-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing {{that all of this}} was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for everything to be back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for everything to be like it used to be). [...] When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard). [...] Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.|$|E

2500|$|Michael {{does not}} write back or visit but {{continues}} simply sending tapes, and in 1988 a prison official (Linda Bassett) telephones him to seek his help with Hanna's transition into society after her upcoming early release due to good behavior. He finds {{a place for}} her to live and a job and finally visits Hanna a week before her release. In their meeting, Michael remains somewhat distant and confronts her about what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> from her past, to which she replies [...] "It doesn't matter what I feel. It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead.", seemingly disappointing him. Michael arrives at the prison on the date of Hanna's release with flowers {{only to discover that}} Hanna hanged herself. She has left a tea tin with cash in it with a note asking Michael to give the cash and money in a bank account to Ilana. He discovers that she killed herself out of guilt after reading Ilana's memoir of her horrifying experience in the concentration camp.|$|E
2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and when they come back up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E
