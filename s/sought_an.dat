5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph. The central figure in the college's {{incorporation}} was Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence, who <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> institution that would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island.|$|E
5|$|Two of the University of South Carolina {{fraternity}} {{brothers who}} appeared in the film, Justin Seay and Christopher Rotunda, sued the producers, claiming defamation. The suit by Seay and Rotunda was dismissed in February 2007. The students had also <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> injunction to prevent the DVD release of the film, which was denied.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> investigation into the 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E

5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made police brutality and excessive force {{an issue in}} the campaign. He <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> independent citizens' review of the police department. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago. After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned whether there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Burnett <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> audience with President Andrew Johnson, an old congressional colleague, but Johnson told him to go home. Burnett was indicted for treason at Louisville, but released on bond and never prosecuted. He partnered with Judge John R. Grace and resumed the practice of law in Cadiz. He died of cholera in Hopkinsville on September 28, 1866. Initially buried in the Old Cadiz Cemetery, he was moved to the East End Cemetery in Cadiz. His tombstone bears no mention of his Confederate service.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian writer Farley Mowat {{says that}} many {{returned}} veterans after World War II <b>sought</b> <b>a</b> meaningful life {{far from the}} ignobility of modern warfare, regarding his own experience as typical of the pattern.

5|$|In 1982, Shaw {{was chosen}} for the small but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father. Since the scene was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, the casting crew <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> experienced actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E
5|$|Patton never seriously {{considered}} a career {{other than the}} military. At the age of seventeen he <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the United States Military Academy. Patton applied to several universities with Reserve Officer's Training Corps programs. Patton was accepted to Princeton College but eventually decided on VMI, which {{his father and grandfather}} had attended. He attended the school from 1903 to 1904 and, though he struggled with reading and writing, performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection as well as military drill. While Patton was at VMI, California's Senator nominated him for West Point.|$|E
50|$|The Gregoire {{campaign}} had <b>sought</b> <b>a</b> sixth debate in Tacoma, {{sponsored by the}} Tacoma News-Tribune.

50|$|On March 29, 2004, IBM amended its counterclaims again. It dropped one of {{the patent}} {{infringement}} claims, but added two new Declaratory judgments of Noninfringement of Copyrights.

5|$|Stephenson was well-connected, and {{received}} letters from prominent people, including Jefferson Davis in 1834. That same year, Stephenson {{was elected to}} his first public office, the Illinois State Senate, after which he <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the Land Office in Galena. From December 1834 until April 1835 Stephenson was absent from Galena. He spent time in St. Louis, where he married Ellen Kyle in December, then traveled on to Edwardsville and Vandalia, Illinois; the couple eventually had two children. In April 1835 the couple returned to Galena where James took office as Register of Lands at Galena and Chicago, and they lived an elegant lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scientology <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> {{injunction}} and {{a restraining}} order to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous. Both the injunction and the restraining order were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with disturbing an assembly of worship, disturbing the peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E
5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{sought to}} build an {{interlocking}} series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries {{as a means of}} deterring Hitler from war. He <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> agreement among Britain, France, the USSR and Poland whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail. Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of British and French guarantees that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence. In the ensuing debate Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government. Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{never again}} <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> elected office after his defeat by Morton, though he {{remained}} active in state politics {{and continued to}} lead the anti-Chandler faction of his party. From 1957 to 1959, {{at the insistence of}} Lyndon Johnson, he served {{as executive director of the}} United States Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and helped ensure the election of a fourteen-seat Democratic majority in the Senate. He considered running for governor again in 1959, but ultimately decided against it. Without Clements in the race, the anti-Chandler faction was unable to unite behind either former candidate Bert T. Combs or former Louisville mayor Wilson Wyatt. Clements united the faction behind Combs, making Wilson Wyatt their candidate for lieutenant governor and promising him support for later races. Combs defeated the Chandler candidate, Harry Lee Waterfield in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election.|$|E
5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, <b>sought</b> <b>an</b> alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what {{was meant to be}} a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
