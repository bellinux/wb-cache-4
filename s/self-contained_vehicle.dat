TREAT can operate at a steady state power of 100 kW, produce short transients of up to 19 GW, or produce shaped transients controlled by the TREAT automatic reactor control system and the Control Rods. A test assembly can be inserted in the center of the core. The test assembly is a <b>self-contained</b> <b>vehicle,</b> that can contain fuel or materials for a variety of reactor types. These test assemblies, also referred to as test vehicles or test loops, can simulate the conditions of a light water reactor, heavy water reactor, liquid metal fast breeder reactor, or a gas cooled reactor.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, NZR sought {{a means of}} {{providing}} economic services on lowly trafficked services including some suburban routes {{and to provide a}} faster alternative to mixed trains on rural lines. It aimed to develop a light and <b>self-contained</b> <b>vehicle</b> that could operate economically even with low passenger levels. [...] The first true railcar, the MacEwan Pratt petrol railcar of 1912, did not pass its tests and never entered revenue service. It was followed by the Westinghouse railcar in 1914, which did enter revenue service but proved unreliable. [...] Accordingly, in 1916, NZR developed its third railcar, the Thomas Transmission railcar. It was classified as RM 2; the Westinghouse railcar had previously re-used the MacEwan-Pratt railcar's classification of RM 1.|$|E

50|$|Slowly 2nd {{generation}} Pinzgauers, the 716 and 718 models, are {{appearing on}} the retail market in various states and conditions. The government of Malaysia has retired its Pinzgauer fleet of P90 and P93, which vary in date of manufacture from 1996 to as late as 1998. UK army surplus vehicles tend to be in poor condition, most having served in Afghanistan or Iraq. Good vehicles are quickly bought by collectors and a small number may be turned into <b>self-contained</b> expedition <b>vehicles,</b> the Pinzgauer {{being one of the}} very few vehicles of its size that can successfully be made 'self-contained' due to its forward control cab and large load area.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis was to design, construct and develop the initial autonomous control algorithm for the NPS Planar Autonomous Docking Simulator (NPADS). The effort included hardware design, fabrication, installation and integration; mass property determination; and the development and testing of control laws utilizing MATLAB and Simulink for modeling and LabView for NPADS control. The NPADS vehicle uses air pads and a granite table to simulate a 2 -D, drag-free, zero-g space environment. It is a completely <b>self-contained</b> <b>vehicle</b> equipped with eight cold-gas, bang-bang type thrusters and a reaction wheel for motion control. A "star sensor" CCD camera locates the vehicle on the table while a color CCD docking camera and two robotic arms will locate and dock with a target vehicle. The on-board computer system leverages PXI technology and a single source, simplifying systems integration. The vehicle is powered by two lead-acid batteries for completely autonomous operation. A graphical user interface and wireless Ethernet enable the user to command and monitor the vehicle from a remote command and data acquisition computer. Two control algorithms were developed and allow the user to either control the thrusters and reaction wheel manually or simply specify a desired location.

40|$|The Mobile Mapping System (MMS) is a {{completely}} <b>self-contained</b> <b>vehicle</b> with omnidirectional capability and extremely good odometry, capable of operation up to 12 hours between battery charges. The platform itself {{is based on a}} dual differential drive system with a compliant linkage between the two drive systems. This compliant linkage allows for low-level controller errors to be absorbed by the system and their navigational effects to be compensated for, yielding an extremely accurate navigational capability. Vehicle design also allows for a considerable payload (250 lb) and a large surface area for auxiliary equipment mounting (2 by 6 ft). The vehicle supports remote operation by reading commands and writing replies through its serial communications port. Use of a radio-ethernet and a radio-video channel allow for remote video and communications links to be maintained with the vehicle in many remote operation environments. The MMS uses a structured light system to quickly acquire coarse range images of the environment and a coherent laser radar (CLR) to acquire finer resolution range images. The coherent laser radar {{can also be used to}} determine platform position and orientation to millimeter accuracies if targets of known. Sensor range image data as well as video are off loaded to a remote computer for postprocessing, display, and archiving. Diagrams and images below include an image of the MMS vehicle before addition of sensors, diagram of vehicle with sensors, and computer system connections...|$|E

This paper systematically proposes a versatile strategy for <b>self-contained</b> land <b>vehicle</b> navigation using the IMU and an odometer. Specifically, the paper proposes a self-calibration and refinement method for IMU/odometer integration that is able to overcome significant variation of the misalignment parameters, which are induced by many inevitable and adverse factors such as load changing, refueling and ambient temperature. An odometer-aided IMU in-motion alignment algorithm is also devised that enables the first-responsive functionality even when the vehicle is running freely. The versatile strategy is successfully demonstrated and verified via long-distance real tests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel indoor navigation and ranging strategy via monocular camera. By exploiting the architectural orthogonality of the indoor environments, we {{introduce a new}} method to estimate range and vehicle states from a monocular camera for vision-based SLAM. The navigation strategy assumes an indoor or indoor-like manmade environment whose layout is previously unknown, GPS-denied, representable via energy based feature points, and straight architectural lines. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithms on a fully <b>self-contained</b> microaerial <b>vehicle</b> (MAV) with sophisticated on-board image processing and SLAM capabilities. Building and enabling such a small aerial vehicle to fly in tight corridors is a significant technological challenge, especially {{in the absence of}} GPS signals and with limited sensing options.

50|$|The {{original}} {{strengths of}} railways—a fixed track, multiple vehicle passenger trains, highly structured and staffed stations—had limitations {{in responding to}} changing needs. The London and South Western Railway had successfully operated a railmotor, consisting of a <b>self-contained</b> passenger <b>vehicle</b> with its own steam power unit, on its Southsea Railway, and the Great Western Railway arranged to borrow one unit for trials on its Golden Valley Line in Gloucestershire. The trial proved successful and a steam rail motor was designed by the Chief Mechanical Engineer George Jackson Churchward. Two units were manufactured, and they entered service on the same route on 12 October 1903. A further 44 were built during 1904 and 1905 {{and by the time}} production finished in 1908 the fleet numbered 99 carriage units. There were 112 power units which could be changed between carriages to suit maintenance needs.|$|R

While throw-weight may refer to any type of warhead, in normal modern usage it almost exclusively refers to nuclear or thermonuclear payloads. It was once also a consideration in the design of naval ships and the number/size of guns they carried.|$|R
40|$|Most explorers on Mars {{will seek}} to travel {{considerable}} distances away from a base habitat. A large, <b>self-contained</b> pressurized <b>vehicle</b> with accommodations for three was used in field trials of the exploration strategy developed {{over the course of}} a Mars analog mission. The first 5 -day Mars-analog pressurized rover mission was conducted to compare the science return and the amount of territory explored. Results suggest that without improved exploration strategies, during a long surface stay on Mars of about 560 days, only 40 sites selected from 100 areas scouted could be studied thoroughly. Spacing of these sites within a few kilometres defines a minimum exploration circle of about 80 km in diameter. Mission architectures calling for ranging up to 500 km with rovers are pessimistic in estimating how sparse features of interest would be, while optimistic about how much territory could be studied within the span of a single expedition. Future rover investigations will define the time-limited operational constraints on scientific exploration...|$|R

Experimental results show that the system is only limited by the capabilities of the camera and the availability of good corners...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{testing is}} an {{important}} aspect of validating complex integrated safety critical aircraft technologies. The Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research (AirSTAR) Testbed is being developed at NASA Langley to validate technologies under conditions that cannot be flight validated with full-scale vehicles. The AirSTAR capability comprises a series of flying sub-scale models, associated ground-support equipment, and a base research station at NASA Langley. The subscale model capability utilizes a generic 5. 5 % scaled transport class vehicle known as the Generic Transport Model (GTM). The AirSTAR Ground Facilities encompass the hardware and software infrastructure necessary to provide comprehensive support services for the GTM testbed. The ground facilities support remote piloting of the GTM aircraft, and include all subsystems required for data/video telemetry, experimental flight control algorithm implementation and evaluation, GTM simulation, data recording/archiving, and audio communications. The ground facilities include a <b>self-contained,</b> motorized <b>vehicle</b> serving as a mobile research command/operations center, capable of deployment to remote sites when conducting GTM flight experiments.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research (AirSTAR) project, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) has {{developed}} a subscaled flying testbed in order to conduct research experiments {{in support of the}} goals of NASA s Aviation Safety Program. This research capability consists of three distinct components. The first of these is the research aircraft, of which there are several in the AirSTAR stable. These aircraft range from a dynamically-scaled, twin turbine vehicle to a propeller driven, off-the-shelf airframe. Each of these airframes carves out its own niche in the research test program. All of the airplanes have sophisticated on-board data acquisition and actuation systems, recording, telemetering, processing, and/or receiving data from research control systems. The second piece of the testbed is the ground facilities, which encompass the hardware and software infrastructure necessary to provide comprehensive support services for conducting flight research using the subscale aircraft, including: subsystem development, integrated testing, remote piloting of the subscale aircraft, telemetry processing, experimental flight control law implementation and evaluation, flight simulation, data recording/archiving, and communications. The ground facilities are comprised of two major components: (1) The Base Research Station (BRS), a LaRC laboratory facility for system development, testing and data analysis, and (2) The Mobile Operations Station (MOS), a <b>self-contained,</b> motorized <b>vehicle</b> serving as a mobile research command/operations center, functionally equivalent to the BRS, capable of deployment to remote sites for supporting flight tests. The third piece of the testbed is the test facility itself. Research flights carried out by the AirSTAR team are conducted at NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. The UAV Island runway is a 50 x 1500 paved runway that lies within restricted airspace at Wallops Flight Facility. The facility provides all the necessary infrastructure to conduct the research flights in a safe and efficient manner.

40|$|A {{potentially}} drastic {{reduction in}} law enforcement engagement with citizens is an often overlooked outcome of self-driving vehicles, as the focus remains steadily on highway safety and efficiency of traffic flow. Many of the safety benefits reaped as humans are {{taken out of the}} second-by-second decision-making equation of driving will also eliminate traffic violations; as vehicles become increasingly automated, the number of traffic violations will continually decrease. At the point where vehicles are driverless, it appears that the necessity of traffic-related stops could become moot altogether. Between now and then, however, there will be questions raised every step of the way, with answers that are likely to change as quickly as the modifications in the technology. Criminal liability issues in particular will arise in two ways—a legislative need for the actual rules of the road to change and a judicial response regarding the enforcement of those laws. The majority of the answers sought depend on more detailed specifications of the technologies to be used, as well as infrastructure plans for <b>self-contained</b> and interconnected <b>vehicles,</b> but the areas to be impacted are easily identifiable. This Article will focus on the criminal liability aspects of automated vehicles, beginning with impacts on the traffic codes that are expected (and in some cases, have already begun). The heart of the discussion will be in the judicial response category, examining the privacy protections around the digital information created by the car itself. The conclusion will identify possible courses of action for both government entities and manufacturers of these vehicles as they establish the parameters in which the vehicles operate...|$|R
