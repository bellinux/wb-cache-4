40|$|Subsampling is {{a common}} method for {{estimating}} the abundance of species in trawl catches. However, the accuracy of subsampling in representing the total catch has not been assessed. To estimate one possible source of bias due to subsampling, we tested whether the position on trawler sorting trays from which subsamples were taken affected their ability to represent species in catches. This was done by sorting catches into 10 kg subsamples and comparing subsamples taken from different positions on the <b>sorting</b> <b>tray.</b> Comparisons were made after species were grouped into three categories of abundance, either 'rare', 'common' or 'abundant'. A generalised linear model analysis showed that taking subsamples from different positions on the <b>sorting</b> <b>tray</b> had no major effect on estimating the total numbers or weights of fish or invertebrates, or {{the total number of}} fish or invertebrate taxa, recorded in each position. Some individual taxa showed differences between positions on the <b>sorting</b> <b>tray</b> (11. 5 % of taxa ina three-position design; 25 % in a five-position design). But consistent and meaningful patterns in the position of these taxa on the <b>sorting</b> <b>tray</b> could only be seen for the pony fish Leiognathus moretoniensis and the saucer scallop Amusium pleuronectes. Because most bycatch laxa are well mixed throughout the catch, subsamples can be taken from any position on trawler sorting trays without introducing bias...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for changes to onboard handling practices {{in order to}} improve the fate of juvenile school prawns (Metapenaeus macleayi) discarded during trawling were investigated in two Australian rivers (Clarence and Hunter) by comparing a purpose-built, water-filled <b>sorting</b> <b>tray</b> against a conventional dry tray across various conditions, including the range of typical delays before the start of sorting the catch (2 min vs. 15 min). Juvenile school prawns (n= 5760), caught during 32 and 16 deployments in each river, were caged and sacrificed at four times: immediately (T 0), and at 24 (T 24), 72 (T 72), and 120 (T 12 0) hours after having been discarded. In both rivers, most mortalities occurred between T 0 and T 24 and, after adjusting for control deaths (< 12...|$|E

60|$|Hoisting {{gear and}} rope had been {{prepared}} on the first day, in case it should be necessary to lower any one, for the wire rope had snapped when the attempt {{had been made to}} draw up the cage after the second explosion, and the sudden release from the strain had caused the engine to fly round, breaking some gear, and for the time disabling it from further work. A hundred and forty fathoms of rope, the depth of the shaft being a hundred and twenty, {{had been prepared}}, and was in readiness to be passed over a pulley suspended above the shaft. A lighted candle in a candlestick was placed on a <b>sort</b> of <b>tray,</b> which was fastened to the rope, and then it was lowered gradually down. Eagerly those above watched it as it descended--down--down, till it became a mere speck below. Then it suddenly disappeared.|$|R
40|$|Crayfish farmers {{reported}} reduced {{tolerance of}} stress in specimens of Cherax quadricarinatus, which were formerly robust crayfish. Furthermore, one farmer reported a large reduction in yield with final harvest only equaling the stocking weight. Upon trapping, one-third of the crayfish regularly died overnight and a further one-third died on the <b>sorting</b> <b>tray</b> during sexing of juveniles (~ 3 mo old). Histopathological examination revealed very light (1 or 2 cells per section) infections with Cherax giardiavirus and sometimes mild atrophy of hepatopancreatic cells. Gene probe analysis with a DIG-labeled spawner-isolated mortality virus (SMV) probe demonstrated extensive positive signals in nuclei of many tissues. The hepatopancreas, the midgut, glands associated with the midgut, the epithelium of seminal ducts and follicle cells surrounding oocytes gave the strongest positive signals. Nuclei of the heart, haemocytes, connective tissue and subcutis gave positive signals in some individuals. Although signals were intense and extensive, cytolysis of infected cells was very limited. The possibility of cross infections of SMV between prawns and freshwater crayfish is of international quarantine significance...|$|E
40|$|The minimum sieve {{mesh size}} for fossil chironomid {{analysis}} is usually set at 100 mu m, to ensure adequate recovery of small species. Yet {{taking into account}} the labor intensity of sorting and identifying fossil chironomid remains, the large numbers of samples requiring processing in paleoclimate studies with high temporal resolution, and the increasing need to engage non-specialist analysts in this work, it seems appealing to sieve samples through a larger mesh size that would mainly retain easier-to-see, easier-to-extract and easier-to-identify fossil specimens. In this study we evaluated the influence of sieve mesh size on chironomid-based quantitative paleoenvironmental reconstructions in African lakes. We developed two chironomid-salinity calibration data sets based on either the > 100 mu m or > 150 mu m size fractions of surface-sediment fossil assemblages, and compared the performance of salinity-inference models derived from them. We find that, despite similar to 35 % additional fossil loss, restriction to > 150 mu m data did not appreciably affect individual taxon optima or tolerances, and resulted in only a modest reduction of mean taxon richness per lake. Parameters of statistical model performance were as good, or better than those of models based on the > 100 mu m data, albeit only after excluding two atypically dilute (150 mu m or > 100 mu m data to a 200 -year fossil record from Lake Abiyata, Ethiopia, produced very similar trends, amplitudes and uncertainty ranges of inferred past salinity change. Restriction to > 150 mu m data reduced the mean fossil yield of core samples by similar to 20 % on average, i. e. fossil loss was markedly lower than in surface-sediment samples. Using the larger mesh size reduced sample processing time by up to 50 %, partly by removing a significant proportion of visually obstructive organic debris, and partly by allowing a greater fraction of chironomid fossils to be identified directly in the <b>sorting</b> <b>tray.</b> The fraction of 1 st instar group taxa in surface-sediment samples was reduced from 13 % to 3 %, increasing the mean taxonomic resolution of fossil assemblages, and thus their ecological specificity...|$|E

The bookstacks use two classification systems: the Yale Library system and the Library of Congress system. Adopted in the 1890s, the non-standard Yale system became cumbersome and inefficient for cataloging. Though replaced in 1970 by the Library of Congress system, many of the 5.7 million volumes held by the library at that time remain filed in the Yale system.

40|$|The Multimedia Thesaurus is {{a playful}} tool for {{exploring}} sound and its latent and potential correlations with space, light, colour, image and movement. Its design is aimed to stimulate critical discourse about sound and multimedia, and to facilitate discussion between potential collaborators {{who may not}} share the same terminology, background experience or conceptual framework for describing sounds and music. Participants explore collections of very short sound and image files through the manipulation of physical objects linked to the files through barcodes. The sounds and images are sorted according to their perceived salient characteristics, whether relating to mood, association, or parameters of the audio signal itself. Each has an associated database entry in the computer with various types of information, updated at each “sorting”. Although the main format of the tool is a room-size installation, the MMT Travel Kit is a portable prototype, where the objects can be <b>sorted</b> into <b>trays</b> and/or on trees by colour, keywords, or diagrams. For this demonstration, most of the clips will be drawn from contemporary electroacoustic and computer music compositions, including the FreeSound collection [4] and works by composers associated with the project...|$|R
60|$|When {{dinner was}} done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and words made me {{understand}} the concern {{he was in}} that I had nothing to eat. Oats in their tongue are called hlunnh. This word I pronounced two or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own species. The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a <b>sort</b> of wooden <b>tray.</b> These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain. I ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk. It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough {{in many parts of}} Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to hard fare in my life, {{this was not the first}} experiment I had made how easily nature is satisfied. And I cannot but observe, that I never had one hours sickness while I stayed in this island. It is true, I sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of Yahoo’s hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled, and ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a little butter, and drank the whey. I was at first at a great loss for salt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was first introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from great markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.|$|R
40|$|Select {{at random}} {{an issue of}} American Antiquity from the past 15 years. Chances are good that you will find at least one article or report in the table of {{contents}} {{that focuses on the}} archaeology of California. Recent research in the Golden State and adjacent regions has been highly influential in two main areas: the archaeology of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and innovative historic archaeology brought to bear on the past few centuries. One might argue that the specialists in the historic period of California have been truly at the forefront of general anthropological and archaeological theory, while those focused on precontact California have been relatively satisfied with a long-cherished and comfortable package of theory that leans heavily—as hunter-gatherer archaeology nearly always does—on cultural ecology and behavioral ecology. While some archaeologists grumble that they do not need any stinking theory for their job at hand, the truth is that every time we load up the field gear in the truck, <b>sort</b> through a <b>tray</b> of artifacts in the lab, write up that overdue report, or critique someone else’s work, we are using archaeological theory. As many have pointed out, everything we think or do with regard to archaeology is based on theoretical assumptions and models. The point of this is to stress the importance of Orderly Anarchy: Sociopolitical Evolution in Aboriginal California, by Robert L. Bettinger. This work promises to be a catalyst for California archaeology and ethnography for decades to come. Most California archaeologists will find that whatever problems they are working on will fit squarely into what Bettinger writes about in this book. He brings together nearly all of the topics over which California specialists grapple under a single theoretical model, and this is perhaps unprecedented. In response, the journal California Archaeology hereby establishes its own new practice, its first book review forum. This format provides a more thorough consideration of the significance and impact of Bettinger’s book than would be possible with a single review. Four reviewers, including three California specialists and one from the Northwest Coast, share their reactions to the book. Their comments, insights, praises, and critiques indicate that Orderly Anarchy is likely to spur on additional creative thinking and research among California specialists, and that much of this will be conducted within a context of explicit and diverse general anthropological and archaeological theory.
