40|$|ABSTRACT The {{available}} research {{concerning the}} processing of grass seeds is scarce, despite its fundamental importance for national and international agribusiness. The objective of this project was to evaluate the effects of processing phases on the physical and physiological quality of tanzania grass seeds for commercialization purposes. Seeds were sampled before processing and after leaving the air and screen machine (upper and intermediate screens and bottom); first gravity table (drift, upper and intermediate spouts); treating machine; second gravity table (upper, intermediate, and lower spouts). Seeds were evaluated as to water content, physical quality (purity and 1, 000 seeds weight) and physiological (germination, first count of germination, seedling vigor rating, seedlings length of primary roots and shoots, seedling emergence in the field, and emergence speed index). The processing of Tanzania grass seeds in the air <b>screen</b> <b>cleaner</b> machine and gravity table are efficient to improve the physical quality of the lot. The seed treatment with dye ink reduces the seedlings emergence speed in the field.

An international release of these versions was announced on January 21, 2016, by the publisher, PQube. The company promised the game would be uncensored from the original Japanese product, remaining completely intact, a rarity for a game of this subject matter. The game was widely available in various chains throughout Europe, but North America saw a limited release, exclusive to VGP.ca for Canada and Amazon.com for the United States. Rice Digital primarily handled the British sale, offering both a standard edition and a collectors edition, titled the Mr Happiness edition. This set includes a wall scroll, artbook, soundtrack, bonus downloadable content, and a <b>screen</b> <b>cleaner</b> {{in the shape of}} female undergarments. Rice also offered the North American version of the game. Conversely, the Canadian distribution was handled by Video Games Plus. VGP offered standard copies as well as an exclusive edition of their own, dubbed the 'launch edition'. This included a copy of the game alongside an artbook. Rice charged $50 for the Vita edition, while asking $65 for the PlayStation 4 version. The Mr Happiness limited edition cost either $95 or $100, dependent on platform. VGP asked similar prices for the standard set, while asking an additional $10 for the launch edition. Amazon only sold the standard editions.|$|R

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project was to reduce the {{aflatoxin}} level in the final coproduct of ethanol bioprocessing [...] DDGS. This was pursued by examining the effects of reduction of aflatoxin in the incoming corn prior to bioprocessing, the degradation of aflatoxin in the intermediate products, namely DWG and CDS, during processing, and aflatoxin degradation in the DDGS. Segregation techniques (size screening and density sorting) and detoxification methods (conventional and microwave heating, food additives, and high voltage atmospheric cold plasma) were evaluated for their effectiveness in aflatoxin reduction. ^ Effectiveness of physical segregation of aflatoxin contaminated corn was investigated by size screening and density sorting in a 737 kg corn lot with an aflatoxin level of 185 ppb. There are statistically significant differences in major and minor diameters, the sphericities and the densities between moldy and healthy corn kernels. The moldy corn kernels had a smaller major diameter, greater sphericity and a lower density. Results indicated that removal of fine material from the corn lot through size screening could significantly reduce aflatoxin in the remaining lot. Further removal of small size kernels through cleaning with a <b>screen</b> <b>cleaner</b> and removal of lower density kernels with a gravity table gave an additional reduction of aflatoxin in the remaining corn lot. ^ Reductions of aflatoxin achieved by conventional heating (using a convection oven and water bath) and microwave heating to degrade the aflatoxin were also investigated. The presence of water is critical to aflatoxin degradation during heating. Aflatoxin is very stable during dry heating and a temperature of 150 ºC is required to initiate decomposition of aflatoxin. HPLC-MS studies revealed that aflatoxin B 1 was converted into its enantiomer by dry heating. During wet heating for 1 h at 80 °C, 73...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical pulping, {{also called}} high-yield pulping processes, are pulping systems where {{a great deal}} of effort is taken with regards to the {{fractionation}} in <b>screens</b> and <b>cleaners</b> as well as to optimize process conditions to refine the rejected fractions. The fraction that is rejected for further treatment can vary from 10 to 50 % depending on process strategy and final product which can be from printing paper, writing paper, paperboard middle layer and tissue. In practice, it is common that approximately 10 % of the pulp fibres and also {{a large part of the}} fines fraction have properties that are unsatisfactory in relation to the final products. Part of the less useful fines fraction could instead be used to produce nano-ligno-cellulose (NLC) of high value either in the main product or used for completely different purposes. In order to study the potential of this concept, treatment of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) fines fractions were studied by means of homogenization. It seems possible to homogenize fine particles of thermo-mechanical pulp (1 % w/v) to NLC. A corresponding fines fraction from bleached kraft pulp (BKP) was tested as a reference at 0. 5 % w/v concentration. This fines (BKP) fraction was very difficult to homogenize at a higher concentration (1 % w/v). An explanation for this could be that the BKP fines have much higher cellulose content and lower charge level compared to the fines fraction of the hemicellulose and lignin-rich TMP. Fibre length-weighteddistribution plays a vital role with respect to both pressure fluctuations and clogging during treatment in the homogenizing equipment. ...|$|R
40|$|Stock {{preparation}} {{systems for}} recycled papers {{need to be}} designed to produce a high quality, uniform product from a source that has significantly varying properties.

The contaminant concentration is expressed as a function of both particle size and density of the contaminant. Finally, the separation efficiency of the processing steps also becomes a function of fiber and contaminant distributions. Ultimately, these models are used to determine the efficiency of various stock preparation systems with differing configurations of the <b>cleaners,</b> <b>screens,</b> washing, and other operations.

40|$|Accomplishments in 2001 [...] 2002 were spotty {{and limited}} due {{primarily}} to right-of-way problems at several sites and unanticipated changes in scope at some sites. Changes in BPA funding procedures have also impacted {{our ability to}} accomplish previously scheduled work. The following is a brief summary of work accomplished and scheduled at the remaining Phase II sites. (1) Selah-Moxee Fish Screen [...] Construction at this site was started in October 2001 and was completed in March 2002. We have settled the contractor claims and have closed out the construction contract. The O&M Agreement with the irrigation district was also completed in 2002. Work remains to complete the Designer's Operating Criteria. (2) Scott Fish Screen [...] Considerable effort was spent in 2001 and 2002 to try to resolve right-of-way issues at this site. However, these problems proved to be insurmountable, and this site has been dropped from the Phase n Program. The only thing remaining on Scott (as far as the Phase n program is concerned) is to prepare a brief wrap-up report to send to all interested parties to summarize {{what has been done}} and to explain the status of the diversion from a fish passage standpoint. (3) Packwood Fish Screen [...] Designs and specifications for the civil works were completed for this screen in 2002. The <b>screen,</b> <b>screen</b> <b>cleaner,</b> and other metal work have already been fabricated by WDFW Screen Shop. Award of a construction contract was scheduled for September 2002. The BP A lands staff has experienced significant delays in obtaining an easement from the state of Washington for a piece of the John Wayne Trail right-of-way currently occupied by the existing screen. As a result, the construction contract has been rescheduled for award in the fall of 2003. We are ready to proceed with construction if BP A can obtain the necessary easements by May 2003. (4) Fogarty Fish Screen [...] We opened bids on this site in August, 2002. There was only one responsive bidder and the bid was nearly double our engineer's estimate. We canceled that solicitation, revised the specifications to eliminate some poorly defined work items and reissued the solicitation. We intended to award the revised contract in October 2002. In September 2002 {{at the request of the}} Technical Work Group (TWG), we canceled the revised Fogarty solicitation prior to bid opening. A new plan is being formulated by others to relocate the screen further down the ditch and to add other features to make the ditch more fish friendly for rearing. As a result of these significant changes in scope, this site has been dropped from the Phase n program. (5) Tjossem Fish Screen [...] We intended to complete predesign and design work at this site in FY 2002 in anticipation of awarding a construction contract in the fall of 2003. However, the project has been delayed due to a proposal by TWO members to use the ditch for off channel rearing. The proposal would require relocation and redesign of the fish screen. Essentially no progress was made on screen design due to lack of a defined plan for use of the ditch for off-channel rearing. We are gathering additional data to help TWO members define the plan. If a plan can be formulated soon, it may be possible to build this screen in the fall of 2003. However, the changes in scope and timing for this project may result in the site being dropped from the Phase n program to be picked up by the Yakima Side Channels, YTAHP, or another program. (6) Naches-Cowiche Screen Bypass Outfall Mods [...] We have an on-going serious problem with bedload deposition in front of the Naches-Cowiche screen (an early Phase n site) bypass outfall. A fix at this site is beyond the scope of routine maintenance activities. As soon as our FY 2003 funding amendment is approved, we will get an experienced river morphologist on-site to develop a conceptual plan which might include a rock weir, barbs, jetties, or other measures to correct the situation. We plan to implement this fix during the in-water work period in the summer of 2002...|$|R
40|$|Background: The role of Papanicolaou (Pap) test in {{cervical}} cancer screening {{need not be}} overemphasized. While most Western countries have adopted the liquid-based cytology (LBC), which is considered superior, many developing countries are still using the conventional Pap smear (CPS) technique. Objective: To compare the staining and cytomorphological features on conventional versus liquid-based cervicovaginal smears. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty cervicovaginal smears prepared by the standard conventional and LBC techniques were interpreted as per the Bethesda system of reporting cervicovaginal smears. Twelve parameters were studied, compared, and statistically analyzed. A P value < 0. 05 {{was considered to be}} statistically significant. Results: 129 / 140 (92 %) of CPSs and 130 / 140 (93 %) LBC smears were satisfactory. LBC had a significantly shorter screening time (2. 0 ± 0. 08 vs 4. 0 ± 0. 65) and better representative material than that of CPS (50 % vs 42 %). Neutrophils were significantly more in CPS than LBC (96 % vs 92 %) with a P value < 0. 05 while hemorrhagic background and red blood cells (RBCs) were more prominent in CPS. LBC showed significant artifactual changes in squamous epithelial cells. Epithelial abnormalities ranging from atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) to high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were seen in 3 % (4) and 2 % (2) of CPSs and LBCs, respectively. Organisms were better picked up in CPS (99 % in CPS vs 73 % LBC) with a value of P = 0. 0001. Conclusion: Although a shorter <b>screening</b> time and <b>cleaner</b> background are the major advantages of LBC, CPS is not inferior to LBC. Considering the high cost, rather than the advantages associated with LBC, we feel that CPS is a better option for developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 Laser {{printers}} {{and copy}} machines produce an increasing quantity of difficult-to-recycle paper. In {{the last several}} years, {{the need for an}} effective process to de-ink the toner has prompted a number of facilities to try toner agglomeration. The method requires the use of small amounts of an appropriate oil which serves to collect the toner into agglomerates that can be removed from paper fibers by <b>screens</b> or centrifugal <b>cleaners.</b> The technique shows promise by being simple, economical, and often very effective; however, it currently requires high-temperature and performs inconsistently, preventing significant use. A fundamental study of agglomeration is needed to determine how it operates, the key variables and their interactions. Therefore, the present study provides a fundamental understanding of agglomeration, laying the groundwork for process enhancement. We identify the key factors in agglomeration: concentration of cationic starch released from sheets in the repulper, oil composition, agitation rate, time and temperature. Furthermore, we examine how and why each factor influences agglomeration, and a population balance model is developed to help determine the quantitative relationships between the key variables. Cationic starch adsorbs to toner and oil interfaces, rendering them electrosterically stable to coalescence, thus preventing oil drops from reaching toner particle surfaces. However, when the oil contains an oil-soluble surfactant, the cationic starch adlayer is engulfed and some agglomeration resumes. Direct and novel use of the atomic force microscope provides insight into the cationic starch-induced reduction in oil-toner collision efficiency. Agitation rate and temperature influence the particle breakup rate, the latter by increasing aggregate strength by fusing toners above 35 ∘C. The model effectively predicts the experimental results, and shows how the competition between aggregate growth and breakup determines both the rate and degree of agglomeration. The results yield the agglomeration mechanism, quantitative expressions relating key variables and performance, and practical suggestions...|$|R
