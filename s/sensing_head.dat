5000|$|Capacitance probe, or fringe {{capacitance}} sensor. Capacitance probes use capacitance {{to measure the}} dielectric permittivity of the soil. The volume {{of water in the}} total volume of soil most heavily influences the dielectric permittivity of the soil because the dielectric of water (80) is much greater than the other constituents of the soil (mineral soil: 4, organic matter: 4, air: 1). Thus, when the amount of water changes in the soil, the probe will measure a change in capacitance (from the change in dielectric permittivity) that can be directly correlated with a change in water content. Circuitry inside some commercial probes change the capacitance measurement into a proportional millivolt output. Other configuration are like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil. The probe consists of <b>sensing</b> <b>head</b> at fixed depth. The <b>sensing</b> <b>head</b> consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, fringe-effect capacitor, and the dielectric constant of the soil.|$|E
50|$|Capacitance sensors (or Dielectric sensors) use {{capacitance}} {{to measure}} the dielectric permittivity of a surrounding medium. The configuration is like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil; probes can also be modular (comb-like) and connected to a logger. The <b>sensing</b> <b>head</b> consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, fringe-effect capacitor, and the dielectric constant of the soil. Each capacitor sensor consists of two metal rings mounted on the circuit board at {{some distance from the}} top of the access tube. These rings are a pair of electrodes, which form the plates of the capacitor with the soil acting as the dielectric in between. The plates are connected to an oscillator, consisting of an inductor and a capacitor. The oscillating electrical field is generated between the two rings and extends into the soil medium through the wall of the access tube. The capacitor and the oscillator form a circuit, and changes in dielectric constant of surrounding media are detected by changes in the operating frequency. The capacitance sensors are designed to oscillate in excess of 100 MHz inside the access tube in free air. The output of the sensor is the frequency response of the soil’s capacitance due to its soil moisture level.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new {{sensor system}} for {{simultaneous}} and independent multipoint strain and temperature measurements is presented. The interrogation of the <b>sensing</b> <b>heads</b> {{has been carried}} out by monitoring their FFT phase variations. In particular, two of each microstructured optical fiber (MOF) cavity interference frequencies were used for the measures. This method is independent of the signal amplitude and also avoids the necessity of tracking the wavelength evolution in the spectrum, which can be a handicap when there are multiple interference frequency components with different sensitivities. The <b>sensing</b> <b>heads</b> present birefringent and multimodal properties and therefore both characteristics lead to their own interference with different properties and sensitivities.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A new, {{computer}} oriented {{system for}} automatic, in situ monitoring of water quality is proposed which makes full and {{effective use of}} modern computer technology. The main objective of this thesis work was {{the development of the}} concept for in situ computer controlled experimenting as a reasonable and effective means of automatically observing the wide range of aquatic parameters needed. The established capability in the teleprocessing industry is assumed as starting point and an optimal design is sought for a <b>sensing</b> <b>head</b> which would meet current expression of requirements for automated water quality monitors while exploiting the advantages of both hardware and software in a total system context. A working model of such a <b>sensing</b> <b>head</b> was constructed and operationally tested using an EAI 690 hybrid computer to simulate the central computer and telecommunications facility. This <b>sensing</b> <b>head</b> consisted of a peristaltic pump, a servo positioned valve, an array of six electrodes (2 glass pH, 3 silver-silver chloride and 1 gold microelectrode) and a thermistor, along with buffer amplifiers and motor controllers to service these devices. A main feature is its design as a remote, computer periferal, like a teletype, which understands up to 64 different commands and which returns coded responses. A second feature is its in situ design making the entire sensor head submersible and operable in depths to 100 meters. A repertoire of programmed experiments was developed for the working model system to show how, for example, it could monitor the water quality parameters; temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chloride ion, total carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, and a factor called "other ions".
