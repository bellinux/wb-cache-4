5000|$|In 1939 Mudjair {{went looking}} for fish at the river estuary along coast. He noticed a strange fish that fed its {{children}} when in danger and <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> when they reached safety..Wishing to bring a specimen home, Moedjair questioned whether the fish would survive a non-saltwater environment. Experimenting with freshwater habitats, he demonstrated 4 fish can live in saltwater after 11 experiments. These 4 fish, released in rivers and lakes, quickly grew in population. To honor his work, the fish was named mujair in Indonesian, and mujair is now a popular freshwater fish in Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The game's {{platforming}} mechanics {{are very}} similar to most other Kirby games, as is Kirby's skillset. Kirby is able to jump, duck, slide, fly (by inflating himself), as well as perform his signature move: inhaling enemies. When Kirby inhales an enemy, it can be <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> out as a projectile, or swallowed. Normally this has no effect on Kirby, although specific enemies grant Kirby copy abilities, a staple of the Kirby games. Copy abilities replace Kirby's standard inhaling move with a special attack, depending on the enemy Kirby ate. For example, swallowing a fire-based enemy allows Kirby to become a fireball.|$|E

Unless her husband rescued her by {{shooting}} the whale in a spot on its back, she would not be freed.|$|R
50|$|The fry {{are tiny}} at hatching. The male takes {{responsibility}} for the fry, rescuing them and <b>spitting</b> them <b>back</b> into the nest if they fall out. Some tend to grow faster than others, and will exhibit fratricide, eating their smaller siblings.|$|R

Jo <b>spits</b> <b>back</b> that Amy is a not a child but a demon in a child's body. Jo then rushes up to her attic to rewrite her story. Laurie invites Jo to a skating match, which she at first refuses but eventually agrees to. Amy wants {{to go with them}} but she already outgrown her pair of skates. Beth, who intends to stay home, offers Amy her old skates.|$|R
50|$|The larger {{questions}} about {{the popularity of the}} Berenstain Bears are more troubling: Is this what we really want from childrens books in the first place, a world filled with scares and neuroses and problems to be toughed out and solved? And if it is, arent the Berenstain Bears simply teaching to the test, providing a lesson to be <b>spit</b> <b>back,</b> rather than one lived and understood and embraced? Where is the warmth, the spirit of discovery and imagination in Bear Country? Stan Berenstain taught a million lessons to children, but subtlety and plain old joy werent among them.|$|E
5000|$|After Hope {{decides that}} each of the Lights needs their own codename, Kenji begins to {{consider}} his several options. At first, he suggests Derivative or Rei (Japanese for Zero, and a reference to Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion) before settling on simply Zero. Later, after Primal wins the right to stay on Utopia, Zero wonders if Primal truly is happy on Utopia or if he is faking it to remain close to Hope. He and Transonic acknowledge that Hope has changed them all, and Zero doesn't think it's quite right. He reveals that he had considered another codename to <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> at their [...] "messiah": Judas.|$|E
5000|$|Eggs {{typically}} hatch {{two days}} after spawning. The young fry, commonly called [...] "wrigglers", are immediately moved by the parents to a pit they have previously dug inside the territory. The parents suck a few wrigglers at a time into their mouths and spit them into the pit. The pit is guarded against other fish. Sometimes, the wrigglers are spit onto a vertical surface rather than a pit. The young adhere to the surface because of adhesive mucus-producing glands {{on the top of}} their heads. If they fall off, they are retaken by the parents and <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> into position. This use of vertical surfaces is most commonly seen when oxygen levels are low; the parents then spit the wrigglers onto aquatic plants, near the water surface. Proximity to the surface and to oxygen-producing photosynthesizing plants ensures that the wrigglers get more oxygen.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Haré {{wakes up}} to find Guu a {{completely}} different person who is no longer cute, social, or energetic. No one seems to notice the change. Guu mostly remains quiet and ignorant of things while Haré has to show her around and explain things. Hare notices Guu likes to eat things. She swallows Haré but, instead of dying, he is taken to another world in Guu's stomach. There he meets Seiichi and Tomoyo, a couple who has accepted their fate in Guu's stomach. After Guu spits Haré out, she accompanies him to school where she meets all of Haré's schoolmates (whom she swallows and <b>spits</b> <b>back</b> out) and the village elder (whose chest hair she rips out).|$|R

5000|$|The problem, then, becomes evident: {{the massive}} {{education}} system cannot account for differences between its subjects, from different learning preferences to different teaching styles to different paces. Student-Directed Teaching asks, [...] "why do students {{all have to}} do the same thing, at the same time, in the same manner?" [...] It is because of this, according to the Student-Directed Teaching philosophy, that students lose faith in school: gifted students are not challenged enough while students that fall behind have little support. Thus, the public education system rewards those who remain in the middle: these are the students who receive praise because they never challenge the teacher, give textbook answers on homework and <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> cute phrases the teacher said yesterday. These are students who understand that challenging the status quo and being different carries a penalty.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{begins with}} Peter Parker/Spider-Man battling Anti-Venom, who kills him. Rewinding {{back to the}} {{starting}} of the event, in the year 2099 Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 investigates Alchemax scientist Walker Sloan. While spying on him, Spider-Man 2099 discovers Sloan plans to travel {{back in time to}} establish Alchemax years before its time, allowing him to rebuild the company in his own image and dismantle its corporate rivals before they are even established. Spider-Man 2099 arrives just as Sloan enters his Gateway, but jumps through the portal too late to stop him. Trapped in the portal, Spider-Man 2099 sees visions of the original Spider-Man being killed (though not by who). Being <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> into 2099, Miguel (unaffected due to being trapped in the portal) discovers Sloan's interference has reduced New York City to a horrifying dystopia. Miguel uses Peter Parker's DNA, stored within the company's archives, to create a chronal link with him, back in the present. (Peter's question if the [...] "other me's" [...] are in his head, suggests this takes place in the same continuity of Shattered Dimensions.) Spider-Man, now working for Alchemax in the genetics department instead of the Daily Bugle, is warned about his death on the 66th floor. However, Spider-Man refuses to obey his orders to flee if there's a psycho on the loose and travels to the 66th floor.|$|E
5000|$|During the Dark Reign storyline, Ares {{has joined}} the Dark Avengers, Norman Osborn's {{personal}} team of Avengers. Writer of the Dark Avengers series, Brian Michael Bendis, described Ares' role: [...] "Ares {{is going to be}} a big part of this book. He's really going to step up and use his War God brain." [...] During The Dark Avengers' first mission, [...] "Venom-Spidey" [...] is turned into a monster by Morgan le Fay. Venom (under her control) attempts to eat Ares. He is <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> out but is turned to stone shortly thereafter by Morgana. He returns to normal when Morgana is defeated by Dr. Doom in her own time. Ares later receives a truancy notice in the mail regarding his son. Deciding to investigate as best he can, he sends Alex to school, only to see him board Daisy Johnson's scooter on the way to a new base for the Secret Warriors. Ares tails them on his motorcycle and rampages his way in through the wall. When Hellfire tries to attack, Ares easily dispatches him and in their own silent way, Nick Fury and Ares ask for a private audience with one another. Ares then uncharacteristically declares himself a horrid father, but only aims to raise Alex differently than he and his father were raised. He then peacefully leaves the place behind, allowing Alex the opportunity to not have to hide his allegiance anymore.|$|E

5000|$|Outside, Matt {{is asking}} Damon {{to kill him}} as Damon kicks him around. Elena jumps in, {{tackling}} Damon to the ground, and growls at him to leave Matt alone. Elena asks Damon why he never {{told her about the}} times she was compelled. Damon <b>spits</b> <b>back</b> [...] "would it have changed anything?" [...] When she asks if he would have followed her for Matt to be saved, Damon responds that he would absolutely not, so that Elena could live the life she always wanted: [...] "Because I'm that selfish, but you know that," [...] referencing the other compulsion when Damon confessed his love for Elena. Stefan takes Matt and feeds him his blood. Matt tells Stefan to stop saving him. Stefan retorts that it was Elena's choice that Matt be saved first.

5000|$|Nebula {{appears in}} Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series, voiced by Ashly Burch. Following {{the death of}} Thanos, Gamora states to Star-Lord at a bar at Knowhere that {{a small part of}} her wants to see her sister Nebula again. Star-Lord will either tell Gamora that Nebula's family or that calling her could be a mistake. If it is the former, Nebula expresses anger in her call with Gamora of how the Guardians killed their father. In episode 2, Nebula attacks the {{location}} where Thanos' body is being held. Regardless on Star-Lord's choice revolving around Rocket Raccoon's trip to Halfworld, Star-Lord and Gamora fight Nebula and managed to subdue her. On the Milano, Nebula is shown to be locked up in Gamora's room. Entering Gamora's room which Nebula has been locked up in, Star-Lord and Gamora tell Nebula that they need her to translate the ancient Kree language which Nebula is reluctant to do. When Nebula tells Gamora that she still remembers Tar-Voll, Gamora draws her sword on her as Nebula orders for Gamora to leave. If Star-Lord has Gamora leave, she does so while stating to Star-Lord that she won't help him if she hears screams. Nebula states that she never cared for them. If Star-Lord agrees with Gamora, he states that Gamora's got the right idea as he pins her against the wall (Star-Lord will also have the option to <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> on her). Drax the Destroyer later tells Star-Lord that there was a device found in Nebula's skull. Star-Lord persuades Nebula into giving him the device where she states that it will tell him everything he'll want to know while stating to Star-Lord that he owes her. When Kree soldiers working for Hala the Accuser attack the ship, Star-Lord will have the option to release Nebula to help fight the Kree soldiers while warning her that the trust exercise will be over if she back-stabs them in battle.|$|E

Driven by profits {{and struggling to}} keep up with the busy American with a short attention span and even shorter amount of free time, it seems broadcast television news programs have resorted to a man bites dog, blood and guts, celebrity format. What many think of as news seems to be no more than a few attention grabbing headlines already digested and <b>spit</b> <b>back</b> out in a way that the viewer can understand. In order to get down to the real story of what these news programs are presenting I viewed, logged and occasionally taped various types of programs which all fall under the heading of news. I also relied on library research and interviewed professional sources within the television news industry for their opinion. I developed methods of categorizing and dissecting these news programs in order to see what type of information these programs were presenting and in what way. After months of watching these news programs I found that there might still be a place out there for objective, comprehensive news. I also discovered that criticized comedy programs like The Daily Show, may offer just as much substance as the average local news program and that there a well-carved niche for screaming heads debating over the day’s news stories. After studying this variety of outlets my hope is that the average viewer can discern between these options and make the choice that keeps them most informed and allows them to self-govern based on the information they glean from these programs...|$|E

During the ~6-day incubation period, the male 'fans' (oxygenates) the eggs, removes rotten eggs and debris, and defends the territory.

Several witnesses take the stand, including Primal's mother who gives a heartfelt testimony about wanting her son back. After she leaves the stand, Primal himself rushes the stand to give his own testimony, which is surprisingly well-spoken and deep. He explains that {{he is no longer}} sentient in the way that everyone else is, and that he sees the modern world through his primitive instincts. Give him a refrigerator and he will eat the food inside in order to satisfy his nutritional needs; give him a court room, and he will give the court a well thought out speech to get his needs. He requests that the court recognize his hyperinstinctive intelligence the same way it recognizes robotic and alien intelligence. He also hopes that his parents understand that he is happier now than he has ever been. Primal wins the right to stay with Hope on Utopia, but Zero wonders if he is actually happy, or if he is just lying to stay with Hope. He talks with Transonic about how Hope has changed them all, and they both agree that something isn't right about it.

Similarly, in Ancient China, those accused of a crime would have rice powder placed in their mouths. In ancient middle-eastern cultures, the accused were made to lick hot metal rods briefly. It is thought that these tests had some validity since a guilty person would produce less saliva and thus have a drier mouth; the accused would be considered guilty if rice was sticking to their mouths in abundance or if their tongues were severely burned due to lack of shielding from saliva.|$|R
