40|$|The Parabolic Offset Linearly Actuated Reflector (POLAR) solar dynamic module was {{selected}} as the baseline design for a solar dynamic power system aboard the space station. The POLAR concept was chosen over other candidate designs after extensive trade studies. The primary advantages of the POLAR concept are the low mass moment of inertia of the module about the transverse boom and the compactness of the stowed module which enables packaging of two complete modules in the Shuttle orbiter payload bay. The fine pointing control system required for the solar dynamic module has been studied and initial results indicate that if disturbances from the station are allowed to back drive the rotary alpha joint, pointing errors caused by transient loads on the space station can be minimized. This would allow pointing controls to operate in bandwidths near system structural frequencies. The incorporation of the fine pointing control system into the solar dynamic module is fairly straightforward for the three strut concentrator support structure. However, results of structural analyses indicate that this three <b>strut</b> <b>support</b> is not optimum. Incorporation of a vernier pointing system into the proposed six <b>strut</b> <b>support</b> structure is being studied...|$|E

40|$|Based on researching into WDPSS- 8, after {{analysing}} {{and comparing}} 3 support systems in wind tunnel including the strut suspension system, cable mounted system and wire-driven parallel suspension system, the following {{conclusions can be}} acquired. 1) 	Till now the <b>strut</b> <b>support</b> systems and rotary balances can be used in measuring the dynamic derivatives of the aircraft in low-speed wind tunnels successfully, wire-driven parallel suspension system has a great potentiality, but it is still under investigation. 2) 	The cable mounted system is one of suitable method for measuring the static derivatives of the aircraft in LSWT. Though it allows a large supporting stiffness, small interference of the streamline flow and a high measuring precision for large attack angle, it can not be used in measuring the dynamic derivatives. 3) 	Wire-driven parallel suspension system has opened a new horizon for measuring the static and dynamic derivatives of the aircraft in LSWT. Using the same system based on position control and force control in robotics, it allows to realize the free flight of the aircraft model and to obtain the static and dynamic derivatives. However, the results given in this Chapter can only be considered as a preliminary step in establishing feasibilityï¼Œalthough the wire-driven parallel suspension system is a very interesting design, and it may be sufficiently developed into a routine practical system...|$|E

The model had a wing span of 7. 5 ft and was tested through a free stream Reynolds number range from 1. 3 to 6. 0 x 10 to 6 th power per foot at a Mach number of 0. 20.

During the tests in both the Langley and Ames tunnels, the model was tested with six basic wing configurations: (1) cruise; (2) climb (slats only extended); (3) 15 deg take-off flaps; (4) 30 deg take-off flaps; (5) 45 deg landing flaps; and (6) 60 deg landing flaps...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the aerodynamic estimation {{carried out on}} a three-dimensional aircraft model by conducting wind tunnel tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The test model is a 15 % scaled down from a two-seater light aircraft that is closed to the Malaysian made SME MD 3 - 160 aircraft. This aircraft model has been tested at two different low speed tunnels, namely at Universiti Teknologi Malaysiaâ€™s tunnel (UTM-LST) test section sized of 2. 0 x 1. 5 m 2, and at Institute Aerodynamic Research, National Research Council of Canada (IAR-NRC) sized 3. 0 x 2. 0 m 2 tunnel. The speed during testing at UTM-LST and IAR-NRC tunnels was up to 70 m/s, which corresponds to Reynolds Number of 1. 3 x 10 6. The longitudinal and lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft such as coefficients of pressure, forces (lift, drag and side force) and moments (roll, pitch and yaw moment) had been experimentally measured either using direct force measurement or pressure measurement method. The data reduction methods included the <b>strut</b> <b>support</b> interference factor using dummy image and the blockage correction had been applied in this wind tunnel tests. On top of the experimental study, simulation was also performed using a commercial CFD code, FLUENT.

30|$|Our {{study showed}} that outcome in {{patients}} of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures with complete paraplegia depends on multiple factors such as fracture pattern, trauma-fixation interval, and type of surgery offered. The two groups {{in this study were}} not randomized, which is a weak point because more severe injuries underwent staged anterior decompression. In spite of severe injury pattern and morbidity of staged surgery the ultimate functional outcome (FIM score) was better in staged decompression group. In incomplete burst fractures transpedicular fixation and faster rehabilitation given comparable results in our series and is the only type of burst fracture which was treated satisfactorily with transpedicular fixation alone if done within 7 Â days. In our study only 4 cases out of 22 of typeÂ A 3.1 fractures required anterior decompression and fusion because these were operated after 7 Â days, and distraction and kyphosis correction maneuvers failed in these cases. Only two cases of split burst fractures (typeÂ  3.2) were treated with transpedicular fixation alone and both did not show any recovery and had persistent back pain and recurrence of kyphotic deformity (loss of correction > 5 Â°). It is important to take into consideration the results of Shono etÂ al. [62], who have shown in their experimental study that posterior distractive reduction maneuver generates anterior and middle spinal column defects, leading to significant mechanical instabilities, particularly in axial compressive loading. Short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation technique to resist axial spinal loading anteriorly is not adequate [63], but if the construct is used in neutral mode and adequate <b>strut</b> <b>support</b> is provided anteriorly, the efficacy and utility of pedicle screws is increased.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the aerodynamic studies {{carried out on}} a three-dimensional aircraft model. The test model is a 15 % scaled down from a two-seater light aircraft that close to the Malaysian made SME MD 3 - 160 aircraft. The aircraft model is equipped with control surfaces such as flaps, aileron, rudder and elevator and it is designed for pressure measurement testing and direct force measurement using a 6 -components balance system. This aircraft model has been tested at two different low speed tunnels, at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia tunnel sized 1. 5 x 2. 0 meter 2 test section, and at Institute Aerodynamic Research, National Research Council of Canada sized 3 x 2 meter 2 tunnel. The speed during testing at UTM and IAR/NRC tunnels was up to 70 meter/second, which is corresponds to Reynolds numbers of 1. 3 x 106. The longitudinal and lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft such as coefficients of pressure, forces (lift, drag, side) and moments (roll, pitch and yaw) have been experimentally measured either using direct force measurement or pressure measurement method. The data reduction methods include the <b>strut</b> <b>support</b> interference factor using dummy image and the blockage correction have been applied in this project.
