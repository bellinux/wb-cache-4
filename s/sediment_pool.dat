40|$|Abstract The {{quantity}} of suspended sediment in an estuary is regulated either by transport, where energy or {{time needed to}} suspend sediment is limiting, or by supply, where the {{quantity of}} erodible sediment is limiting. This paper presents a hypothesis that suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) in estuaries can suddenly decrease when the threshold from transport to supply regulation is crossed as an erodible <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> is depleted. This study was motivated by a statistically significant 36 % step decrease in SSC in San Francisco Bay from water years 1991 – 1998 to 1999 – 2007. A quantitative conceptual model of an estuary with an erodible <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> and transport or supply regulation of sediment transport is developed. Model results confirm that, if the regulation threshold was crossed in 1999, SSC would decrease rapidly after water year 1999 as observed.

We tested such interactions in an intertidal soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> system where both the sand goby Favonigobius lentiginosus and post-settlement whiting Sillago spp. consume meiofaunal prey, but F. lentiginosus also consumes Sillago spp. We quantified changes in fish gut content volumes and composition (i. e. meiofaunal group diversity and abundances) in response to the presence of a predator/prey and to different fish densities (two, four or six total individuals) in experimental aquaria. We found no significant density-dependent effects on either the predator or prey species, likely due to meiofaunal prey oversupply; however, the diet composition of the prey species Sillago spp. changed significantly in the presence of their potential predator. We conclude that lower consumption of meiofaunal amphipods in the presence of gobies suggests that whiting perhaps maintain their gut fullness by preferentially targeting larger amphipods.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between sediment nutrient enrichment and carbon sequestration, using the ratio of gross primary production to respiration (P/R), in a fish-farming impacted and an unaffected Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) ecosystem in the Aegean Sea, Greece. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sedimentation, nutrient <b>pools</b> in <b>sediment</b> and dissolved nutrients in pore water were significantly and positively intercorrelated, indicating close linkage between sedimentation and <b>sediment</b> nutrient <b>pools</b> in seagrass meadows. C, N and P <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> were significantly enhanced in the impacted meadow throughout the year, even during winter when fish farming activity was low. In the impacted sediment, the increase in C and N was higher than P, reflecting a faster remineralization and uptake of P than C and N. The ecosystem P/R ratio decreased exponentially with sediment nutrient enrichment. Threshold values are given for C, N and P sedimentation rates and <b>sediment</b> <b>pools,</b> and for N and P concentrations in pore waters, after which P/R ratio in the seagrass meadow decreases below 1, indicating a shift from autotrophy to heterotrophy with sediment nutrient enrichment. Such a regime shift indicates a loss of storage capacity of the seagrass ecosystem, jeopardizing the key role of P. oceanica as a carbon sink in the Mediterranean. © Inter-Research 2011.

40|$|Tide pools are {{challenging}} environments. They can experience rapid changes in temperature, salinity and pH yet are occupied by fishes and other organisms. While more {{attention has been}} given to community composition, zonation and competition of intertidal rockpool faunas, soft sediment tidepools are potentially important in terms of biodiversity and fisheries. Gobies, dominate the communities of both rock- and soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> by virtue of physiological and behavioural adaptations. In part their great diversity is potentially a function of the ability to cope with great adversity. The combination of physiological challenges and low resource diversity offers and useful natural laboratory for examining resource partitioning and speciation processes in extreme environments. Moreton Bay, Australia contains extensive areas of soft sediment shores on which pools commonly occur. The objectives of this thesis were to: 1) quantify the use of soft sediment tidepools by fishes and their associated meiofaunal prey, and 2) examine more closely how several gobiid species are able to coexist in such a homogenous environment. A twelve month survey of fishes in soft sediment tidepools was undertaken between January and December 2009 at three sites: Dunwich, Manly and Godwin Beach, in south-east Queensland, Australia. The gobies Favonigobius lentiginosus, Favonigobius exquisitus, Pseudogobius sp., whiting Sillago spp. and the blenny Omobranchus punctatus were the most abundant species. The mean density of fish was between 0. 29 ± 0. 13 and 5. 04 ± 1. 74 fish L- 1. Abundance of fish was positively correlated with pool volume. Most fish caught were juveniles, suggesting that soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> act as nurseries for some species. To assess prey availability and therefore the potential role of soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> as foraging areas during low tide, I assayed the meiofaunal occupation of soft sediment tidepools at each of the three intertidal shores.

A total of 1364 individuals representing 15 species and nine families of fishes were observed. At Dunwich, fish assemblages were dominated by the sand goby Favonigobius lentiginosus (89 %) and whiting, Sillago spp. (10 %). At Manly, the gobies Favonigobius exquisitus (37 %), Pseudogobius sp.

40|$|The loss of {{biodiversity}} worldwide has prompted a close {{investigation of the}} link between diversity and ecosystem functions. Most experimental studies have looked at the relationship between grassland plant diversity and aboveground productivity. Less is known about other ecosystems or how diversity affects belowground processes. Our objective was to investigate the link between plant community (diversity and composition) and key belowground processes such as root biomass production and CH 4 dynamics in wetland ecosystems. We hypothesized that 1) root biomass would increase with functional group diversity due to complementarity and 2) the <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> of CH 4 would decrease with diversity due to increased CH 4 oxidation facilitated by root biomass. Four plant functional groups (facultative annuals, obligate annuals, reeds and tussocks) were planted in controlled mesocosms to represent five levels of functional diversity and every combination of functional groups at each diversity level. Unplanted mesocosms served as the zero diversity treatment. At peak biomass in 2007, porewater samplers were used to extract water at 5, 15, and 25 cm. The samples were frozen prior to headspace analysis of CH 4 and CO 2. Porewater was also analyzed for DOC. Afterward, we took soil cores from each mesocosm at 0 - 10 cm, 10 - 20 cm and 20 - 30 cm to determine the root biomass in each depth. |$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{increase}} the knowledge on the mobility of mercury in a salt marsh colonised by Halimione portulacoides. Mercury distribution in the sediment layers and its incorporation into the plant biomass were assessed, {{as well as the}} potential export of mercury from the contaminated area to the adjacent environment. Mercury pools in the sediments ranged from 560 to 943  mg m- 2 and are largely associated with the solid fraction, with just a small amount being associated with the pore waters. Estimated diffusive fluxes of reactive mercury ranged from 1. 3 to 103  ng m- 2  d- 1. Despite the above ground biomass values being comparatively higher than below ground biomass values, the mercury pools were much higher in the root system (0. 06 - 0. 16  mg m- 2 and 29 - 102  mg m- 2, respectively). The annual bioaccumulation of mercury in above ground tissues was estimated in 0. 11  mg m- 2  y- 1, while in below ground biomass the values were higher (72  mg m- 2  y- 1). The turnover rates of H. portulacoides biomass suggest higher mercury mobility within the plant rhizosphere. Taking into account the pools of mercury in above ground biomass, the export of mercury by macro-detritus following the "outwelling hypothesis" is not significant for the mercury balance in the studied ecosystem. The mercury accumulated in the below ground part of the plant is quite mobile, being able to return to the <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> throughout the mineralisation process. [URL]...|$|E

Water temperature and salinity showed a clear seasonality whilst particulate and sediment organic matter did not show any clear seasonal pattern. Relative abundances of suspended and sediment organic matter, on the other hand, appeared to be site-dependent and controlled mainly by the dynamic balance between resuspension and sedimentation. High quantities of both suspended and sediment total organic matter were present, while very low algal biomasses (in terms of chlorophyll-a concentrations) were observed both in the suspended and <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> thus showing the oligotrophy of the site. The contribution of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos to the total organic content of suspended and sediment matter was negligible.

40|$|Denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate {{reduction}} to ammonium (DNRA) {{are important}} processes occurring simultaneously under oxygen-limited or anaerobic conditions both competing for nitrate and organic carbon. Despite their ecological importance, {{there has been}} little investigation of how denitrification and DNRA potentials and related key functional genes vary vertically with sediment depth. Nitrate reduction potentials measured in sediment depth profiles along the Colne estuary were in the upper range of nitrate reduction rates reported from other sediments and showed the existence of strong decreasing trends both with increasing depth and from the head to the estuary mouth. Denitrification potential decreased along the estuary, decreasing more rapidly with depth towards the estuary mouth; in contrast, DNRA potential increased along the estuary. Significant decreases in 16 S rRNA and nitrate reducing genes copy numbers were observed along the estuary and from surface to deeper sediments. Both metabolic potentials and functional genes persisted at sediment depths where porewater nitrate was absent. Transport of nitrate by bioturbation could only account for the upper 10 cm depth of sediment based on macrofauna distribution. A several fold higher combined freeze-lysable KCl-extractable nitrate pool compared to porewater nitrate was detected. We hypothesised that his could be attributed to intracellular nitrate pools from nitrate accumulating microorganisms like Thioploca or Beggiatoa. However, pyrosequencing analysis did not detect any such organisms, leaving other bacteria, microbenthic algae or foraminiferans which have also been shown to accumulate nitrate, as possible candidates. The importance and bioavailability of a KCl-extractable nitrate <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> remains to be tested. The significant variation in the vertical pattern and abundance of the various nitrate reducing genes phylotypes reasonably suggests differences in their activity throughout the sediment column, raising interesting questions as to what could the alternative metabolic roles for the various nitrate reductases be, as previously found for nitrite reductases...|$|E

The gobies showed preference for a particular estuarine habitat at a given stage of ontogenetic development and habitat shift corresponded with change in body shape implying the level of competence exhibited by these species during ontogeny. The occurrence of larva and the early J 1 in the lower estuary around May was timed with spring bloom that was attributed to increase in the secondary production of estuaries in the bay particularly the zooplankton, which was the main prey item of gobies during the pelagic phase. The movement in the tidal creek from late J 1 to J 2 was related with shift to benthic lifestyle with preference for benthic prey {{but it could also}} be attributed to refuge from predators as well as temperature-mediated growth and morphogenesis in the shallow habitat. Relevant changes in body shape was a prelude to benthic life particularly the narrowing of the head, reduction in the angle of the mouth on the ventral surface bringing the mouth closer to the substrate, deformation at the anterior trunk region that resulted to a tumescent appearance on the dorsal region of the trunk as well as a relatively elongated and ventrally displaced tail. All these characters were attained at J 3. The gobies gained competence when they reached J 3 having the ability to explore “high-risked” habitats such as the middle estuary and a specialized habitat like the soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools.</b> The J 3 of G. breunigii on the other hand corresponded with upstream movement to preferred adult habitats. Changes during the adult stage was primarily associated with the elaboration of the morphological form inherent at J 3.

The objective {{of this study was to}} trace the C and N from senescing macroalgae into relevant <b>sediment</b> <b>pools.</b> A macroalgal die-off event was simulated by the addition of freeze-dried macroalgae (Gracilaria spp.), pre-labeled with stable isotopes (13 C and 15 N), to sediment mesocosms.

Bulk sediments took up label immediately following the die-off, and macroalgal C and N were retained in the sediments for at least 2 wk. Approximately 6 to 50 % and 2 to 9 % of macroalgal N and C, respectively, were incorporated into the sediments. Label from the macroalgae appeared in both bacterial and BMA biomarkers, suggesting that efficient shuttling of macroalgal C and N between these communities may serve as a mechanism for retention of macroalgal nutrients within the sediments. ...|$|R

40|$|Riffle–pool {{sequences}} {{are maintained}} through the preferential entrainment of <b>sediment</b> grains from <b>pools</b> rather than riffles. This preferential entrainment has {{been attributed to}} a reversal in the magnitude of velocity and shear stress under high flows; however the Differential Sediment Entrainment Hypothesis (DSEH) postulates that differential entrainment can instead result from spatial sedimentological contrasts. Here we use a novel suite of in situ grain-scale field measurements from a riffle–pool sequence to parameterize a physically-based model of grain entrainment. Field measurements include pivoting angles, lift forces and high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using terrestrial laser scanning, from which particle exposure, protrusion and surface roughness were derived. The entrainment model results show that grains in pools have a lower critical entrainment shear stress than grains in either pool exits or riffles. This is because pool grains have looser packing, hence greater exposure and lower pivoting angles. Conversely, riffle and pool exit grains have denser packing, lower exposure and higher pivoting angles. A cohesive matrix further stabilizes pool exit grains. The resulting predictions of critical entrainment shear stress for grains in different subunits are compared with spatial patterns of bed shear stress derived from a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reach. The CFD model predicts that, under bankfull conditions, pools experience lower shear stresses than riffles and pool exits. However, the difference in sediment entrainment shear stress is sufficiently large that <b>sediment</b> in <b>pools</b> is still more likely to be entrained than <b>sediment</b> in <b>pool</b> exits or riffles, resulting in differential entrainment under bankfull flows. Significantly, this differential entrainment does not require a reversal in flow velocities or shear stress, suggesting that sedimentological contrasts alone may be sufficient for the maintenance of riffle–pool sequences.

Objectives of this basin-wide analysis were to: 1) identify and inventory major sources of sediment; 2) estimate rates, timing and volumes of sediment {{production and}} delivery to streams; and 3) attempt to link sediment delivery to changes in pool volumes. Two sets of data were collected and analyzed. The first set used aerial photos and field data to identify and estimate sediment production and delivery. The second data set used channel and pool measurements to estimate V*, the percent of fine <b>sediment</b> in <b>pools</b> (Lisle and Hilton 1992). Primary factors influencing landslides are unstable geology, steep slopesin inner gorges and management activity. Sedimert production from landsliding increased as management increased while forested areas decreased. Sediment was delivered to Pistol River streams at a rate of 400 m 3 /km 2 *yr. Fine <b>sediment</b> in <b>pools</b> was primarily stored on edges and downstream ends of pools where shear stress is typically less than at pool:heads and along the thaiweg. A positive correlation was found between total fine sediment volume and scoured pooi volume; however no relationship was found between V* and scoured pool volume. This suggests that even though larger pools have the capacity to store more sediment, the percent of fine <b>sediment</b> occupying scoured <b>pool</b> volume is independent of pool size. The relationship between V* and unjt area sediment delivery was positive and strongly correlated but only after the effects of local sediment input were considered. A spatial and temporal relationship was round between V* and time and distance of delivered sediment. The relationship between fine <b>sediment</b> volume in <b>pools</b> and <b>sediment</b> deliiiery indicated that landslide sediment delivery from years past is being transported through the stream system and stored in downstream pools, bars and terraces.

Scaling of the underlying dynamic equations shows dependence of the results on the Simpson number (relative strength of horizontal density gradient) and the Rouse number (relative settling velocity) as well as impacts of the Unsteadiness number (relative tidal fre-quency). Here, the parameter space given by the Simpson and Rouse numbers is mainly investigated. A simple analytical model {{based on the assumption}} of stationarity shows that for small Simpson and Rouse numbers sediment flux is down estuary and vice versa for large Simpson and Rouse numbers. A fully dynamic water column model coupled to a second-moment turbulence closure model allows to decompose the sedi-ment flux profiles into contributions from the transport flux (product of subtidal velocity and sediment concentration profiles) and the fluctuation flux profiles (tidal covariance between current velocity and sedi-ment concentration). Three different types of bottom <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> are distinguished to vary the sediment availability, by defining a time scale for complete sediment erosion. For short erosion times scales, the transport sediment flux may dominate, but for larger erosion time scales the fluctuation sediment flux largely dominates the tidal sediment flux.

40|$|Abstract: The {{response}} of the mainstem channel of North Fork Caspar Creek to recent logging is examined by time trends in bed load yield, scour and fill at resurveyed cross sections, and the volume and fine-sediment content of pools. Companion papers report that recent logging has increased streamflow {{during the summer and}} moderate winter rainfall events, and blowdowns from buffer strips have contributed more large woody debris. Changes in bed load yield were not detected despite a strong correlation between total scour and fill and annual effective discharge, perhaps because changes in stormflows were modest. The strongest responses are an increase in <b>sediment</b> storage and <b>pool</b> volume, particularly in the downstream portion of the channel along a buffer zone, where large woody debris (LWD) inputs are high. The association of high <b>sediment</b> storage and <b>pool</b> volume with large inputs of LWD is consistent with previous experiments in other watersheds. This suggests that improved habitat conditions after recent blowdowns will be followed in future decades by less favorable conditions as present LWD decays and input rates from depleted riparia...|$|R

40|$|A major {{gap that}} {{currently}} limits accurate prediction of cumulative watershed effects {{is the lack}} of quantifiable relationships between sediment supply, channel conditions, and the magnitude of a biological response. We addressed this uncertainty by testing in six streams of the Klamath National Forest whether increased sediment supply resulted in elevated levels of streambed fine <b>sediment</b> stored in <b>pools</b> and riffles, and whether fine bed material in turn was correlated with spawning gravel quality and altered benthic assemblages. Results {{of this study indicate that}} there are significant, measurable differences in streambed fine sediment levels between basins in the Klamath National Forest with high and low sediment supply as estimated by two models: (1) a fine sediment model based on a locally-calibrated version of the universal soil loss equation and (2) an empirical mass-wasting-based landslide model. Increased sediment supply was directly correlated with fine <b>sediment</b> stored in <b>pools</b> and riffles, and with an overall fining of the median grain size. Model estimates of sediment supply were inversely correlated with subsurface flow rates, which have been directly correlated with salmonid egg survival in laboratory studies. Increased fine sediment was also associated with minor changes in th...|$|R
50|$|Dynamic steady {{states of}} {{sediment}} erosion and deposition work to sustain alluvial channel morphology, as river reaches import and export fine and coarse sediments at approximately equal rates. At {{the apex of}} meander curves, high velocity flows scour out <b>sediment</b> and form <b>pools.</b> The mobilized <b>sediment</b> is then deposited at the point bar directly across the channel or downstream. Flows of high magnitude and duration {{can be seen as}} important thresholds that drive channelbed mobility. Channel aggradation or degradation indicate sediment budget imbalances.|$|R
40|$|Riffle-pool {{sequences}} in gravel-bed rivers {{provide the}} template {{for a number}} ol fish and invertebrate habitats and their morphological complexities create spatial hydraulic variation over the flow regime that is logistically impossible to measure completely in the field. The mechanisms responsible for riffle-pool maintenance are unclear and despite contributions from many researchers, no conclusive explanation has been developed. There is much debate over the popular velocity reversal hypothesis, where it is generally acknowledged that at low flows the maximum bed shear stress in the channel occurs across the riffle, but at higher less frequent flows areas of maximum bed shear stress can switch to the <b>pool.</b> <b>Sediment</b> interactions control fluvial forms and processes, as such specific analysis of spatial hydraulic patterns in boundary shear stress are required to aid understanding of riffle-pool system behaviour and gain the insight in to the transport capacity that can scour sediment deposited in the predominandy low energy, lower competence pools and thereby provide a mechanism for maintenance ol riffle-pool morphology. Terrestrial LiDAR captures reach scale topographical data to yield a 0. 02 m digital elevation model and provides input to three-dimensional computation fluid dynamics software (CFD), where the spatial distribution and area! extent of bed shear stress, surface flow velocities and potential sediment entrainment over the discharge range are investigated for a 188 m gravel-bed reach of Kingsdale Beck, UK. With increasing discharge, spatial distributions of shear stress are revealed, which, until now, have been largely overlooked using previous cross-sectional analysis, highlighting the influence of pool tails as discharge rises. Results show some agreement with past literature on reversal with higher shear stress zones associated with riffles. As discharge increases pools are shown to become more dominant, however the existence of multiple reversals shows that while reversals do occur, they may be short-lived and marginal in magnitude, providing inherent problems with current theory. The overall temporal maintenance of the riffle-pool sequence is more explicitly linked with the long term flow regime, with the flows responsible for moving <b>pool</b> <b>sediment</b> closely confined to near bankfull discharge. Results indicate that potential to entrain <b>sediment</b> from <b>pools</b> occurs only from 85 % bankfull. Discharges less than 85 % bankfull are suggested {{to be responsible for}} maintaining the riffle-pool morphology through flow routing and bed shear stress reversal, however, they are not capable of potentially entraining sediment from the deepest pools. Combined CFD simulations with temporal discharge dominance derived from triangulated rainfall and the Revitalised FSR/FEH rainfallrunoff methodology, highlight the role of rarer more extreme flows in terms of explaining <b>sediment</b> entrainment from <b>pools.</b> At high flow Kingsdale Beck creates a competent sub channel, where a continuous sinuous channel with higher levels of bed shear stress develop with embryonic lateral bars, increasing potential sediment entrainment following the line of thalweg. As flow velocity decreases conventional rifflepool hydromorphology re-establishes and provides a new proposal for the maintenance of a riffle-pool sequence.

40|$|A user-friendly, web-accessible {{model has}} been {{developed}} that allows restoration practitioners and resource managers to easily estimate the TMDL-related benefits of oyster reef restoration per unit area, run restoration scenarios in Harris Creek, MD to optimize restoration planning and implementation, and calculate {{the benefits of the}} chosen plan. The model is rooted in scientifically defensible data and is readily transferable to systems throughout the Chesapeake Bay and Eastern Shore. The model operates in five vertically well-mixed boxes along the main axis of the creek. Exchanges among creeks are computed using a tidal prism approach and were compared to exchanges provided from a high resolution 3 D hydrodynamic model. Watershed inputs for the model were obtained for the Harris Creek sub-watershed from the Phase V Chesapeake Bay Program Watershed Model. The base model simulates daily concentrations over an annual cycle of chlorophyll-a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, the biomass of benthic microalgae, and the water column and <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> of labile organic carbon (C) and associated N and P. Water quality data for model forcing and calibration were obtained from the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Choptank Riverkeeper, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. An oyster sub-{{model has been}} coupled to this base model and computes the volume of water filtered, removal of phytoplankton, suspended solids, and associated nutrients via filtration, recycling of nutrients and consumption of oxygen by oyster respiration, production of feces, N and P accumulation in oyster tissues and shell, oyster-enhanced denitrification, and N and P burial associated with restored reefs. The completed model is served online and operates through a web browser, enabling users to conduct scenario analysis by entering box-specific values for acres restored, restored oyster density, and restored oyster size, as well as the economic value of associated N and P removal...|$|R

40|$|A Helley-Smith {{pressure}} differential bedload sampler {{was used to}} measure bedload transport at consecutive riffle sections of a riffle-pool-riffle sequence on Bambi Creek, a small (154 ha), second-order stream on Chichagof Island, Alaska, during four storms over a 2 -year period. Maximum bedload transport rate measured was 4920 kg/h at a streamflow of 2. 35 m 3 /s corresponding to a storm having a 5 -year return interval. Transport of larger sediment (> 8 mm) varied systematically with streamflow at the two sampling locations. At flows up to approximately bankfull, transport of large sediment was greatest at the upstream site; at flows above bankfull, transport of large sediment was greatest at the downstream site. The net import of large <b>sediment</b> to the <b>pool</b> during moderate stormflows and net export of large <b>sediment</b> from the <b>pool</b> during flows above bankfull may be related to a “convergence” or “reversal” of competence between the upstream riffle and subsequent pool at flows approximating bankfull stage. Cross-sections monitored within the study reach indicate that stormflows resulted in net filling of the riffle sections and net scour of the pool; periods of low streamflow resulted in net scour of the riffles and net filling of the poo...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{combining}} fluorescent particle tracer techniques with time-lapse {{video recording}} {{demonstrated that the}} gastropod Hydrobia truncata decreases crawling rate on patches rich in chlorophyll-a, while maintaining a constant feeding rate as sedimentary chlorophyll-a content varies. In contrast, H. truncata decreases feeding rate but does not change crawling rate upon encounter with patches of recently egested sediment. Depression of feeding rate is less pronounced if the egested material is enriched in chlorophyll-a. For deposit feeders inhabiting highly reworked sediments, the majority of available material may consist of sediment that has been recently egested. For an animal that responds negatively to recently egested <b>sediment,</b> the <b>pool</b> of material available for ingestion may be much reduced.

The percentage of nuclei in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle was used as a proxy of the cell division rate and therefore of the meristematic activity. The variability observed in the percentage of dividing cells (i. e. those containing nuclei in the G 2 phase) in P. oceanica meris- tems was closely (> 80 % of total variance) coupled to variability in SSP and SRR. The percentage of nuclei in the G 2 phase exponentially declined with increasing SSP and SRR, reaching the lowest values (0. 001 mol AVS (acid volatile sulfides) m- 2.
