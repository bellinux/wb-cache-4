40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{research}} is to assess whether performance on remembering faces with <b>attached</b> positive <b>information</b> and faces with <b>attached</b> negative <b>information</b> was enhanced when compared to faces with <b>attached</b> neutral <b>information,</b> or the control of faces with attached names only. It was hypothesised that likeability score would significantly differ for faces with <b>attached</b> positive <b>information</b> and <b>attached</b> negating <b>information,</b> an effect that was found in this research. In total, five measure of memory were used to assess the effect of <b>attached</b> social <b>information</b> on memory for faces- time taken to complete match pair grids, time taken between clicks on match pair grids, distance error on match pair grids, correct assisted name recall, correct assisted <b>attached</b> <b>information</b> recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> <b>information</b> recall. Three conditions were used (positive/neutral <b>attached</b> <b>information,</b> negative/neutral <b>attached</b> <b>information</b> and control condition) to measure the effect of mate relevant information on memory test scores. For the three match pair measures, no significant effect of <b>attached</b> mate relevant <b>information</b> was found. Non-significant results were found for correct assisted name recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> <b>information,</b> however for correct recall for <b>attached</b> <b>information,</b> a significant effect was found, suggesting that source memory of information can enhance subsequent memory for faces. Implications of research and future directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|SWISS-PROT is a curated protein {{sequence}} database which {{strives to}} provide {{a high level of}} annotation, a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Ongoing genome sequencing projects have dramatically increased the number of protein sequences to be incorporated into SWISS-PROT. Since {{we do not want to}} dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by incorporating sequences without proper sequence analysis and annotation, we cannot speed up the incorporation of new incoming data indefinitely. However, as we also want to make the sequences available as fast as possible, we introduced TREMBL (TRanslation of EMBL nucleotide sequence database), a supplement to SWISS-PROT. TREMBL consists of computer-annotated entries in SWISS-PROT format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDS) in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, except for CDS already included in SWISS-PROT. While TREMBL is already of immense value, its computer-generated annotation does not match the quality of SWISS-PROTs. The main difference is in the protein functional <b>information</b> <b>attached</b> to sequences. With this in mind, we are dedicating substantial effort to develop and apply computer methods to enhance the functional <b>information</b> <b>attached</b> to TREMBL entries...|$|R
