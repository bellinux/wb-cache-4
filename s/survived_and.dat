5|$|Ingham (1991) {{shows how}} small, {{independent}} {{iron and steel}} manufacturers <b>survived</b> <b>and</b> prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms.

Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed {{a higher percentage of}} highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.|$|E
