5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal assent is granted or {{withheld}} either by the realm's <b>sovereign</b> or, more frequently, by {{the representative of the}} <b>sovereign,</b> the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state, province, or territory is granted or withheld by the representatives of the <b>sovereign.</b> In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the <b>sovereign.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Chapel of the Order is the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Every four years, an {{installation}} ceremony, {{presided over by}} the Great Master, and a religious service are held in the Chapel; the <b>Sovereign</b> attends every alternate ceremony. The last such service was in May 2014 and was attended by the <b>Sovereign.</b> The <b>Sovereign</b> and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall in the choir of the chapel.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo and Jane {{sat down}} upon the couch, and Rollo poured out the money into Jennie's lap. It was all gold.

A {{mint mark}} distinguished the Ottawa Mint’s {{production of the}} <b>sovereigns.</b> All <b>sovereigns</b> produced in Ottawa had a “C” mint mark to signify that it was produced in Canada. The <b>sovereigns</b> of 1908 were Specimen coins only and its tiny mintage was struck merely to establish the series. [...] The production for the circulation of <b>sovereigns</b> began in 1909.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Sovereign</b> is {{traditionally}} advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were summoned {{to form the}} magnum concilium, or Great Council, {{which was one of}} the four councils belonging to the <b>Sovereign.</b> The other three were the Privy Council, Parliament (which was called the commune concilium, or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of the <b>Sovereign</b> on legal matters).|$|E
5|$|The monarch has {{a similar}} {{relationship}} with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The <b>Sovereign</b> appoints the First Minister of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales. In Scottish matters, the <b>Sovereign</b> acts {{on the advice of}} the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the <b>Sovereign</b> acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The <b>Sovereign</b> can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Scottish heraldry, use of the banner is not restricted to the <b>sovereign.</b> Several Great Officers of State who officially represent the <b>Sovereign</b> in Scotland are permitted to use the Royal Banner of Scotland, including; the First Minister of Scotland (as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland), Lord Lieutenants within their respective Lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by the <b>Sovereign.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1855, gold {{full and}} half <b>sovereigns</b> (worth {{respectively}} one pound sterling and ten shillings) were first minted by the Sydney Mint.

5|$|Royal <b>Sovereign</b> {{was laid}} down on 15 January 1914 at the HM Dockyard, Portsmouth. The ship was {{launched}} on 29 April 1915 and commissioned in May 1916. On 30 May 1916, {{three weeks after}} her commissioning, Royal <b>Sovereign</b> was present in Scapa Flow when the fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to sea. Jellicoe purposely left Royal <b>Sovereign</b> behind in port due to the inexperience of her crew; causing her to miss the Battle of Jutland the following day. In the months after the engagement, Royal <b>Sovereign</b> was quickly made ready for service with the fleet to further increase the numerical superiority of the Grand Fleet over the German High Seas Fleet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only time}} {{there has been}} a {{deviation}} from this composition was in the production of early Australian <b>sovereigns,</b> which used silver as part of the alloy, and in London <b>sovereigns</b> dated 1887, when an additional 1.25% silver was added {{in order to make the}} blanks softer for the new Joseph Boehm relief of Queen Victoria: 1887 London Mint <b>sovereigns</b> are more yellow than other London-produced <b>sovereigns.</b> This additional silver affected the amount of copper in the coin, not, of course, its gold content. (Nineteenth-century techniques of refining were not as advanced as today, and nineteenth-century <b>sovereigns</b> became more accurate in terms of their gold weight as silver – which is often naturally combined with gold – was removed as an impurity from the [...] "pure" [...] gold used. Such minor inconsistencies would not affect either their numismatic or bullion value).|$|R

5|$|Royal Sovereigns main {{opponent}} was {{the large}} Spanish first rate Santa Ana, {{with whom she}} was engaged for several minutes {{at the start of}} the action without support. During this time, Royal <b>Sovereign</b> was at one point engaged with five different enemy ships, and suffered heavy damage and casualties during the engagement, finally subduing the 112-gun Santa Ana after a duel lasting several hours. Both ships were left unmanageable at the end of the engagement, Royal <b>Sovereign</b> being taken in tow by HMS Euryalus into which Collingwood transferred his flag. Royal <b>Sovereign</b> had suffered nearly 150 casualties, Santa Ana over 300 by the end of the battle. Santa Ana was later abandoned by her captors and ultimately fell back into Spanish hands, but Royal <b>Sovereign</b> reached the safety of Gibraltar soon after the battle.|$|E
5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by <b>Sovereign</b> and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue <b>Sovereign.</b> <b>Sovereign</b> then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while <b>Sovereign</b> is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if {{it was left to}} perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before turning away from the proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Sovereign</b> has {{historically}} {{had the power}} to choose Knights of the Order.
