40|$|A general displacement-based shear and {{transverse}} normal deformable plate {{theory is}} reviewed. Shear and transverse normal deformable plate theories suitable for cylindrical bending {{problems have been}} deduced from the general plate theory by introducing certain general functions of the transverse coordinate into the displacement field approximation. This theory {{takes into account the}} transverse shear and normal deformation effects and unifies most of the classical and shear deformable theories available in the literature. A predictor-corrector method has been used for improving the accuracy of transverse stress analysis results and assessing the accuracy of composite plate/beam theories. In more detail, uniform <b>shear</b> deformable <b>plate</b> theory, parabolic <b>shear</b> deformable <b>plate</b> theory, general three-degree-of-freedom <b>shear</b> deformable <b>plate</b> theory, general four-degree- of-freedom transverse shear and normal deformable plate theory and general five-degree-of-freedom <b>shear</b> deformable <b>plate</b> theory are employed to improving their prediction performances of transverse shear and normal stresses.

Specifically, this project aimed to develop and evaluate alternative attachment designs for the bolted, tabbed bracket and evaluate the use of a larger diameter, keeper rod for use in the top cable attachment. From a group of over 25 alternative attachment concepts, two tabbed bracket designs were selected for evaluation through dynamic component testing: 1) the lateral <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> attachment and 2) the drop-in <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> attachment. The drop-in <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> concept did not perform as intended, as the vertical release load was too high and the lateral release loads were too low. Alternatively, the lateral <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> design provided vertical and lateral release loads very similar to the original bolted, tabbed bracket V 10. However, concerns were raised over the lack of rigidity in the attachment and the ease of installations of the <b>shear</b> <b>plate.</b> Thus, it was recommended that the lateral <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> design be modified and reevaluated prior to use in the full-scale system. Dynamic bogie or component testing of the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass keeper rod provided a quick cable release similar to the previous design. The increased strength of the rod also showed promise in distributing impact loads more uniformly to adjacent posts and helping reduce system deflections. Thus, the 3 / 16 -in.

40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>plate</b> {{measurements}} of bed shear stress under fixed and loose bed swash uprush flows are presented and contrasted. A <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> previously developed for fixed bed flows was modified and tested for coarse and fine grain loose beds. Transient flows were {{generated by a}} dam-break flow over initially dry horizontal and sloping beds, with flows upslope analogous to swash uprush flows on beaches. Performance of the <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> varied with grain size. For the coarse grained loose beds only the peak shear stress {{at the leading edge}} of the swash flow was consistently obtained; for fine grained loose beds the shear stress was reliably obtained over the whole uprush swash cycle. Data were obtained for varying thickness of loose bed material, commencing with a single grain layer, which correspond to partially starved bed conditions. The direct measurements clearly indicate that the bed shear stress comprises of a fluid shear stress component and a grain shear stress component. The grain shear stress increases linearly with sediment load and is significantly larger for the coarse loose grain bed tests due to the much larger normal stress compared to that for fine grain loose bed tests with the same number of grain layers. The data show a high degree of consistency with the classical theory of Bagnold (1956) and the derived coefficient of dynamic internal friction is similar to that observed by Hanes and Inman (1985) ...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural EngineeringKimberly W. KramerIn {{structural}} steel connection design, simple shear connections {{are one of}} the most common connection types utilized. The industry, especially from the side of the engineer, tends to lean toward using Double Clip Angle Connections as the default standard for simple shear connections. A double clip angle connection is a connection consisting of two angles transferring the shear forces from one member to the next either through bolts or welds. The design of Double Clip Angle Connections is efficient and the connections themselves are easy to fabricate. However, benefits to utilizing other types of shear connections exist. Many of these benefits are seen in the fabrication shop or during erection and construction. This is especially true of single <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> or shear tab connections when applied to open structure design. Shear tab connections consist of a single plate that transfers the shear forces from one member to the next with bolts or with welds. The design of shear tab connections can be a more involved process than the design of double clip angles. Sometimes the <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> or shear tab has to be longer than is typical. This is called an extended <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> connection. These extended shear plates can bring other variables into the design that typically don’t occur with Double Clip Angle Connections such as bending of the plate or the need for multiple bolt columns. However, with proper planning and detailing, the benefits and savings experienced in the fabrication or construction phase may outweigh what can be seen as a more laborious design task. The purpose of this report is to identify the possible benefits achieved in using each of these connections, highlight the differences in the design approach for each, and use a study model to compare the outcome of using one connection over another in the design of a typical open structure. Double clip angles are typically the most efficient approach when speed of design and simplicity of fabrication are the desired outcomes. However, <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> or shear tab connections have the potential to provide safer erection alternatives and materials savings if used in appropriate ways and with the right applications...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental {{investigations of the}} flow on a beach, i. e., the swash, due to solitary waves {{with the objective of}} understanding the flow processes that govern complex coastal hydrodynamics. The bed shear stress is identified as an important quantity and consequently, a <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> sensor is developed to make accurate measurements of the bed shear stress. Its size is designed to be small enough to give spatially local measurements and its bandwidth high enough to resolve time-varying forcing due to waves. Typically, <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> sensors are restricted to zero pressure gradient flows because secondary forces {{on the edge of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> caused by pressure gradients can introduce large errors. To address this issue, a theory is developed to analyze the pressure distribution at the edges of the <b>shear</b> <b>plate</b> and a new methodology is introduced for correcting for the pressure gradient force. Experimental results are presented that show that this methodology improves the accuracy of the sensor. The swash flow created by solitary waves beyond the stillwater shoreline on a plane, impermeable beach is studied. Measurements of the bed shear stress, flow velocities, water depths, bed pressure and shoreline motion are presented for a wide range of incident solitary waves that span different regimes of wave breaking. The flow evolution due to breaking solitary waves is found to be a gravity-driven flow that is scaled by the initial velocity of the shoreline, which, in turn, is shown to be predicted by measurements of wave height near the stillwater shoreline. Experimental results are presented that show how different wave breaking regimes influence the initial shoreline velocity, the swash flow evolution, the run-up and the time period of the swash. Time-histories of the bed shear stress are also presented, but a new normalization for the peak values of the bed shear stress using the initial shoreline velocity shows the crossshore variation of bed shear stress and the influence of different wave breaking regimes. The effects of bed friction are found to significantly alter the flow in the leading edge of the swash, near the moving shoreline. A theory is developed that considers the leading order dynamical balance in the swash tip, treating it in a bulk sense. Predictions of the shoreline motion from the theory compare very well to the measured shoreline motion. Experiments are also conducted to study the interaction between successive solitary waves incident on a beach. Two cases are examined: a strongly interacting case and a weakly interacting case. The parameters relevant to predicting the strength of interaction between the swash of successive solitary waves are given. Measurements of bed shear stress, bed pressure and velocity are also used to explain the complex boundary layer dynamics that occur in the interaction of the swash flows due to successive waves...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} hygrothermal {{conditions}} on the dynamic response of <b>shear</b> deformable laminated <b>plates</b> resting on a two-parameter (Pasternak-type) elastic foundation is investigated using a micro-to-macromechanical analytical model. The material properties of the composite {{are affected by the}} variation of temperature and moisture, and are based on a micromechanical model of a laminate. The governing equations are based on higher order <b>shear</b> deformation <b>plate</b> theory and include the plate–foundation interaction and hygrothermal effects. All four edges of the plate are assumed to be simply supported with no in-plane displacements. Analytical solutions of dynamic response for symmetric cross-ply and antisymmetric angle-ply laminated plates subjected to a transverse dynamic load under different sets of hygrothermal environmental conditions are obtained by using the state variable approach. The numerical illustrations concern the free vibration and dynamic response of <b>shear</b> deformable laminated <b>plates</b> resting on Pasternak-type elastic foundations with the Winkler elastic foundations being a limiting case. The influences played by temperature rise, the degree of moisture concentration, fiber volume fraction and foundation stiffness are studied.
