50|$|In operation, the <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motor</b> may {{be viewed}} as a {{transformer}} with a rotating secondary. When the rotor is not rotating in sync with the magnetic field, large rotor currents are induced; the large rotor currents magnetize the rotor and interact with the stator's magnetic fields to bring the rotor almost into synchronization with the stator's field. An unloaded <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motor</b> at rated no-load speed will consume electrical power only to maintain rotor speed against friction and resistance losses. As the mechanical load increases, so will the electrical load - the electrical load is inherently related to the mechanical load. This is similar to a transformer, where the primary's electrical load is related to the secondary's electrical load.|$|E

50|$|This {{is why a}} {{squirrel-cage}} {{blower motor}} may cause household lights to dim upon starting, but does not dim the lights on startup when its fan belt (and therefore mechanical load) is removed. Furthermore, a stalled <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motor</b> (overloaded or with a jammed shaft) will consume current limited only by circuit resistance as it attempts to start. Unless something else limits the current (or cuts it off completely) overheating and destruction of the winding insulation is the likely outcome.|$|E
50|$|DOL {{starting}} {{is sometimes}} used to start small water pumps, compressors, fans and conveyor belts. In {{the case of}} an asynchronous motor, such as the 3-phase <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motor,</b> the motor will draw a high starting current until it has run up to full speed. This starting current is typically 6-7 times greater than the full load current. To reduce the inrush current, larger motors will have reduced-voltage starters or variable speed drives in order to minimise voltage dips to the power supply.|$|E
5000|$|A {{shaded-pole}} motor {{is the original}} type of AC single-phase induction motor. A {{shaded-pole motor}} is a small <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motor</b> in which the auxiliary winding is composed of a copper ring or bar surrounding a portion of each pole. This auxiliary single-turn winding is called a shading coil. Currents induced in this coil by the magnetic field create a second electrical phase by delaying the phase of magnetic flux change for that pole (a shaded pole) enough to provide a 2-phase rotating magnetic field. The direction of rotation is from the unshaded side to the shaded (ring) side of the pole. [...] Since the phase angle between the shaded and unshaded sections is small, shaded pole motors produce only a small starting torque relative to torque at full speed. Shaded-pole motors of the asymmetrical type shown are only reversible via disassembly and flipping over the stator, though some similar-looking motors have small, switch-shortable auxiliary windings of thin wire instead of thick copper bars and can reverse electrically. Another method of electrical reversing involves four coils (two pairs of identical coils).|$|E

50|$|Compared to a {{squirrel-cage}} rotor, {{the rotor}} of the {{slip ring motor}} has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, and the current lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motors</b> is higher starting torque.|$|R

50|$|If {{the rotor}} of a {{squirrel}} cage motor were to run at the true synchronous speed, the flux in the rotor at any given place on the rotor would not change, and no current would be created in the squirrel cage. For this reason, ordinary <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motors</b> run at some tens of RPM slower than synchronous speed. Because the rotating field (or equivalent pulsating field) effectively rotates faster than the rotor, {{it could be said}} to slip past the surface of the rotor. The difference between synchronous speed and actual speed is called slip, and loading the motor increases the amount of slip as the motor slows down slightly. Even with no load, internal mechanical losses prevent the slip from being zero.|$|R

40|$|<b>Squirrel-cage</b> {{induction}} <b>motors</b> are {{the most}} widely used type of electric machinery in industrial applications thanks to their rugged, cheap and robust construction.

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work {{is to develop a}} tool for condition monitoring of <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motors</b> using axial magnetic flux measurements, and to design a diagnostics system for electrical motors. The basic theory of the measurements and systems was found through literature reviews and was further developed from the experimental results of {{this research}} work. Fluxgate magnetometers and Hall effect sensors are not reliable enough for condition monitoring purposes, but measurements by flux coil sensors can reach adequate reliability. The useful frequency area of the flux coil sensor is from about 0. 2 Hz to 15 kHz, an area is well applicable for condition monitoring of <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motors.</b> Output voltage is frequency dependent, increasing towards higher frequencies. Sufficient sensitivity is usually reached by a flux coil sensor having a diameter of about 30 cm and the number of turns of about 200. Sensitivity can be improved by increasing the diameter or number of turns of the coil. The sensor should be placed axially centred {{on the end of the}} motor, and measurements should be made with the loaded motor in steady operation. Output voltage is typically from the microvolt to millivolt level, however, installation inside the motor can increase it from tens of millivolts to some volts. The dynamic resolution requirement of measurement is about 70 dB and the highest line resolution needed for the spectrum analysis is about 3200 lines. Time base signal can be used to study rapid disturbances of flux caused by mechanical loading or switching of the frequency converter. Various motor failures cause specific variation to the frequency distribution of flux, so spectrum analysis is well applicable for condition monitoring. Reference measurement of each motor is required because stator winding factors, installation tolerances, operating conditions and mechanical load affect leakage flux. A broken rotor bar failure can be detected from the amplitude difference between the supply frequency and its rotor bar induced sideband. A broken rotor end ring failure can be detected by the amplitude difference between the slip frequency and the supply frequency. However, it was found that the stator current spectrum is a more reliable method of detecting both these rotor failures. The supply voltage asymmetry can also be evaluated by specific sidebands of axial flux. Turn to turn failure of the stator winding was most reliably detected by sidebands around the rotor slot pass frequencies. Equations for frequency converter supplied motors are the bases for similar equations, but the supply frequency is replaced by the output current frequency of the converter. The developed diagnostics system design for condition monitoring of ac motors includes stator current, flux coil, temperature, vibration, partial discharge, bearing current and voltage measurements. At the system diagnosis stage these measurable signals are divided to time base and frequency base signals and for each of them a fault indicator is determined. For flux coil measurements four fault indicators were found: rotor bar failure ratio, rotor end ring failure ratio, stator winding turn to turn ratio and supply voltage asymmetry operation ratio. With these failure indicators we determine failure location, state and cause. From this information a lifetime prediction of the motor is made. The results of this work are used to analyse flux coil measurements of <b>squirrel-cage</b> <b>motors.</b> In addition the research has led to a special application to monitor electric motors using an on-line condition monitoring system for paper machines and power plants...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{starting}} performance of <b>squirrel-cage</b> induction <b>motors,</b> the so-called 'skin effect' becomes very serious, which causes a highly uneven distribution of rotor-bar currents. The corresponding conduction losses of {{the upper and lower}} portions of rotor bars create high thermal stress, which may damage the rotor bars, particularly at the junction of rotor bars and end-rings.
