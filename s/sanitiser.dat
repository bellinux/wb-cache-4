40|$|Abstract Background New Zealand has {{relatively}} {{high rates of}} morbidity and mortality from infectious disease compared with other OECD countries, with infectious disease being more prevalent in children compared with others in the population. Consequences of infectious disease in children may have significant economic and social impact beyond the direct effects of the disease on the health of the child; including absence from school, transmission of infectious disease to other pupils, staff, and family members, and time off work for parents/guardians. Reduction of the transmission of infectious disease between children at schools could be an effective way of reducing the community incidence of infectious disease. Alcohol based no-rinse hand <b>sanitisers</b> provide an alternative hand cleaning technology, for which {{there is some evidence that}} they may be effective in achieving this. However, very few studies have investigated the effectiveness of hand <b>sanitisers,</b> and importantly, the potential wider economic implications of this intervention have not been established. Aims The primary objective of this trial is to establish if the provision of hand <b>sanitisers</b> in primary schools in the South Island of New Zealand, in addition to an education session on hand hygiene, reduces the incidence rate of absence episodes due to illness in children. In addition, the trial will establish the cost-effectiveness and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the intervention in this setting. Methods/Design A cluster randomised controlled trial will be undertaken to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hand <b>sanitisers.</b> Sixty-eight primary schools will be recruited from three regions in the South Island of New Zealand. The schools will be randomised, within region, to receive hand <b>sanitisers</b> and an education session on hand hygiene, or an education session on hand hygiene alone. Fifty pupils from each school in years 1 to 6 (generally aged from 5 to 11 years) will be randomly selected for detailed follow-up about their illness absences, providing a total of 3400 pupils. In addition, absence information will be collected on all children from the school rolls. Investigators not involved in the running of the trial, outcome assessors, and the statistician will be blinded to the group allocation until the analysis is completed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{potential}} for transmission {{of infectious diseases}} offered by the school environment {{are likely to be}} an important contributor to the rates of infectious disease experienced by children. This study aimed to test whether the addition of hand <b>sanitiser</b> in primary school classrooms compared with usual hand hygiene would reduce illness absences in primary school children in New Zealand. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This parallel-group cluster randomised trial took place in 68 primary schools, where schools were allocated using restricted randomisation (1 : 1 ratio) to the intervention or control group. All children (aged 5 to 11 y) in attendance at participating schools received an in-class hand hygiene education session. Schools in the intervention group were provided with alcohol-based hand <b>sanitiser</b> dispensers in classrooms for the winter school terms (27 April to 25 September 2009). Control schools received only the hand hygiene education session. The primary outcome was the number of absence episodes due to any illness among 2, 443 follow-up children whose caregivers were telephoned after each absence from school. Secondary outcomes measured among follow-up children were the number of absence episodes due to specific illness (respiratory or gastrointestinal), length of illness and illness absence episodes, and number of episodes where at least one other member of the household became ill subsequently (child or adult). We also examined whether provision of <b>sanitiser</b> was associated with experience of a skin reaction. The number of absences for any reason and the length of the absence episode were measured in all primary school children enrolled at the schools. Children, school administrative staff, and the school liaison research assistants were not blind to group allocation. Outcome assessors of follow-up children were blind to group allocation. Of the 1, 301 and 1, 142 follow-up children in the hand <b>sanitiser</b> and control groups, respectively, the rate of absence episodes due to illness per 100 child-days was similar (1. 21 and 1. 16, respectively, incidence rate ratio 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 18). The provision of an alcohol-based hand <b>sanitiser</b> dispenser in classrooms was not effective in reducing rates of absence episodes due to respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, the length of illness or illness absence episodes, or the rate of subsequent infection for other members of the household in these children. The percentage of children experiencing a skin reaction was similar (10. 4 % hand <b>sanitiser</b> versus 10. 3 % control, risk ratio 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 30). The rate or length of absence episodes for any reason measured for all children also did not differ between groups. Limitations of the study include that the study was conducted during an influenza pandemic, with associated public health messaging about hand hygiene, which may have increased hand hygiene among all children and thereby reduced any additional effectiveness of <b>sanitiser</b> provision. We did not quite achieve the planned sample size of 1, 350 follow-up children per group, although we still obtained precise estimates of the intervention effects. Also, it is possible that follow-up children were healthier than non-participating eligible children, with therefore less to gain from improved hand hygiene. However, lack of effectiveness of hand <b>sanitiser</b> provision on the rate of absences among all children suggests that {{this may not be the}} explanation. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of hand <b>sanitiser</b> in addition to usual hand hygiene in primary schools in New Zealand did not prevent disease of severity sufficient to cause school absence.

40|$|Microbial {{attachment}} and proliferation on a surface {{leads to the}} formation of a structure known as a biofllm. In this thesis attention is directed towards the attachment of microorganisms to submerged surfaces in private swimming pools Samples were taken from two private swimming pools located in West Lancashire, England. The planktonic phase of the water was sampled using a standard fluid grab technique and the submerged surfaces (e. g. the pool lining, the steps and the water recirculation trap) were sampled using swabs and a scalpel blade to scrape the surface. Using these techniques, thirteen different bacteria (e. g. Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp.) and one alga (Chlorella vulgaris) were isolated from the two private swimming poois. In both cases the use of a swimming pool <b>sanitiser</b> (Baquacil, ICI Chemicals) showed excellent control of the planktonic population. Only algae were recovered from the fluid grab sample when incubated in appropriate media. Bacteria were found to be present only on plates incubated aerobically and from areas where swabbing/scraping had taken place. No anaerobic bacteria were isolated even after a long incubation period of 120 h. On further investigation it was shown that two of the isolated species, Pseudomonas maltophilia and Ps. putida, were capable of producing extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Production of this material has been implicated in the initial adhesion of bacteria, and further, it can act as a barrier against the diffusion of the <b>sanitiser</b> so that organisms exhibit higher levels of tolerance to the added swimming pooi <b>sanitiser.</b> Laboratory studies demonstrated that planktonic populations of one of the isolates, Pseudomonas fluorescens, attached rapidly to the surface of PVC coupons from a planktonic population thereby mimicking the in vivo situation. The shortest time investigated for attachment (3. 5 h) demonstrated that up to 1 x 10 7 cells/cm 2 were firmly adhered to the surface. Attacimient to the coupons wasalso shown to provide resistance to the swimming pool <b>sanitiser</b> below, at and above the recommended levels (Chapter 2), the greatest increase in resistance being two fold. Planktonic populations of bacteria were reduced to acceptable levels after incubation for only 3 hours in a dilute medium. It was also shown that the organism attached to the surface produced extracellular material. On screening of Ps. fluorescens mutants (approximately 2000, induced by transposon mutagenesis, Chapter 4) for altered <b>sanitiser</b> resistance, it was found that 14 of these mutants had an increased resistance to the <b>sanitiser</b> above that shown by the wild type cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total cell protein extracts of thirteen of these mutants revealed that in 11 cases, a band with a molecular weight between 52, 000 and 54, 000 was induced or enhanced when biocide was added to the system. If a swimming pool is not to become a potential source of infection to the bathers then attention must be paid to the submerged surface-attached population of microorganisms. Planktonic sampling will indicate that there is little microbial activity within {{the main body of the}} pool water but the techniques used only assess the quality of the bulk fluid phase of the system and not the submerged surfaces. The attachment of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms to submerged surfaces must be accepted as a nornrnl occurrence. In this state, the organisms often exhibit increased resistance to the swimming pool <b>sanitiser.</b> Therefore, regular cleaning (i. e. scrubbing/vacuuming) of the submerged surfaces is suggested as a part of the recommended maintenance programme for domestic swimming pools of this type...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The NSW poultry {{processing}} industry {{has gone through}} an evolution of regulatory change over the past 100 years from an inspection system through to a HACCP-based food safety system audited by the NSW Food Safety Authority (FSA). This required the restructuring of legislation {{and an understanding of}} the appropriate microbiological standards by which the FSA could judge the effectiveness of the operator’s processing operation. This microbiological standard was developed following two surveys of the vast majority of registered poultry processors in NSW. These surveys demonstrated the microbiological outcomes that could be achieved by the processors. From this knowledge, a new standard for the levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) on product were established that were to be used by the operator and the regulator to judge the effectiveness of the operator’s program. Studies into the carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry in the plant and on the reliability of the microbiological tests being used within the survey and by industry were carried out. They found {{that there had been a}} significant reduction in carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry from 48. 6 % to 34. 2 % over two years. The test method utilised in the survey and one utilised by the Australian industry were shown to be able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium at 1 - 3 CFU per ml of carcase rinse fluid. An examination of E. coli by PCR to determine the likelihood that E. coli carried by NSW poultry were capable of inducing Haemorrhagic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) found no evidence of shigatoxin producing genes (stx 1 or stx 2) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli specific plasmid (ehxA). The attachment factor, intimin (eaeA) was found in E. coli from 93 of 430 carcases (21. 6 %). Campylobacter species were found on 94 % of all carcases in the first survey. A count of Campylobacter species on a series of carcases from one plant found an average of 163 CFU per cm 2 on the broiler chickens tested. Because raw poultry carry pathogens from the processing plant into the wider community, the use of two post-chill <b>sanitisers</b> was examined. This study found that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of pathogens being carried by raw poultry. The use of post-chill <b>sanitisers</b> provides a potential means of reducing the risk of foodborne illness arising from the handling of raw poultry and eating undercooked poultry meat...|$|R

Vegetables are {{an important}} source of nutrients, but they can host a large microbial population, particularly bacteria. Foodborne pathogens can contaminate raw vegetables at any stage of their production process with a potential for human infection. Appropriate washing can mitigate the risk of foodborne illness consequent to vegetable consumption by reducing pathogen levels, but few data are available to assess the efficacy of different practices. In the present work, six different washing methods, in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>sanitisers</b> (peracetic acid and percitric acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hypochlorite) and vinegar, were tested for their effectiveness in reducing Salmonella and Listeria counts after artificial contamination of raw rocket (Eruca vescicaria).

In the case of Listeria monocytogenes, all the examined washing methods were effective, with 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite solution and a solution of peracetic and percitric acids displaying the best performances (2 and 1. 5 Log reductions, respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background Interventions to {{increase}} hand washing in {{schools have been}} advocated {{as a means to}} reduce the transmission of pandemic influenza and other infections. However, the feasibility and acceptability of effective school-based hygiene interventions is not clear. Methods A pilot study in four primary schools in East London was conducted to establish the current need for enhanced hand hygiene interventions, identify barriers to their implementation and to test their acceptability and feasibility. The pilot study included key informant interviews with teachers and school nurses, interviews, group discussions and essay questions with the children, and testing of organised classroom hand hygiene activities. Results In all schools, basic issues of personal hygiene were taught especially in the younger age groups. However, we identified many barriers to implementing intensive hygiene interventions, in particular time constraints and competing health issues. Teachers' motivation to teach hygiene and enforce hygienic behaviour was primarily educational rather than immediate infection control. Children of all age groups had good knowledge of hygiene practices and germ transmission. Conclusion The pilot study showed that intensive hand hygiene interventions are feasible and acceptable but only temporarily during a period of a particular health threat such as an influenza pandemic, and only if rinse-free hand <b>sanitisers</b> are used. However, in many settings there may be logistical issues in providing all schools with an adequate supply. In the absence of evidence on effectiveness, the scope for enhanced hygiene interventions in schools in high income countries aiming at infection control appears to be limited {{in the absence of a}} severe public health threat. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hydroponic {{production}} was initially explored {{as an alternative}} to field production due to the ease of plant growth control and the hopes of preventing the majority of disease causing agents known to be present in general soil environments. Of primary concern in terms of pathogens are the water-borne and water-motile zoosporic fungi (especially Pythium spp.) which are able to spread easily throughout the system and cause root-rot and wilting. Few pesticides are currently registered for use in hydroponic systems due to the high costs of registration, while registered pesticides carry a high cost to the grower. Recent legislative moves by numerous countries are also resulting in a trend towards the re-use of hydroponic nutrient solution. As a result such hydroponic solutions require a greater level of disinfection to prevent disease outbreaks but without resulting in chemical buildup of phytotoxic and environmental concern. <b>Sanitiser</b> formulation has seen significant changes {{over the last few years}} resulting in sanitisers being used in many new areas and in a more environmentally friendly nature. Although sanitisers are not designed to have specific action against micro-organisms (as is the case with fungicides and anti-microbial agents such as antibiotics), most sanitisers are able to act on cell membranes due to the inherent surfactant properties. This study attempted to determine the suitability of various sanitisers and chemicals as alternate means of control of Pythium in recirculating gravel hydroponic systems by: 1). Exposing Pythium zoospores in a water suspension to the sanitisers Actsol®, Agral 90 ®, Fitosan®, Prasin®, Purogene®, TecsaClor®, Sporekill® and copper (as copper (I) sulphate) which all managed to eliminate 80 % or more of the viable inoculum within a 10 minute exposure time at relatively low concentrations. 2). Testing the above sanitisers for phytotoxicity effects on cucumber plants in a static hydroculture system under laboratory conditions and lettuce plants in a gravel bed hydroponic system under greenhouse conditions. Purogene® and TecsaClor® exhibited a slight growth promotion effect at low concentrations, yet still caused negative phytotoxic effects when dosed at high concentrations. All other sanitisers exhibited some measure of phytotoxicity, observed as growth retardation and leaf discolouration, with phytotoxic effects increasing with increasing concentrations. Copper sulphate was found to be the most phytotoxic chemical tested. 3). Addition of the sanitisers to a small scale hydroponic system (greenhouse), as well as to a semi-commercial scale (field) gravel bed hydroponic system artificially infested with Pythium and cultivated with lettuce. The sanitisers were also compared to a commercially available fungicide, Phytex®. Only Phytex® and Purogene® managed to effectively reduce disease incidence and promote growth over an untreated, Pythium infested control. The results indicated that Purogene® was the most effective for application into a gravel bed hydroponic system cultivated with lettuce, while no <b>sanitiser</b> treatment was able to equal the improved growth and disease control recorded with treatment of the commercial fungicide Phytex®. Although all the sanitisers were able to reduce levels of Pythium inoculum in the hydroponic nutrient solution, this beneficial effect did not translate into increased yields, due to the growth retardation due to phytotoxic effects.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis examined the regulation of DNA repair pathways in response to agents shown to induce oxidative stress and oxidative damage to cellular DNA in human dermal fibroblasts. Non-cytotoxic doses of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), UVB irradiation, hypochlorite (H 0 C 1) and vitamin C were established. Measurement of base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors using a ribonuclease protection assay showed little modulation of gene transcript levels in response to treatment with H 2 O 2, UVB, H 0 C 1 or vitamin C. Significant changes in protein expression of the BER factors 8 -oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGGl) and human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (hAPE) and of the NER factors human homologue of Rad 23 (hHR 23 B) and Xeroderma pigmentosum protein A (XPA) in response to oxidative stress were not observed. Likewise, significant changes in endonuclease nicking activity (measured as the excision activity at a known site of oxidative DNA damage) were not observed. Studies in MCF- 7, MDA-MB- 468, MDA-MB- 436, MDA-MB- 231, T 47 -D, ZR- 75. 1 and HBL- 100 human breast cancer cell lines revealed significantly elevated endonuclease nicking activity in the MDA-MB- 436 cell line compared to human dermal fibroblasts. hi contrast to the other breast cancer cell lines under investigation, MDA-MB- 436 cells {{were found to have}} a relatively low gene expression of the nucleotide pool <b>sanitiser,</b> human MutT homologue (hMTHl). The other breast cancer cell lines possessed increased gene expression of hMTHl relative to dermal fibroblasts, which may be as a response to increased oxidative stress generated {{as a consequence of the}} carcinogenesis process. In conclusion, regulation of DNA repair pathways in response to oxidative stress may be an important consequence in the carcinogenesis process. hMTHl expression and endonuclease nicking activity may provide useful tools for investigations into carcinogenesis in the future...|$|E
40|$|Minimally {{processed}} (MP) {{fruits and}} vegetables are a growing market segment in Australia. Chlorinated water is commonly used in the sanitising washing steps of minimal processing. However, {{there is a growing}} concern over the presence of organo-chemical residues, such as chloramines and trihalomethanes, together with other by-products derived from the use of chlorine. A number of alternative sanitising systems are available for water treatment, and one of these utilises the electrolytic generation of silver in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. In the current study, this system has been investigated for its potential application as an alternative <b>sanitiser</b> to wash horticultural produce including MP {{fruits and vegetables}}. The developed system (silver/hydrogen peroxide) was also tested to disinfect fruit juices and liquid milk. In a resting cell test system, electrochemically generated silver (5 - 5000 ppb) and hydrogen peroxide (0. 04 - 40 ppm) showed a bactericidal effect on Pseudomonas fluorescens, a predominant bacterium on MP leafy salad products. This bactericidal effect was observed after treatment with silver or hydrogen peroxide separately and in combination. However, the combined treatment (silver and hydrogen peroxide) produced a more severe effect. Several trials have also investigated the use of silver nitrate as an alternative source of silver and the results showed a similar reduction in the microbial count. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of silver on 20 strains including species of Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Escherichia, Xanthomonas, Clavibacter and yeasts ranged from 100 - 150 ppb. Five silver resistant isolates were also developed from parent cultures by growth in successively higher concentrations of silver ions to investigate the mechanisms of silver resistance in the developed resistant strains. The tolerance of both parent and resistant strains was examined against silver, hydrogen peroxide, and other heavy metals, including copper, cadmium and zinc. The resistant isolates showed higher levels of resistance towards copper and cadmium, indicating a possible cross-resistance to these metals. Additionally, similar mechanism(s) of resistance may be present in the derived silver resistant isolates as those that have already been reported for copper and cadmium resistance in microorganisms. The silver resistance determinant recently reported by Silver and Gupta in 2000 was used to identify a similar silver resistance determinant in the derived silver resistant isolates using PCR techniques. The PCR product corresponding to silE gene was used to amplify Escherichia coli carrying a silver resistant plasmid pMG 101 and the silver resistant strains. However, the specific silver resistant determinant was not found in the derived isolates, which may indicate that other mechanisms may be involved in the derived isolates. The enhanced bactericidal effect of silver in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was further evaluated as a <b>sanitiser</b> in the washing steps for minimally processed vegetables including, lettuce, broccoli and carrots. Results from both lab and pilot scale washing trials showed the potential use of silver/hydrogen peroxide to reduce the populations of Pseudomonads, Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts in minimally processed products during storage at 4 or 12 C. The application of the proposed system was also extended to fruit juices and milk as a possible alternative to thermal treatment. The effect of the combined silver and hydrogen peroxide treatment on spoilage yeast populations in fruit juices was found to be significant at approved concentrations of both disinfectants. Application of this technology in milk systems was not as promising due to the chelating effect of milk organic constituents on silver. The development and application of the silver/hydrogen peroxide disinfectant system to disinfect water and fruit juices, and wash fresh-cut produce will have potential applications in the food industry as a possible alternative to chlorination and thermal pasteurisation. The success of this novel technology requires appropriate regulatory measures and consumer acceptance. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to farmer requests after milk from their herds {{was rejected by}} processors due to poor quality, a study was carried out from April to October 2011 to determine the prevalence of sub clinical mastitis, associated risk factors and causative micro-organisms. Samples were collected from 195 dairy cows on 23 randomly selected dairy farms delivering milk to Isangano, Kirebe and Nyagatare milk collection centres in Nyagatare District, Rwanda. The Draminski ® Mastitis Detector was used to detect sub clinical mastitis in individual cows based on milk electrical conductivity changes. Risk factors for mastitis that were evaluated included teat-end condition, cow dirtiness, breed, parity, age and stage of lactation. Relationships of these factors with mastitis status were determined using Chi-square analysis, and relative importance as causes of mastitis was assessed using logistic regression. Samples from 16 sub clinical mastitis positive dairy cows were analysed to identify causative micro-organisms using Dairy Quality Control Inspection analytical kits. Sub clinical mastitis prevalence was 52 % across the farms. It was higher with increases in, amongst other risk factors, teat-end damage severity, cow dirtiness, and level of pure dairy breed genetics. The risk factors considered accounted for 62 % of mastitis prevalence; teat-end condition alone accounted for 30 %. Most of the mastitis cases (87. 5 %) were caused by coliform bacteria. Considering that farmers are upgrading their local Ankole cows to cross-breed dairy cows that {{are more susceptible to}} mastitis, results from this study indicate the need to dip the teats of cows in <b>sanitisers,</b> improve cow hygiene, and introduce mastitis prevention and control programmes...|$|R
40|$|Food {{safety is}} a {{priority}} for the food industry and to achieve this result a correct plant sanitation programme is of the utmost importance. Among various disinfection techniques, an emerging one {{is represented by the}} use of electrolysed water (EW) as the disinfecting agent. The use of EW is compliant with the desire to find alternatives to chlorination and heat treatments, representing a green cleaning alternative to toxic disinfectants. EW is an activated liquid, obtained by passing a diluted saline solution (NaCl, KCl or MgCl 2) through an electrolytic cell, thus causing the production from the anode side of electrolysed oxidising water, containing high dissolved oxygen, free chlorine and characterised by a low pH (2. 3 – 2. 7) and a high oxidation–reduction potential (ORP> 1, 000 mV). At the same time from the cathode side electrolysed reduced water is produced, with high pH (10. 0 – 11. 5), high dissolved hydrogen and low ORP (800 to 900 mV). Unlike other chemical disinfectants, EW is not harmful for skin and mucous membranes and is quite easy to handle. Furthermore, the use of EW is relatively inexpensive and, above all, is a sustainable technique. Currently used <b>sanitisers</b> (e. g. glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, etc.) are effective, but their adverse effects on the environment are well known. Differently from these chemicals, the use of EW has a reduced impact on the environment and because of its properties, it may find several applications in the food industry. In this work, the characteristics and some EW applications as sustainable sanitation technique applied in the food industry are reported and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop {{improved}} cleaning strategies for controlling biofilms on the surfaces of membranes used in dairy ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) plants. Eleven UF / RO membrane modules from 7 different New Zealand dairy membrane processing plants were received after typical cleaning-in-place (CIP) procedures. Microorganisms were isolated from both the retentate and permeate sides of these membrane surfaces and from the liquids collected from a UF membrane plant. Also some foulants scraped from a RO membrane were tested. The routine CIP currently used in the dairy plants was not adequate to completely remove organic material, including microbial cells, proteins and carbohydrates from the membrane surfaces. These residues may influence the surface characteristics and interactions between microorganisms and membranes and thus affect biofilm formation. Thirteen isolates including both bacteria and yeast were identified using biochemical techniques. Klebsiella oxytoca were isolated from 3 different membrane plant sites. This is, {{so far as we}} know, the first report of K. oxytoca being isolated from dairy membrane surfaces. The ability of the 13 strains to attach to negatively charged polystyrene surfaces was tested using a microtitre plate assay. Three K. oxytoca strains demonstrated higher ability to adhere than the other strains, suggesting that these strains might {{play an important role in}} developing biofilms on dairy membrane surfaces. Two K. oxytoca strains (K. B 006 from plant A, UF and K. TR 002 from plant C, RO) that performed best in the microtitre screening assay with respect to attachment capabilities were chosen for the remainder of the study. The cell surface hydrophobicity of all isolates was determined using the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon assay (MATH) and the cell surface charge was determined by measuring the surface zeta potential. These two characteristics did not show a clear relationship with the adherence of the isolated strains. However, it was found that bacterial attachment was enhanced in the presence of whey or mixed strains. A commercial biofilm reactor CBR 90 was modified for developing biofilms on membranes and investigating strategies for biofilm removal. Biofilms of single and dual K. oxytoca strains were developed under a continuous flow of whey. The saturated biofilm was approximately 8 log 10 CFU cm- 2. The results of our study suggested that the whey protein concentration, membrane type including membrane material (polyethersulfone (PES) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)), membrane age (used and new), bacterial strain and the interactions between different microorganisms are all significant factors for biofilm development on membrane surfaces. Three enzymatic cleaners and four <b>sanitisers,</b> including sodium hypochlorite (pH 6. 5, 200 ppm free available chlorine (FAC)), Perform® (peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide, 2 % v/v), ozonated water (pH 7. 0, 0. 5 ppm free available ozone (FAO)) and anolyte of MIOX® electrolysed water (EW) (pH 6. 8, 120 ppm FAC) were tested for their efficacies in killing culturable cells from biofilms formed by single or dual K. oxytoca strains on used PES membrane surfaces. With no sanitation applied, two of three enzymatic cleaners performed better than sodium hypochlorite (pH 10. 8 - 11, 200 ppm FAC) commonly used for CIP of UF membranes in the dairy industry. The four <b>sanitisers</b> were used to treat the membranes after a CIP wash regime. The results indicated that if a dairy processor were to use a standard CIP on membrane systems, then a further flush with MIOX® EW anolyte would reduce residual attached microbial populations further. In addition, using protease followed by a sanitation (sodium hypochlorite, Perform® or anolyte of MIOX® EW) produced the best clean based on a greater than 2 log reduction in residual cells and left no culturable and viable cells at a detection limit of 0. 1 log 10 CFU cm- 2...|$|R
