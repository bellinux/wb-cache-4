25|$|Rijkaard has evidently {{learned to}} curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a {{portrait}} of calm and stability in training and along the touchline. He rarely courts controversy {{in the media and}} is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team's play <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> when faced with intense rivalry or criticism. The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard's commitment to playing stylish attacking football. During the team's 2004–05 and 2005–06 campaigns, the coach frequently fielded a 4–3–3 formation, a system which encouraged the creativity of the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks. Within this system, the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield, which frequently advanced to participate in the attack. The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents' half of the field, applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking.|$|E

[...] Sixty-five years later, in an obituary tribute, Peter Heyworth wrote in the same newspaper: [...] "From Nikisch he had early acquired an immaculate stick technique and was quietly scathing about conductors who used their anatomy to indicate their artistic requirements.... In an occupation ridden with inflated egos and circus tricksters Boult brought a rare probity to everything he undertook." ...|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Record Plant, RCA Studios, and Capitol Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1975. Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself,</b> I really had fun making this record, and I thought it might interest you {{to know something about}} each song. After all, I wouldn't want to be a chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E
500|$|Festivities {{began in}} the {{afternoon}} {{on the day before}} his birthday, when Hitler rode in the lead car of a motorcade of fifty white limousines along architect Albert Speer's newly completed East-West Axis, the planned central boulevard for Welthauptstadt Germania, which was to be the new capital after the planned victory in World War II. Hitler, anticipating that Speer would give a speech, was amused when he evaded this by briefly announcing that the work should <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself.</b> The next event was a torchlit procession of appointments from all over Germany, which Hitler reviewed from a balcony in the Reich Chancellery. Then, at midnight, Hitler's courtiers congratulated him and presented him with gifts, including, [...] "Statues, bronze casts, Meissen porcelain, oil-paintings, tapestries, rare coins, antique weapons, and a mass of other presents, many of them kitsch. Hitler admired some, made fun of others, and ignored most." ...|$|E
500|$|British foreign {{minister}} George Canning {{was concerned that}} {{in the event of}} a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted. [...] In 1823, he proposed to the American minister to Great Britain, Richard Rush, that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force. [...] Rush asked for instructions from President James Monroe. The President consulted with his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States. [...] Nevertheless, Monroe's Secretary of State, future president John Quincy Adams, felt that if the United States was going to set forth its principles, it should <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> and not seem to be following the lead of powerful Britain. [...] Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.|$|E

[...] Donald E. Cameron, who delivered the eulogy at the funeral remarked of Primrose, [...] "Colonel Primrose never sought for himself or for his men more than that their record of service should be allowed to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself.</b> Somewhat austerely he clung to the tradition of the service that duty faithfully discharged its own reward." [...] An obituary published shortly after his death described him as [...] "courageous, outspoken and firm in dealing with his criminals." [...] John W.

Primrose was one of the outstanding officers of the force. … He was a good citizen and a good police officer and a man of many admirable qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional.

But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done."

[...] Colin Joyce of Spin called the song an [...] "unbridled joy", and noted that while {{it may not be}} included on The Pink Print, the album would be [...] "lucky, however, to feature any track half as exuberant as this one." [...] A writer for MTV News UK praised both the production and vocals on [...] "Yasss Bish", saying that Minaj's [...] "melodic" [...] vocals and [...] "fierce" [...] rap delivery were {{the best part of the}} song. Several critics noted a musical departure from the pop and dance-pop stylings of her second studio album [...] (2012). MTV News writer Emilee Lindner said [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] found Minaj going back to her original sound, saying: [...] "Nicki Minaj is letting her rapping <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself.</b> She's left her colorful wigs, fancy robes and tutus behind — along with the hyper-pop production of some of her biggest hits — and now she's getting back to her roots." [...] Emma Goddard of Bustle praised the chemistry between the two rappers and saw the song as a change from the more upbeat sound found in Minaj's catalogue, which she credited with [...] "show her rapping prowess much more". Writing for The Source, Khari said of [...] "Yasss Bish": [...] " [...] sheds the wig and the excessive make-up, we get the most gorgeous Nicki we've seen in her career.

Bäckman even hints that Politkovskaya was depressed and ordered her own murder. According to Bäckman, Politkovskaya, a Russian writer and human rights activist, was an American agent. He also criticizes Finns' reaction to the murder. Bäckman accused Finnish Green League politician Heidi Hautala and the Finnish media of inciting hatred towards Russia and Vladimir Putin.
