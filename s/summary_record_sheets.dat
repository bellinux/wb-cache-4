Intensive survey transects are identified by transect survey unit number and, if they are associated with identified sites, by ID number and/or site name. Intensive transect survey site names are the site numbers given in Evelyn Adkins' catalogue in the "Intensive Transect Survey" article in the forthcoming volume Aphrodisias Regional Survey: Special Studies (for example, "Adkins 12 " in the database indicates site number 12 in Adkins' catalogue).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore the way a {{supranational}} institution is imposing diverse forms of regulations on the production of discourse, and to interrogate the reasons for these choices and their consequences on the language practices within the institution. The research is built on the analysis of <b>summary</b> <b>records,</b> a frequently used text in different bodies of the specific institution I am working on: The United Nations. After exploring the general concerns of the UN about the documentation, I will explicate the underlying ideologies that appear in the instruction manuals for the writing of <b>summary</b> <b>records.</b> In finishing I will make a comparative analysis based on two different oral communications and their original <b>summary</b> <b>records,</b> focusing on the process of textualisation/transposition. This will allow me to interrogate the status of these specific documents within the ideology of the institution, but also to show how theideology of objectivity, central for the institution, is reflected through the linguistic conceptions and institutional practices...|$|R
