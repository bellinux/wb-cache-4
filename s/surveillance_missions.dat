5|$|The Germans {{had begun}} massing troops near the Soviet border {{even before the}} {{campaign}} in the Balkans had finished. By {{the third week of}} February 1941, 680,000 German soldiers were gathered in assembly areas on the Romanian-Soviet border. In preparation for the attack, Hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million German troops and approximately 690,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border regions. Additional Luftwaffe operations included numerous aerial <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions</b> over Soviet territory many months before the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese Air Force had {{purchased}} 12 Merlins under a €446 million contract, {{the first of}} which was delivered on 22 December 2004. The type has been used to conduct transport, search and rescue, and maritime <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions,</b> progressively replacing the Aérospatiale Puma previously tasked with these missions. The main role of Portuguese AW101s is to perform search and rescue missions within Portugal's maritime zone. They are operated by 751 Squadron and are kept on constant alert at three bases: Montijo near Lisbon, Lajes Field on the Azores, and Porto Santo Island.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Australia {{continued}} to retain forces in Malaysia {{as part of}} the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack, with this commitment initially including significant air, ground and naval forces. However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973, and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft. Australian submarines reportedly undertook a number of clandestine <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions</b> throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the Orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights.|$|E

5|$|Reinforcements, {{consisting}} of elements from the QRF, 10th Mountain Division soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, Pakistan Army tanks and Malaysian armored personnel carriers, finally arrived at 1:55am on 4 October. The combined force worked until dawn {{to free the}} pilot's body, receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night. All the casualties were loaded onto the armored personnel carriers, and {{the remainder of the}} force was left behind and {{had no choice but to}} move out on foot. AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement. The main force of the convoy arrived at the Pakistani Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6:30am, thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the Vietnam War. Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded. Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000. Although Task Force Ranger's few missions were successes, the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force's failure to complete their stated mission, capturing Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994. The withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on March 1995. Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed, USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia. SOF performed reconnaissance and <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions,</b> assisted with humanitarian relief, protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols. Additionally, they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{the problem}} of {{employing}} multiple UAVs for carrying out a Coordinated Strike and a Multiple UAV <b>Surveillance</b> <b>mission</b> has been addressed. The goal of the Coordinated Strike mission is for multiple UAVs to cooperate in order to simultaneously arrive at a high priority target {{to carry out a}} coordinated strike. The coordination strategy is based on coordination variables and coordination functions. A distributed system architecture is proposed that allows vehicles to communicate coordinating information across the team without reliance on a central ground controller. Simulations have been conducted to illustrate the performance of the coordination strategy under an actuator fault in single and multiple vehicles. The Multiple UAV Surveillance problem has been investigated by developing a hypothetical Border <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Mission,</b> wherein a UAV team is tasked to monitor a region along a border between two countries. The goal of the UAVs is to cover the entire surveillance region, while minimizing the team cost, which is a function of each vehicle's fuel consumption and mission time. Three fault cases in a single vehicle in the team have been simulated, namely (1) actuator; (2) sensor; and (3) simultaneous actuator and sensor faults. These faults necessitate a resource allocation problem to be solved, which is used to determine the configuration of the team engaged in the <b>surveillance</b> <b>mission.</b> The team chosen to perform the <b>surveillance</b> <b>mission</b> is the one that incurs the minimum cost for performing the mission...|$|R

According to Dornier Seawings, the Seastar's flight endurance can be extended by cruising on only a single engine to around 11 flight hours for <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions.</b> It is also claimed that the Seastar is one of the fastest flying boats on the market.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{deployment}} of EC-121Cs {{began with the}} 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, based at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts. Operational on 21 December 1954, the 551st AEWCW subsequently upgraded to EC-121D and later EC-121H Warning Stars. Its Pacific counterpart was the 552nd AEWCW, based at McClellan Air Force Base, California, which became operational on 1 July 1955. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the 552nd AEWCW also had administrative control of the 966th AEWCS, based at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida. The 966th had a dual mission: monitoring activity in Cuban airspace and flying Gold Digger missions (continuous tracks of U-2 <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions).</b>|$|E

25|$|Starting in October 1951, {{electronic}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions</b> {{were flown}} from U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point in the Philippines (and, later from the Naval Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, and later Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan, by a secretive unit that eventually gained the designation Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1). Long missions were flown {{along the coast}} (about 30 NM offshore) of Vietnam, China, North Korea and the eastern Soviet Union, and were of a highly secret nature; the aircraft sometimes masqueraded as regular P2V Neptunes in radio communications, and often flew with false serial numbers (Bureau Numbers) painted under the tail. Operational missions were always flown at night, during the dark with the moon when possible, and with no external running lights.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{passenger}} airliner {{is essentially}} a flying robot, with two humans to manage it. The autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, normal flight, and even landing. Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military <b>surveillance</b> <b>missions.</b> Some can even fire on targets under command. UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, {{without the need for}} a command from a human. Other flying robots include cruise missiles, the Entomopter, and the Epson micro helicopter robot. Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, propelled by paddles, and guided by sonar.|$|E
