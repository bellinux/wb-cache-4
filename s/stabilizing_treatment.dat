50|$|There {{are some}} {{challenges}} with implementing these quality-based incentives in emergency medicine in that patients {{are often not}} given a definitive diagnosis in the ED, {{making it difficult to}} allocate payments through coding.

It is also difficult to quantify the savings due to preventive care during emergency <b>treatment</b> (i.e. workup, <b>stabilizing</b> <b>treatments,</b> coordination of care and discharge, rather than a hospital admission).

In the United States, opiate replacement therapy is tightly regulated in methadone clinics and under the DATA 2000 legislation.

A modest (but not statistically significant) improvement in behavioral scores after treatment was observed in both fMRI tasks. There were brain activation increases in the semantic association task after treatment, and the differences in brain activation present in the comparison of AD patients' baseline images with those of controls were not detectable after treatment. In the target detection task, regions that were activated in the elderly controls but not in the baseline images of the AD group also showed significant activation after treatment. Overall, however, the increases were modest and might reflect the heterogeneity of clinical response to treatment in this small group.

Dry heat treatments at 190 °C produce a water insoluble material, that is stiffer than the methanol treated equivalent but without significant secondary structural changes. Honeybee silk proteins are particularly high in Lys, Ser, Thr, Glu and Asp.

Its possible role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) is particularly important, as AD remains a public health concern with no current efficient treatment. Vitamin D administration could be a multitarget <b>stabilizing</b> <b>treatment</b> for AD since vitamin D simultaneously targets several factors leading to neurodegeneration through immunoregulatory, antioxidant and anti-ischemic actions, {{as well as the}} regulation of neurotrophic factors, acetylcholine neurotransmitter and clearance of amyloid beta peptide, and the avoidance of hyperparathyroidism. By preventing neuronal loss, the question is whether correcting hypovitaminosis D among older adults could also prevent AD-related cognitive decline. The cross-sectional associations between the vitamin D intakes - whether from diet, sun exposure or drug supplements - and cognition strengthened this hypothesis, but prevented the finding of a cause and effect link. Pre-post studies showed an improvement of cognition concomitant with the increase in 25 -hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. One randomized trial found that supraphysiological doses of vitamin D were not better than physiological doses at improving cognition in AD. At this stage, only clinical trials testing vitamin D supplements versus placebo can further determine the impact of vitamin D administration on cognition and AD with higher levels of evidence.

The present study was designed to identify an appropriate mouse strain for modeling some behavioral domains of mania and to evaluate the effects of drugs using this strain. The study compared the behavior of four strains: Black Swiss, C 57 Bl/ 6, CBA/J and A/J mice in a battery of tests that included spontaneous activity; sweet solution preference; light/dark box; resident-intruder; forced-swim and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. Based on the ‘manic-like’ behavior demonstrated by the Black Swiss strain, the study evaluated the effects of the mood stabilizers valproate and lithium and of the antidepressant imipramine in the same tests using this strain. Results indicated that lithium and valproate attenuate the ‘manic-like’ behavior of Black Swiss mice whereas imipramine had no effects.

Long-term treatment studies of youth with BD are lacking. This paper provides longitudinal observations of response to mood stabilizers early in the course of illness in youth with BD. Method: We report on 15 research patients who, as adolescents, met DSM-IV lifetime criteria for a bipolar spectrum disorder and required long-term treatment. These youths derived from families with one parent having BD whose course and long-term treatment response were determined in accordance with research criteria. The patients were offered lithium, and if they failed to respond or refused it, they were treated with either an anticonvulsant or an atypical antipsychotic. Using a validated scale, an independent rater retrospectively blindly scored the response to long-term treatment. Results: Those patients who stabilized on lithium derived from lithium-responsive families, whereas those who stabilized on an antipsychotic derived from lithium-nonresponsive families. The clinical course in the youths stabilized by lithium differed from that in the youths stabilized by an atypical antipsychotic.

It is unclear whether modifications also occur in the nuclear matrix, a mainly proteinaceous structure that conceivably acts as a nuclear framework. We have investigated whether biochemical and morphological alterations of the nuclear matrix prepared from apoptotic HL- 60 cells were dependent on the manipulations to which isolated nuclei were subjected before DNase I digestion and 2 M NaCl extraction. Our results showed that the stabilizing procedures employed to preserve the inner fibrogranular network and nucleolar remnants of the matrix (i. e., a 37 degrees C incubation; exposure to sodium tetrathionate at 4 degrees C; exposure to sodium tetrathionate at 37 degrees C) had no effect on the protein recovery of apoptotic nuclear matrices, which was always approximately two- to fivefold less than in control matrices. Moreover, one- and two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins showed that, in apoptotic samples, striking quantitative changes were present, as compared with controls. Once again, these changes were seen irrespective of the stabilizing procedures employed.

40|$|The {{presence}} of heterogeneity of variance across groups {{indicates that the}} standard statistical model for treatment effects no longer applies. Specifically, the assumption that treatments add a constant to each subject's development fails. An alternative model is required to represent how treatment effects are distributed across individuals. We develop in this article a simple statistical model to demonstrate the link between heterogeneity of variance and random treatment effects. Next, we illustrate with results from two previously published studies how a failure to recognize the substan-tive importance of heterogeneity of variance obscured significant results present in these data. The article concludes with a review and synthesis of techniques for modeling variances. Although these methods have been well established in the statistical literature, they are not widely known by social and behavioral scientists. Psychological researchers have tended historically to view heterogeneity of variance as a methodological nuisance, an un-welcome obstacle {{in the pursuit of}} inferences about the effects of treatments on means. In their discussion of variance hetero-geneity, standard texts concentrate on identifying conditions under which such heterogeneity can safely be ignored so that standard analyses of means may proceed. It is usually argued that heterogeneity can be ignored when statistical tests for means are robust to violation of the homogeneity assumption (Glass & Hopkins, 1984, pp. 238 - 240; Hays, 1981, p. 287; Winer, 1971, pp. 37 - 39).
