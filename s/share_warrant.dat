5000|$|Bearer shares - Are a legal {{instrument}} denoting company ownership, {{and are usually}} {{in the form of}} share warrants. A <b>share</b> <b>warrant</b> is a document which states that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares stated in it. If authorised by its articles, a company may convert any fully paid shares to [...] "share warrants". These warrants are easily transferable without any need for a transfer document; that is, they can simply be passed from hand to hand. When share warrants are issued, the company must strike out the name of the shareholder from its register of members and state the date of issue of the warrant and the number of shares to which it relates. Subject to the articles, a <b>share</b> <b>warrant</b> can be surrendered for cancellation. If so, the holder is entitled to be re-entered into the register of members. Vouchers are usually issued with the share warrants in order that any dividends may be claimed. (Bearer shares have been abolished in the UK by the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. Existing Bearer shares must be converted to registered shares by February 2016 or the company will be obliged to apply to the Court to cancel them.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{values of}} the famous Subscription Shares issued by the South Sea Company in 1720 have to be split into two {{components}} {{before they can be}} understood. One component was a fractional claim upon one original share in the firm. The other component, however, was a bundle of share warrants. The information contained in <b>share</b> <b>warrant</b> values is potentially helpful in understanding the South Sea Bubble. Warrant values might also be especially sensitive to "events" and "news" and could provide new ways of marking the turning points in the South Sea Bubble and testing for efficiency of markets. The level and volatility of subscription share prices are both consistent with the hypothesis that the subscription shares were essentially share warrants.

40|$|AbstractDelta-hedging is a {{powerful}} strategy how to hedge a portfolio consisting of derivatives and shares. This paper focuses on portfolio consisting of <b>warrants</b> and <b>shares.</b> <b>Warrants</b> are chosen to be American call type with shares as underlying assets. Shares belong to the world-known companies such as Lufthansa, Microsoft and others. The aim {{is to find out}} if delta-hedged portfolio has lower risk than the non-hedged portfolio and if so, how big is the difference. The delta is derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Based on the data from Frankfurt Stock Exchange we build 50 different portfolios. Results are that the average percentage of avoided risk is 70 %. In some cases delta-hedging also causes profit instead of a loss and in very less cases it causes losses instead of the profits, which would be gained without hedging. Delta-hedging makes the derivatives feasible even for risk-averse investors...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} of rational pricing South Sea Company liabilities and call options written on South Sea shares. A previously unstudied dataset on South Sea share options is presented. The Company's capital {{structure of the}} firm is redefined so that the application of modern financial economic theories {{can be applied to}} its valuation. We present evidence that a significant portion of South Sea equity liabilities was in the form of <b>share</b> <b>warrants</b> and conversion (from bonds to shares) privileges and should be so valued. Finally we present a model of the cross-sectional behaviour of share prices, South Sea Company debt and call option values. The model is calibrated and simulated in order to produce estimates of the required return on the Company’s debt and the volatility of the firm’s asset values. We conclude that the jointly estimated value of the firm, its constituent liabilities, third-party call option values and implied volatilities are consonant with rational pricing behaviour during the Bubble, although the model requires extension in several directions in order to present a more complete picture of the South Sea Bubble...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: the 2005 - 2006 {{reform of}} the Chinese stock market, aimed at {{eliminating}} nontradeable shares, is used to study the role of asset float on stock prices. The reform implies that holders of nontradeable shares compensate under various forms (cash, bonus <b>shares,</b> <b>warrants)</b> the holders of tradeable shares {{in exchange for their}} right to sell their shares at a future time. We exploit a company-level data set to measure the price reaction of each company to both the announcement of the details of the reform and the implementation of the compensation plan, using information about the timing of suspension of each stock from trading and subsequent readmission. The setup of the reform process is useful to disentangle the relative roles of information and supply. We carry out both an event study to measure abnormal returns and a cross sectional analysis to explore the determinants of the abnormal returns, with a particular attention devoted to the impact of supply shocks on returns. We find that the reform process has been successful and characterized by positive abnormal returns. We also find evidence on favor of a negatively sloped demand function.

50|$|On May 5, 1994, Great American Communications (which {{would be}} renamed Citicasters {{following}} {{the completion of}} its debt restructuring later that year) agreed to sell WBRC and three of its sister stations - fellow ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina, NBC affiliate WDAF-TV in Kansas City and CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV in Phoenix - to New World Communications for $350 {{million in cash and}} $10 million in <b>share</b> <b>warrants.</b> As part of a broader deal between New World and Fox signed on May 23 of that year, New World agreed to affiliate five of its eight existing television stations and the four it had acquired from Great American with Fox, in a series of affiliation transactions that would take two years to complete due to the varying conclusion dates of their ongoing contracts with either ABC, NBC or CBS. WBRC was one of the stations involved in this agreement.

50|$|On May 5, 1994, Great American Communications (which {{would later}} be renamed Citicasters {{following}} the completion of its restructuring) agreed to sell WBRC and three other television stations - WDAF-TV in Kansas City, KSAZ-TV in Phoenix and WGHP in High Point, North Carolina - to New World Communications - for $350 {{million in cash and}} $10 million in <b>share</b> <b>warrants.</b> However, three weeks later, New World agreed to purchase four stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings, WVTM being among them, in a purchase option-structured deal for $717 million (although the transfer/assignment applications for the stations involved in the Argyle purchases were not filed with the FCC until after New World's acquisition of the four Citicasters stations was completed); this posed a problem for New World on two counts. At the time, the FCC forbade any broadcasting company from owning two commercial television stations in the same market; in addition, the concurrent acquisitions of the Argyle and Citicasters stations put New World three stations over the national television ownership cap that the agency enforced at the time, which allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of twelve stations nationwide.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{stations}} {{involved in the}} wide-ranging agreement was Kansas City's longtime NBC affiliate, WDAF-TV, which had been affiliated with that network since it signed on in October 1949.

New World included WDAF among {{the stations}} that would switch to Fox as part of its affiliation agreement with the network.|$|R

The day prior to that deal, SCI purchased WTVT in Tampa, Florida, from Gillett Holdings in a separate agreement for $163 million.
