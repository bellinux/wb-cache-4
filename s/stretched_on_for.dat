50|$|The indecisive {{nature of}} {{conflict}} meant wars {{were long and}} endemic. Conflicts <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> decades and many states spent more years at war than they did at peace. The Spanish attempt to reconquer the Netherlands after the Dutch Revolt became bogged down in endless siege warfare. The expense caused the Spanish monarchy to declare bankruptcy several times, beginning in 1577.|$|E

50|$|In a {{communist}} country where verbal offence {{was defined as}} a crime and as such punishable by law, Karajlić and other band members were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its sacred cows and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the party, or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the station}} was built as a {{temporary}} terminus, owing {{to the complexity of}} the hydrogeological situation in the area that would become the Holosiivska extension of the Kurenivsko-Chervonoarmiyska Line. The line's extension southwards <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> more than 15 years, which became a major issue for commuters during rush hours. The station was one of the busiest terminus stations since many bus and marshrutka routes were routed through its vicinity, connecting commuters with areas on the outskirts of Kiev which were lacking metro access. When the Holosiivska extension was inaugurated on December 15, 2010, {{the station was}} no longer a terminus.|$|E

50|$|An {{announcement}} of intention to sue on the Directors Guild of America website caused CleanFlicks to preemptively {{file a lawsuit}} in Denver Federal Court in August 2002. Robert Huntsman, an attorney and inventor affiliated with Cleanflicks who had a DVD-editing patent pending, was named as the lead plaintiff, so the original short caption for the case was Huntsman v. Soderbergh. In their suit, Cleanflicks sought a judgment stating that edited content was legal under federal copyright law. In addition to director Steven Soderbergh, named defendants included Hollywood luminaries such as Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford, Sydney Pollack, Robert Altman, John Landis, and Martin Scorsese. Although the chain had been operating for two years, the issue {{was brought to the}} spotlight when MovieMask made a series of demonstrations around Hollywood in March of that year. The directors counter-suit soon followed, but the legal battle <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years.|$|E

50|$|The Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington {{is divided}} into the Declaration, the Address, and the Appendix. The {{document}} is written {{in the style of}} early 19th century American religious literature, making it difficult for many to read. Paragraphs sometimes <b>stretch</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> pages at a time, while the text is unfortunately void of any subheadings. This makes Knofel Staton's 1976 paraphrase of this document particularly helpful.|$|R
50|$|Bhog {{also takes}} place when a family or a {{community}} {{decides to go}} for a slower reading of the holy scripture (Sahaj Path). The reading is done as and when the circumstances permit. No time-limit applies in this case. The 'Bhog' comes at its end and has to be recited in a single session, without a break. Another variation is the Saptahik Path, in which the reading of the scripture has to be completed within a week. The Sahaj Path may <b>stretch</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> months.|$|R
50|$|Production for So Close to Paradise began while Wang Xiaoshuai {{was officially}} blacklisted. While Wang participated in self-criticisms and {{networking}} opportunities {{in an effort}} to be allowed to make films again, he was invited to join Tian Zhuangzhuang's production company to begin work on the screenplay of So Close to Paradise, then called The Girl from Vietnam. During this period, the screenplay was vetted by both Beijing Film Studio executives and individual investors, who, while supportive of the film's portrayal of modern social reality, had some misgivings. This led to a shift in focus from the characters' sexual impulses to the general states of being. Wang had originally planned to begin shooting So Close to Paradise in June or July 1994 in Wuhan but was delayed until October due to continued bureaucracy problems between Wang and the state apparatus. As a result of the shift in season, filming of Paradise proved to be far more complicated in terms of logistics than Wang had initially anticipated. Combined with extensive edits to meet government censor approval and the production of the film <b>stretched</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years.|$|E

The war ultimately proved unsuccessful, <b>stretching</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 24 years and engaging the Kingdom of Sweden, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Teutonic Knights of Livonia. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, while the Oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile the Union of Lublin had united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland, and the Commonwealth acquired an energetic leader, Stefan Batory, who was supported by Russia's southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's realm was being squeezed by two of the great powers of the time.|$|R
50|$|With 133 ha of vineyards, {{the double}} {{municipality}} {{is among the}} biggest winegrowing centres on the Middle Moselle. One well known vineyard is the Zeltinger Sonnenuhr (“Sundial”) at the Bernkasteler Ring winemakers’ association’s wine auction in September 2006, a 2002 Trockenbeerenauslese from this vineyard fetched a record price for one bottle of €2,100. Other vineyards are Zeltinger Himmelreich (“Heaven Empire”), Zeltinger Schloßberg (“Castle Mountain”) and Zeltinger Deutschherrenberg (“German Lords’ Mountain”). Several wineries, which grow mainly Riesling, still exist today. Furthermore, there is a cultural path {{in the form of}} the Mosel.Erlebnis.Route, which <b>stretches</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 7 km and gives information about the municipality’s history, winegrowing and culture.

It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to <b>stretch</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are certainly going to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season. And hey, if we learned anything from last season's Queens of Darkness, it's that maybe we'll at least get some awesome wardrobe changes for Emma. Some darker eyeliner? Strappy awesome three inch stilettos? The possibilities are endless… [...] " ...|$|R

40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} to write a review of this book (by the way, {{this will be a}} very unorthodox book review, see below). Full disclosure here: Nick Sanchez is an old and dear friend, and a former colleague of mine when we overlapped, for six years, 1991 - 1997, as professors of economics at Holy Cross College. One of my own contributions to student development is that I have co authored numerous refereed articles in scholarly journals with members of my undergraduate classes. Well, Nick has done me one better in this regard: this entire book is co-authored with two of his undergraduate students, Christopher Kopp and Francis Sanzari. This must surely be a rarity in publishing. Indeed, I know of no other case where a professor has co authored a full length book with undergraduates. I really regard this as a stupendous accomplishment. My own articles with students take up anywhere from 10 to 20 published pages; this is an entire book <b>stretching</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 224 pages. These student co authors of his must be very exceptional young men. As to the book itself, it will be a welcome one for Austro-libertarians, even though Sanchez is not himself a member of the praxeological school of economics...|$|R
50|$|Internationally, de Zúñiga saw Spain's {{future as}} part of a strong {{alliance}} with the Holy Roman Empire also ruled by the Habsburg family, echoing contemporary arbitrista Giovanni Botero, who promoted the concept of a Habsburg family-led hegemony across Europe. De Zúñiga was also influenced by the consequences for Spanish controlled northern Italy should the Austrian branch of the family fail in Germany. De Zúñiga persuaded Philip III to send aid the Emperor in Bohemia in 1619, effectively entering Spain into the Thirty Years War (1618-48). In 1620, he {{played a key role in}} the dispatch of the Army of Flanders to aid the Imperial cause, leading to the Spanish victory at the Battle of White Mountain later that year. De Zúñiga was also responsible for key Spanish decisions over the future of the conflict in the Netherlands. The armistice since 1609 had become increasingly tense; whilst de Zúñiga was convinced that a straightforward military victory over the Dutch was unlikely, by 1619 he had concluded that a renewal of hostilities could enable negotiations leading to a treaty more favourable to the Spanish. He was largely responsible for the renewal of the war in 1621; as a consequence, the conflict would <b>stretch</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> another 27 years until the peace treaty of 1648.|$|R

40|$|The RESTORE Act {{presents}} an historic opportunity {{to invest in}} the revitalization of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem on an unprecedented scale. The Act also can provide support for spurring economic recovery for a region hit hard by the BP Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010. Though much remains uncertain about how the Act will be funded and put to use, enough is clear to take stock of what the Act can do, what it will not do, and how affected communities and stakeholders might best engage the RESTORE Act process to ensure it fulfills its promise of a revitalized Gulf of Mexico. Given the unprecedented nature of the RESTORE Act and the hopes and expectations that many have for the Act, {{it is important to keep}} in mind what the Act will not and cannot be expected to do. Simply put, the Act does not address, much less solve, the deep ecologic challenges facing the Gulf of Mexico and its associated coastal ecosystems. Nor does it address the longstanding challenges to the sustainability and resilience of the communities of the region, many of which are tied to past and projected environmental trends in the coast and the Gulf. The Act can certainly improve conditions and create greater possibilities for the future, but it will take much more than RESTORE Act dollars to create the intellectual, civic, and financial capacity to achieve the goal of a Gulf and coast that are ecologically, culturally, and economically vibrant and sustainable. Indeed, it is far more certain that the challenges of participating in the RESTORE Act process [...] which will <b>stretch</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some years [...] and ensuring that the Act in fact lives up to its promise will put new demands on communities and stakeholders that the Act does not meet in any way. Those demands and the broader demands of creating sustainable communities and environments will likely have to be met by the sort of civic, academic, and philanthropic investment that helped make the RESTORE Act a plausible public investment...|$|R
