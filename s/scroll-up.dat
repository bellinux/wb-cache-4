25|$|Roll-up or <b>scroll-up</b> or {{paint-on}} or scrolling: Real-time words sent in paint-on or scrolling mode {{appear from}} left to right, up to one line at a time; when a line is filled in roll-up mode, the whole line scrolls up {{to make way for}} a new line, and the line on top is erased. The lines usually appear at the bottom of the screen, but can actually be placed on any of the 14 screen rows to avoid covering graphics or action. This method is used when captioning video in real-time such as for live events, where a sequential word-by-word captioning process is needed or a pre-made intermediary file isn't available. This method is signaled on EIA-608 by a two-byte caption command or in Teletext by replacing rows for a roll-up effect and duplicating rows for a paint-on effect. This allows for real-time caption line editing.|$|E
