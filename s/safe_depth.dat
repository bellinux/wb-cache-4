2500|$|According to the Turkish plan, the {{ultimate}} goal was the [...] "Sahin" [...] and [...] "Attila" [...] lines, namely the capturing of {{a large part of}} north Cyprus. The operation would be divided in two phases. The first objective, was the creation of a beachhead that would give access to the sea the Turkish-Cypriot enclave of Gönyeli. In order to give it a <b>safe</b> <b>depth,</b> it was planned that a triangle with a base of 18km along the coast and 22km depth should be secured. Following that, the Turkish planned to stop operations and seek a diplomatic solution. If diplomacy failed, they would forcefully pursue their second main objective, the [...] "Attila" [...] line.

2500|$|On {{hearing the}} Dinaric explosion, Drummondville raced towards the sinking ship, firing a star shell. U-162 {{was caught in}} the illumination. Drummondville moved to ram the submarine, with U-162 not diving until the {{minesweeper}} was almost on top of it. Drummondville dropped three depth charges over the diving submarine. As U-162 dived, the submarine encountered a variable density layer within the water, keeping the submarine from dropping to a <b>safe</b> <b>depth.</b> Drummondville turned to ram again, but this time the submarine began to sink faster. This was a result of Vogelsang opening his forward torpedo tubes in order to decrease the submarine's buoyancy. Drummondville dropped three more depth charges, exacerbating the damage caused earlier in U-162s patrol. The main line for the operation of the buoyancy tanks had been severed causing the submarine to sink to , near crush depth for U-162. Efforts aboard the submarine to rise to a safer depth failed and the submarine remained near [...] below the surface. To reach the surface, Vogelsang blew out his buoyancy tanks. The submarine reached the surface and fled the area at [...] using its diesel engines. Drummondville meanwhile had been attempting to gather the merchants into a convoy again against what he believed to be the threat of a second submarine. At 03:30, the noise from U-162s diesels was picked up by Drummondvilles asdic. Drummondville sped towards the contact and fired star shell, finding nothing with U-162 just beyond range of the illumination. The minesweeper dropped depth charges before returning to the merchant vessels.|$|E

For some time before her eyes had been slowly wandering around the edge of that lonely piece of water, and it was with an unsatisfied air that she now stood gazing from side to side.

5000|$|Ruxley {{agreed to}} build a {{swimming}} pool in Forsyth's garden. The contract specified that the pool would have a diving area seven feet, six inches deep.

The uncertain composition of the gas means that worst case estimates are usually made for both maximum operating depth and decompression considerations.
