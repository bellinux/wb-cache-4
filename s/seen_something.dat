Sherratt were test flying the Vanguard airliner from Brooklands Aerodrome when control was lost and the aircraft nose-dived from 2000 feet into the ground. Observers had <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> fluttering away from the tail just before the aircraft dived. Scholefield was killed in the burnt wreck, and Sherratt who had jumped from the aircraft died from the fall.|$|E

Tommy Barban, another guest, comes loyally to the defense of the Divers. The action involves various other friends, including the Norths, where a frequent occurrence is the drunken behavior of Abe North. The story becomes complicated when Jules Peterson, a black man, is murdered and ends up in Rosemary's bed, in a situation which could destroy Rosemary's career.

Police said he committed suicide by cutting the artery on his wrist and taking poison. A suicide note cited mental torture by the CBI. The CBI had alleged that Augustine had destroyed evidence and closed the case as a suicide, but the case diary revealed it was Augustine who pointed {{to the possibility of}} homicide. He had recorded that Abhaya could have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> objectionable in the dining room and could have been silenced. In his personal diary, Augustine wrote about how he was pressured by CBI to say that senior police officers tried to influence him.|$|E

25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment. They kept an eye for any activity on Tobares' bank accounts {{to see if they}} were used after he went missing. Investigators analyzed his latest activity on social media as well. His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him knowing who he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> {{suspicious}} while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

The status of this dispute hasn't changed since 1959 and I've never <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> as disgusting as a rivalry between people occasioned from politics.

500|$|Individuals {{had been}} visiting the castle {{since the end}} of the 17th century and this grew in {{importance}} through the 19th century. In 1858 Queen Victoria visited the 4th earl with great local celebrations. However, by 1885 it would appear the visitors were becoming a nuisance as the earl closed the castle to visitors, causing consternation in the town. A local report stated, [...] "One day last week eight American visitors who were staying at one of the principal hotels left somewhat hurriedly in consequence of their being unable to gain admission to the castle". It soon re-opened again and by 1900 had a ticket office and was employing a permanent guide. By 1936 Arthur Mee was enthusing not just that [...] "these walls have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> of the splendour of every generation of our [...] story", with rooms [...] "rich in treasure beyond the dreams of avarice" [...] but also that [...] "their rooms are open to all who will". The collection of armoury on display at Warwick Castle is regarded as second only to that of the Tower of London.|$|E

500|$|RedEye {{journalist}} Curt Wagner {{stated that}} the series was [...] "well acted and smartly written". BuddyTV writer Laurel Brown called the pilot a [...] "great episode". In his [...] "A" [...] grade review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said that the episode was a [...] "great piece of televised art", describing the script as [...] "witty, warm, and soulful".

[...] "Pilot" [...] was highly anticipated by Los Angeles Times journalist Robert Lloyd, who observed that [...] "it promised {{to be one of the}} year's best and most interesting new series." [...] In a pre-broadcast review, Matt Fowler from IGN gave the pilot a [...] "10 out of 10" [...] classifying it as a [...] "masterpiece". Some commentators were less enthusiastic than the general consensus. Writing for The Washington Post, Hank Stuever felt that despite having high ambitions, the pilot episode was slow and drowsy.|$|E
500|$|Zack did {{not exist}} in the {{original}} scenario of Final Fantasy VII, but was created only when scenario writer Kazushige Nojima decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife's background. Nojima had always planned for Cloud Strife's memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and Aerith Gainsborough, as Aerith had <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> of Zack in Cloud. Zack was Aerith's first boyfriend, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud, because he reminds her of him. Originally, the role of her first boyfriend was to have been fulfilled by the game's antagonist Sephiroth. As the game continued in its development, Nojima worked out the mysteries regarding Zack and Cloud, which led to some of the scenes in the game needing revision. Director Yoshinori Kitase was surprised by the revelation of Cloud's and Zack's connection, as until the later stages of development, even he did not know about Zack. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura got the request to design Zack when Final Fantasy VII was reaching the end of development. Prior to the late addition of Zack, Nojima had asked the staff to add details to some scenes so as to give clues about him, {{despite the fact that he}} did not reveal to the staff Zack's existence until later.|$|E

The Aztecs led the Spaniards into the heart of the city where Moctezuma gave them with more gifts and then quartered them in lavish apartments. However, Aztec accounts of the first meeting indicate that Moctezuma was too deferent and generous to the newcomers.
