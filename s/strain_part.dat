5000|$|With cycloheptene, the {{cis-isomer}} {{is always}} assumed but the trans-isomer does also exist. One procedure for the organic synthesis of trans-cycloheptene is by singlet photosensitization of cis-cycloheptene with methyl benzoate and ultraviolet light at −35 °C. The double bond in the trans isomer is very strained. The directly attached atoms {{on a simple}} alkene are all coplanar. In trans-cycloheptene, however, {{the size of the}} ring makes it impossible for the alkene and its two attached carbons to have this geometry because the remaining three carbons could not reach far enough to close the ring (see also Bredt's rule). There would have to be unusually large angles (angle strain), unusually long bond-lengths, or the atoms of the alkane-like loop would collide with the alkene part (steric <b>strain).</b> <b>Part</b> of the strain is relieved by pyramidalization of each alkene carbon and their rotation relative to each other. The pyramidalization angle is estimated at 37° (compared to an angle of 0° for an atom with normal trigonal-planar geometry) and the p-orbital misalignment is 30.1°. [...] Because the barrier for rotation of the double bond in ethylene is approximately 65 kcal/mol (270 kJ/mol) and can only be lowered by the estimated strain energy of 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol) present in the trans-isomer, trans-cycloheptene should be a stable molecule just as its homologue trans-cyclooctene. In fact, it is not: unless the temperature is kept very low, rapid isomerization to the cis-isomer takes place. The trans-cycloheptene isomerization mechanism is not simple alkene-bond rotation, but rather an alternative lower energy pathway. Based on the experimentally observed second order reaction kinetics for isomerization, two trans-cycloheptene molecules in the proposed pathway first form a diradical dimer. The two heptane radical rings then untwist to an unstrained conformation, and finally the dimer fragments back into two cis-cycloheptene molecules. Note that the photoisomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid with bromine is also bimolecular.|$|E

First, we consider a two-dimensional infinite isotropic or anisotropic homogeneous medium with a non-elliptical inclusion subjected to a prescribed uniform heat flux-free temperature gradient. Eshelby's conduction tensor field and its area average are first expressed compactly in terms of two boundary integrals avoiding the usual singularity and then specified analytically for arbitrary polygonal inclusions and for inclusions characterized by the finite Laurent series. Next, we are interested in a three-dimensional infinite isotropic or transversely isotropic homogeneous medium with a cylindrical inclusion of a non-elliptical cross section that undergoes uniform generalized plane eigenstrains. The solution to this problem is obtained by decomposing a generalized plane eigenstrain tensor into a plane <b>strain</b> <b>part</b> and an anti-plane <b>strain</b> <b>part,</b> exploiting the mathematical similarity between two-dimensional thermal conduction and anti-plane elasticity, and combining the relevant results of Zou et al.

40|$|New {{elements}} are derived to validate {{and assess the}} assumed natural deviatoric strain (ANDES) formulation. This is a brand new variant of the assumed natural strain (ANS) formulation of finite elements, which has recently attracted attention as an effective method for constructing high-performance elements for linear and nonlinear analysis. The ANDES formulation {{is based on an}} extended parametrized variational principle developed in recent publications. The key concept is that only the deviatoric part of the strains is assumed over the element whereas the mean <b>strain</b> <b>part</b> is discarded in favor of a constant stress assumption. Unlike conventional ANS elements, ANDES elements satisfy the individual element test (a stringent form of the patch test) a priori while retaining the favorable distortion-insensitivity properties of ANS elements. The first application of this formulation is the development of several Kirchhoff plate bending triangular elements with the standard nine degrees of freedom. Linear curvature variations are sampled along the three sides with the corners as gage reading points. These sample values are interpolated over the triangle using three schemes. Two schemes merge back to conventional ANS elements, one being identical to the Discrete Kirchhoff Triangle (DKT), whereas the third one produces two new ANDES elements. Numerical experiments indicate that one of the ANDES element is relatively insensitive to distortion compared to previously derived high-performance plate-bending elements, while retaining accuracy for nondistorted elements...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{deals with}} the adaptation of quartz-microfabrics to changing physical deformation conditions, and discusses their preservation potential during subsequent retrograde deformation. Using microstructural analysis, a sequence of recrystallization processes in quartz, ranging from Grain-Boundary Migration Recrystallization (GBM) over Subgrain-Rotation Recrystallization (SGR) to Bulging Nucleation (BLG) is detected for the Simplon fault zone (SFZ) from the low strain rim towards the internal high <b>strain</b> <b>part</b> of the large-scale shear zone. Based on: (i) the retrograde cooling path; (ii) estimates of deformation temperatures; and (iii) spatial variation of dynamic recrystallization processes and different microstructural characteristics, continuous strain localization with decreasing temperature is inferred. In contrast to the recrystallization microstructures, crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) have a longer memory. CPO patterns indicative of prism and rhomb glide systems in mylonitic quartz veins, overprinted at low temperatures (� 400 �C), suggest inheritance of a high-temperature deformation. In this way, microstructural, textural and geochemical analyses provide information for several million years of the deformation history. The reasons for such incomplete resetting of the rock texture is that strain localization is caused by change in effective viscosity contrasts related to temporal large- and small-scale temperature changes during the evolution of such a long-lived shear zone. The spatially resolved, quantitative investigation of quartz microfabrics and associated recrystallization processes therefore provide great potential for an improved understanding of the geodynamics of large-scale shear zones...|$|E
40|$|Coaxiality {{between the}} {{principal}} directions of stress tensor {{and the principal}} directions of the plastic strain increment tensor is assumed in conventional plasticity models. In order to investigate coaxiality, or not, between these two principal directions, a series of drained tests on dry Hostun sand was carried out using a precision Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA). The applied stress path includes large Principal Stress Axes Rotation (PSAR). Two of the three principal stresses are kept constant. So, among the three principal stresses, only the intermadiate principal stress which is the confining pressure (same pressure outside the hollow cylinder for internal and external lateral surfaces) changes during loading. During these tests, at different stress levels, the elastic (or quasi-elastic) properties are also investigated considering small amplitude quasi-static cycles. These small cycles are performed in two different directions by changing successively only the axial stress σzz or the shear stress σθz. The elastic experimental properties are well simulated using the DBGS hypo-elastic model, which takes into account PSAR. For each test, the elastic part of deformation is calculated using the DBGS model and removed from the global strain to focus only on the irreversible part (plastic part). Then, the principal directions of stress and the principal directions of plastic strain increment are compared. The experimental results {{show that there is}} no coaxiality between these directions. This observation attests the existence of a non-coaxial plasticity. In addition, coupling between coaxial and non-coaxial part is clearly shown.

When the bole of a tree is subjected to resultant loads in the directions of the Cartesian base vectors, the S₁₁, S₂₂, S₃₃, and S₁₂ stresses in Cartesian coordinates are coupled. It is desirable to use beam elements to analyze the structural behavior of trees because of the ease with which these can be incorporated into Finite Element Models. However, elementary beam theory is not able to consider the problem where the S₁₁, S₂₂, S₃₃, and S₁₂ stresses are coupled. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the magnitudes of the normal stresses in the radial and tangential directions (Srr, Sθθ) and the shear stress (Srθ), relative to the normal stress in the x₃ direction for an element of a tree bole. In cylindrical coordinates the strains are not unique at r = 0. Therefore, a constitutive equation was adopted in cylindrical coordinates where the elastic coefficients are dependent on r. An element of a tree bole was considered as a cantilever beam and posed as a Relaxed Saint-Venant's Problem in Cartesian coordinates. It was found if the strains resulting from the generalized plane <b>strain</b> <b>part</b> of the problem were considered linear functions of the x₁ and x₂ coordinates, then the strain compatibility conditions arid equilibrium equations could be satisfied. Given the assumption that the generalized plane strains are linear in x₁ and x₂, it was proven that the Srr, Sθθ, and Srθ stresses are analytic functions of the complex variable z. It is also proven that the Srr, Sθθ, and Srθ stresses are equal to zero on the lateral surface of the element of the tree bole. Therefore, using the analyticity of the stress functions and the fact that they are zero on the lateral surface it is possible to show that the Srr, Sθθ, and Srθ stresses are zero throughout the element of a tree bole...|$|E

Through the use of CTL clones from Moloney virus-immunized bm 13 mice, the class I Kb-presented CTL epitope was identified. The epitope {{is located in the}} Moloney virus gp 70 envelope protein region (Moloney envelope, amino acids 189 to 196 [Mol env (189 - 196) ]), SSWDFITV and has the Kb allele-specific binding motif. The Dbm 13 molecule does not present the env(189 to 196) epitope to Kb-restricted bm 13 CTL. In B 6 mice, Mol env(189 - 196) -specific CTL could be induced by peptide vaccination. B 6 mice thus have CTL precursors specific for this epitope but at considerably lower levels than do bm 13 mice. We hypothesize that additional positive selection of Kb-restricted CTL on the Dbm 13 molecule in bm 13 mice explains this difference in precursor frequencies. We examined related strains of MuLV for the presence of Mol env(189 - 196) sequence equivalents. Rauscher, Friend, and AKV MuLV-encoded Mol env(189 - 196) epitope equivalents were properly recognized in cytotoxicity assays, both as synthetic and as endogenously expressed (Rauscher MuLV) peptides.

Although these compounds are normally found in plants, production levels are too low for commercial use. As a result, we have begun engineering the metabolic pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to accumulate sesquiterpenes. Epi-cedrol is a sesquiterpene identified from Artemisia annua, which was used as a reporter molecule to monitor sesquiterpene production in our engineered yeast strains. Through manipulations of the ergosterol pathway, we were able to increase sesquiterpene production from 0. 090 mg/L (wild type yeast) to 1. 000 mg/L in yeast strains that overexpress the truncated 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase isozyme (HMG 1) gene in an erg 9 background. This yeast strain also increased the in vivo production of farnesol and trans-nerolidol, the hydrolyzed products of FPP. Likewise, the use of a different resin to isolate the epi-cedrol allowed a further increase to 1. 883 mg/L in this yeast <b>strain.</b> <b>Part</b> II describes a valuable alternative to the specifically designed yeast strains described in Part I of this thesis by producing the yellow compound, 4, 4 '-diaponeurosporene. 4, 4 '-Diaponeurosporene is a deep yellow triterpene carotenoid identified in Staphylococcus aureus.

40|$|The precise {{determination}} of residual stress profiles in optical fibers allows drawing conclusions about radiation-induced density-changes of the fibers doped core glass. The corresponding index changes partially {{contribute to the}} phenomenon of photosensitivity, i. e. the modification of the refractive index of a glass through the irradiation with an appropriate laser source. Photosensitivity is widely exploited for the fabrication of fiber Bragg gratings which are in-fiber filter devices whose spectral response can be designed with great versatility. Fiber Bragg gratings find broad application nowadays {{in the field of}} telecommunication as well as in sensing applications. The polarimetric assessment of the integrated transverse fiber birefringence serves as a means to gather information about both stress and strain profiles of the fiber. Birefringence is introduced in the optical fiber due to the photo-elastic effect. In this work, a highly sensitive polariscope with sub-micron resolution has been developed. The captured birefringence data has been interpreted to be basically strain and not stress-induced, which allowed the proper discrimination between an inelastic, stress-free strain contribution and a <b>strain</b> <b>part</b> essentially accompanied by elastic stress. In earlier interpretations of the polarimetric data, all birefringence had been attributed to be purely stress-induced, which excluded the existence of inelastic strain and even led to contradictory results in some cases. The reinterpretation in terms of strain, however, results in a consistent picture of both stress and strain-induced birefringence. The polariscope has been used in the following to determine radiation-induced stress changes for different optical fibers and irradiation sources. Femtosecond-laser induced core stress changes in SMF- 28 ® standard telecommunication fibers have been measured tomographically and correlated with corresponding index changes. Furthermore, stress has been correlated to the refractive index change in highly germanium-doped fibers irradiated with cw-irradiation at 244 nm. The annealing behavior of stress, strain and index in this fiber has been studied. Approximately the same linear correlation between stress and index change was found for all germanium-doped fibers under investigation. In addition, stress changes were measured for phosphorus- and nitrogen-doped fibers drawn at different tensions before and after irradiation with an ArF excimer-laser. The impact of the drawing force on fiber stress and inelastic strain anisotropy has been determined as well as radiation-induced stress modifications. The observed stress increase has been compared to those obtained for germanium-doped fibers. Atomic Force Microscopy of cleaved and subsequently etched fiber end-faces is a powerful means to gather topographic information on a nanometer scale due to differential etching of the doped core and the undoped silica cladding. Within this work, the technique has been used to acquire information about etch rate changes in fibers drawn from the same nitrogen-doped preform with different drawing conditions. Furthermore, the impact of UV-irradiation on the etch rate has been determined for phosphorus- as well as nitrogen-doped fibers.

The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop a biological control programme for F. occidentalis through the selection of an efficient beneficial arthropod. First, a general review of the literature about thrips pest species in Europe and in particular of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Western Flower Thrips) was made. Information regarding the biology, distribution, host plants of thrips and damage induced by this pest species were discussed and summarized. The main candidates as natural enemies for control of thrips emerging from this literature study and from an evaluation of all present data, were Anthocoridae, and, thus, further research was directed towards Anthocorid predators of the genus Orius (Rhyncota: Heteroptera) (chapter 1). Next, of the genus Orius, the most common species of the Mediterranean regions of Europe were chosen as candidates for biological control of F. occidentalis. Orius predators were collected in several areas in Italy on 36 plant species infested by thrips. The most common species were O. niger Wolff, O. laevigatus (Fieber) and O. majusculus (Reuter). No clear host-plant preferences of these Orius species were recorded (chapter 2). Consequently, biological characteristics and predation activity of four Orius species (the palaeartic O. majusculus, O. laevigatus and O. niger and the neartic O. insidiosus, an exotic species that was earlier released in Italy) were determined by laboratory experiments using two prey species: Ephestia kuehniella (Zell.) eggs and Frankliniella occidentalis adults. Preimaginal mortality, development time, sex-ratio, pre-oviposition period, longevity, fecundity, and predation during the instar stages and the adult stage were measured. The intrinsic rates of natural increase (r m) and the kill rates (k m = ln k 0 /t k) for all four Orius species was determined. The k m was 0. 23 for O. laevigatus, 0. 21 for O. majusculus, 0. 25 for O. insidiosus, 0. 19 for O. niger, respectively. In all species, the females that fed on E. kuehniella showed greater longevity and higher reproduction than those fed on F. occidentalis. Most data for the neartic O. insidiosus were similar to those of O. laevigatus and O. majusculus. Mass rearings of O. insidiosus, O. laevigatus and O. majusculus were successfully developed, while O. niger appeared difficult to rear. Based on these data, it was concluded that O. laevigatus might be the best candidate for control of thrips (chapter 3). No data were available about the occurrence of diapause in O. laevigatus. As thrips pest occur early in the season, it is important to use natural enemies that do not go into diapause. The possibility of inducing a reproductive diapause in this palearctic species was therefore investigated in the laboratory using two strains: strain N collected in northern Italy (Po Valley) and strain S collected in southern Italy (Sicily). The influence of photoperiod on Orius eggs was studied. Development time, adult emergence, sex ratio, pre-oviposition period, fecundity, and the presence of mature oocytes were recorded. The two strains of O. laevigatus showed to have a different way of overwintering: in the northern <b>strain</b> <b>part</b> of the population undergoes a weak reproductive diapause, while for the southern strain overwintering could best be described as quiescence (chapter 4). Finally, the capacity of O. laevigatus to control thrips pests (F. occidentalis and T. tabaci) was studied by releases of this predator in two vegetable crops in commercial greenhouses, sweet pepper and eggplant. The releases of the pirate bugs were made as soon as thrips were detected, resulted in early establishment of the predator, in an interaction between prey and predator at low population densities and often in sufficient control of the pest (chapter 5 and 6). In conclusion, the southern Italian strain of O. laevigatus showed to be an efficient natural enemy of thrips and F. occidentalis. This natural enemy is currently produced and commercially used on large scale in Europe to control thrips species in vegetable and ornamental crops, mostly in protected crops (chapter 7) ...|$|E
40|$|Summary and {{conclusions}} In this thesis {{the management of}} dyspepsia in primary care in relation to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was studied. In chapter two several important issues considering the approach of dyspepsia are discussed. It is clear that dyspepsia is not a disease but merely a cluster of symptoms believed to originate from the gastrointestinal tract. This is probably the main reason why a universal consensus regarding the approach of dyspepsia is still lacking. Although many studies have evaluated strategies for dyspepsia, considerable differences exist in the definitions of dyspepsia, hampering a reliable comparison between study results. The discovery of H. pylori has resulted in new strategies to approach dyspepsia in primary care, based on screening for H. pylori infection. Altogether, four main strategies for dyspepsia are currently considered: 1. Symptom guided empirical treatment, 2. Direct referral for endoscopy, 3. Non-invasive testing for H. pylori and subjecting the H. pylori-positive patients to endoscopy (“test-and-scope”), and 4. Noninvasive testing for H. pylori and treatment of the infection in H. pylori-positive patients (“test-and-treat”). Based on data derived from the literature, several key issues were identified which {{have a significant impact}} on the cost-effectiveness of these strategies, namely: cost of endoscopy,cost of therapy, cost of physician visit, prevalence of H. pylori in the dyspeptic population, prevalence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in H. pylori positive patients, prevalence of all underlying diseases in dyspepsia, benefit of H. pylori eradication in patients with functional dyspepsia, and recurrence of dyspeptic symptoms in patients with (functional) dyspepsia after treatment. After careful consideration of the literature with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of the various strategies and the key issues mentioned above, it is concluded that at this moment, a “test-and-treat” strategy is the most rational approach in the younger patient with uncomplicated dyspepsia. Chapter three reports the results of the SENSE study (Strategy: ENdoscopy versus SErolgy). Patients who visited their general practitioner (GP) for dyspepsia could participate in the study if the GP judged the symptoms severe enough to justify treatment with acid-suppressive drugs or an upper endoscopy. Two hundered seventy patients fulfilling this condition were randomised to either a serology based “test-and-treat” strategy or a prompt open-access endoscopy. The study was performed completely in a primary care setting in the northern part of the Netherlands. After a one year follow-up period, only 33 % of the patients in the “test-and-treat” arm were eventually referred for endoscopy. In these patients, no H. pylori associated PUD was detected. Symptom resolution, change in quality of life, and patient satisfaction were comparable between the “testand-treat” patients and the patients in the prompt endoscopy arm. The “test-and-treat” patients, however, visited their GP more frequently and were more frequently prescribed prokinetic drugs. On the other hand, prompt endoscopy patients were more often prescribed PPI's. Altogether, the SENSE study proved that the “test-and-treat” strategy is a save and cost-effective approach in primary care. Before a “test-and-treat” strategy can be savely implemented in primary care, however, several conditions need to be fulfilled. Firstly, reliable non-invasive testing for H. pylori has to be possible and therefore, accurate tests are required. In chapter four, the accuracy of the recently introduced Helicobacter pylori Stool Antigen (HpSA) test, which is based on the detection of H. pylori antigens in faecal samples by antigen capture ELISA, was evaluated. This test showed accurate results for the detection of H. pylori infection in untreated patients (sensitivity and specificity of 96. 3 % and 81. 8 % respectively) when compared to a gold standard based on culture, histology, and rapid-urease testing of gastric biopsy specimens. Both one and four weeks after cessation of therapy, however, the test failed to detect persisting H. pylori infection (sensitivity 20. 0 %, specificity 95. 0 % (at one week), sensitivity 40. 0 % and specificity 95. 0 % (at four weeks)). These results are in contrast to the results published by others. No adequate explanation can be given for this discrepancy. It is concluded, however, that the HpSA test is not sufficiently reliable to monitor treatment success, at least in our hands. Secondly, as stated before in chapter two, the cost-effectiveness of strategies based on screening for H. pylori mainly depend on the number of patients who will clearly benefit from anti-H. pylori therapy. As these are patients suffering from H. pylori related PUD, a decrease inthe prevalence of H. pylori related PUD will result in a decreased cost-effectiveness of the “test-and-treat” strategy. Recently, it has been suggested that the significance of H. pylori in PUD has been overestimated and that the decrease in H. pylori prevalence will unmask idiopathic PUD (not related to NSAID use or H. pylori infection). In chapter five the results of all endoscopies performed over an eigth year period in a single hospital were studied. These data revealed a decreasing trend in the prevalence of H. pylori in PUD. The proportion of PUD ascribed to NSAID-use increased significantly, but the proportion ascribed to idiopathic PUD remained stable at about 10 % during the study period. Thirdly, a “test-and-treat” strategy in primary care is only useful if patients can be effectively treated in the absence of information on antibiotic susceptibility. Numerous studies have shown that antibiotic resistance has a significant impact on the efficacy of anti-H. pylori regimens. In the Netherlands, the most frequently used anti-H. pylori regimens are the triple regimens PAM (protonpump inhibitor, amoxicillin, metronidazole), and PAC (protonpump inhibitor, amoxicillin, clarithromycin). In chapter six we showed that in the north-eastern part of the Netherlands the prevalence of metronidazole resistance decreased significantly from 1996 to 2001. The prevalence of clarithromycin resistance fluctuated over this period, but no significant trend could be observed. Interestingly, the decrease in prevalence of metronidazole resistance was accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the number of metronidazole prescriptions in the Netherlands (precriptions for other conditions than anti-H. pylori treatment were also included). Altogether both regimens (PAM and PAC) had a calculated efficacy of > 80 %. The efficacy of the PAM regimen is likely to increase if the decrease in prevalence of metronidazole resistance continues, whereas the efficacy of the PAC regimen will drop significantly after even a slight increase in the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance. The second part of the thesis focussed on genetic differences between H. pylori strains. These genetic differences have been hold responsible for the differences in clinical outcome. Several virulence factors have been identified in H. pylori, like the vacA gene which encodes for the vacuolating cytotoxin, the cagA gene responsible for the production of the CagA protein, and the iceA gene, which is expressed at contact with gastric epithelial cells. In chapter seven, we have studied the association between these virulence factors and various clinical outcomes (PUD, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastritis only). The results of this study showed that many patients (over 20 %) harboured a mixture of H. pylori strains. PUD patients were most frequently infected with an H. pylori strain of the s 1 vacA genotype or a strain which carried the cagA gene. On the other hand, patients with GERD, were most frequently colonized by a strain lacking both the cagA and the iceA 1 gene. This finding supports the hypothesis that more virulent H. pylori strains may protect against the development of GERD. It was concluded that virulence factors are indeed associated with specific clinical outcomes. Whether the detection of these virulence factors is significant in a clinical setting, however, needs further exploration. If so, a reliable non-invasive test to detect the presence of these virulence factors in dyspeptic patients would be essential. Chapter eight reports the results of a study evaluating the accuracy of the CagA rapid test (Orion). It has been claimed that this test enables the accurate detection of CagA-antibodies in serum samples by an easy to perform immunochromatographic test, showing results within 10 minutes. We compared the CagA rapid test (Orion) to a surrogate gold standard based on a combination of PCR based cagA gene detection in gastric biopsies and the OroVax recombinant based ELISA for the detection of serum antibodies. The gold standard was considered positive if both PCR and OroVax recombinant based ELISA were positive. In other cases, the gold standard was considered negative. This gold standard was chosen, as it is well known that the presence of the cagA gene does not always result in the transcription of this gene. Without transcription serological antibodies may be absent. On the other hand, persisting CagA-antibodies after a previously cleared H. pylori infection may result in a positive CagA rapid test (Orion), whereas the PCR results are negative. Compared to the surrogate gold standard, the CagA rapid test (Orion) showed a sensitivity and a specificity of 96. 8 % and 95. 4 % respectively. Finally, in chapter nine the results are reported of an extensive study performed on biopsy specimens of nine patients in whom both metronidazole susceptible and resistant H. pylori bacteria had been demonstrated. The question was whether these patients were colonized by two different H. pylori strains or by a single <b>strain,</b> <b>part</b> of which became resistant. The second hypothesis appeared to be true as eight patients harboured only a single H. pylori <b>strain,</b> <b>part</b> of which was sensitive and part of which was resistant to metronidazole. In one patient, the presence of two different strains could be demonstrated, but both strains were in part susceptible and resistent to metronidazole. Based on these data it is concluded that the occurence of metronidazole resistant and metronidazole susceptible bacteria within one single biopsy specimen does not imply the presence of a multiple strain infection with one resistant and one susceptible strain. General conclusions The discovery of the role of H. pylori in several diseases of the upper alimentary tract has resulted in new strategies to approach uncomplicated dyspepsia. Several authors have suggested that an approach based on screening for H. pylori may be more rational than the common strategy of empirical treatment with acid-suppressive drugs. This suggestion is supported by both decision analytic studies and clinical studies, among which the SENSE study described in this thesis. Moreover, most studies suggest that such an approach, especially the “test-and-treat” strategy, may be more cost-effective. In contrast to most other clinical studies, the SENSE study was completely performed in a primary care setting. It showed that in primary care a “test-and-treat” strategy is safe, is more cost-effective than a prompt endoscopy approach, and results in comparable symptom resolution. Implementation of the “test-and-treat” strategy in primary care is feasible, as accurate noninvasive tests to diagnose H. pylori infection are available. Moreover, given the current levels of antibiotic resistance, treatment of H. pylori infection with the usual PAC or PAM regimens should result in acceptable success rates (> 80 %), even in the abscence of information on antibiotic susceptibility. Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori, however, remains mandatory, as even a slight increase in the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance will result in a sharp drop in cure rates if the PAC regimen is used. Any strategy for dyspepsia that is based on non-invasive detection of H. pylori is critically dependent on the prevalence of H. pylori in the dyspeptic population. At a low prevalence, the positive predicitive value of any test for H. pylori will drop below an acceptable level, prohibiting the implementation of a “test-and-treat” strategy. Moreover, if the prevalence of H. pylori in the dyspeptic population is to low, conditions unrelated to H. pylori infection (among which idiopathic PUD) are more likely to be the cause of dyspepsia. In our view, however, the current prevalence of H. pylori in the dyspeptic population (> 30 % in the SENSE study) still justifies a “test-and-treat” approach of uncomplicated dyspepsia in primary care. It is feasible, safe and cost-effective. The prevalence of H. pylori infection, however, is rapidly decreasing in the Western world, and it is likely that empirical treatment with acid suppression will eventually become more cost-effective than the “test-and-treat” strategy. As the prevalence of H. pylori is strongly associated with age this may already be true for the very young dyspeptic patient. The virulence of the infecting H. pylori strain is probably related to the clinical outcome of the infection. However, as the most virulent strains at the same time seem to cause PUD and protect against GERD, it is unlikely that the non-invasive detection of virulence factors will contribute to the clinical decision to treat or not to treat an infected patient, even though accurate tests are available. Finally, it should be stressed that prompt endoscopy is the only acceptable approach of any patient presenting with alarm symptoms. ...|$|E
40|$|Rearrangement of {{two-dimensional}} Ge and Si islands after coarsening on a laterally strain modulated Ge surface {{covered with}} a monolayer of Bi is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. Spatial ordering of the islands {{with respect to the}} modulations of the strain field shows that the binding energy of Si atoms at strained Si islands is, unexpectedly, higher than at unstrained islands. This behavior is explained by a strong compressive stress of the surfactant layer, which favors an expansion of the underlying surface structures and therefore stabilizes the tensile strained Si islands. It is shown that a Si mass transport towards more strained Si islands can be also favored by an increased binding energy of Si adatoms to the less <b>strained</b> <b>parts</b> of the Ge surface.
