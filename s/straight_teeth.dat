25|$|The holotype fossil {{consists}} only of {{the front}} part of the head, which is kept today under the number USP GP/2T-5 in the University of São Paulo.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the spiral <b>tooth</b> over the <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts {{at one end of}} the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking. For these reasons straight bevel gears are generally limited to use at linear speeds less than 1000 feet/min; or, for small gears, under 1000 r.p.m.|$|R

50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position.

50|$|The {{teeth of}} Guidraco are very distinctive. Of the twenty-three {{teeth of the}} upper jaw the first is long and very narrow, {{pointing}} nearly horizontally forward. The next three teeth are enormous in size, very long, robust, pointed and slightly recurved. They gradually point more downwards. These are followed {{by a series of}} three medium-length downward-pointing <b>straight</b> <b>teeth,</b> of which the middle one, the sixth, is the shortest. The remaining thirteen teeth constitute a long row of small elements gradually diminishing in size. This arrangement is mirrored by the eighteen teeth of the lower jaw. Here however, a forward pointing tooth is lacking. The first four teeth are of great size, even longer than their counterparts of the upper jaw. Next is a series of three <b>straight</b> <b>teeth</b> of medium height, followed by a row of eleven increasingly smaller elements for a grand total in the head of eighty-two teeth. With the fossil, the beak is closed and due to their extreme length the front teeth extend far beyond the upper and lower edges of the head, the protruding parts being up to twice as long as the depth of the snout or lower jaw. The teeth can also be divided into two types according to their built: the first nine teeth of the upper jaw and eight teeth of the lower jaw have vertical ridges on the back of their enamel; the back teeth have a uniformly smooth enamel and thickened crown bases, giving them a more triangular outline.|$|E

The teeth on the forward gears of most consumer automobiles are helically cut. When helical gears rotate, there is constant contact between gears, which results in quiet operation. In spite of all forward gears being always meshed, they do not make a sound {{that can be easily}} heard above the engine noise. By contrast, most reverse gears are spur gears, meaning that they have <b>straight</b> <b>teeth,</b> in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.|$|E

5000|$|Dorygnathus ("spear jaw") was a genus of {{pterosaur}} {{that lived}} in Europe during the Early Jurassic period, 180 million years ago when shallow seas flooded much of the continent. It had a short 1.5 m wingspan, and a relatively small triangular sternum, which is where its flight muscles attached. Its skull was long and its eye sockets were the largest opening therein. Large curved fangs that [...] "intermeshed" [...] when the jaws closed featured prominently {{at the front of}} the snout while smaller, <b>straighter</b> <b>teeth</b> lined the back. Having variable teeth, a condition called heterodonty, is rare in modern reptiles but more common in primitive pterosaurs. The heterodont dentition in Dorygnathus is consistent with a piscivorous (fish-eating) diet. The fifth digit on the hindlimbs of Dorygnathus was unusually long and oriented to the side. Its function is not certain, but the toe may have supported a membrane like those supported by its wing-fingers and pteroids. Dorygnathus was according to David Unwin related to the Late Jurassic pterosaur, Rhamphorhynchus and was a contemporary of Campylognathoides in Holzmaden and Ohmden.|$|R
