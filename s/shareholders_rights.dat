We also find that the premium paid for shares is inversely related {{to the strength of}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights,</b> and this suggests that managers pay higher premiums when <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are more restricted. These findings imply that managers use shareholders' funds to eliminate blockholders who are more likely to monitor them when <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are relatively weak, thereby entrench themselves. Consistent with this view, we further show that significant positive abnormal long-run returns after private stock repurchases are limited to firms with stronger shareholder protection. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Privately negotiated stock repurchases <b>Shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> Agency conflict...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> on non-price loan contract terms. Using a large sample of syndicated loans borrowed by U. S. firms between 1991 and 2006, I find that stronger <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> significantly enhance the stringency of loan contract design. The likelihood of having collateral significantly increases with the strength of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> Loan maturity of firms with strongest <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> is 13. 1 % shorter. The loan size of the same borrowing firms is 8. 4 % smaller. These results are robust to different proxies of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> and are robust to the instrumental variable approach controlling for simultaneous determination of loan contract terms, such as collateral and maturity. This study complements the existing literature {{on the impact of}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> on loan pricing and has important implications for understanding the impact of companies' governance structure on loan contract design...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine whether}} sell-side analyst {{recommendations}} reflect <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> Our rationale is that analysts should {{be influenced by}} external governance only if market participants do not efficiently price its value. We find that stronger <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are associated with more favorable recommendations. Further analysis reveals that analysts favor firms with strong <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> only when strong rights appear to be warranted, but do not penalize firms for having strong rights when not needed. These findings occupy middle ground in {{the debate on the}} pricing efficiency of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> Moreover, we find that firm value is positively associated with the strength of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> regardless of the expected external governance structure.

On the other hand, the introduction of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> reduces the possibilities for management to steal. This paper develops a simple model and gives some empirical evidence on which firms are likely to choose to honour <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> In particular, I find that larger firms are more likely to honour <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights,</b> possibly because of the expected of stealing profits is smaller as the likelihood of punishment in the case of detection is higher.

In contrast, firms with strong <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> did not experience a significant positive market reaction.

This came as hedge fund MHR Fund Management LLC disclosed a 13.6% stake in the company, slightly higher than billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn's 11.9% stake. As a result, Navistar adopted a poison pill defense. If the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of 15 percent or more in the company, then Navistar would issue its <b>shareholders</b> <b>rights</b> that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of 50 percent: For each share held, the investor could buy $280 worth of new shares for $140.

5000|$|Some {{have argued}} that poison pills are {{detrimental}} to shareholder interests because they perpetuate existing management. For instance, Microsoft originally made an unsolicited bid for Yahoo!, but subsequently dropped the bid after Yahoo! CEO Jerry Yang threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, [...] "They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place." [...] Yahoo has had a <b>shareholders</b> <b>rights</b> plan in place since 2001. Analysts suggested that Microsoft's raised offer of $33 per share was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from Carl Icahn. Yahoo's stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid, and Jerry Yang faced a backlash from stockholders that eventually led to his resignation.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, {{almost all}} <b>shareholders</b> <b>rights</b> plans are [...] "chewable", meaning they contain a {{permitted}} bid concept such that a bidder {{who is willing}} to conform to the requirements of a permitted bid can acquire the company by take-over bid without triggering a flip-in event. Shareholder rights plans in Canada are also weakened by the ability of a hostile acquirer to petition the provincial securities regulators to have the company's pill overturned. Generally, the courts will overturn the pill to allow shareholders to decide whether they want to tender to a bid for the company. However, the company may be allowed to maintain it for long enough to run an auction to see if a white knight can be found. A notable Canadian case before the securities regulators in 2006 involved the poison pill of Falconbridge Ltd. which at the time {{was the subject of a}} friendly bid from Inco and a hostile bid from Xstrata plc, which was a 20% shareholder of Falconbridge. Xstrata applied to have Falconbridge's pill invalidated, citing among other things that the Falconbridge had had its pill in place without shareholder approval for more than nine months and that the pill stood in the way of Falconbridge shareholders accepting Xstrata's all-cash offer for Falconbridge shares. Despite similar facts with previous cases in which securities regulators had promptly taken down pills, the Ontario Securities Commission ruled that Falconbridge's pill could remain in place for a further limited period as it had the effect of sustaining the auction for Falconbridge by preventing Xstrata increasing its ownership and potentially obtaining a blocking position that would prevent other bidders from obtaining 100% of the shares.|$|E

WEAK SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS: A PRODUCT MARKET RATIONALE In product markets where customers care about firm survival, strong shareholder power can have detrimental implications on firm performance by affecting {{the likelihood that}} the firm is acquired. We use a framework where firms choose their level of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> after comparing the costs of takeover vulnerability, i. e., the loss of customers, with the synergistic benefits of an acquisition. This generates two testable implications. First, it is optimal to have weaker <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> in competitive markets. Second, this link between competition and <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> is stronger in industries characterized by long-term customer relationships. Using data on <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> in the corporate charter, we empirically find that indeed firms have stronger <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> in concentrated industries and especially relationship based industries where customers tend to have a long-term relationship with the firm. We also document that weak <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are associated with worse performance only in non-competitive industries. Finally, we discuss the implications of this framework for the design of various governance mechanisms. In conclusion, the paper provides a rationale for why shareholders themselves might not want strong <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> 1 I...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> on the quality of {{reported}} earnings using a proxy for strength of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> In the analysis, the influence of institutional investors on <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> is incorporated and their joint impact on earnings quality is studied. Design/methodology/approach – Alternative regression models with the level of discretionary accrual (DA) as the dependent variables are estimated. To measure DA, a model developed by DeChow et al. is used. Higher levels of DA imply lower quality of earnings. The independent variables of interest are <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> (measured by a modified Gomper's index) and institutional ownership (measured in three different ways discussed in the paper). A number of control variables, which prior research indicates, that can influence earnings quality is also included. Findings – It is found that stronger <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are associated with higher earnings quality. However, when firms' stocks are held predominantly by institutions with short investment horizons (transient institutions), the role of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> in constraining aggressive and opportunistic management of earnings is significantly diminished or rendered essentially ineffective. Originality/value – This research adds to the understanding of how levels of institutional ownership moderate the association between <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> and earnings quality.

40|$|We {{examine how}} country-level legal and {{institutional}} differences in creditor and <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> shape {{the use of}} bond covenants. Using comprehensive debt covenant information for a sample of Yankee bonds issued by firms from more than 50 countries, we find that bond contracts for firms incorporated in countries with stronger creditor rights use fewer restrictive covenants. This finding suggests that creditor rights laws substitute for debt covenants in reducing the agency cost of debt. On the other hand, bond contracts for firms incorporated in legal regimes with stronger <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> include more covenants, suggesting that greater <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> may actually increase the shareholder-bondholder agency conflict. These results are robust to alternative measures of creditor <b>rights</b> and <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> We also document that stronger firm-level corporate governance is positively related {{to the use of}} restrictive covenants even after controlling for country institutions.

40|$|Importance of {{corporate}} governance as a setting {{of relations between}} management and shareholders of a corporation has been widely acknowledged in the past years. Mechanisms {{of corporate}} governance are very important {{in order to increase}} overall trust in the company and among the individual part of a corporation, especially between managers and investors.

40|$|This paper investigates {{why and how}} bank-level <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> {{affect the}} quality of loans {{originated}} for securitization. Using a sample of bank holding companies, I find that banks with large <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> experience poor performance of securitized loan, especially for banks which suffer large information asymmetry between managers and shareholders. In addition, the negative impact of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> on the quality of securitized loans is mitigated if banks provide less securitization recourse. Lastly, banks with the highest <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> pre-crisis are found to suffer the largest losses in securitized loans during the financial crisis. Overall, the evidence supports the view that when the risk of securitized loans is retained by banks, those with strong <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are more likely to originate risky loans. Hence, there could be a potential negative consequence of having powerful shareholders in banks.

Using a governance index built from 24 firm-level takeover defenses over {{a sample of}} 491 mergers from 1990 to 2001, we provide evidence that investors value a change in corporate governance. We find that firms acquired by bidders with relatively greater investor protection experience significantly greater abnormal returns. On average, 2. 49 percent in additional abnormal return is recorded when bidders with above median <b>shareholders</b> <b>rights</b> acquire firms with below median investor protection. In contrast, we do not find evidence that bidders benefit from the increased social surplus created in transactions where the target corporate governance is improved. The thesis also examines {{the relationship between the}} protection of minority shareholder at the firm-level and the probability of a takeover bid, a stock settlement and the premium paid. Although no statistically significant relation is established between the investor rights and the takeover premium, we are able to confirm a negative correlation with the intensity of M&A activity, providing additional support for the efficiency hypothesis. Evidence is also provided that the method of payment is influenced by the previous degree of <b>shareholders</b> <b>rights</b> in the target and acquiring firm but not by the change in corporate governance following a takeover bid...|$|E

40|$|The great {{corporate}} scandals {{of the recent}} past and the resulting push for legal reform have revived {{the role of the}} shareholder in the corporation as a subject of great debate. Those who favor an expanded role for shareholders in corporate governance tend to focus on developing new legal <b>rights</b> for <b>shareholders,</b> and their critics respond with reasons why such rights are unnecessary and inappropriate. While these issues certainly are worthy of consideration, issues concerning existing <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are more fundamental. If existing rights are adequate or could be improved, then new rights may not be necessary; but if existing rights cannot be salvaged, then efforts to add new rights may be equally unavailing. In this article, I argue that the traditional <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> to vote and to sell their shares could be adequate but are undermined by other laws that impede their exercise. I assume that the traditional role of the shareholder in corporate governance is the appropriate one: the business and affairs of every corporation should be managed by or {{under the direction of the}} board of directors, and <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> can and should be limited accordingly. Nevertheless, <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> are important. Unfortunately, the law does a poor job of securing even these limited rights.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} two {{issues that have}} arisen during the {{development}} of equity capital markets in transition economies. First, it has typically been observed that the divestiture of state assets in Russia has not been implemented comprehensively. Following an introductory chapter, the second chapter develops a model to explain this observation {{in an environment where}} the objective of the state is to maximize revenues from the sale of its shares on the equity capital markets. If the state has private information about the future macroeconomic environment or about potential improvements of the firms' qualities due to improved corporate governance it can signal its private information to investors. This can be achieved by choosing a percentage of the state's shareholdings to be held back from the immediate sales. A second issue which has typically slowed down the development of capital equity markets in transition economies has been the violation of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> Governments have often not guaranteed such rights. However, management might have incentives to introduce <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> voluntarily. The third chapter develops a simple static framework to think about the issue of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> and tests some of its predictions. The chapter presents evidence from a sample of the 140 largest Russian joint stock companies. Only a minority of firms in this sample do honour <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> and the chapter analyzes which firms are more likely to do that. It turns out that large firms are more likely to introduce <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights,</b> possibly because the expected value of stealing profits is smaller. Furthermore, {{there is some evidence that}} large outside blockholders, as well as the state in its role as shareholder, are able to press for <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights.</b> The fourth chapter develops a dynamic model for the introduction of <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> where the firm's ownership is endogenised. The chapter shows that in the short nm, management might be willing to introduce <b>shareholder</b> <b>rights</b> in case it has received a sufficiently large portion of the firm's voting shares in the privatization process. In the long term, more firms will introduce such rights, but only after they have stolen a sufficient part of the firms profits to build up a large equity stake...|$|R
