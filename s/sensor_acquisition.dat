40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} have received consider-able attention {{in recent years}} and {{played an important role in}} data collection applications. Sensor nodes usually have limited supply of energy. Therefore, a major consideration for developing sensor network applications is to conserve the energy for sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient data acquisition algorithm based on the pe-riodic patterns derived from past sensor readings. Our key observation is that sensor readings often exhibit periodic patterns, e. g., the daily cycle of temperature readings, and the patterns provide opportunities for reducing energy con-sumption for <b>sensor</b> data <b>acquisition.</b> We exploit the patterns and use the patterns to build a statistic model for predicting sensor readings. In our approach, <b>sensor</b> data <b>acquisition</b> is needed only when acquired readings are unpredictable. Therefore the energy for <b>sensor</b> data <b>acquisition</b> and the associated radio communications can be conserved. The ex-periments performed with real data validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach...|$|R
