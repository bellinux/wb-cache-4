5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and <b>sodium</b> <b>benzoate.</b> The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

25|$|The {{major cause}} of benzene in soft drinks is the {{decarboxylation}} of benzoic acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315). Benzoic acid is often added to drinks as a preservative in the form of its salts <b>sodium</b> <b>benzoate</b> (E211), potassium benzoate (E 212), or calcium benzoate (E 213). Citric acid is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with benzoic acid, but some evidence suggests that in the presence of ascorbic or erythorbic acid and benzoic acid, citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.|$|E
40|$|Thermodynamic {{parameters}} for the complexation process involving substituted <b>sodium</b> <b>benzoates</b> with a, 13 and 7 cyclodextrins have been determined {{in water and}} in N,N-dimethylformamide at 298. 15 K. The increasing negative enthalpies of complexation in N,N-dimethylformamide moving from a to 7 -cyclodextrin reflects the effects of substituting the cyclodextrin ligand as the cyclodextrin cavity size increases. Single-ion parameters of the new benzoate-cyclodextrin anions have been derived and {{the results show that}} these anions are solvated much better in water than in N,N-dimethylformamide. Thermodynamic {{parameters for}} the complexation of 1 : 1 monosaccharide-cyclodextrin complexes have been determined in water at 298. 15 K. The data show the ability of the cyclodextrins to selectively distinguish between the aldopentoses and aldohexoses. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry of an isolated monosaccharide-cyclodextrin complex reveal that N,N-dimethylformamide is interacting with cyclodextrin. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and spectrophotometric studies together with computer modelled calculations suggest the formation of exclusion type complexes. stability constants, free energies, enthalpies and entropies of complexation of the D-amino acids and D-amino acid trifluoromethanesulphonates in methanol at 298. 15 K are discussed. No significant variations were found in the free energies of complexation of the amino acids {{as a result of an}} entropy-enthalpy compensation effect. The transfer enthalpy of the amino acid cations are negative implying that these cations are enthalpically more stable in methanol than water. However, no complexation in water was found between these guest species and 18 -crown- 6. This is attributed to an interaction between 18 -crown- 6 and water as reflected in the transfer enthalpy of this ligand from water to methanol. Electrochemical, spectrophotometric, nuclear magnetic resonance and calorimetric studies on the interaction of a resorcinol-based calix[4]arene with amines in non-aqueous media (chloroform and benzonitrile) are reported as a contribution to the area of calixarene chemistry involving the generation of new electrolytes, resulting from a combination of proton transfer and hydrogen bonding from the calixarene to the amine.

40|$|Hybrid anion {{exchange}} hollow fiber membranes (HAEHFMs) based on bromomethylated poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (BPPO) are proposed as potential drug carriers for four anionic model drugs, including the <b>sodium</b> salts of <b>benzoate</b> (NaBS), salicylate (NaSA), meta-amino salicylate (NaMAS), and loxoprofen (NaLS). The {{results of the}} static loading and release experiments suggest that electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interaction are the main interaction patterns between the membrane and the drugs. And they are directly influenced by the external phase conditions and the drug physicochemical characteristics, such as structure, molecular weight, dissociation (pKa), and hydrogen bonding capability.

25|$|The {{treatment}} {{goal for}} individuals affected with OTC deficiency is {{the avoidance of}} hyperammonemia. This can be accomplished through a strictly controlled low-protein diet, as well as preventative treatment with nitrogen scavenging agents such as <b>sodium</b> <b>benzoate.</b> The goal is to minimize the nitrogen intake while allowing waste nitrogen to be excreted by alternate pathways. Arginine is typically supplemented as well, {{in an effort to}} improve the overall function of the urea cycle. If a hyperammonemic episode occurs, the aim of treatment is to reduce the individual's ammonia levels as soon as possible. In extreme cases, this can involve hemodialysis.|$|E
25|$|Benzene in {{soft drinks}} {{has to be}} seen in the context of other {{environmental}} exposure. Taking the worst example found to date of a soft drink containing 87.9 ppb benzene, someone drinking a 350 ml (12oz) can would ingest 31 μg (micrograms) of benzene, almost equivalent to the benzene inhaled by a motorist refilling a fuel tank for three minutes.

40|$|Expanded newborn {{screening}} detects patients with modest elevations in citrulline; {{however it is}} currently unclear how to treat these patients and how to counsel their parents. In order to begin to address these issues, we compared the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of 10 patients with mildly elevated citrulline levels. Three patients presented with clinical illness whereas seven came to attention {{as a result of}} expanded {{newborn screening}}. One patient presented during pregnancy and responded promptly to IV <b>sodium</b> phenylacetate/sodium <b>benzoate</b> and arginine therapy with no long-term adverse effects on mother or fetus. Two children presented with neurocognitive dysfunction, one of these responded dramatically to dietary protein reduction. ASS enzyme activity was not deficient in all patients with biallelic mutations suggesting this test cannot exclude the ASS 1 locus in patients with mildly elevated plasma citrulline. Conversely, all symptomatic patients who were tested had deficient activity. We describe four unreported mutations (p. Y 291 S, p. R 272 H, p. F 72 L, and p. L 88 I), as well as the common p. W 179 R mutation. In silico algorithms were inconsistent in predicting the pathogenicity of mutations. The cognitive benefit in one patient of protein restriction and the lack of adverse outcome in seven others restricted from birth, suggest a role for protein restriction and continued monitoring to prevent neurocognitive dysfunction. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of <b>sodium</b> phenoxide into <b>benzoates</b> over polymer-supported phase-transfer catalysts with trialkylamines as the functional groups (triphase catalysis) was investigated.

During the reaction, the catalyst stays between the aqueous and organic phases. The overall reaction rate was strongly dependent on the stirring speed and the ionic exchange of Cl(-) of the catalyst with PhO(-) in the interfacial region. The reaction rate decreased with increasing the mean particle sizes for 1. 38 % DVB catalyst. The variation of the catalytic intermediate within the catalyst was determined to verify the reaction mechanism. A kinetic model was also proposed to correlate the reaction rate constants.

This study is focused on corrosion which occurs in the hydraulic access cover areas of the guide arm assemblies. The HK 26 GHLS is continuously exposed to a fluctuating marine environment and occasional high temperature rocket exhaust gases. 1008, 1018, ASTM A 514 Grade B, and ASTM A 514 Grade E steel specimens were sujected to potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, crevice, atmospheric, immersion, inhibitor, atmospheric, and paint tests in Port Huememe, CA sea water to ascertain corrosion mechanisms taking place and effective corrosion control/prevention measures. No passive film was formed {{on any of the}} steels tested when immersed in sea water. Pitting occurred at magnesium sulfide inclusions, grain boundaries, and localized areas where corrosion product films were breached.
