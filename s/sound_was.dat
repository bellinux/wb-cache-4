5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, the <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E

5|$|When {{fin whale}} <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> the vocalizations of fin whales.|$|R
5|$|Ocean of <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in January 1996 by Virgin Records. It was well received by music critics and finished {{fourth in the}} voting for The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop poll. The album later went out of print.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe basic {{difference}} between real and virtual <b>sound</b> environments <b>is</b> that virtual <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> originating from another environment or are artificially created, whereas the real <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> the natural existing {{sounds in the}} user's own environment. Augmented Reality Audio combines these aspects in a way where real and virtual <b>sound</b> scenes <b>are</b> mixed so that virtual <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> perceived as an extension or a complement to the natural ones...|$|R

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, {{it was clear that}} the Sepultura <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E

50|$|Cues {{originating}} at the same, or slowly changing, positions {{usually have}} the same source.

5|$|Damage Sustained by the System. Contrary to {{what was}} done in other places, {{electricity}} was not shut down in Grand Cayman before arrival of the hurricane. Total system failure came at around 01:40 hours on 12 September. Slight damage was sustained by the North Sound Road power plant, and more extensive damage occurred in transmission lines and several substations {{as well as in}} distribution grids. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} submarine cable in the North <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> damaged 1,500 feet offshore.|$|E
5|$|Feeder's {{music has}} been {{inspired}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists and styles, including The Police, Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins.

50|$|The {{music of}} Twotone {{features}} regular techno conventions, {{such as a}} regular kick drum and snare beat, but these <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> augmented by irregular rhythmic placements and supplemental click and cut sounds.

Other featured <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> vocal snippets and occasional industrial samples.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, the <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} {{using the}} Musyx audio format, but WayForward chose to switch during development. The soundtrack featured about 20 songs at the time, and was composed by Jake Kaufman. Kaufman ultimately used the Paragon 5 GameBoy Tracker {{to create the}} music. Paragon 5's CEO, Paul Bragiel, served as music producer, and Stephane Hockenhull performed music replay.|$|E
5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a {{noise is}} heard {{that sounds like}} {{somebody}} knocking at a door.

5|$|The Nashville <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> {{a popular}} {{kind of country}} music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most to innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E

Its name comes from the Croatan Indians who once {{inhabited}} the area. The Croatan <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> crossed by two bridges, the older William B. Umstead Bridge, and the newer Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 64.|$|R

5|$|The Russian {{entry to}} the Northwest Coast, beyond Prince William <b>Sound,</b> <b>was</b> slow because of a {{shortage}} of ships and sailors. Yakutat Bay was reached in 1794 and the settlement of Slavorossiya, originally intended to be the colonial capital, was built there in 1795. Reconnaissance of the coast {{as far as the}} Queen Charlotte Islands was carried out by James Shields, a British employee of the Golikov-Shelikhov Company. In 1795, Alexandr Baranov sailed into Sitka Sound, claiming it for Russia. Hunting parties arrived in the following years. By 1800, three-quarters of the Russian-American Company's sea otter skins came from the Sitka Sound area, amounting to several thousand per year. Sitka <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> also where serious competition between the Russians, British, and Americans first arose.|$|E
5|$|The band's early <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> {{rooted in}} post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. In 2010, they began experimenting with acoustic music, (obvious in 2014 release Unbroken, Untied) {{a theme that}} would expand and develop their sound and audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship and abuse of the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E
50|$|In human speech, egressive <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> <b>sounds</b> {{by which}} the air stream is created by pushing air out through the mouth or nose. The three types of egressive <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> pulmonic egressive (from the lungs), glottalic egressive (from the glottis), and lingual (velaric) egressive (from the tongue). The {{opposite}} of an egressive <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> an ingressive <b>sound,</b> {{by which the}} airstream flows inward through the mouth or nose.|$|R
50|$|In places {{throughout}} the film, telemetry <b>sounds</b> from spacecraft <b>were</b> integrated {{so that they}} themselves became the music. None of these telemetry <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> from Apollo, because by that time telemetry was so rapid and of such frequency that even slowed down was inaudible to the ear. The telemetry <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> taken from Mariner IV which flew by Mars many years before, the last time such <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> audible.|$|R
50|$|The swiping <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, {{the bigger the}} swipe will be.
