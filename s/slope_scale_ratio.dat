To investigate variations in stability on the <b>slope</b> <b>scale,</b> stuffblock and rammrutsch stability tests were carried out in an array on eight small avalanche slopes above timberline near Davos, Switzerland over the winter 2001 - 02. On each slope 17 to 26 stability tests were done. The analysis focuses on failures in two persistent weak layers that were found on all eight slopes. The median {{and the spread of}} the stability values are calculated. Slopes with low average stability and low variation in stability are more critical than if either average stability or variation in stability is high. <b>Slope</b> <b>scale</b> trends in stability were found on some slopes. Depth of the failure layer partly explained variations in stability.

40|$|Wildfires {{can have}} {{important}} impacts on hydrological processes and soil erosion in forest catchments, {{due to the}} destruction of vegetation cover and changes to soil properties. However, the processes involved are non-linear and not fully understood. This has severely limited the understanding on the impacts of wildfires, especially in the up-scaling from hillslopes to catchments; in consequence, current models are poorly adapted for burnt forest conditions. The objective of this presentation is to give an overview of the hydrological response and sediment yield from the micro-plot to <b>slope</b> <b>scale,</b> in the first year following a wildfire (2008 / 2009) that burnt an entire catchment nearby the Colmeal village, central Portugal. The overview will focus on three slopes inside the catchment, with samples including: • Runoff at micro-plot scale (12 bounded plots) and <b>slope</b> <b>scale</b> (12 open plots); • Sediments and Organic Matter loss at micro-plot scale (12 bounded plots) and <b>slope</b> <b>scale</b> (12 open plots plus 3 Sediment fences); • Rainfall and Soil moisture data; • Soil Water Repellency and Ground Cover data. The analysis of the first year following the wildfire clearly shows the complexity of runoff generation and the associated sediment transport in recently burnt areas, with pronounced differences between hillslopes and across spatial scales as well as with marked variations through time. This work was performed in the framework of the EROSFIRE-II project (PTDC/AGR-CFL/ 70968 / 2006) which has as overall aim to predict soil erosion risk in recently burnt forest areas, including common post-fire forest management practices; the project focuses on the simultaneous measurement of runoff and soil erosion at multiple spatial scales.

The radiative transfer equation (RTE) considering gas and particle radiation in a non-uniform plume has been adopted and solved by the finite volume method (FVM) to compute the three dimensional, spectral and directional radiation of a plume in the infrared waveband 2 – 6 μm. Conditions at wavelengths 2. 7 μm and 4. 3 μm are discussed in detail, and ratios of plume radiation for reduced-scale through full-scale models are examined. This work shows that, with increasing <b>scale</b> <b>ratio</b> of a computed rocket motor, area of the high-temperature core increases as a 2 power function of the <b>scale</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the radiation intensity of the plume increases with 2 – 2. 5 power of the <b>scale</b> <b>ratio.</b> The infrared radiation of plume gases shows a strong spectral dependency, while that of Al 2 O 3 particles shows spectral continuity of gray media. Spectral radiation intensity of a computed solid rocket plume’s high temperature core increases significantly in peak radiation spectra of plume gases CO and CO 2. Al 2 O 3 particles are the major radiation component in a rocket plume. There is good similarity between contours of plume spectral radiance from different scale models of computed rockets, and there are two peak spectra of radiation intensity at wavebands 2. 7 – 3. 0 μm and 4. 2 – 4. 6 μm.

40|$|International audienceTo produce {{probability}} distributions {{for regional}} {{climate change in}} surface temperature and precipitation, a probability distribution for global mean temperature increase has been combined with the probability distributions for the appropriate scaling variables, i. e. the changes in regional temperature/precipitation per degree global mean warming. Each scaling variable {{is assumed to be}} normally distributed. The uncertainty of the scaling relationship arises from systematic differences between the regional changes from global and regional climate model simulations and from natural variability. The contributions of these sources of uncertainty to the total variance of the scaling variable are estimated from simulated temperature and precipitation data in a suite of regional climate model experiments conducted {{within the framework of the}} EU-funded project PRUDENCE, using an Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA). For the area covered in the 2001 ? 2004 EU-funded project SWURVE, five case study regions (CSRs) are considered: NW England, the Rhine basin, Iberia, Jura lakes (Switzerland) and Mauvoisin dam (Switzerland). The resulting regional climate changes for 2070 ? 2099 vary quite significantly between CSRs, between seasons and between meteorological variables. For all CSRs, the expected warming in summer is higher than that expected for the other seasons. This summer warming is accompanied by a large decrease in precipitation. The uncertainty of the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratios</b> for temperature and precipitation is relatively large in summer because of the differences between regional climate models. Differences between the spatial climate-change patterns of global climate model simulations make significant contributions to the uncertainty of the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratio</b> for temperature. However, no meaningful contribution could be found for the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratio</b> for precipitation due to the small number of global climate models in the PRUDENCE project and natural variability, which is often the largest source of uncertainty. In contrast, for temperature, the contribution of natural variability to the total variance of the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratio</b> is small, in particular for the annual mean values. Simulation from the probability distributions of global mean warming and the <b>scaling</b> <b>ratio</b> results in a wider range of regional temperature change than that in the regional climate model experiments.
