40|$|Lentiviral vector-based {{gene therapy}} {{has been used}} to target the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) using an antisense env payload. We have analyzed lentiviral-vector integration <b>sites</b> <b>from</b> three treated individuals. We compared integration <b>sites</b> <b>from</b> the ex vivo vector-transduced CD 4 + cell products to <b>sites</b> <b>from</b> cells recovered at several times after infusion. Integration sites were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing, yielding a total of 7, 782 unique integration <b>sites</b> <b>from</b> the ex vivo product and 237 unique <b>sites</b> <b>from</b> cells recovered after infusion. Integrated vector copies in both data sets were found to be strongly enriched within active genes and near epigenetic marks associated with active transcription units. Analysis of integration relative to nucleosome structure on target DNA indicated favoring of integration in outward facing DNA major grooves on the nucleosome surface. There was no indication that growth of transduced cells after infusion resulted in enrichment for integration sites near proto-oncogene 5 ′-ends or within tumor suppressor genes. Thus, this first look at the longitudinal evolution of cells transduced with a lentiviral vector after infusion of gene modified CD 4 + cells provided no evidence for abnormal expansions of cells due to vector-mediated insertional activation of proto-oncogenes...|$|R
