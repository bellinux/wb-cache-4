5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard <b>sandy</b> <b>limestone</b> {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
25|$|The Archaean granites and gneisses of the Yilgarn Craton {{form the}} high ground of the Perth Hills and can be {{observed}} in road cuts, with good examples in the Mundaring Weir area. The only exposed sediments of the Perth Basin, west of the fault, are of Cenozoic age, and comprise the material such as <b>sandy</b> <b>limestone,</b> travertine and dune sand on which the city of Perth is built, including sand dunes of Pleistocene age formed during the last Ice Age.|$|E
500|$|The {{road was}} rebuilt by convicts in the 1850s, {{but by that}} decade, the {{importance}} of the coast road was diminishing. For most of its length, the road went through well-timbered, <b>sandy</b> <b>limestone</b> country of little value to agriculture, and settlers {{in the vicinity of the}} road were scarce. In contrast, settlements had spread and prospered in the foothills of the Darling Scarp, and on 1 July 1853, Colonial Secretary Frederick Barlee announced a new proposal for a Perth–Pinjarra–Bunbury route along the foothills, with a [...] width, mostly following the alignment of previous tracks. Between 1864 and 1876, two parties of convicts were involved in the making of the road.|$|E
50|$|The sediments of the Perth Basin are Tertiary and Quaternary in age {{immediately}} below Perth {{and include}} coquina, travertine, and <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> with abundant shelly material. Perth is sited {{on a set}} of sand dunes formed during the Pliocene-Pleistocene during the last ice age. Offshore, the sand dune system and surficial deposits transition into a system of partly eroded <b>limestones</b> and <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones.</b> These form a series of drowned cuestas which today form submerged reefs.|$|R
50|$|The {{third and}} last {{sequence}} of the Lias sets in during the Lower Toarcian without any detrital deposits at its base, the sediments being black ammonite-bearing marls (with Harpoceras falciferum and Hildoceras bifrons). Towards {{the end of the}} Toarcian {{and the beginning of the}} Aalenian, the sediments turn into <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> indicating another regression. Interlayered with these <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> are oyster beds, iron oolite and gypsum layers; they contain ammonites like Pleydellia aalensis and Leioceras opalinum. The sequence ends with an erosional unconformity.|$|R
50|$|Because it {{is heavily}} {{composed}} of ancient seabed, the Brooks Range contains ancient marine and other fossils. In {{addition to the}} coral fossils shown at left, trilobites and brachiopods from the middle Cambrian {{have been found in}} the <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Central Brooks Range.|$|R
500|$|One of the highest, and {{therefore}} youngest, formations {{seen in the}} Grand Canyon area is the Kaibab Limestone (see 6d in figure 1). It erodes into ledgy cliffs that are [...] thick and was laid down in latest early Permian time, about 270million years ago, by an advancing warm, shallow sea. The formation is typically made of <b>sandy</b> <b>limestone</b> {{sitting on top of}} a layer of sandstone. This is the cream to grayish-white rock that park visitors stand on while viewing the canyon from both rims. It is also the surface rock covering much of the Kaibab Plateau just north of the canyon and the Coconino Plateau immediately south. Shark teeth have been found in this formation as well as abundant fossils of marine invertebrates such as brachiopods, corals, mollusks, sea lilies, and worms. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remainder}} of the North Col Formation, exposed between [...] on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between , the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-sericite-quartz schist. Between , {{the lower part of}} the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of quartzose marble. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey sandstone, calcareous sandstone, graywacke, and <b>sandy</b> <b>limestone.</b> The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the [...] "Lhotse detachment".|$|E
6000|$|Lying on it, {{as we go}} south-eastward, appear {{alternate}} beds of <b>sandy</b> <b>limestone,</b> with vast {{depths of}} clay between them. These [...] "oolites," [...] or freestones, furnish the famous Bath stone, the Oxford stone, and the Barnack stone of Northamptonshire, of which {{some of the finest}} cathedrals are built--a stone only surpassed, I believe, by the Caen stone, which comes from beds of the same age in Normandy. These freestones and clays abound in fossils, but of kinds, be it remembered, which differ more and more from those of the lias beneath, as the beds are higher in the series, and therefore nearer. [...] There, too, are found principally the bones of that extraordinary flying lizard, the Pterodactyle, which had wings formed out of its fore-legs, on somewhat the same plan as those of a bat, but with one exception. In the bat, as any one may see, four fingers of the hand are lengthened to carry the wing, while the first alone is left free, as a thumb: but in the Pterodactyle, the outer or [...] "little" [...] finger alone is lengthened, and the other four fingers left free--one of those strange instances in nature of the same effect being produced in widely different plants and animals, and yet by slightly different means, on which a whole chapter of natural philosophy--say, rather, natural theology--will have to be written some day.|$|E
5000|$|The August Town Formation {{comprises}} <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> and calcareous sandstones with sporadic clays or conglomerates (James-Williamson, S and Mitchell S.F 2012). The age is Mid Miocene to Pliocene. It {{was first}} described by Matley (1951). Matley (1951) describes the August Town Formation as fossiliferous sands, gravels and calcareous marls.|$|R
40|$|Especially in {{the western}} part of the Netherlands, Eocene <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> from Belgium have elaborately been used in the {{construction}} of many 13 th – 17 th century monuments. These comprise both the Lede or Balegem stone from the Lede formation and the Gobertange stone from the Brussels formation. Over the centuries, both stones suffered serious damage in many monuments, manifest by typical black gypsum crusts. Whilst nowadays replacement with original stones would be favoured if enough material would be available, and is done at a small scale, several replacement stones have been used during end 19 th and 20 th century restorations. The typical white <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones</b> have been replaced by various French limestones, amongst them Anstrude, Brauvilliers, Coutarnoux, Euville, Faverolles, Massangis (Vaurion), Reffroy, Savonnières, St. -Joire, and St. -Pierre-Aigle.

50|$|The Bündner schists were {{deposited}} in the two small oceanic basins (the Valais Ocean and the Piemont-Liguria Ocean) that were located south of the European continent in the Mesozoic era. They formed a kilometers thick monotonous layer of dark clays, marbles and <b>sandy</b> <b>limestones.</b> These sediments were subducted to great depths during the Alpine orogeny. The resulting metamorphism and deformation turned them into calcareous phyllites and schists, strongly foliated rocks rich in micas.|$|R
