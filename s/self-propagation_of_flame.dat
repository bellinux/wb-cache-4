40|$|The {{ignition}} and flame initiation in a gaseous reacting mixture {{subject to a}} local source of thermal energy is analysed by means of large activation energy asymptotics. The ignition transient {{is assumed to be}} long enough for heat conduction to be the dominant cooling mechanism. We show the existence of a critical valué of the Damkóhler number, defined as the ratio of appropriate characteristic times of conduction and chemical reaction, such that ignition only occurs for supercritical valúes. Additional conditions are required to ensure <b>self-propagation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>flame</b> after ignition. These are obtained, with the thermal-diffusive model, for a source of energy represented by an instantaneous point, line or planar source. The analysis, involving an unsteady free-boundary problem, shows that the initial flame kernel evolves to a self-propagating fíame only if the energy released by the source is greater than a critical valu...|$|R
40|$|International audienceData {{obtained}} in 3 D direct numerical simulations of statistically planar, 1 D premixed turbulent flames {{indicate that the}} global burning velocity, flame surface area, and the mean flame brush thickness exhibit significant large-scale oscillations with time. Analysis of the data shows that the oscillations are caused by origin, growth, and subsequent disappearance of elongated channels filled by unburned gas. The growth of such an unburned mixture finger (UMF), which deeply intrudes into combustion products, is controlled by a physical mechanism of flame-flow interaction {{that has not yet}} been highlighted in the turbulent combustion literature, to the best of the present authors knowledge. More specifically, the fingers grow due to strong axial acceleration of unburned gas by local pressure gradient induced by heat release in surrounding flamelets. Under conditions of the present DNS, this physical mechanism plays an important role by producing at least as much flame surface area as turbulence does when the density ratio is equal to 7. 5. Although, similarly to the Darrieus-Landau (DL) instability, the highlighted physical mechanism results from the interaction between a premixed flame and pressure field, it is argued that the UMF and the DL instability are different manifestations of the aforementioned interaction. Disappearance of an UMF is mainly controlled by the high-speed <b>self-propagation</b> <b>of</b> strongly inclined <b>flame</b> fronts (cusps) to the leading edge <b>of</b> the <b>flame</b> brush, but significant local increase in displacement speed due to large negative curvature of the front plays an important role also...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} simulating premixed turbulent combustion in gas turbine and spark ignition engines consists of tracking an average flame surface {{in an average}} velocity field. Although such an approach is widely used both within RANS and LES framework, the basic substantiation of the corresponding kinematic (or level set, or mean Gt) equation {{has not yet been}} elaborated well. The goal of the present paper is to derive such an equation in a straight forward manner from the well-known G-equation for tracking an infinitely thin flame sheet (flamelet) in a turbulent flow in the simplest case of a statistically one-dimensional premixed turbulent flame. The derived equation clarifies the physical meaning of (i) the speed <b>of</b> the <b>self-propagation</b> <b>of</b> the mean <b>flame</b> surface and (ii) the mean flow velocity used to track the surface. In order for the mean flame speed to be equal to the turbulent burning velocity, the velocity used to track the mean flame should differ from the mean flow velocity at the flame surface. In the simplest case of a statistically one-dimensional (planar or spherical) premixed turbulent flame, the former velocity is equal to the extrapolation of the mean velocity profile in the fresh gas to the mean flame surface. An extension of the aforementioned kinematic equation to a general three-dimensional case is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Prompted by {{observational}} {{evidence for}} an enhanced source of surface nutrients within an anticyclonic eddy in the NE Atlantic, we investigate vertical transport processes that may produce such a phenomenon. For the eddy investigated, the dominant mechanism {{is found to}} be ageostrophic circulation resulting from a perturbation of the circular flow of the eddy. This can produce upwelling velocities of order 10 md? 1. Ekman pumping due to wind stress on the eddy also produces upwelling within, but on a smaller scale of ~ 0. 5 md? 1. There is no evidence that <b>self-propagation</b> <b>of</b> the eddy leads to an enhanced nutrient flux by displacement upwards of nutrient-laden deeper isopycnals over the core of the eddy. Deeper winter mixing within the eddy relative to the surroundings, however, may contribute to the elevated nutrient levels...|$|R
40|$|CENH 3 is a centromere-specific histone H 3 variant {{essential}} for kinetochore assembly. Despite its {{central role in}} centromere function, {{there has been no}} conclusive evidence supporting CENH 3 as sufficient to determine centromere identity. To address this question, we artificially targeted Drosophila CENH 3 (CENP-A/CID) as a CID-GFP-LacI fusion protein to stably integrated lac operator (lacO) arrays. This ectopic CID focus assembles a functional kinetochore and directs incorporation of CID molecules without the LacI-anchor, providing evidence for the <b>self-propagation</b> <b>of</b> the epigenetic mark. CID-GFP-LacI-bound extrachromosomal lacO plasmids can assemble kinetochore proteins and bind microtubules, resulting in their stable transmission for several cell generations even after eliminating CID-GFP-LacI. We conclude that CID is both necessary and sufficient to serve as an epigenetic centromere mark and nucleate heritable centromere function...|$|R
