5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary <b>stator</b> design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a <b>stator</b> by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBowed-twisted <b>stators</b> {{with large}} camber angles have been {{developed}} to replace the conventional tandem <b>stators</b> in an axial transonic fan stage working at high subsonic speeds. Experimental study is carried out on both stages with tandem <b>stators</b> and with bowed-twisted <b>stators.</b> Compared to the tandem <b>stators,</b> the bowed-twisted <b>stators</b> change the distribution of the low-energy fluid and the potential high-energy fluid at the compressor outlets, reduce the endwall loss significantly, improve the aerodynamic matching of rotors and <b>stators,</b> and eventually increase the fan stage performances. The aerodynamic performances of the fan stage at different operating points are compared and contrasted. The results show that the transonic fan stage with bowed-twisted <b>stators</b> has better aerodynamic performances. It is thus suggested that the bowed-twisted <b>stators</b> with large camber angles be popularized into the high-loaded transonic fan designs...|$|R

50|$|Anyone new to {{variable}} <b>stators</b> had {{to overcome}} {{the complexity of the}} linkages and the difficulty of sealing the pivots and airfoil root/casing clearances. Two spools needed more knowledge about bearings and sealing. GE studied both options for nearly a year before deciding, in 1952, that they should pursue variable <b>stators</b> for the 12:1 pressure ratio(PR) compressor. Rolls-Royce had tested a rig compressor with four stages of variable <b>stators</b> in 1949 but did not pursue the idea at the time for the 6.5:1(PR) Avon. Connors tells us that Pratt and Whitney chose two spools for the 12:1(PR) J57 as they knew a lot more about bearings and sealing than about variable <b>stators.</b>|$|R
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a <b>stator.</b> This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on the bacterial flagellar motor {{have shown that}} the structure of this nanomachine, which drives locomotion {{in a wide range of}} bacterial species, is more dynamic than previously believed. Specifically, the number of active torque-generating complexes (<b>stators)</b> was shown to vary across applied loads. This finding brings under scrutiny the experimental evidence reporting that limiting (zero-torque) speed is independent of the number of active <b>stators.</b> Here, we propose that, contrary to previous assumptions, the maximum speed of the motor increases as additional <b>stators</b> are recruited. This result arises from our assumption that <b>stators</b> disengage from the motor for a significant portion of their mechanochemical cycles at low loads. We show that this assumption is consistent with current experimental evidence and consolidate our predictions with arguments that a processive motor must have a high duty ratio at high loads...|$|R
50|$|When the RB211 {{programme}} started, it {{was intended}} {{that none of the}} compression system would require variable <b>stators,</b> unlike the American competition. Unfortunately, it was found that, because of the shallow working line on the Intermediate Pressure Compressor (IPC), at least one row of variable <b>stators</b> was required on the IPC, to improve its surge margin at throttled conditions. This feature has been retained throughout the RB211 and Trent series. Although the original intent was not met, Rolls-Royce eliminated the need for many rows of variable <b>stators,</b> with all their inherent complexity, thereby saving weight, cost and improving reliability.|$|R

An analysis of the test results with comparisons to theoretical predictions supports the following conclusions: (1) For small seals, the Hirs' friction-factor model is more restricted than had been thought; (2) For smooth seals, predictions of stiffness and damping improve markedly as the radical clearance is reduced; (3) Friction-factor data for hole-pattern-seal <b>stators</b> frequently deviates from the Hirs model; (4) Predictions of stiffness and damping coefficients for hole-pattern-stator seals is generally reasonable; (5) Tests for the hole-pattern <b>stators</b> at reduced clearances show no clear optimum for hole-pattern seals with respect to either hole-area ratio or hole depth to minimum clearance ratios; (6) Tests of these hole-pattern <b>stators</b> show no significant advantage in net damping over smooth seals; (7) Tests of helically-grooved seal <b>stators</b> in Halon show reasonable agreement between theory and prediction for leakage and direct stiffness but poor agreement for the net damping coefficient...|$|R
40|$|An aeroacoustic {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} assess the effects of adding mass flow at the trailing edges of four <b>stators</b> upstream of an aircraft engine simulator. By using trailing edge blowing to minimize the shed wakes of the <b>stators,</b> the flow into the rotor was made more uniform. In these experiments a reduced number of <b>stators</b> (four) was used in a 1 / 14 scale model inlet which was coupled to a 4. 1 in (10. 4 cm) turbofan engine simulator with 18 rotors and 26 downstream <b>stators.</b> This study is a preliminary step toward a more in depth investigation of using trailing edge blowing to reduce unsteady rotor-stator interaction. Steady-state measurements of the aerodynamic flow field and acoustic far field were made in order to evaluate the aeroacoustic performance at three simulator speeds: 40 %, 60 %, and 88 % of the design speed. The lowest test speed of 40 % design speed showed the most dramatic reduction in radiated noise. Noise reductions as large as 8. 9 dB in the blade passing tone were recorded at 40 % design speed, while a tone reduction of 5. 5 dB was recorded at 60 % design speed. At 88 % design speed a maximum tone reduction of 2. 6 dB was recorded. In addition, trailing edge blowing reduced the overall sound pressure level in every case. For both the 40 % design speed and the 60 % design speed, the fan face distortion was significantly reduced due to the trailing edge blowing. The addition of trailing edge blowing from the four upstream <b>stators</b> did not change the total pressure ratio, and the mass flow added by the blowing was approximately 1 %. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that blowing from the trailing edges of the <b>stators</b> is effective in reducing unsteady rotor-stator interaction and the subsequent forward radiated noise. ii...|$|R
