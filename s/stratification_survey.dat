40|$|This general {{introduction}} locates the GBCS {{papers on the}} elite, and their respondents, within a context. It emphasizes {{some of the key}} points made by the respondents in order to intervene in a discussion about what is at stake in doing sociological research on class. It draws attention to the differences between on the one hand status and stratification, and on the other class struggle perspectives, and hence the difference between a hierarchical gradational analysis and a relational one based on the struggle between groups over value. I begin to answer a question raised by many of the respondents in this special issue: “what is the question that the analysis of class is designed to answer?” I also draw attention to some of the problems with Bourdieu’s “structuring architecture”, showing how the partial reproduction of Bourdieu presents fundamental problems, leading to a Great British <b>Stratification</b> <b>Survey</b> (“GBSS”) rather than a GBCS. The different trajectories in class analysis that confusingly merge over the concept of culture in the present are briefly mapped, showing very different intentions in analysis. I argue that to understand class we need to understand the processes of classification: exploitation, domination, dispossession and devaluation, and their legitimation. Overall this special issue extends the sociological debate on class into a larger political frame about injustice, classification and value. It develops arguments from anthropology that maintain that it is the ability to define what value is (through culture) that is the ultimate difference in politics and power...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} four descriptive research questions. First, {{is there}} a direct effect of social background on labour market success {{over and above the}} effect of own education? Second, has this effect declined over time? Third, does it vary depending on the level of education achieved and, more precisely, is it weaker among those with higher education. Finally, have the returns on education in the chances of access to the upper class (professional and managerial occupations) varied over time? These questions are addressed for the Spanish case by using comparable social <b>stratification</b> <b>surveys</b> for the years 1988, 1989, 1990 - 1998, 2005 and 2006. Three measures of success in the labour market (LM) are considered: labour income, a socio-economic index (ISEI) and the chances of access to a given social class. The main findings of the paper are that: there is a considerable direct effect of social origin on LM success; this effect has not changed (and actually if anything it might have increased) over time; and it does not vanish among those with higher education. There is on the other hand evidence of credential inflation, such that the same educational qualification provided better chances to access the most rewarding occupations in the past, compared to nowadays. Once these phenomena and trends are documented, the paper also sets out to investigate possible mechanisms underlying the direct effect of social origins on LM success. It, thus, explores whether the influence of social origins actually become apparent through the choice of field of studies, whether it reflects different abilities captured by performance at school, whether it might hinder social skills related to the family of origin or whether it is due to social networks used in finding a job...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the optimum plot size as well as the appropriate sample size in order to provide an accurate sampling of natural regeneration surveys in high floodplain forests, low floodplain forests and in floodplain forests without stratification in the Amazonian estuary. Data were obtained at Exportadora de Madeira do Pará Ltda. – EMAPA forestlands, located in Afuá County, State of Pará. Based on the results, the following plot sizes were recommended: 70 m 2 - SC 1 (0, 3 m ≤ h < 1, 5 m), 80 m 2 - SC 2 (h ≥ 1, 50 m to DAP < 5, 0 cm), 90 m 2 - SC 3 (5, 0 cm ≤ DAP < 15, 0 cm) and 70 m 2 – ASP (h ≥ 0, 3 m to DAP < 15, 0 cm.

40|$|Stratification {{reduces the}} {{variance}} of sample estimates for population parameters by creating homogeneous strata. Often, surveyors stratify the population using the most convenient variables such as age, sex, region, etc. Such convenient methods often do not produce internally homogeneous strata, hence, the precision of the estimates of the variables of interest could be further improved. This paper introduces an R-package called ’stratifyR’ whereby it proposes a method for optimal <b>stratification</b> of <b>survey</b> populations for a univariate study variable that follows a particular distribution estimated from a data set that is available to the surveyor. The stratification problem is formulated as a mathematical programming problem and solved by using a dynamic programming technique. Methods for several distributions such as uniform, weibull, gamma, normal, lognormal, exponential, right-triangular, cauchy and pareto are presented. The package is able to construct optimal stratification boundaries (OSB) and calculate optimal sample sizes (OSS) under Neyman allocation. Several examples, using simulated data, are presented to illustrate the stratified designs that can be constructed with the proposed methodology. Results reveal that the proposed method computes OSB that are precise and comparable to the established methods. All the calculations {{presented in this paper}} were carried out using the stratifyR package that will be made available on CRAN. ...|$|R

40|$|Countryside Survey 2000 (CS 2000) is {{the latest}} in a series of surveys {{designed}} to measure and evaluate stock and change of land cover, landscape features, freshwaters, habitats and the vegetation of Great Britain. The ideas behind CS 2000 developed during the 1960 s and 1970 s and culminated in the first survey of vegetation and land cover in 1978. One kilometer sample squares were selected at random using an environmental <b>stratification.</b> Subsequent <b>surveys</b> took place in 1984, 1990 and 1998, revisiting the original sample locations, whilst progressively expanding in scope and sample size; CS 2000 included soils, breeding birds, remotely sensed imagery, freshwater biota and hydromorphology. Countryside Survey data may be interpreted using the pressure–state–response model, by selecting indicators of process and quality, and by identifying models of expected responses to different pressures. Thus, results showing losses of hedgerows between 1984 and 1990 stimulated new protection for these features. Ideally, CS 2000 data should be used to stimulate experiments to distinguish between different pressures, in order to ensure that policy and management responses are both appropriate and achievable. The experience from CS 2000 may prove helpful for the design and management of other large scale monitoring programmes of ecosystems. In particular, the scope of the survey, and the use to which the data are applied, have evolved through time, and yet continuity was essential for change to be detected efficiently. These objectives were reconciled by collecting the data in a disaggregated form, allowing a high degree of flexibility in both analysis and reporting. ...|$|R
40|$|This applied {{research}} {{study was designed}} to examine hospital employees’ perceptions of safety as it relates to error reporting. Data from safety culture surveys at the research site showed a clear trend of a perception of a punitive environment for error reporting. Hospital administrators depend on error-report data to create safe and reliable systems for care; therefore, a safe reporting environment is a critical component of a safe and just culture. A recently developed instrument was used to survey the 1, 730 employees at the northeastern community hospital regarding their perception of just culture and safety in the error-reporting process. No significant relationships were established between survey scores (perceptions of just culture) and the variables of age, gender, experience, and degree of training in just culture principles for the overall study population. However, significant differences were identified when comparing groups consisting of specific positions or specialties. Notably, administration and management had a more optimistic viewpoint of just culture than other groups, particularly technologists and technicians, who had a somewhat diminished perception of just culture. The findings of this {{applied research}} study have implications for hospital leaders seeking strategies to improve the safety cultures within their organizations. Measurement of specific dimensions of just culture may be valuable in these settings; particularly, <b>stratification</b> of <b>survey</b> results by position with analysis of gaps between leaders and frontline staff may provide a clue to the maturity of the safety culture.

The study instrument is a survey designed to assess respondents' knowledge regarding severe thunderstorms {{through the use of}} both Likert scale and binary response questions. Results of this research may be an important consideration when constructing Severe Thunderstorm and/or Tornado Warning messages, as well as in planning public education endeavors regarding severe weather. Potential users of this information include the National Weather Service, broadcast media, and emergency management personnel. The locational setting for this study is Muncie, Indiana and surrounding rural areas of Delaware County. Reasons for this are based on the identification of Muncie as "Middletown U. S. A. " by social scientists searching for a single city representative of the entire American Midwest region. As a result, the information gained from this research may be valid for many rural communities within the Midwestern United States. Results of the survey suggest that: 1) residents of Muncie believe flash flooding presents the least of all severe weather threats despite statistics that suggest the opposite; 2) severe straight-line winds are much less a threat than tornadoes, even though they are much more common; 3) an overpass provides the best shelter when out on the road, which has been shown not to be the case; and 4) that people should not attempt to drive away from a storm as it approached. <b>Stratification</b> of <b>survey</b> results suggest some of these perceptions are dependent upon respondents' age, gender, and residential location (city versus rural environment).

In {{this article}} {{the authors have}} {{represented}} the introductory research results of the springs located in Dzierżązna drainage basin which touches the Grotniki-LuĆInierz sandr {{in the western part}} of the Łódź Upland margin zone. First of all, the location of the springs, their morphology and the output were subjected to an analysis. The springs can be found in the erosional undercuttings located at the dry valley mouths. They possess distinctly developed long shaped, steep scarped, 2 - 3 m deep spring niches with flat, strongly waterlogged bottoms (fig. 2). The discussion of the research material lets us state that the highest outputs and the low variability occur in the Ciosenka river springs - the left tributary of the Dzierżązna river. The contribution of the spring water in the total Ciosenka river runoff is about 57 %. The Dzierżązna river springs are also characterized by the low variability but their output is much smaller (tab. l). Their contribution in the total Dzierżązna river runoff is hardly 20 %. Different hydrogeological conditions result in the output differentiation of the described springs.

40|$|While spatial {{autocorrelation}} {{is used in}} {{spatial sampling}} survey to improve the precision of the feature's estimate of a certain population at area units, spatial heterogeneity as the <b>stratification</b> frame in <b>survey</b> also often have a considerable effect upon the precision. Under the context of increasingly enriched spatiotemporal data, this paper suggests an information-fusion method to identify pattern of spatial heterogeneity, {{which can be used}} as an informative stratification for improving the estimation accuracy. Data mining is major analysis components in our method: multivariate statistics, association analysis, decision tree and rough set are used in data filter, identification of contributing factors, and examination of relationship; classification and clustering are used to identify pattern of spatial heterogeneity using the auxiliary variables relevant to the goal and thus to stratify the samples. These methods are illustrated and examined in the case study of the cultivable land survey in Shandong Province in China. Different from many stratification schemes which just uses the goal variable to stratify which is too simplified, information from multiple sources can be fused to identify pattern of spatial heterogeneity, thus stratifying samples at geographical units as an informative polygon map, and thereby to increase the precision of estimates in sampling survey, as demonstrated in our case research. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} discusses {{findings of}} {{a study of the}} causal models of explanations of unemployment and poverty that have been developed in the research literature. The data used to examine the models are from the 1985 Edmonton Area Study Survey, University of Alberta (N= 415), and the 1980 Beliefs about Social <b>Stratification</b> Study <b>Survey,</b> University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (N= 704). The unemployment models were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was also used to develop additional causal models, which were also tested with CFA. Sources of variations in explanations were explored using post-hoc ANOVA analysis. The poverty models were also examined using CFA, and sources of variations in explanations were explored using post-hoc ANOVA analysis. A structural equation model (SEM) was also developed to examine causal modelling of explanations for poverty. An examination of the unemployment models revealed that they did not provide a good fit between the causal models from the literature and the data set using CFA. A number of indices were used to evaluate the fit between the models and the data, with the explanation of the rational for the selection of specific measures. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to develop additional causal models of explanations for unemployment that were tested and found to provide a good fit between the model and the data. However, the developed models in the study were different from the models of explanations for unemployment that have been proposed in the research literature. Analysis of the poverty models did provide a good fit between the models and the data, using CFA. A feature of the previous research in this area is that the hypothesized factors of explanations of poverty (and unemployment) have been modeled as having a direct link to the responses. A structural equation model (SEM) was developed that hypothesized that opinions of inequality and equality act as antecedent variables, and that the hypothesized factors from the research literature are intervening variables in relation to public responses in this area. There was some empirical support for the SEM model, as the results produced a fit between the model and the data based upon the results of the selected indices. Implications of this finding for social workers and social policy were then drawn.

The second level specific goals included gathering data for six major regions of Croatia and creating a survey instrument that {{could be used as a}} benchmark for future studies. The third level components were oriented toward development of public policy -to provide data for analytical studies, data on the economic, social, demographic, occupational and environmental correlates of health for understanding of the relationship between health status and health care utilization. Methodology and implementation of 2003 Croatian Adult Health <b>Survey</b> (<b>stratification,</b> sample and household sampling strategy, data collection and response rate as well as data processing, weighting and estimation are described in details. In conclusion, National Health Survey is a precondition for a preventive and health promotion intervention. Using the data from National Health Survey, health care professionals and policy makers are able to produce in-depth analysis supporting development of national health strategy and to improve the health of population...|$|R
40|$|Older {{citizens}} are directly concerned, as potential beneficiaries and informal caregivers, by access to long-term care (LTC) services matching their expectations. The {{aim of this}} research was to collect their opinions regarding LTC arrangements for a diversity of disability profiles. Mailed vignette survey in a representative population-based sample of 3133 community-dwelling persons 68  years or older residing in a Swiss region. All persons received a set of 10 vignettes. For each vignette, they considered 2 social situations successively: a person (1) living with an able-bodied spouse, and (2) living alone or with a spouse unable to help (resulting in 20 vignettes). Subjects selected a care setting (home, sheltered housing, or nursing home) and specified the preferred type of caregivers (spouse, professionals, or both) after community-based care options. Population estimates were based on weighted data accounting for the <b>stratification</b> of the <b>survey</b> sample. A total of 2985 participants (95. 3 %) expressed opinions on 55, 178 vignettes (mean 18. 5 vignettes, SD 4. 1) Institutionalization was selected by 0. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 3 - 1. 4) of the population for the vignette of lowest disability with able-bodied spouse and 78. 8 % (76. 1 - 81. 6) for the vignette of highest disability and no possible help from a spouse. Continence, cognitive, and behavioral difficulties further influenced the preferences expressed for LTC options. Community-based LTC choices involved professionals mostly as a complement to informal help by the spouse, except for vignettes describing isolated moderate cognitive impairment or difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living. In these cases, most favored help provided by spouses only. This survey had high acceptance. Responses to variations in the disability and social profile displayed in the vignettes suggested the validity of measurements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the vegetation database created {{as part of}} the Countryside Survey (CS) of Great Britain (GIVD ID EU-GB- 003) which was established to monitor ecological and land use change in 1978 ([URL] The sample design is based on a series of stratified, randomly selected 1 km squares, which numbered 256 in the 1978 survey, 500 in the 1990 survey, 569 in the 1998 survey and 591 in the 2007 <b>survey.</b> <b>Stratification</b> of sample squares was based on predefined strata (called land classes) which have been derived from a classification of all 1 km squares in Britain based on their topographic, climatic and geological attributes obtained from published maps. A series of vegetation plots were located within each 1 km square using a restricted randomisation procedure designed to reduce aggregation. Linear features (road verges, watercourse banks, hedges, arable margins and field boundaries) and areal features (fields, unenclosed land and small semi-natural biotope patches) were sampled. Linear plots were 1 x 10 m laid out along a feature whilst unenclosed land and small biotopes were sampled using 2 m x 2 m plots. Larger randomly-placed plots were nested 14 m² plots with an inner nest of 2 m x 2 m. Within each 1 km Countryside Survey sample square the land cover and all landscape features were mapped and each parcel of land (and vegetation plot) has been assigned to a Broad Habitat/EUNIS habitat type. This database of vegetation plots is a very useful resource. The data is freely available from the website, however, there are restrictions on the release of the spatial location of the plots. There is now a considerable time-series of plots within the database going back to 1978 representing different habitat types and landscape features that can be analysed to determine changes in vegetation metrics (e. g. Ellenberg scores) and individual species. Vegetation changes can be linked to environmental drivers and the spatial scale (across GB) is sufficiently large to analyse gradients in most driving variables...|$|R
40|$|Summary The thesis {{developed}} and improved methods for the integrated analysis {{of different types}} of fishery independent research surveys (trawl surveys, acoustic surveys, hydrographical surveys, and gillnet surveys) to study the distribution, density, abundance, migration and biological population dynamic parameters of marine fish species. The topics in the thesis addressed different combinations of trawl, hydro-acoustic, gillnet, and hydrographical data and application of different survey data analysis methods under consideration of factors influencing the survey catch and detection efficiency. Each topic was investigated in one of more case studies. One thesis topic has been to provide more precise estimates of fish distribution and density patterns from survey data (Chapter 2). The 1 st case study applied advanced statistical methods to Baltic trawl data and hydro-acoustic survey data in combination with survey sampled hydrographical data to estimate distri­bution and density patterns of juvenile 0 -group Baltic cod. These patterns were largely unknown. In the 2 nd case study new methodology was developed for analyzing trawl research survey data for Baltic cod and whiting including the corre­la­tion in distribution and density according to space, time, size, and species. The more precise density estimates improve the knowledge of the stock-recruitment relationship of Baltic cod and can improve the Baltic multi-species stock assessment. Furthermore, it will enable more precise marine management and spatial planning involving fish stocks and fisheries in the Baltic Sea. In context of Baltic cod stock assessment, the 3 rd case study developed a new method for inter-calibration of trawl survey CPUE data by fish size group exemplified by Baltic cod (and flounder) where the concept of disturbance by one trawl haul in relation to the next have been {{developed and}} quantified when calibrating new research survey trawl gears with the former ones. These results have been based on introduction of a new international ICES BITS trawl research survey design. A second topic was to improve and develop hydroacoustic research survey methods for more precise detection and discrimination of fish species according to fish size and orientation in the water (Chapter 3). Here, the 4 th case study focused on more precise acoustic target strength estimation of juvenile cod, while the 5 th case study has focused on acoustic discrimination of juvenile gadoid fish in particular juvenile Baltic cod. This enables more efficient research survey estimation of juvenile cod (gadoid) density patterns to be used in stock recruitment estimates and stock assessment. The third topic was to estimate more precisely fish mortality, maturity, and growth parameters for small forage fish species using research survey information (Chapter 4). Associated to this, the 5 th case study analysed these population dynamic parameters using trawl survey data taking into account spatial variation. This study provided more precise estimates and deeper understanding of Norway pout mortality, maturity, and growth dynamics. The more precise population dynamic parameters have been implemented in and improved the North Sea Norway pout stock assessment, management advice, management, and long term management plan evaluations. The fourth topic was to develop methodology to integrate hydroacoustic, gillnet, and hydro­gra­phi­cal research survey data to investigate pelagic fish migration patterns (Chapter 5). The methods were applied in the 6 th case study to evaluate Western Baltic herring feeding and spawning migra­tion based on distribution and density estimates in a narrow over-wintering area of the stock. The more precise information on migration patterns gives better possibility for acoustic monitoring of the full stock abundance in different areas and seasons og the year to be used in stock assessment and marine spatial planning. Also, it increases knowledge on biological interactions and mixing with other stocks and species.   In the final synthesis Chapter 6, the thesis reviews relevant analysis methods of research survey data and underlying data distributions, <b>survey</b> design and <b>stratification,</b> trawl <b>survey</b> inter-calibration and standardization, as well as estimation procedures and data processing methods in context of the obtained results and methods developed in the thesis. This is done with focus on survey precision and uncertainty (bias, sources of errors) for trawl and acoustic surveys and factors affecting it.        ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Between 2010 and 2030, a 69 % {{increase}} in type- 2 diabetes {{is expected in}} low-income countries compared to a 20 % {{increase in}} high income countries. Yet health system responsiveness to non-communicable diseases has been slow in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its associated factors in mainly rural settings is lacking, yet such data can guide planning for diabetes control. Objective: The aim of these studies {{was to assess the}} prevalence of type 2 diabetes, its risk factors, risk perceptions, and possible screening tools among people aged 35 - 60 years so as to inform primary care level intervention in rural low-income settings. Methods: Four studies (I-IV) were conducted among people aged 35 - 60 years in a mainly rural demographic surveillance site in eastern Uganda (2011 - 2013). Study I, a cross-sectional survey assessed the prevalence of diabetes-related risk factors (including overweight, hypertension and seven socio-behavioural risk factors) in 1, 656 people. Study II then estimated the prevalence of abnormal glucose regulation (AGR) using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and assessed its socio-behavioural correlates in 1, 497 people. To compare the utility of FPG and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 C) rapid tests in risk <b>stratification,</b> a comparative <b>survey</b> of 795 people was nested into study II (Study III). To assess perceptions about diabetes, 12 Focus Group Discussions were conducted among people afflicted or at higher risk of type 2 diabetes (Study IV). The assessments used standard measurements and cut-offs. Results: About 18 % of people aged 35 - 60 years were overweight, while 21 % had hypertension. Women (OR 3. 7; 95 % CI 2. 7 - 5. 1), peri-urban dwellers (OR 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 3. 0), and wealthier people (OR 4. 1; 95 % CI 2. 4 - 7. 0) {{were more likely to be}} overweight. Only 34 % had adequate knowledge about lifestyle diseases (I). Prevalence of diabetes was 7. 4 % while pre-diabetes was 8. 6 % and 20. 2 % with WHO and American Diabetes Association criteria respectively (II). Prevalence of AGR was twice higher in obese people compared to those with a normal BMI (APRR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 8) (II). Sufficient physical activity and diverse diet were associated with lower likelihood of AGR (II). The direct medical cost of screening one person was US$ 0. 53, translating to US$ 2 per person detected with AGR. Agreement between FPG (the reference) and HbA 1 C in classifying diabetes was moderate (Kappa= 22. 9; AUC = 75 %), while that for AGR was low (Kappa= 11. 0; AUC= 59 %) (III). However, agreement was high (over 90 %) among negative tests and in participants with risk factors for type 2 diabetes. FPG was more practical than HbA 1 C (III). Participants‟ strong perceptions of diabetes as a very severe disease were incongruent with their perceived urgency for lifestyle change (IV). While people with diabetes perceive obesity as „sickness‟, those without diabetes say it signifies „success‟ (IV). Poverty, access to food and large families were cited as barriers to healthy diets. Domestic work was the preferred platform for physical activity increments. Conclusions: Obesity, insufficient physical activity and unhealthy diets are possible aids to identifying people at higher risk of type 2 diabetes in primary care. Mass screening for abnormal glucose regulation may not be affordable to struggling health systems. However, rapid tests have utility in further evaluation of people with risk factors. Health education about lifestyle diseases is a priority and should target to change the community‟s notion of health and healthy lifestyles. Several challenges of adding NCD services to overstretched health systems come to light...|$|R
