Methods: Using original and current literature in this field, this comprehensive review presents the major concepts of keloid pathogenesis and the treatment options stemming from them. Results: Mechanisms for keloid formation include alterations in growth factors, collagen turnover, tension alignment, and genetic and immunologic contribu-tions. Treatment strategies for keloids include established (e. g., surgery, steroid, radiation) and experimental (e. g., interferon, 5 -fluorouracil, retinoid) regi-mens.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} improving the speed of actuators based on shape memory alloys (SMA) by increasing {{the rate at which}} an SMA element can safely be heated. The method consists of measuring the electrical resistance of an SMA element, calculating a maximum <b>safe</b> heating <b>current</b> as a function of measured resistance, and ensuring that the actual heating current does not exceed this maximum value. In effect, resistance is being used as a form of temperature measurement, and the maximum <b>safe</b> heating <b>current</b> is designed to prevent overheating. This method has been incorporated into a two-stage relay controller that controls the motion of a pantograph robot actuated by two antagonistic pairs of SMA wires. Experimental results show a substantial increase in the maximum velocity attainable by this robot, without any change in the cooling regime, purely as a result of faster heating. ...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} an electromagnetic (EM) fire warning alarm sys-tem for underground mines. The system generates a magnetic field for through-the-earth signal trans-mission to microreceivers carried by individual miners. EM fields can induce electric currents in metallic conductors; if an EM transmitting antenna and an electric blasting cap array are too close, the field could induce a current in the blasting array and cause an unintentional initiation of the electric detonators. The USBM conducted tests that define the safe and unsafe regions for using electric detonators near the transmitting antenna of the warning alarm system. The minimum safe distance between a transmitting antenna and a blasting array is the distance where the induced electrical current in the blasting array is 50 mA, which is the <b>safe</b> <b>current</b> level specified in Federal mine safety regulations. Tests indicate that at transmitting power levels of 100 -and 1, 000 -W, separation distances of 9 and 21 m, respectively, were required.

Thus, the tests indicate that, with proper placement of the transmitting antenna, the warning system can be used safely in the proximity of blasting arrays...|$|E

Functional benefit was tested by comparing glutamine versus placebo on change in walking speed at 4 months. Secondary outcome measures were: 2 -minute walk test, work, power, muscle mass (urinary creatinine), markers of myofibrillar protein breakdown (urinary 3 -methyl-histidine/creatinine), serum creatine phospho-kinase, body composition (fat free mass, fat mass percentage), safety and oral nutrient intake. There was no improvement in the primary end point (walking speed) or in secondary measures of muscle function (2 -minute walk test, work, power) in the glutamine group compared with placebo.

No differences in muscle mass, markers of protein breakdown or serum creatine phosho-kinase were observed, except for a blunted increase in fat free mass in the glutamine group which led to a greater increase in fat mass percentage.

40|$|Retaining wall {{design has}} long been carried out {{with the aid of}} either the Rankine or Coulomb {{theories}} of earth pressure. To obtain a closed form solution, these traditional earth pressure theories assume that the soil is uniform. The fact that soils are actually spatially variable leads, however, to two potential problems in design. Namely, 1) do sampled soil properties adequately reect the effective properties of the entire retained soil mass?, and 2) does spatial variability of soil properties lead to active earth pressure effects that are signicantly different than those predicted using traditional models? This paper combines nonlinear nite element analysis with random eld simulation to investigate these two questions and assess just how <b>safe</b> <b>current</b> design practice is. The specic case investigated is a twodimensional frictionless wall retaining a cohesionless drained backll. The wall is designed against sliding using Rankine's earth pressure theory. The design friction angle and unit weight values are obtained by sampling the simulated random soil eld at one location and these sampled soil properties are then used as the effective soil properties in the Rankine model. Failure is dened as occurring when the Rankine predicted force acting on the retaining wall, modied by an appropriate factorofsafety, is less than that computed by the random nite element method employing the actual soil property (random) elds. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the probability of failure of the traditional design approach is assessed {{as a function of the}} factorofsafety used and the spatial variability of the soil. 1 1...|$|E
40|$|SMA {{belongs to}} a class of {{so-called}} “smart materials” which possess properties that can be controlled by application of various types of stimuli – stress, temperature, electric field or magnetic field. In particular, SMA is a smart material which undergoes a temperature- or stress-dependent phase transformation giving it the property of remembering its original shape. Once deformed (up to a certain recoverable strain), SMA returns to its original shape upon heating. In this thesis, a study of SMA models and techniques to improve the performance of SMA actuators was carried out. In general, an SMA model is required for 3 main purposes: simulation, analysis and for model-based hysteresis compensation. In this work, the reduced-order form of John Shaw’s partial-differential equation model is chosen for implementation and simulation. The reduced-order form is used because its simpler structure makes it more useful for real-time control applications. The parameters were estimated for the John Shaw model followed by its implementation in MATLAB. From the view of control applications, a limitation of the John Shaw model is the inability to reproduce the so-called ‘minor loop behavior’ which is observed when the material is subject to cycling resulting in incomplete phase transformations. Modeling minor loop behavior is particularly important in closed-loop strain (or position) control applications since achieving a specific target strain between the two (load-dependent) extremes requires partial phase transformation. Herein, the governing equations are modified to include minor loop behavior. This behavior was tested using damped signals which {{would be expected to}} trigger minor loops in the actual SMA and reasonable match is observed from the simulations. The use of SMA actuators is limited by the relatively slow response time compared to other smart materials. The conventional current saturation (CS) scheme limits the maximum current into the wire at the manufacturer-specified <b>safe</b> <b>current</b> values {{in order to protect the}} wire from damage due to overheating. However, this is a conservative limit on the maximum current and hence, the response is artificially slowed. In order to improve the response time, a model-based temperature saturation (MBTS) scheme was developed, in which current is saturated based on model-predicted temperature. The MBTS scheme allows much higher currents to be applied to the wire, while ensuring that the wire is not damaged. Based on simulations using the reduced-order John Shaw model, it is observed that better tracking occurs using the MBTS scheme in the actuation scheme as compared to the CS scheme...|$|E
