5|$|In 1974, Thulborn {{suggested}} that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a secondary <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b> According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype specimen of the related Abrictosaurus, which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, who argued that the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype specimen of Abrictosaurus; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus.|$|E
25|$|More recently, the kype is {{regarded}} as a secondary <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic</b> displayed by males at the spawning grounds. Therefore, its function is considered to be helping the fish establish a hierarchy among other males where those with larger kypes are dominant over animals with smaller kypes, and/or characteristics that could be of importance in inter- and intra-sexual evaluations of individual quality. The size of the kype is believed to determine male spawning frequency.|$|E

25|$|A kype is a hook-like {{secondary}} <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic</b> which develops at {{the distal}} {{tip of the}} lower jaw in some male salmonids prior to the spawning season.

25|$|Although fine vellus hair {{is present}} in the area in childhood, pubic hair is {{considered}} to be the heavier, longer and coarser hair that develops during puberty as an effect of rising levels of androgens in males and estrogens in females. Pubic hair is part of a person's body hair and a secondary <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Many cultures regard pubic hair to be erotic, and in most cultures pubic hair is associated with genitalia, which both men and women are expected to keep covered at all times. In some cultures, it is the norm for pubic hair to be removed, especially of females, a practice which is regarded as part of personal hygiene. In other cultures, the exposure of pubic hair (for example, when wearing a swimsuit) may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing, and is therefore trimmed or otherwise styled to avoid it being visible.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female secondary <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic</b> and {{an important aspect of}} femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.|$|E
