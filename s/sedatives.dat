5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong <b>sedatives.</b> The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E
25|$|Combined use of {{clonazepam}} {{with certain}} antidepressants, antiepileptics, such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, <b>sedative</b> antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics like zolpidem and alcohol {{may result in}} enhanced <b>sedative</b> effects.|$|R
25|$|However, at {{therapeutic}} doses, GHB reaches {{much higher}} {{concentrations in the}} brain and activates GABAB receptors, which are primarily responsible for its <b>sedative</b> effects. GHB's <b>sedative</b> effects are blocked by GABAB antagonists.|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} proportion of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia have developed these conditions {{as a result of}} alcohol or <b>sedative</b> abuse. Anxiety may pre-exist alcohol or <b>sedative</b> independence, which then acts to perpetuate or worsen the underlying anxiety disorder. Someone suffering the toxic effects of alcohol abuse or chronic <b>sedative</b> use or abuse will not benefit from other therapies or medications for underlying psychiatric conditions. as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Recovery from <b>sedative</b> symptoms may temporarily worsen during alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal.|$|R
5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general <b>sedatives</b> in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Farrar later {{alleged that}} Green had been self-medicating with <b>sedatives</b> and {{narcotics}} to treat pain from infections and injuries periodically throughout their marriage. He recounted several episodes to author Ann Rule {{in which he}} had confronted Green with issues regarding her demeanor, handwriting, and speech patterns which indicated drug intoxication, and said that Green had agreed to stop using the medications each time he confronted her.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the <b>sedatives</b> chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
30|$|Patients under {{mechanical}} ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) require sedation {{in order to}} facilitate ventilator and endotracheal tube tolerance. The <b>sedative</b> agent that must be used should not interfere with early extubation of patients. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine, a common <b>sedative</b> agent used in the ICU, while dexmetomidine is an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, that is used over the last years. It has both <b>sedative</b> and analgesic effects.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of <b>sedative</b> and stimulative music and music {{preference}} on stress reduction when participants are exposed to a stressor, 144 female music education students performed a stressful, mental arithmetic test. After the stress was induced successfully, participants were randomly assigned to four experimental groups. They listened to preferred <b>sedative</b> music, preferred stimulative music, unpreferred <b>sedative</b> music, and unpreferred stimulative music, respectively. Tension and state-anxiety levels were obtained after listening to music. The results revealed that participants who listened to <b>sedative</b> music showed significantly lower tension and state-anxiety levels than did those who listened to stimulative music when music was unpreferred. However, {{there was no significant difference}} of tension and stateanxiety levels between listening to <b>sedative</b> music and stimulative music when music was preferred. These findings demonstrate that the effects of <b>sedative</b> and stimulative music on stress reduction depend on music preference. Our study has important implications for the practice of clinical music therapy since it provides strong support for the use of preferred music when working to reduce patient stress.

40|$|Intravenous {{diazepam}} {{is commonly}} used in clinical dentistry to produce sedation for dental procedures. Its chief benefit seems to derive from its <b>sedative</b> and amnesic properties. The literature contains conflicting reports about the direct analgesic effects of the drug. In the present study, we observed significant increases for conventional pain threshold measures in response to electric tooth pulp stimulation and decreased sensitivity to a fixed painful stimulus when diazepam was administered intravenously using clinical criteria for conscious <b>sedative</b> dosages. The data support the possibility that intravenously administered diazepam in conscious <b>sedative</b> doses may have some analgesic action {{in addition to its}} better documented <b>sedative</b> and amnesic properties...|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by <b>sedatives,</b> to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children <b>sedatives.</b> According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the <b>sedatives</b> Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
50|$|Cinolazepam (marketed {{under the}} brand name Gerodorm) is a drug which is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, <b>sedative</b> and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.Due to its strong <b>sedative</b> properties, it is primarily used as a hypnotic.|$|R
30|$|We evoked our {{experiment}} of the <b>sedative</b> {{effects of}} MEPH by observing the spontaneous locomotor activity of mice both the open field and hole cross test. In these tests, <b>sedative</b> properties of diazepam will produce both decreases {{in the number}} of square cross movements and expound in the new environment. This experimental data demonstrated that the <b>sedative</b> activity of MEPH conceives the satisfactory behavioral changed on the open field test (Table 2).|$|R
50|$|In equine surgery, {{premedication}} with acepromazine {{has been}} shown to reduce the perianaesthetic mortality rate, possibly due to its actions as a <b>sedative</b> and anxiolytic. It is less effective as a <b>sedative</b> if the horse is already excited.|$|R
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. <b>Sedatives,</b> analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2014, a {{day after}} the Twitter controversy, Sunanda was found dead in room number 345 of the Leela Palace hotel in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, where the couple had shifted to, as their house was being renovated and painted. Shashi Tharoor {{discovered}} her body, when she did not wake up from her sleep in the evening. He informed the Delhi Police, who recovered the body from the hotel and sent it for postmortem. According to initial reports, Sunanda was suspected to have committed suicide. Later reports stated that {{the cause of death was}} unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body. They said that these injuries may or may not be the cause of death. The autopsy indicated that she died of drug overdose, most likely a combination of <b>sedatives,</b> other strong medicines and probably alcohol. An investigation has been ordered by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to examine the cause of poisoning and to ascertain if it was murder or suicide. Her body was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in South Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{operation}} is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter comes {{up with an idea}} to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with <b>sedatives</b> in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. While the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.|$|E
50|$|Pazinaclone has a {{very similar}} {{pharmacological}} profile to the benzodiazepines including <b>sedative</b> and anxiolytic properties, but with less amnestic effects, and at low doses it is a relatively selective anxiolytic, with <b>sedative</b> effects only appearing at higher doses.|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the <b>sedative</b> activity of aqueous extract of Vigna trilobata (L) verdc. Leaves using experimental animal models. In the present study aqueous extract of the Vigna trilobata leaves (AEVTL) was used to investigate the <b>sedative</b> activity using Rotarod apparatus and Photoactometer in mice at a dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg of body weight and compared to standard diazepam (5 mg/kg, i. p.). The result obtained from this study revealed that AEVTL possessed significant (p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 01) <b>sedative</b> activity at a dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg by reducing locomotor activity and fall off time in mice in a dose dependent manner. The {{results of this study}} justify the use of the leaves as <b>sedative</b> in traditional medicine. Further studies may be directed at characterizing the bioactive ingredients that are responsible for the observed <b>sedative</b> activity in the plant...|$|R

5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. <b>Sedatives</b> or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the <b>sedative</b> effect of Diospyros lotus L (D. lotus) extract in mice using the open field and Rota rod tests. Methods: For the <b>sedative</b> and muscle relaxants activities of extract/fractions of the plant, in-vivo open field and phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time were used, while the Roda rod test was employed in animals {{for the assessment}} of muscle relaxant activity. Results: Results from this investigation revealed that the extracts of D. lotus have exhibited significant <b>sedative</b> effect in mice (45. 98 %) at 100 mg/kg i. p.

40|$|Background: Older {{people with}} {{dementia}} {{may be particularly}} susceptible to cognitive impairment associated with anticholinergic and <b>sedative</b> medicines. This impairment may be misattributed to the disease process itself. Objective: This review examines clinical considerations associated with using anticholinergic and <b>sedative</b> medicines in people with dementia or incipient cognitive impairment. It highlights issues associated with concomitant use of cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergic medicines, and pharmacotherapy of conditions that commonly occur in people with dementia. Discussion: Use of medicines with anticholinergic or <b>sedative</b> properties may result in adverse events by increasing the overall anticholinergic or <b>sedative</b> load. Patients may benefit from clinicians reviewing the anticholinergic load of the current medicine regimen before the initiation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine.
