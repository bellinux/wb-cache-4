The answer to this question could have important policy implications that affect economic growth and prosperity. In this paper, a panel of firms is followed over a 17 -year period to investigate the relationship between oil price movements, firm size, and <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> Evidence is found that shows the relationship between oil <b>price</b> movements and <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> does vary with firm size and the relationship is strongest for medium-sized firms.

Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares.

40|$|Purpose – This paper, using daily data, {{sets out}} to present an {{empirical}} analysis {{of the relationship between}} recent Japanese <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> and macroeconomic variables under the quantitative easing policy in Japan. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical framework of the analysis is provided followed by application of the empirical method and analysis of the deterministic elements of <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> in Japan. Vector error correction method is applied. Findings – The results indicate that interest rates, especially the domestic interest rate, have not impacted Japanese <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> Exchange rates also have not been a significant determinant of Japanese <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> US <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> have significantly influenced Japanese <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> Moreover, there exists a long-term stable relationship between Japanese and US <b>stock</b> market <b>prices.</b> Originality/value – The Bank of Japan's monetary policy, especially quantitative monetary easing, has not yet been fully determined. The effect of the policy on <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> has not been discussed at all. Analyzing this effect is important because of its impact on the Japanese economic recovery, which has prevailed for more than ten years.
