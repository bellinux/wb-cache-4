40|$|<b>Sulawesi</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> (Leucocephalon yuwonoi) even if it’s {{listed on}} CITES Appendix II {{actually}} is considered critically endangered for IUCN red list. Management of a sustainable captive {{population of the}} critically endangered <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> (Leucocephalon yuwonoi) has been a priority {{for the conservation of}} the species. Mortality in captivity varies widely among keepers and shipments, but generally ranges from 25 to 100 %. In breeding center the most common reported causes of death were correlated with parasite infestation. In 2000 Bursey et al. described and identified for the first time Falcaustra kutcheri in one free-living adult male of <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Geoemyda yuwonoi) now called Leucocephalon youwonoi. After this first description very little is known about this specie of nematode and its cycle, moreover the knowledges about the management of breeding of <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Turtle</b> in captivity is very poor. This report describes the first european identification of this parasite in imported Leucocephalon youwonoi, and the drug treatments responce against Falcaustra kutcheri and protozoan infestation in seven subjects of Leucocephalon youwonoi from italian breeding centre...|$|E

50|$|Due to its rarity and {{its status}} as newly rediscovered, little is known {{of the life cycle}} of the Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtle.</b> From observations, however, Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> appear to exhibit long life spans and high adult {{survival}} rates. Like most turtles, their sexual maturation is delayed but they are able to mate multiple times before death (iteroparity).|$|R

5000|$|The Arakan <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> (Heosemys depressa) {{is a rare}} turtle species which lives only in the Arakan {{hills of}} western Myanmar and the {{bordering}} Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. [...] The Arakan <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> is a semiterrestrial turtle, meaning it can survive in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats, but as adults, they prefer living in terrestrial habitats. [...] The turtle remains dormant {{the majority of the}} time by hiding in leaves and debris if they are not foraging for food. The Arakan <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> is an omnivore, feeding on both animals and plants. Although these turtles are considered a relatively reserved animal for the majority of their daily activity, they are aggressive when it comes to eating insects, worms, and fish. They also consume fruit that falls to the forest floor.|$|R

50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> populations often exist {{alongside}} {{other more}} common native turtle species, including Asian leaf turtles (Cyclemys dentata) and Southeast Asian box turtles (Cuora amboinensis).|$|R
50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{classified}} under the subgenus Panyaenemys. Together with the smiling terrapin (Siebenrockiella crassicollis), {{it is one}} of the two species in the genus Siebenrockiella.|$|R
25|$|Formerly {{under the}} genus Emys, black marsh turtles are now {{classified}} under Siebenrockiella. They were first {{described by the}} British zoologist John Edward Gray from three specimens from the collections of Thomas Bell. Black marsh turtles used to be monotypic within the genus Siebenrockiella until Diesmos et al. (2005) showed based on genetic studies and morphology, that the recently rediscovered and critically endangered Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles,</b> until that time known as Heosemys leytensis, were actually very closely related. Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> were subsequently reassigned to Siebenrockiella under the subgenus Panyaenemys.|$|R
50|$|Between January 21, and February 14, 2000, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} participated in an expedition to central Rakhine, formerly Arakan, State {{in the western part of}} Myanmar, formerly Burma, to gain information on the Arakan <b>forest</b> <b>turtle.</b> The expedition yielded one male Arakan <b>forest</b> <b>turtle,</b> with a carapace length of 22.cm, a mass of 1.3 kg, and 18 plastral annuli. It was discovered by a hunter’s dog on 7 February about 30 m from a small stream in bamboo forest on Salu Taung, along the Arakan Yoma. The carapace was severely damaged with signs of abnormal healing.|$|R
50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are readily}} {{recognizable}} by their ginkgo-shaped vertebral scutes and a pale white to yellow line traversing across its head behind the ears. The previous characteristic has earned it the nickname of 'bowtie turtle'.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{during an}} {{assessment}} of endemic wildlife of the island of Palawan, live specimens of Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> were rediscovered. It soon became apparent that natural populations of the species existed in Palawan. Diesmos et al. (2004) have concluded that Taylor and/or Lopez may have somehow confused the type locality of the original specimens. Lopez also collected turtle specimens from the islands of Coron and Busuanga in Palawan. Specimens from Palawan may have been mistakenly exchanged with actual specimens from Leyte (which were probably Cyclemys dentata). It is now presumed that Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> have never been introduced outside of Palawan, and thus were not actually from Leyte.|$|R
5000|$|The Cochin <b>forest</b> cane <b>turtle</b> (Vijayachelys silvatica), {{also known}} as Kavalai <b>forest</b> <b>turtle,</b> <b>forest</b> cane <b>turtle</b> or simply cane turtle, is a rare turtle from the Western Ghats of India. Described in 1912, its type {{locality}} is given as [...] "Near Kavalai in the Cochin State Forests, inhabiting dense forest, at an elevation of about 1500 feet above sea level". Only two specimens were found at that time, and no scientist saw this turtle in the next 70 years. It was finally rediscovered in 1982, and since then a number of specimens have been found and some {{studies have been conducted}} about its affiliation and habits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scientific}} name of Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> is Siebenrockiella leytensis. It is classified under the genus Siebenrockiella in the subgenus Panyaenemys (frequently misspelled as [...] "Panayanemys" [...] and [...] "Panyanemys"). It {{belongs to the}} subfamily Geoemydinae of the family Geoemydidae.|$|R
50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{relatively}} easy to recognize. They can be distinguished from all other turtles by their strongly projecting epiplastra, vertebral scutes shaped like ginkgo leaves, the absence of temporal arches in the skull, and the aforementioned light lines behind its head.|$|R
50|$|The Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{an enigmatic}} {{freshwater}} turtle species, it exerts great fascination for turtle hobbyists. Due {{to the previous}} inability to locate it in the wild, probable threats from habitat loss, and potential pressure from collectors, this turtle is listed as critically endangered.|$|R
5000|$|Geoemyda {{was used}} as a [...] "wastebin taxon" [...] in former times, uniting a number of {{distinct}} lineages of <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> from East and Southeast Asia. These are now regarded as distinct and placed in the genera Heosemys, Leucocephalon, Melanochelys, Siebenrockiella (including Panayanemys), and Vijayachelys.|$|R
5000|$|The African <b>forest</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pelusios gabonensis) is {{a species}} of turtle in the family Pelomedusidae.

50|$|The largest {{environmental}} issue in Sulawesi is deforestation. In 2007, scientists found that 80 percent of <b>Sulawesi's</b> <b>forest</b> {{had been lost}} or degraded, especially centered in the lowlands and the mangroves. Forests have been felled for logging and large agricultural projects. Loss of forest has resulted in many of Sulawesi's endemic species becoming endangered. In addition, 99 percent of Sulawesi's wetlands have been lost or damaged.|$|R
50|$|The {{subgenus}} name {{is derived}} after the Pala'wan word panya-en. The word {{was used by}} a local Palawan resident to describe the turtles in a 2003 survey. The word means 'enchanted', supposedly because Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> were favorite pets of the forest spirits. -emys comes from the Greek word εμύς, meaning 'freshwater turtle'.|$|R
50|$|Other {{unique and}} {{threatened}} reptiles include Gray's monitor and the Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtle.</b> There are two newly discovered species of frugivorous monitor lizard, the Panay monitor lizard {{from the island}} of Panay and Northern Sierra Madre forest monitor from north east Luzon, {{there are only three}} species of monitor lizards that are specialized frugivores.|$|R
50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are known}} only from {{northern}} Palawan and surrounding islands. This includes {{the island of}} Dumaran where the species is still relatively abundant in creeks. Elsewhere, it is believed their populations are declining sharply. Particularly {{in the areas of}} Taytay and San Vicente. Its distribution area is estimated to be less than 100 km2.|$|R
50|$|Siebenrockiella leytensis is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} turtle endemic to the Philippines. It is classified as critically endangered. It {{is known as the}} Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtle,</b> the Philippine pond turtle, the Palawan turtle, or the Leyte pond turtle. Despite the latter common name, it does not occur in the island of Leyte but is instead native to the Palawan island group.|$|R
50|$|Philippine <b>forest</b> <b>turtles</b> {{were first}} {{described}} by the American herpetologist Edward Harrison Taylor in 1920 as Heosemys leytensis. He described them {{on the basis of}} two specimens (male and female) collected by Gregorio Lopez, allegedly from the swamps of the municipality of Cabalian in Southern Leyte (now known as the municipality of San Juan). These specimens were unfortunately destroyed in World War II during the firebombing of Manila.|$|R
50|$|The Arakan Mountains act as {{a barrier}} to the southwestern monsoon rains and thus shield the central Myanmar area, making their western slopes {{extraordinarily}} wet during the monsoon with typically over 1 m of rain per month, and the eastern slopes much drier. They include the Chin Hills-Arakan Yoma montane forests ecoregion which is home to an elephant population and also the critically endangered Arakan <b>Forest</b> <b>Turtle</b> which was considered extinct.|$|R
