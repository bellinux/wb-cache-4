5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions. <b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have low}} {{toxicity}} {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E
5|$|The thallium(I) halides are stable. In {{keeping with}} the large size of the Tl+ cation, the {{chloride}} and bromide have the caesium chloride structure, while the fluoride and iodide have distorted sodium chloride structures. Like the analogous <b>silver</b> <b>compounds,</b> TlCl, TlBr, and TlI are photosensitive. The stability of thallium(I) compounds demonstrates its differences {{from the rest of}} the group: a stable oxide, hydroxide, and carbonate are known, as are many chalcogenides.|$|E
5000|$|... silver {{fulminate}} (which, confusingly, {{is the only}} [...] "fulminating silver" [...] to be a <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> with the fulminate anion) ...|$|R
50|$|Silver sulfite is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula Ag2SO3. This unstable <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> when heated and/or in light it decomposes to silver dithionate and silver sulfate.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} in nature as the mineral naumannite, a {{comparatively}} rare silver mineral which has nevertheless become recognized as important <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> in some low-sulfur silver ores from mines in Nevada.|$|R
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because {{of the importance of}} <b>silver</b> <b>compounds,</b> particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E
5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are very}} explosive, {{such as the}} {{nitrogen}} compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
50|$|Silver {{phosphate}} {{is formed}} as a yellow precipitate by the reaction between a soluble <b>silver</b> <b>compound,</b> such as <b>silver</b> nitrate with a soluble orthophosphate; its solubility product is 8.89×10−17 mol4dm−12. The precipitation reaction is analytically significant and can be used in qualitative or quantitative tests for phosphates.|$|R
40|$|The colloid silver sols with defined average {{particle}} size were prepared by means of chemical reduction of <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> [Ag(SO 3 2] 3 – by several organic redox systems used as development agents in photography. The average size of the particles varied from 700 to 150 nm in dependence on sulphite concentration in reaction system and reduction compound type.

40|$|Silver {{coordination}} polymer chains were {{deposited on}} Au(111) {{as a model}} surface, {{as well as on}} gold alloy and titanium as dental implant and restorative materials. The topography of the surface was analysed on the model substrate and it was found to be a nano-structured crystalline material. In vitro investigations in a flow chamber imitating the oral environment prove the anti-bacterial properties of the <b>silver</b> <b>compound...</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> have {{significant}} covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is {{higher than that of}} lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable {{even in the absence of}} π-acceptor ligands.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain <b>silver</b> <b>compounds,</b> generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} <b>silver</b> <b>compounds,</b> especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E
50|$|Most toners work by {{replacing}} the metallic {{silver in the}} emulsion with a <b>silver</b> <b>compound,</b> such as <b>silver</b> sulfide (Ag2S) {{in the case of}} sepia toning. The compound may be more stable than metallic silver and may also have a different color or tone. Different toning processes give different colors to the final print. In some cases, the printer may choose to tone some parts of a print more than others.|$|R
50|$|Silver halides, {{except for}} silver fluoride, are very {{insoluble}} in water. Silver nitrate {{can be used}} to precipitate halides; this application is useful in quantitative analysis of halides. The three main <b>silver</b> halide <b>compounds</b> have distinctive colours that {{can be used to}} quickly identify halide ions in a solution. The <b>silver</b> chloride <b>compound</b> forms a white precipitate, silver bromide a creamy coloured precipitate and silver iodide a yellow coloured precipitate.|$|R
50|$|N-2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoylsulfacetamide bromide (referred to as {{compound}} 45) is a pyridinioalkanoyl thiolester {{that can}} {{function as a}} zinc ejector. Once activated with <b>silver,</b> <b>compound</b> 45 uses its pyridinioalkanoyl groups to covalently modify NCp7, specifically altering cysteines 36 and 49 on the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger. It ejects the zinc from the zinc binding sites in a two steps. The zinc in the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger is released first, followed by the ejection of zinc from the amino-terminal zinc finger.|$|R
5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At {{the bottom of}} the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{and silver}} ions {{also have been}} known to show {{antimicrobial}} properties and have been used {{in a wide range of}} applications, including water treatment. It is shown that silver ions prevent DNA replication and affect the structure and permeability of the cell membrane. Silver also leads to UV inactivation of bacteria and viruses because silver ions are photoactive in the presence of UV-A and UV-C irradiation. Cysteine and silver ions form a complex that leads to the inactivation of Haemophilus influenzae phage and bacteriophage MS2.|$|E
500|$|In medicine, silver is {{incorporated}} into wound dressings {{and used as}} an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. They interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, synthesise cell walls, and bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Microbes cannot develop resistance to silver as they can to antibiotics, and hence silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial {{in a variety of}} industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer. <b>Silver</b> <b>compounds</b> are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. [...] Silver diammine fluoride, the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula F, is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.|$|E
50|$|After being {{attacked}} and knocked unconscious by robbers, Oscar is nursed by Lucilla and {{falls in love}} with her, and the couple become engaged. Their plans are jeopardized by Oscar's epilepsy, a result of the blow to his head. The only effective treatment, a <b>silver</b> <b>compound,</b> has the side-effect of turning his skin a permanent, dark blue-grey. Despite her blindness, Lucilla suffers a violent phobia of dark colours, including dark-complexioned people, and family and friends conceal Oscar's condition from her.|$|R
50|$|The second book, with Ronald Wilfred Gurney, On the Physical Chemistry of Solids {{was more}} diverse. It treated notably of the {{oxidation}} of metals at low temperatures, where it described {{the growth of}} the oxide layer as due to the electric field developed between the metal and absorbed oxygen ions, which could force the way of metallic or oxygen ions through a disordered oxide layer. The book also analysed the photographic reactions in ionic <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> in terms of precipitation of silver ions into metallic clusters.|$|R
5000|$|Native silver {{occurs as}} {{elongated}} dendritic coatings or irregular masses. It may also occur as cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral crystals. It may occur alloyed with gold as electrum. It often occurs with silver sulfide and sulfosalt minerals. [...] Various amalgams {{of silver and}} mercury or other metals and mercury do occur rarely as minerals in nature. An example is the mineral eugenite (Ag11Hg2) and related forms. [...] Silver nuggets, wires, and grains are relatively common, {{but there are also}} a large number of <b>silver</b> <b>compound</b> minerals owing to silver being more reactive than gold.|$|R
2500|$|Silver nitrate is an {{inorganic}} compound with chemical formula [...] This compound is a versatile precursor {{to many other}} <b>silver</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as those used in photography. It is far less sensitive to light than the halides.

50|$|Localised argyria {{often results}} from topical use of {{substances}} containing silver, such as {{some kinds of}} eye drops.

50|$|In {{animals and}} humans chronic intake of silver {{products}} commonly leads to gradual accumulation of <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> {{in various parts of}} the body. As in photography (where silver is useful because of its sensitivity to light), exposure of pale or colourless <b>silver</b> <b>compounds</b> to sunlight decomposes them to silver metal or silver sulfides.
