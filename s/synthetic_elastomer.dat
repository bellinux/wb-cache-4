50|$|Most folding boats have two-part skins, with {{different}} materials {{used for the}} deck and the hull. Decks can be made of a breathable cotton/hemp blend, as Klepper has done since their early days, or of coated synthetics, as Feathercraft, Folbot, Long Haul, Nautiraid, Pouch and TRAK do. Each approach has its own particular benefits and drawbacks; all work well in practice, and some companies, such as Long Haul Folding Kayaks, offer both materials. Hulls are generally made of a heavily coated synthetic fiber. In the early days, rubber coated cotton canvas was used, while the modern boats use a <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> —Hypalon, polyurethane or PVC—over a synthetic (typically Dacron) cloth. The tension on the hull is what gives certain folding kayaks performance advantages over others. One manufacturer (TRAK) incorporates several hydraulic jacks into the frame that allow the user to change the hull's shape.|$|E

Most of the halocarbons encountered in everyday life - solvents, medicines, plastics - are man-made. The first synthesis of halocarbons was achieved in the early 1800s.

Development of plastics and <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomers</b> has led to greatly expanded scale of production. A substantial percentage of drugs are halocarbons.|$|R
30|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>elastomers</b> can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{thermoplastic}} elastomers and cross-linked elastomers, based on the type of ‘cross-link’ used to join their molecular chains. Unlike cross-linked elastomers, where the cross-link is a covalent bond created during the vulcanization process, the cross-link in thermoplastic elastomers is a weaker dipole or hydrogen bond,or takes place in one of the phases of the material. Linear thermoplastic elastomers usually consist of two separated microphases: crystalline, hydrogen-bonded hard segments and amorphous soft segments. The crystalline or hard segments function as cross-linkers which provide mechanical strength and stiffness, whereas soft segments provide the flexibility (Hiki et al. [2000]).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the reactions of oxygen in its normal ground state, some reactions of oxygen are due to the excited singlet state, a highly reactive form of the molecule. Singlet oxygen {{is responsible for the}} rapid deterioration of materials, particularly those with conjugated unsaturation such as natural rubber and <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomers.</b> It is formed when triplet oxygen, the normal ground state, reacts with sensitizers, such as certain dyes and ketones, excited by radiation to their triplet states. Oxygen also increases the amount of solar radiation absorbed by conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbons through formation of a complex with these materials.|$|R
40|$|Highlights {{from the}} last year in {{nanomedicine}} Synthetic biology attempts to reproduce emergent behaviors from natural biology {{with the goal of}} creating artificial life. The main challenge in this field is the reduction of complex phenomena into functional components, which can be individually engineered and later combined to repli-cate the macroscopic behavior of the model biological system. Nawroth and coworkers reverse-engineered the mechanics of jelly-fish propulsion by studying the structural design, stroke kinematics and fluid–solid interactions of the jellyfish, and exploit-ing the natural properties of the living and nonliving materials used in the design. The artificial jellyfish, dubbed ‘medu-soids’, were composed of a bilayer of liv-ing muscle tissue and <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> arranged in freely movable lobes around a central disc. Medusoid propulsion, like that of a jellyfish, was externally driven by electrically paced power and recovery strokes that alternately contracted the body into a quasi-closed ‘bell ’ and then relaxed into the open-lobed form. The muscle layer, comprised of anisotropic rat cardiac tissue that intrinsically enables spatiotemporally synchronous contraction, replicated the power stroke of the jellyfish. The recovery stroke, which is a consequence of elastic recoil in the jellyfish compliant matrix, was replicated by tuning the stiffness of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> substrate. The geometry was further refined to allow the formation of overlapping boundary layers between lobes, thereby resisting flow across the lobe gaps. Qualitative and quantita-tive comparisons of jellyfish and medusoid propulsion showed that the engineered sys-tem was able to replicate the momentum, transport and body lengths traveled per swimming stroke of the natural system. This serves as a powerful demonstration of biomimetic swimming of a simple, natu-ral life form, that can be engineered from a few materials and some well-arranged cells. It also represents an important develop-mental milestone in the rise of biological actuators and has implications in tissue engineering and drug discovery/screening applications...|$|E
30|$|Hyalomatrix® PA is {{designed}} as a sterile, bi-layered wound dressing. It is a biodegradable, absorbent, non-woven pad entirely composed of HYAFF® which constitutes the wound contact layer. The HYAFF® layer is physically coupled with a transparent and flexible film of a medical-grade <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> {{that acts as a}} semipermeable barrier against external contaminants. As the product is applied on the wound bed, the HYAFF® wound contact layer provides a three-dimensional scaffold that permits the colonization of the product by fibroblasts and onto which extracellular matrix components are laid down, resulting in an almost ordered reconstruction of the dermal tissue. The transparent elastomeric film, characterized by a vapor transmission rate comparable to that of normal skin, prevents excessive body fluid loss. The product conforms well to wound edges and can be cut to suit the shape of the lesion.|$|E

40|$|In most <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomers,</b> {{changing}} the physical properties by monomer choice also {{results in a}} change to the crystallinity of the material, which manifests through alteration of its mechanical performance. Using organocatalyzed stereospecific additions of thiols to activated alkynes, high-molar-mass elastomers were isolated via step-growth polymerization. The resulting controllable double-bond stereochemistry defines the crystallinity and the concomitant mechanical properties as well as enabling the synthesis of materials that retain their excellent mechanical properties through changing monomer composition. Using this approach to elastomer synthesis, further end group modification and toughening through vulcanization strategies are also possible. The organocatalytic control of stereochemistry opens the realm to a new and easily scalable class of elastomers that will have unique chemical handles for functionalization and post synthetic processing. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} high impact {{polystyrene}} (HIPS) which was subjected the drop-weight test. HIPS is a polymer produced by the reaction between butadiene <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> and styrene (5 – 14 %) which contains the crystal polymer in certain amounts and is commonly used in mechanical engineering applications where machine parts are exposed to impact loading. The injection moulded HIPS samples were subjected the penetration test at different fall heights {{and the results were}} subsequently evaluated and discussed. It was found out that all fall heights are suitable for HIPS penetration, but the optimal one is 50 J because of the smallest variation range. Higher heights are not needed because of increasing power consumption of the test device. From the results, it is clear, that HIPS is not so highly impact resistant material as for example HDPE, because of that is this material suitable for applications where is not often exposed to too big impacts at high velocities...|$|E

One of the results was that adjusting the degree of etherification of the high-absorbency polymer, which is a component of the WSM, and the resin content of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> contributed to improvement of the swelling of the sealant and the strength of the swelling material.

Vascular cells reside in an elastic extracellular environment and are subjected to normal as well as shear forces. Polyurethane (PU), a <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer,</b> is investigated in this study for its potential to promote the attachment and migration of Wharton’s jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs). A nanocomposite of PU containing gold nanoparticles (PU-Au) with distinct phase separation on the nanometer scale is also tested because it provides better mechanical/topographical cues compared to those of pristine PU. PU-Au up-regulates the protein expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) /Rho-GTPase/matrix metalloproteinase- 9 in WJMSCs upon the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1). Furthermore, PU-Au improves the attachment and migration of WJMSCs and increases the expression levels of cell surface markers such as CXCR 4 and 5 β 3 integrin after VEGF and SDF- 1 stimulation. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} elastic nanocomposites such as PU-Au may enhance WJMSC migration in response to tissue and blood vessel injury, which may in turn contribute to neovascularization in a vascular lesion...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a new network alteration theory to describe the Mullins effect. The stress-softening phenomenon that occurs in rubber-like materials during cyclic loading is analysed from a physical point of view. The Mullins effect is considered to be a consequence of the breakage of links inside the material. Both filler-matrix and chain interaction links are involved in the phenomenon. This new alteration theory is implemented by modifying the eight-chains constitutive equation of Arruda and Boyce (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 41 (2) (1993) 389). In the present method the parameters of the eight-chains model, denoted C-R and N in the bibliography, become functions of the maximum chain stretch ratio. The accuracy of the resulting constitutive equation is demonstrated on cyclic uniaxial experiments for both natural rubbers and <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomers...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an {{experimental}} way to deduce the field of dissipated energy from the measurement of the temperature field. The case studied is a structural sample (i. e. with a circular notch) in order to test the ability of the protocol to describe heterogeneous energy fields. The material chosen is a filled <b>synthetic</b> <b>elastomer</b> in order to investigate the case of large displacements. Moreover, very thin samples are used to reduce the solving of the thermo-mechanical problem to a 2 D investigation. To reach high enough spatial and thermal resolutions the protocol suggested takes advantage of the low thermal conductivity of the material and of a very precise calibration of the infrared camera used to record the temperature fields. The paper suggests a protocol based on an adiabatic assumption and investigates its capabilities and range of validity. A very accurate description of the severe gradients of the fields of dissipated energy can be obtained. In order to evaluate the reliability of the experimental fields, a numerical approach is applied using a simple yet robust dissipation modelling. Finally, the experimental fields of displacement and of dissipated energy are compared with the ones obtained from the numerical simulation...|$|E
