25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. Félix da Costa set a late provisional pole position lap time of two minutes and 11.535 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than Ilott who held the pole until Félix da Costa's time. Rosenqvist was third-fastest, ahead of Yamashita in fourth and Juncadella fifth. Sette Cãmara, Norris, Cassidy, Hughes and Sam MacLeod completed the top-ten provisional starting positions. Sims was the fastest driver not to record {{a time in the}} top ten and was 1.065 seconds off Félix da Costa's pace. He was followed by Maini, Russell, Anthoine Hubert and Günther with Ticktum, Pedro Piquet, Chang Wing Chung, Nikita Mazepin and Joel Eriksson completing the top-twenty fastest drivers. The session was red flagged four times: firstly for Yamashita when his wheel became detached from his car, possibly from a <b>split</b> <b>rim,</b> the second was for Sims who was stranded in the centre of Lisboa corner's run-off area, Norris impacted the San Francisco Bend barriers and Eriksson hit the Solitude Esses wall, triggering the third stoppage, and the session ended early when Juncadella crashed heavily into the Fisherman's Bend turn barrier.|$|E

5000|$|Between 2000 and 2002 VW offered two {{sporting}} models, the 16V and GTI. The 16V {{came with}} the 1.4 16V 100 PS (74 kW) engine and had options such as 15" [...] Spa alloys and air conditioning. However more interest was in the GTI. Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125 PS (92 kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power. Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" [...] BBS <b>split</b> <b>rims</b> suited the car well. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Mark 3F Polo GTI however missed the new six-speed gearbox that {{was introduced in the}} smaller Lupo GTI.|$|R
50|$|All models had Budd <b>split</b> <b>rim</b> {{disc wheels}} with 12.20×20-20” tires. Dual rear {{mud and snow}} tires were used.|$|E
50|$|The tire {{could also}} be removed easily. You had to unlock a safety {{mechanism}} and then remove the tire completely with the <b>split</b> <b>rim</b> (very similar to the <b>split</b> <b>rim</b> developed by BMW). The front brake was installed in the hub. The rear suspension also had telescopic oil-filled shock absorbers. The gasoline flowed down through flexible hoses. A panel in the frame allowed {{easy access to the}} seat springs to adjust the hardness of the seat’s suspension.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2000 and 2002, Volkswagen offered two {{sporting}} models — the 16V and GTI. The 16V {{came with}} the 1.4 litre16V [...] engine and had options such as 15" [...] Spa alloys and air conditioning. However, the GTI – available only in 3 or 5 door hatchback body styles in three colours being red, silver and black. Its power plant was a 1.6 litre16V [...] engine with variable valve timing. External changes included a deeper front splitter with honeycomb mesh grilles, lowered sports suspension (10mm), a subtle rear spoiler, deeper side skirts, fog lights, and 15" [...] BBS RXII <b>split</b> <b>rims</b> for the wheels bearing 195/45/15 tyres. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, xenon headlights with a headlight washer system, a six-disc CD autochanger with a GAMMA head unit, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel, handbrake and gearstick, chrome inserts, and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Polo GTI Mk3F however never got the new six-speed gearbox that {{was introduced in the}} smaller Volkswagen Lupo GTI which shared the same engine. Sadly, many of the Polo GTI 5 speed gearboxes fail due to faulty differential rivets and bearings which can only be rectified through a rebuild.|$|R
60|$|The red sun was {{at their}} backs. Surprise Valley lay hazy, dusky, shadowy beneath them. The {{opposite}} wall seemed fired by crimson flame, save far down at its base, which the sun no longer touched. And the dark line of red slowly rose, encroaching upon the bright crimson. Changing, transparent, yet dusky veils seemed to float between the walls; long, red rays, {{where the sun}} shone through notch or crack in the <b>rim,</b> <b>split</b> the darker spaces; deep {{down at the floor}} the forest darkened, the strip of aspen paled, the meadow turned gray; and all under the shelves and in the great caverns a purple gloom deepened. Then the sun set. And swiftly twilight was there below while day lingered above. On the opposite wall the fire died and the stone grew cold.|$|R
5000|$|Black Stallion is {{a monster}} truck that races on the USHRA circuit {{and for other}} promoters. Black Stallion {{started out as a}} stock 1982 Ford F350 back in 1982, owned and {{modified}} by Michael Vaters. The first modification was a homemade 12" [...] lift kit, since such kits were unavailable at the time. Mike then later added two sunroofs, an Alpine stereo system, a Ford 460 Engine, Rockwell 5 ton toploaders, Clark 20 ton planetaries, 66" [...] terra tires, a 9" [...] television and later on, a 1988 Ford F series front end. Between 1990 and 1991, Mike realized the future of monster trucks, which was racing. To be competitive, Mike replaced the leaf springs with airbags, the old heavy <b>split</b> ring <b>rims</b> with lightweight one piece rims, fiberglass body pieces, cutting the tires, gutting the interior out, 4 linking the truck and putting in a bigger engine. The modifications proved to be beneficial to Mike, with close races with First Blood, and competing in some Pendaliner Special Events racing events. After a violent rollover in Bloomsburg Pennsylvania in 1991, Mike decided to put King shocks on the truck, which he later added coil springs in 1992. Along with the coil springs, Mike also removed the airbags. Mike is credited as the first owner to use bypass shocks. Also for 1992, Mike changed the front clip to a 1992 Ford F-series front end. Mike rarely ran this truck after he built the popular Boogey Van in 1993, driven by his then wife, Pam Vaters. Due to this, the truck was nicknamed Rodney, after the comedian, Rodney Dangerfield. Mike then built a truck for the 1996 season for research and development, named Black Stallion 2000, since his crew members joked about Mike not building a new truck for himself until the new millennium. This chassis is still running strong to this day. For his 20th anniversary, Mike decided to repaint Black stallion, with the front of the truck yellow, going into black with a horse face painted on. The truck currently has the same paint scheme. The drivers for 2016 are Michael Vaters & Matt Cody. Vaters will compete in the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. Cody will travel to Birmingham, Toronto, Newark, Charleston, Columbia, Worcester, Wheeling & Baton Rouge.|$|R
50|$|Wheels.Wheels {{are made}} from {{extremely}} strong pressed steel and are of the <b>split</b> <b>rim</b> type for easy tyre removal. Both front and rear wheels run on opposed high-grade taper roller bearings on an alloy steel spindle, which is designed for easy wheel removal. Highly efficient car type internal expanding brakes are used.|$|E

50|$|Also {{noteworthy}} is {{the independent}} suspension consisting of coil springs and hydropneumatic shock absorbers on trailing {{arms in the}} wheel mechanism; South Africa later adopted this design for the Rooikat. All four wheels are of the <b>split</b> <b>rim</b> type and fitted with Dunlop 12.00x20 tyres. There are two hydraulic braking systems, one for the front {{and one for the}} rear.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} {{categories}} of tires on which stand-up scooters travel—hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally six {{inches in diameter}} and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by a solid rubber tire. Air tires are most often 10 inches in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum <b>split</b> <b>rim,</b> an inner tube and rubber tire. Other, less common wheel and tire types include 8 inch and 13 inch air tires.|$|E

5000|$|Volkswagen {{produced}} a limited quantity of 1000 special-edition 3 and 5-door GTI Anniversary models, celebrating 20 {{years of the}} GTI model. This had the usual GTI specification but came equipped with special chequered Recaro front sport seats and matching rear seats bearing the GTI logo, red seat belts front and rear, half-chromed and leather golf ball gear knob, red stitched leather steering wheel and handbrake gaiter. The release knob on the hand brake was also red and silver instrument dials. Floor mats also had red piping along their edges. The red theme continued externally with a red striping on the bumpers and red brake calipers. The wheels were 16" [...] x 7" [...] <b>split</b> <b>rim</b> BBS RS 722 alloys, visually similar to the 15" [...] that were found on VR6 model. Brush stainless steel rear twin tailpipes on the exhaust and smoked front fog and indicator lamps to match the rear lamps. 3 optional extras were made available; electric sunroof, air conditioning and metallic black paintwork. Insurance {{was based on the}} standard GTI which made this version a very desirable model. The edition was sold in only 6 colour schemes and the 1000 number figures that were produced was as follows; 600 8 valve models, 150 16 valve models and 250 TDI models. The diesel model was only produced for the European market and was not sold in the UK. Unfortunately many of the models fell into the UK company car and lease market prior to the second-hand market and its believed only a few hundred still survive.However, another factor in the rarity of Mark 3 Golfs, unlike the excellent build quality of the Mark 2, at least in the UK, is the very low quality steel sourced by VW on some occasions, and used across the range, from entry model to VR6. According to independent mechanics and parts specialists, and MOT testers, the floorpan, both door sills, and rear hatch can suffer severe rot and disintegration, and anybody planning to buy one is advised to check for rot, and holes and patches to the floorpan.|$|E
