Whereas a TWAIN driver handles the user interface as well as communications with the scanner hardware, a SANE driver only provides an interface with the hardware and describes a number of [...] "options" [...] which drive each scan. These options specify parameters such as the resolution of the scan, the <b>scan</b> <b>area,</b> colour model, etc. Each option has a name, and information about its type, units, and range or possible values (e.g., enumerated list). By convention there are several [...] "well known" [...] options that frontends can supply using convenient GUI interaction e.g., the <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> options can be set by dragging a rectangular outline over a preview image. Other options can be presented using GUI elements appropriate to their type e.g., sliders, drop-down lists, etc.|$|E
50|$|Current-imaging-tunneling {{spectroscopy}} (CITS) is an STS technique {{where an}} I-V curve is recorded at each pixel in the STM topograph. Either variable-spacing or constant-spacing spectroscopy {{may be used}} to record the I-V curves. The conductance, , can be obtained by numerical differentiation of I with respect to V or acquired using lock-in detection as described above. Because the topographic image and the tunneling spectroscopy data are obtained nearly simultaneously, there is nearly perfect registry of topographic and spectroscopic data. As a practical concern, the number of pixels in the scan or the <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> may be reduced to prevent piezo creep or thermal drift from moving the feature of study or the <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> during the duration of the scan. While most CITS data obtained on the times scale of several minutes, some experiments may require stability over longer periods of time. One approach to improving the experimental design is by applying feature-oriented scanning (FOS) methodology.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the easiest}} of the techniques, but the least useful. After a hole is milled with an FIB, one can just image the hole (analogous to the TEM technique). The ions stimulate {{movement}} on the wafer, and also implant themselves to help close the hole. Unlike the other two methods, the holes closed in this technique are not very circular and smooth. The holes appear jagged under TEM photos. Also, it is much harder to control {{the size of the}} hole to the single nanometer regime. Another drawback to this technique is that while imaging the hole, the ion beam is continually sputtering membrane material away. If the beam <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> is large enough, the rate of atoms moving to close the hole will be greater than the rate of sputtering, so the hole will close. If the membrane is too thin or the <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> too small, then the rate of sputtering will win, and the hole will open up.|$|E

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanism of}} the low-destructive friction-induced nanofabrication, the microscopic structure of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> of the quartz sample was detected by cross-sectional TEM (XTEM, JEOL JEM- 2100 LaB 6, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) before and after KOH etching.

40|$|Determination of {{the surface}} {{roughness}} by AFM {{is crucial to the}} study of particle fouling in nanofiltration. It is, however, very difficult to compare the different roughness values reported in the literature because of a lack in uniformity in the methods applied to determine surface roughness. AFM is used in both noncontact mode and tapping mode; moreover, the size of the <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> is highly variable. This study compares, for six different nanofiltration membranes (UTC- 20, N 30 F, Desal 51 HL, Desal 5 DL, NTR 7450, NF-PES- 10), noncontact mode AFM with tapping mode AFM for several sizes of the <b>scan</b> <b>area.</b> Although the absolute roughness values are different for noncontact AFM and tapping mode AFM, no difference is found between the two modes of AFM in ranking the nanofiltration membranes with respect to their surface roughness. NTR 7450 and NF-PES- 10 are the smoothest membranes, while the roughest surface can be found with Desal 51 HL and Desal 5 DL. UTC- 20 and N 30 F are characterized by an intermediate roughness value. An increase in roughness with increasing <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> is observed for both AFM modes. Larger differences between the roughnesses of the membranes are obtained with tapping mode AFM because of the tapping of the tip on the surface. Phase imaging is an extension of tapping mode AFM, measuring the phase shift between the cantilever oscillation and the oscillation of the piezo driver. This phase shift reflects the interaction between the cantilever and the membrane surface.
