40|$|Liquid metal {{nanoparticles}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} stretchable electronic devices. Understanding the mechanical properties of liquid metal nanoparticles is crucial to optimizing their use in various applications, especially printing of flexible, stretchable electronics. Smaller nanoparticles are desired for high-resolution printing and compatibility with existing scalable manufacturing methods; however, they contain less liquid metal and are more difficult to rupture than larger particles, making them less desirable for post-processing functionality. This study investigates the mechanics of liquid metal particle rupture as a function of particle size. We employ compression of particle films to characterize the composition of the particle core and derive a minimum particle size required to achieve sintering and subsequent conductance. We further derive the force required to rupture a single particle and validate the results by rupturing individual nanoparticles using atomic force microscopy. In addition, we relate the liquid metal nanoparticles to isotropically-elastic thin-shell microspheres to approximate the particle shell stiffness. Using the results from this study, <b>spray</b> <b>printing</b> {{has been used as a}} scalable process that permits the printing of larger particles in high resolution patterns. Furthermore, existent sintering methods are developed, specifically using laser systems, high voltage generators, and exposure to extreme temperatures. An increased understanding of the behavior of liquid metal nanoparticles during rupture reveals limitations of current manufacturing processes and paves the way for the next generation of scalable mass-producible soft electronics using additive manufacturing technologies. ...|$|E
40|$|Conductive {{electrodes}} {{and electric}} circuits that can remain active and electrically stable under large mechanical deformations are highly desirable for {{applications such as}} flexible displays(1 - 3), field-effect transistors(4, 5), energy-related devices(6, 7), smart clothing(8) and actuators(9 - 11). However, high conductivity and stretchability seem to be mutually exclusive parameters. The most promising {{solution to this problem}} has been to use one-dimensional nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and metal nanowires coated on a stretchable fabric(12, 13), metal stripes with a wavy geometry(14, 15), composite elastomers embedding conductive fillers(16, 17) and interpenetrating networks of a liquid metal and rubber(18). At present, the conductivity values at large strains remain too low to satisfy requirements for practical applications. Moreover, the ability to make arbitrary patterns over large areas is also desirable. Here, we introduce a conductive composite mat of silver nanoparticles and rubber fibres that allows the formation of highly stretchable circuits through a fabrication process that is compatible with any substrate and scalable for large-area applications. A silver nanoparticle precursor is absorbed in electrospun poly (styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (SBS) rubber fibres and then converted into silver nanoparticles directly in the fibre mat. Percolation of the silver nanoparticles inside the fibres leads to a high bulk conductivity, which is preserved at large deformations (sigma approximate to 2, 200 S cm(- 1) at 100 % strain for a 150 -mm-thick mat). We design electric circuits directly on the electrospun fibre mat by nozzle printing, inkjet printing and <b>spray</b> <b>printing</b> of the precursor solution and fabricate a highly stretchable antenna, a strain sensor and a highly stretchable light-emitting diode as examples of applications. close 453...|$|E

The DE increased as much as 25 % by varying the carrier gas flow rate from 2. 0 to 4. 0 L/min. The deposits sprayed at a higher standoff distance and low torch power gave poor deposit characteristics. The deposit characteristics were compared with the in-flight particle parameters and revealed that the deposit characteristics strongly depended on the in-flight particle temperature.

All these technologies require pre-treatment of the substrate prior to the deposition of the thin film and ideally this pretreatment should also be performed at atmospheric pressure. Results {{presented in this paper}} show that use of an atmospheric-pressure plasma is highly effective in activating the surface of substrates commonly used in thin film photovoltaic (PV) device fabrication. Surface activation improves the adhesion of thin films. The use of an atmospheric activation process is compatible with a continuous vacuumfree PV fabrication process. Soda lime glass (SDL) and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass are substrates commonly used in the fabrication of photovoltaic modules. These substrates have been surface treated using a He/O 2 atmospheric-pressure plasma, resulting in increased surface energy as evidenced by Water Contact Angle (WCA) measurements. The pre-treatment reduces adventitious surface contamination on the substrates as shown using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The advantages of using the atmospheric plasma surface pre-treatment has been demonstrated by using it prior to atmospheric deposition of Cadmium Sulphide (CdS) thin films using a sonochemical process.

There are, however, various degradation processes associated with {{the operation of the}} cells and the major mechanism is thought to be associated with a gradual oxidation of the copper sulphide. It is clear therefore that the degradation of single crystal and evaporated thin film cells must be better understood before the more difficult problems associated with the fabrication and operation of <b>sprayed</b> or <b>printed</b> layer cells can be solved. This thesis describes an investigation into the photovoltaic properties of CdS/Cu (_ 2) S heterojunctions. The cells were prepared by forming layers of CU (_ 2) S on single crystals and thin films of CdS. Undoped crystals with both high and low resistivity have been used as have low resistivity samples containing grown-in copper, indium and chlorine impurities. A study of the spectral dependence of the open circuit voltage and of the current-voltage characteristics, after baking in air at 200 C, shows that the maximum spectral sensitivity of the cells in the range 0. 6 to 0. 7 nm is associated with a photo- conductive region in the cadmium sulphide caused by a diffusion of copper into the cadmium sulphide. The effects of forming the cuprous sulphide layers on basal planes of opposite polarity have also been investigated. It was shown that the conversion of cadmium sulphide to cuprous sulphide proceeds 1. 5 times faster on sulphur than on cadmium planes and the photovoltages of unbaked cells with the cuprous sulphide formed on sulphur faces are some 20 % Larger than the photo- voltages from cells in which the cuprous sulphide is formed on cadmium faces.

Cap-illary break-up and the subsequent recoil are examples of finite-time singularities in which the interfacial curvature becomes infinite at the point of disconnection. The divergence of scales near disconnection allows similarity solutions to be found for the flow close to disconnection for both inviscid (potential) and very viscous (Stokes) flow [1 – 9]. Despite substantial progress, a number of outstanding questions remain unan-swered. This paper discusses some of the relationships between the known solutions and these outstanding questions. The inviscid problem is characterised by the density ratio ∆ of internal to external fluids and the viscous problem by the corresponding viscosity ratio λ. For nonzero ∆ the similarity lengthscales are all τ 2 / 3 and for finite nonzero λ they are all τ, leading to well-understood self-similar behaviour. The cases ∆ = ∞, λ = 0 and λ = ∞ are all special and correspond to singular limits. Time-dependent simulations for large ∆ show overturning instabilities due to a Kelvin–Helmholtz-like mechanism, and the case ∆ = ∞ is the subject of some controversy!
