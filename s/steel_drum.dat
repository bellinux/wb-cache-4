5|$|In some stages, Pepsiman's head becomes stuck {{inside a}} <b>steel</b> <b>drum,</b> which inverts the controls, and in some, {{he uses a}} skateboard. Throughout each stage is a number of checkpoints; if the player gets hit by {{obstacles}} too many times, they have to restart from the latest checkpoint. Each stage ends with Pepsiman being chased by an object, including a giant Pepsi can. In between stages, the player is shown videos of an American man drinking Pepsi and eating chips and pizza while watching television.|$|E
5|$|Over 100 {{minutes of}} score {{are present in}} Speed2, more than Mancina wrote for Speed and Twister combined. After the score was written, he created a demo of the entire score on a {{synthesizer}} to play for De Bont. While the score for Speed only used strings, French horns, and percussion, Speed2 used {{a wider variety of}} instruments including trombones, large woodwinds, bass clarinets, and contrabassoons. The score was recorded by a 96-person orchestra, including Mancina, who performed on a classical guitar on several cues. The reggae music featured a band with steel drums, in addition to Cuban drums and Latin percussion. De Bont wanted 16 <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> players, but {{due to a lack of}} available players, Mancina used eight drums which were double-tracked.|$|E

25|$|The University of Delaware has {{a variety}} of musical {{performance}} opportunities available to students, including a wind ensemble, orchestra, symphonic band. There are also a number of jazz groups available, including two large ensembles, and a smaller group that focus on improvisation. All ensembles are open by audition to all students at the university, and can be taken either for credit or for no credit. The school also has a <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> ensemble, and an early music ensemble. There are also {{a variety of}} choral ensembles, including the University of Delaware Chorale, an all-women's choir, and three choirs, also open to community members, that constitute the Schola Cantorum.

25|$|The person {{using the}} iron lung is placed {{into the central}} chamber, a {{cylindrical}} <b>steel</b> <b>drum.</b> An opening allowing {{the head and neck}} to remain outside is then sealed off, forming an air-tight compartment enclosing the rest of the person's body from the neck down. Pumps that control airflow periodically decrease and increase the air pressure within the chamber, and particularly, on the chest. When the pressure is below that within the lungs, the lungs expand and atmospheric pressure pushes air from outside the chamber in via the person's nose and airways to keep the lungs filled; when the pressure goes above that within the lungs, the reverse occurs, and air is expelled. In this manner, the iron lung mimics the physiological action of breathing: by periodically altering intrathoracic pressure, it causes air to flow {{in and out of the}} lungs. The iron lung is a form of non-invasive therapy.|$|E
25|$|The school's {{arts program}} {{includes}} {{courses in the}} performing and visual arts. At least 2 arts credits are required for graduation, {{with at least one}} half-credit course in performance/studio arts and one half-credit course in art history/appreciation. Horace Mann has numerous ensembles, which include the Orchestra, String Sinfonietta, Glee Club, Chamber Choir Jazz Combo, <b>Steel</b> <b>Drum</b> Ensemble, and Chamber and Symphonic Winds. Each ensemble performs at least three to four concerts per year, including past performances at Carnegie Hall, Symphony Space, and Alice Tully Hall of Lincoln Center, culminating in a trip abroad over the summer. Recent trips have taken the Glee Club and Orchestra to Argentina, Belgium, England, Italy, France, and Uruguay. The Jazz Band has performed at many famous jazz clubs including Birdland and B.B. King's, and it has taken trips with the Wind Ensemble to locations such as Hawaii and New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Washington Harbour {{continued}} to stabilize after the acquisition by the Japanese. A new management company, Potomac River Front, {{was brought in}} to manage the property. All 35 condos finally sold (although about a third of them had been put on the market again), 85 percent of office space was leased, and a new Italian restaurant, Pasta Place, opened. The complex was also home to a rising number of free cultural events. By summer 1992, Washington Harbour was the home of the Potomac International Regatta, an outdoor jazz festival, and nightly entertainment in the summer by guitarists, <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> bands, and string quartets. Additionally, six sculptures by John Seward Johnson II were installed in the boardwalk area. By May 1994, office space rentals edged up to 88 percent (but were among Georgetown's highest rents, at $32 to $34 a square foot), and major firms such as Hill & Knowlton and Swidler & Berlin took space. Potomac River Front also brought operating costs down by about 25 percent to just $10 per square foot.|$|E

25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean <b>steel</b> <b>drum,</b> made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E

This test was carried out with three geophysical methods for steel-drum detection: a magnetometric survey, electrical resistivity tomography with different arrays, and a multifrequency frequency-domain electromagnetic induction survey. The data show that as partially expected, the magnetometric and electromagnetic induction surveys detected the actual <b>steel</b> <b>drums</b> buried in the subsurface, while the electrical resistivity tomography mainly detected the changes in some of the physical properties of the terrain connected with the digging operations, rather than the actual presence of the <b>steel</b> <b>drums.</b> Normal 0 14 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 ...|$|R

500|$|The {{experiments}} led to {{a particularly}} promising arrangement: a forty-gallon <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> buried in an earthen bank with just the round front end exposed. At {{the back of the}} drum was an explosive which, when triggered, ruptured the drum and shot a jet of flame about [...] wide and [...] long. The design was reminiscent of a weapon dating from late medieval times called a fougasse: a hollow in which was placed a barrel of gunpowder covered by rocks, the explosives to be detonated by a fuse at an opportune moment. Livens' new weapon was duly dubbed the flame fougasse. The flame fougasse was demonstrated to Clement Attlee, Maurice Hankey and General Liardet on 20 July 1940.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} popular traditions {{common to the}} English-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles. Calypso, {{originally}} an old folk music–based genre from West Africa, is popular throughout the islands; other popular traditions, like soca originally from Trinidad, are also well known throughout the region. <b>Steel</b> <b>drum</b> ensembles is also found throughout the English-speaking Lesser Antilles (and abroad), especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda. The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions. Eastern Caribbean folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the Shango music of Trinidad.

500|$|Initially a track {{recorded}} by Perry for her fourth studio album, Prism (2013), {{the song was}} excluded from its track listing, however Perry handed the demo to Azalea for her to complete. [...] "Black Widow" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "channeling the trap" [...] genre, containing an ominous <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> rhythm, heavy bass and a sparse beat. Its composition {{has been the subject of}} music critics' comparisons to Perry's [...] "Dark Horse". Other journalists, praised its beat and Azalea and Ora's vocals. [...] "Black Widow" [...] charted due to strong digital sales during the debut week of The New Classic. Accordingly, before becoming a single it achieved peaks of number 91 in the United Kingdom and number 86 in Australia, and appeared on several component charts. Azalea has performed the song live as part of the set list for her first headlining tour, The New Classic Tour (2014). The song is featured on the video game series Just Dance 2015.|$|E
500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] {{is a song}} {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and 29 seconds and {{has been described as}} a song that [...] "channels more trap music with its beat". The song combines a sparse snap and heavy trap beat with a refrain that follows a slow-building, clapping chorus formula which peaks but deliberately never capitalizes. Instrumentally, [...] "Black Widow" [...] is composed of an ominous <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> rhythm, and heavy bass, while its dance breakdown is employed with minimalism. Azalea solicits the track's verses with a snarling, bitter technique, consisting of rhyming employed with a spitting delivery. While Ora uses a seething element to sing the track's hook, [...] "I'm gonna love ya, until you hate me / And I'm gonna show ya, what's really crazy / You should've known better, than to mess with me harder / I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you / Gonna love you, gonna love you / Like a black widow baby". Combined, Ora and Azalea's vocals are based on a call and response structure throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|... "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] is a mid-tempo cumbia {{and rock}} song with {{influences}} of dance pop and house music.

Author and contributor to The New York Times, Joe Nick Patoski found the song {{to use the same}} melody of the Pretenders' new wave sound. Author Lori Beth Rodriguez, also found similarities between the Pretenders' mainstream sound and [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] but noticed how the song enchoed a cumbia undertone with [...] "lyrics [...] are similar in theme, yet different from those in the original English version." [...] The song features a synth-driven violin, ostinatish-percussion, and a <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> under a cumbia beat. Perone found the song to have [...] "small hints" [...] of music found in Jamaica, Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago. BuzzFeed contributor Brian Galindo, called the song [...] "upbeat and dancy". Written in the key of D minor, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 90 beats per minute. Rebecca Thatcher of the Austin American-Statesman, found the lyrical content of [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] to be a [...] "lilting ode to a lost love". Lyrically, the song describes a lonely female protagonist who [...] "kisses the photo of her [...] each night before falling asleep." ...|$|E
