50|$|The VASCAR {{system has}} one major {{advantage}} over the RADAR and LIDAR systems also used for determining speed, {{in that it is}} not necessary to be in (or close to) the line of travel of the target vehicle. RADAR and LIDAR clock speed using the Doppler effect, so a vehicle traveling at an angle in relation to the unit will have a lower speed reading than actual speed. VASCAR, however, can provide an accurate speed clock under any conditions in which both a start and a <b>stop</b> <b>point</b> can be identified. It is not even necessary to see the entire course over which the target vehicle travels, so long as that specific vehicle can be identified as it passes the start and end points. The greater the distance (to the limit of the device), the more accurate the average speed.|$|E

50|$|Rho-dependent {{transcription}} terminators {{require a}} protein called Rho factor, which exhibits RNA helicase activity, {{to disrupt the}} mRNA-DNA-RNA polymerase transcriptional complex. Rho-dependent terminators are found in bacteria and phage. The Rho-dependent terminator occurs downstream of translational stop codons and consists of an unstructured, cytosine-rich sequence on the mRNA known as a Rho utilization site (rut) for which a consensus sequence has not been identified, and a downstream transcription <b>stop</b> <b>point</b> (tsp). The rut serves as a mRNA loading site and as an activator for Rho; activation enables Rho to efficiently hydrolyze ATP and translocate down the mRNA while it maintains contact with the rut site. Rho is able {{to catch up with}} the RNA polymerase, which is stalled at the downstream tsp sites. Contact between Rho and the RNA polymerase complex stimulates dissociation of the transcriptional complex through a mechanism involving allosteric effects of Rho on RNA polymerase.|$|E
5000|$|The Karamazovs {{performed}} a unique, broad adaptation of Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors at Lincoln Center. Aired {{live on the}} PBS program Live from Lincoln Center, on June 24, 1987, the Karamazovs were joined by such [...] "new vaudeville" [...] acts as Avner the Eccentric {{and members of the}} troupe Vaudeville Nouveau. The (at the time) five members of the Karamazovs all played major roles: Patterson and Magid as the twins Antipholus, Nelson and Williams as the twins Dromio, and Furst as William Shakespeare himself. Their modern farcical take on the play managed to incorporate everything from juggling, acrobatics and faux knife-throwing to gospel, jazz and a cross-dressing brothel madam. Many jokes made reference to American culture of the 1980s. One running gag was that nobody can pronounce [...] "Epidamnum," [...] a place mentioned several times {{over the course of the}} play. After each stammering attempt, all onstage actors would <b>stop,</b> <b>point</b> toward the supposed location, then resume their activities.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving command}} system used short {{sections}} of the running rails, 10 ft long, which were called 'spots', and carried signals coded at between 1 kHz and 20 kHz. Running speeds were coded so that 100 Hz represented 1 mph, so a 3.5 kHz spot indicated that the train should be travelling at 35 mph and a 2 kHz spot {{that it should be}} travelling at 20 mph. In addition, a 15 kHz spot indicated that the traction motors should be shut down, but the train allowed to coast, while a 20 kHz spot indicated that the train should stop, as the next signal was at danger. When a train passed a speed control spot on the approach to a station, the brakes were applied at different rates, depending on whether the train was travelling faster or slower than the specified speed. Once the speed was below 4 mph, the brakes were released slightly, to ensure a smooth stop, and the resting position would be within 5 ft of the desired <b>stop</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
