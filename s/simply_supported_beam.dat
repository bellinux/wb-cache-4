25|$|When a <b>simply</b> <b>{{supported}}</b> <b>beam</b> {{is loaded}} in flexure, the top side is in compression, {{and the bottom}} side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of damage for <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> to ensure their safety. Based on the analysis of possible kinds of damage may occur, this paper presents a new approach which relies {{on the fact that}} any change in local stiffness caused by damage can be reflected by the change of mid-span displacement between the intact and damaged beams. Direct relationship between the change in local stiffness and the measured mid-span displacement values is developed. This approach can identify the geometric locations of damage and then inspection means are used as a complement to find the real damage phenomena within the obtained small region. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the approach. The novel content offered by authors provides a simple, convenient, cost-effective, and nondestructive damage detection approach for <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 82) The {{purpose of}} this project is to investigate the effects on the minimum weight requirements of a beam when different types of beam tapering are used. The results are then compared with the minimum weight requirement of a uniform beam. The optimization technique employed for the continuous tapers was first described in Ref. (1), and later extended to the stepped taper case by the same author. (3) This {{involves the use of}} a systems merit function. An optimization program based on the Monte Carlo method was set up to handle many of the more complex merit functions. Two groups of cantilever beam loading configurations were investigated. The first group consisted of single point loaded cantilevers, while the second group was composed of uniformly loaded cantilevers. Two groups of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> were also investigated. The first group consisted of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> with a point load at the center of their span. The members of the second group were uniformly loaded. The cantilever <b>beams</b> and the <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> had the lowest merit function, therefore the least weight, when they were of the continuous taper configuration. Small weight differences were found between step tapered beams with equal length steps, and step tapered beams with optimized length steps. Weight comparisons were also done for two examples of bridge beam structures. The first involved two cantilever beams meeting {{in the center of the}} span compared with a <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> span which turned out to be the lightest bridge structure.

40|$|Abstract]: Despite {{experimental}} evidences, {{the contributions}} of the concrete slab and composite action to the vertical shear strength of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> steel–concrete composite <b>beams</b> are not considered in current design codes, which lead to conservative designs. In this paper, the finite element method is used to investigate the flexural and shear strengths of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> composite <b>beams</b> under combined bending and shear. A three-dimensional finite element model has been developed to account for geometric and material nonlinear behavior of composite beams, and verified by experimental results. The verified finite element model is than employed to quantify {{the contributions of}} the concrete slab and composite action to the moment and shear capacities of composite beams. The effect of the degree of shear connection on the vertical shear strength of deep composite beams loaded in shear is studied. Design models for vertical shear strength including contributions from the concrete slab and composite action and for the ultimate moment–shear interaction are proposed for the design of <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> composite <b>beams</b> in combined bending and shear. The proposed design models provide a consistent and economical design procedure for <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> composite <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most {{research}} {{since the}} introduction of mechanical forms of shear connection to provide interaction in steel–concrete beams in the 1940 s has focused on <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> With the use of advanced computer techniques current research on continuous beams is increasing and tends to focus on design issues. However, the fatigue assessment of existing composite bridges worldwide is growing rapidly due to increasing allowable load limits and {{because many of the}} bridges are reaching the end of their originally anticipated design life. Based on linear elastic partial interaction theory, this paper develops simplified equations and practical assessment charts that are used to more accurately assess the remaining strength or endurance of the shear connection in continuous composite beams. This research extends the tiered assessment approach previously published for <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> so that it is now applicable to composite beams with any number of spans, varying span lengths and varying shear connection distribution, and/or cross-sectional geometry.

30|$|A quasi-non-linear {{fracture}} mechanics model based on beam on elastic foundation theory is applied {{for analysis of}} the splitting failure of dowel joints loaded perpendicular to grain. <b>Simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> symmetrically loaded by two dowels are considered, {{and the effects of}} edge distance, dowel spacing, and distance between dowels and supports are accounted for. The foundation modulus used in the beam on elastic foundation model is chosen so that the perpendicular-to-grain tensile strength and fracture energy properties of the wood are correctly represented. This ensures that a conventional stress analysis and failure criterion lead to the same solution as the compliance method of {{fracture mechanics}}. A semiempirical efficiency factor is proposed to account for the influence of the total beam depth, which does not enter the beam on elastic foundation model, but the effect of which is evident from tests. It is shown that the so-called Van der Put/Leijten model, which recently has been adopted in Eurocode 5, appears as a special case of the model presented. Tests on <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> with a single dowel joint at midspan are compared with the theoretical predictions.
