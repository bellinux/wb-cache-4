5|$|Shunt {{surgery was}} {{introduced}} in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal <b>shunting.</b> Negative reports on <b>shunting</b> in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, <b>shunting</b> is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E

30|$|The {{records of}} all <b>shunts</b> placed between 1973 and 2003 for IIH at one {{institution}} were reviewed by McGirt et al. {{in a series}} of 42 patients treated with 36 VP/VA <b>shunts</b> and 79 LP <b>shunts.</b> All the clinical manifestations of IIH especially the headache were significantly improved after the placement of the <b>shunt</b> in 95 % of the cases. The recurrence of a severe headache occurred in 19 % and 48 % after 12 and 36 [*]months, respectively, post <b>shunt</b> insertion despite a well-functioning <b>shunt.</b> The LP <b>shunts</b> had a threefold increase in <b>shunt</b> obstruction in comparison to VP and VA <b>shunts.</b> However, the risk of distal migration, over drainage and <b>shunt</b> infection was the same in both the LP <b>shunt</b> and the VP/VA <b>shunt</b> groups. In conclusion, <b>shunts</b> are extremely beneficial in the acute treatment of IIH-associated intractable headache, and the majority of patients had a long-term relief. Treatment of IIH with VP/VA <b>shunts</b> was associated with a decreased incidence of <b>shunt</b> obstruction as compared to LP <b>shunts</b> [23].|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the morphology of porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> {{in a large}} series of dogs using computed tomography (CT) angiography. Study Design: Retrospective study. Animals: Dogs (n= 36) with porto-azygos <b>shunts.</b> Methods: CT angiography was performed in dogs subsequently proven to have a porto-azygos <b>shunt.</b> The origin and insertion of the <b>shunts</b> were assessed on native images. The diameter of the porto-azygos <b>shunt</b> and the portal vein, cranial and caudal to the <b>shunt</b> origin, were measured. The porto-azygos <b>shunt</b> anatomy was studied on three-dimensional images. Results: All porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> originated either in the left gastric vein (33 left gastro-azygos <b>shunts)</b> or the right gastric vein (3 right gastro-azygos <b>shunts).</b> Two left gastro-azygos <b>shunts</b> had concurrent caval-azygos continuation and 2 right gastro-azygos <b>shunts</b> had a caudal splenic loop. All <b>shunts</b> crossed the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus. The majority of porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> (32) followed a straight pathway after traversing the diaphragm, although 4 <b>shunts</b> followed a tortuous route. All <b>shunts</b> terminated in the thoracic part of the azygos vein, perpendicular to the aorta. The <b>shunt</b> diameter at insertion was only 3 mm on average. The insertion site was consistently the narrowest part of the <b>shunt.</b> Conclusion: CT angiography was well suited to provide anatomic details of porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> and comprehensively documented that all porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> had a thoracic terminus, after crossing the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus. Different <b>shunt</b> types existed with minor variations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Shunt</b> vessels were imaged and <b>shunt</b> flow was {{analysed}} by {{cross sectional}} and Doppler echocardiography in 12 {{patients who had}} had 14 <b>shunt</b> procedures (nine left Blalock-Taussig <b>shunts,</b> three right Blalock-Taussig <b>shunts,</b> one modified Waterston <b>shunt,</b> and one central <b>shunt).</b> METHODS [...] The <b>shunt</b> vessels were classified by echocardiography as uniformly patent, segmentally stenosed, and uniformly stenosed. These findings were {{compared with those of}} angiography. Also the peak flow velocities at the aortic and the pulmonary ends of the <b>shunt</b> vessels were measured by Doppler echocardiography and the ratio of these values was calculated for each <b>shunt.</b> RESULTS [...] Twelve (85. 7 %) of 14 <b>shunt</b> vessels were imaged along their entire length by cross sectional echocardiography. The two remaining <b>shunt</b> vessels were only partially imaged. In 10 patients who also had angiography the echocardiographic and angiographic images of the <b>shunt</b> vessels were identical. The ratio of the peak flow velocity measured at the aortic and the pulmonary ends of the <b>shunt</b> vessel was significantly larger in the segmentally stenosed <b>shunt</b> vessels than in the uniformly patent <b>shunt</b> vessels (p < 0. 001). The ratio in the two <b>shunt</b> vessels only partially imaged by cross sectional echocardiography indicated that they were segmentally stenosed. CONCLUSION [...] The combination of cross sectional and Doppler echocardiography may be useful for determining either the patency or the morphology of an aortopulmonary <b>shunt...</b>|$|R
5|$|Following the report, the CLR {{purchased}} 64 {{driving motor}} carriages {{for use with}} the existing stock; together, these were formed into six- or seven-carriage trains.

5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of <b>shunting</b> over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services. Whilst the <b>shunting</b> of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to {{the interest of the}} tourist and occasional traveller, it also added marginally to the journey time.|$|E
30|$|Five {{patients}} (71 %) {{were presented}} with <b>shunt</b> failure due to tube migration (one of them had wound and <b>shunt</b> infection), while two patients (29 %) presented with <b>shunt</b> failure due to <b>shunt</b> obstruction with proper <b>shunt</b> position.|$|R
25|$|In a {{minority}} of people with advanced cirrhosis that have recurrent ascites, <b>shunts</b> may be used. Typical <b>shunts</b> used are portacaval <b>shunt,</b> peritoneovenous <b>shunt,</b> and the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <b>shunt</b> (TIPS). However, none of these <b>shunts</b> {{has been shown to}} extend life expectancy, and are considered to be bridges to liver transplantation.|$|R
50|$|The {{revision}} of a <b>shunt</b> means to replace or make adjustments to {{all or part}} of the <b>shunt,</b> this also means that the location of the <b>shunt</b> may be changed therefore changing the category or type of <b>shunt</b> a patient has. For some patients with <b>shunts,</b> a revision or multiple revisions to the <b>shunt</b> may be required. This can be something minor, such as adjusting the setting on a valve to change the flow level through the valve to replacing a substantial length of the <b>shunt,</b> or even replacing the entire <b>shunt</b> or relocating the <b>shunt</b> route to a different part of the body. For example, it may be required for a patient with a lumbar-peritoneal <b>shunt,</b> if multiple revisions are required or overdrainage is occurring, to have it replaced with a ventriculo-peritoneal <b>shunt</b> (VP <b>shunt).</b>|$|R
5|$|Inglenook Sidings is {{an award-winning}} model railway train <b>shunting</b> puzzle created by Alan Wright for the Manchester Model Railway Society's 1978 show, {{based on the}} former Kilham Sidings on the Alnwick and Cornhill Railway.

5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A <b>shunting</b> of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, several reports {{enumerated}} {{the numerous}} abnormalities reported previously, and confirmed the previously enunciated theory that metabolic impairment and portosystemic <b>shunting</b> are the underlying mechanism behind hepatic encephalopathy, {{and that the}} nitrogen-rich compounds originate from the intestine. Many of these studies were done by Professor Dame Sheila Sherlock (1918–2001), then at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London and subsequently at the Royal Free Hospital. The same group investigated protein restriction and neomycin.|$|E
40|$|From 1971 to 1975, 55 {{patients}} with variceal bleeding secondary to cirrhosis {{were entered into}} a prospective randomized trial comparing distal splenorenal (selective) and H-graft interposition (nonselective) <b>shunt.</b> This 10 -year follow-up documents that selective <b>shunt</b> is better (p less than 0. 05) {{in four of the}} five variables monitored. Control of bleeding: selective <b>shunt</b> prevented variceal bleeding better than interposition <b>shunt</b> due to the higher (0. 05 less than p less than 0. 1) occlusion rate (30 %) of interposition <b>shunt.</b> Selective <b>shunt</b> maintained postoperative portal perfusion better (p less than 0. 01) than patent interposition <b>shunt.</b> Seventy-five per cent of selective <b>shunt</b> survivors have portal perfusion at 10 years: no patient with a patent nonselective <b>shunt</b> perfuses the liver. Quantitative liver function was better preserved (p less than 0. 01) 10 years after selective <b>shunt</b> than nonselective <b>shunt.</b> Postoperative encephalopathy occurred in fewer (p less than 0. 01) selective (27 %) than nonselective (75 %) <b>shunt</b> patients over the 10 years. Survival: in the randomized population, the improved survival in the selective <b>shunt</b> subgroup did not reach statistical significance. However, improved survival was confirmed in nonalcoholics. Five of eight nonalcoholics operated with selective <b>shunt</b> are alive at 10 years with patent <b>shunts.</b> No nonalcoholic, of seven total, operated with nonselective <b>shunt</b> survived 10 years with a patent <b>shunt.</b> These data show that selective <b>shunt</b> was superior to nonselective <b>shunt.</b> There was less rebleeding and encephalopathy after distal splenorenal shunt; postoperative portal perfusion and hepatic function were maintained...|$|R
50|$|<b>Shunt</b> nephritis {{was first}} {{described}} by Black in 1965. Early cases and most cases since then {{are associated with}} infections of <b>shunts</b> that connect the ventricular system of the brain to the atria of the heart (ventriculoatrial <b>shunts).</b> Less commonly, <b>shunt</b> nephritis {{has been reported to}} arise from infections of <b>shunts</b> connecting the ventricular system to the abdominal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunts).</b>|$|R
50|$|Treatment of a CSF <b>shunt</b> {{infection}} generally includes {{removal of}} the <b>shunt</b> and placement of a temporary ventricular reservoir until the infection is resolved. There are four main methods of treating ventriculoperitoneal (VP) <b>shunt</b> infections: (1) antibiotics; (2) removal of infected <b>shunt</b> with immediate replacement; (3) externalization of <b>shunt</b> with eventual replacement; (4) removal of infected <b>shunt</b> with external ventricular drain (EVD) placement and eventual <b>shunt</b> re-insertion. The last method is best with over 95% success rate.|$|R
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or <b>shunting).</b> In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The depot {{stored and}} {{dispatched}} every item that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines.

The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own <b>shunting</b> locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for <b>shunting</b> and to haul works trains.

The railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.|$|E
40|$|OBJECT: As many as 40 % of <b>shunts</b> fail in {{the first}} year, mainly due to {{proximal}} obstruction. The role of catheter position on failure rates has not been clearly demonstrated. The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of navigated <b>shunt</b> placement compared with standard blind <b>shunt</b> placement at 3 European centers to assess the effect on <b>shunt</b> failure rates. METHODS: All adult and pediatric patients undergoing de novo ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt</b> placement were included (patients with slit ventricles were excluded). The first cohort underwent standard <b>shunt</b> placement using anatomical landmarks. All centers subsequently adopted electromagnetic (EM) navigation for routine <b>shunt</b> placements, forming the second cohort. Catheter position was graded on postoperative CT in both groups using a 3 -point scale developed for this study: (1) optimal position free-floating in CSF; (2) touching choroid or ventricular wall; or (3) intraparenchymal. Episodes and type of <b>shunt</b> revision were recorded. Early <b>shunt</b> failure was defined as that occurring within 30 days of surgery. Patients with <b>shunts</b> were followed-up for 12 months in the standard group, for a median of 6 months in the EM-navigated group, or until <b>shunt</b> failure. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients {{were included in the}} study, 41 with standard <b>shunts</b> and 34 with EM-navigated <b>shunts.</b> Seventy-four percent of navigated <b>shunts</b> were Grade 1 compared with 37 % of the standard <b>shunts</b> (p= 0. 001, chi-square test). There were no Grade 3 placements in the navigated group, but 8 in the standard group, and 75 % of these failed. Early <b>shunt</b> failure occurred in 9 patients in the standard group and in 2 in the navigated group, reducing the early revision rate from 22 to 5. 9 % (p= 0. 048, Fisher exact test). Early <b>shunt</b> failures were due to proximal obstruction in 78 % of standard <b>shunts</b> (7 of 9) and in 50 % of EM-navigated <b>shunts</b> (1 of 2). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive EM image guidance in <b>shunt</b> surgery reduces poor <b>shunt</b> placement, resulting in a significant decrease in the early <b>shunt</b> revision rate...|$|R
50|$|Management {{is focused}} on {{removing}} the infectious source. The <b>shunt</b> is removed immediately and antibiotics are begun. The infected <b>shunt,</b> typically a ventriculoatrial <b>shunt,</b> may be replaced with a ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cell can be degraded drastically by the <b>shunts,</b> {{some of which were}} originated from silicon material, but the most important <b>shunts</b> were induced by process. The simple measurement which can image the <b>shunts</b> directly was described by using the temperature sensitive liquid crystal sheet. Through analyzing all the major process-induced <b>shunts</b> in details, such as edge <b>shunts,</b> Schottky <b>shunts,</b> contamination-originated <b>shunts,</b> and so on, the reasons which influencing the {{efficiency of}} the solar cell can be deduced exactly...|$|R
5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and <b>shunting.</b> Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a new diesel <b>shunting</b> locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was {{partially}} dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NSB {{decided that they}} would replace the {{intercity}} trains with the Class 73 tilting multiple unit, and the locomotives for loco-hauled trains with the Swiss-designed El 18 (also with electric equipment from ABB, former BBC). In 1997, no. 2226 was put aside, and scrapped the following year. From 1998, the second series of El 17 was put into service on the Flåm Line, a steep tourist line that connects to the Bergen Line. The units were painted green and connected {{at each end of}} a train of six B3 passenger cars. From 2003, the first series was taken out of regular service, and units 2222, 2224 and 2225 were put into <b>shunting</b> service at Lodalen. Unit 2223 was transferred to the Norwegian Railway Museum, where it was put on display.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shunt</b> nephritis {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of a chronically infected ventriculoatrial <b>shunt.</b> A 17 year old boy is described, with arthritis in both ankles and positive rheumatoid factor tests, who presented with symptoms of <b>shunt</b> nephritis.

30|$|Although VP <b>shunt</b> is an {{effective}} treatment of hydrocephalus, it is plagued by shunt-related complications [16]. As VP <b>shunt</b> is lifelong commitment, multiple surgical procedures may be required during life time [17]. The incidence of VP <b>shunt</b> complications was reported by most studies to be slightly higher in males than females [18], which {{was consistent with the}} current study as males represent 73.3 %. Among 30 patients who were operated by ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt,</b> infants and children represented 93.3 % whereas adults represented 6.6 %. This is consistent with Abdul Munam et al. who conducted their study on 40 VP <b>shunt</b> complicated patients where children represented 85 % [19]. In neonates, scalp necrosis is actually a common complication associated with VP <b>shunts</b> which is due to the inherent skin fragility and the superficial nature of the <b>shunt</b> [20, 21]. In agreement with this current study scalp, necrosis was presented in four (13.3 %) patients. Lee et al. found <b>shunt</b> blockage in 12.2 % of 246 <b>shunt</b> procedures in Seoul, Korea, and their infection rate was 4.1 %. <b>Shunt</b> infection was found together with blockage in most instances in their series indicating that <b>shunt</b> malfunction could have been caused by infection in these patients [22]. Vanaclocha et al. observed that <b>shunt</b> malfunction occurred in infected <b>shunts</b> where some of which were clinically undetectable. They argued that the incidence of <b>shunt</b> infection might be higher than generally reported and that negative cultures of CSF taps did not exclude <b>shunt</b> infection in malfunctioning <b>shunts</b> [23]. Peacock and Currer found <b>shunt</b> blockage to be 20 % in their series of 440 patients [24]. Mwan’gombe and Omulo reported an infection rate of 24.6 % among children operated for non-tumor hydrocephalus in Nairobi [25]. In the current study, <b>shunt</b> obstruction was reported in approximately 13.4 % of patients (6.7 % proximal obstruction by debris and 6.7 % distal obstruction by pseudo cyst). Infection was also reported in 13.4 % of patients. Hamada and Abou Zeid found that misdirection of proximal catheter was founded in two (7.1 %) patients of their <b>shunt</b> malfunction series which is approximately near to the result of this current study as proximal catheter misdirection was founded in three (10 %) patients [26]. Aldrich and Harmann found that <b>shunt</b> disconnection and fracture accounted for 15 % of their <b>shunt</b> malfunctions and that occipitally placed <b>shunts</b> had a higher tendency to dislocate than frontally placed <b>shunts</b> [27]. In agreement with this study, <b>Shunt</b> fracture was noted in 6.66 % of <b>shunt</b> complication for occipitally placed <b>shunts.</b> Bierbauer et al. found no advantage of anteriorly placed <b>shunts</b> over posteriorly placed <b>shunts</b> in terms of <b>shunt</b> malfunction or infection [28]. However, in the current study, there was an advantage of anteriorly placed VP <b>shunts</b> over posteriorly placed <b>shunts</b> in terms of malfunction and infection. It was also noted that complications tend to occur more with occipitoparietal than with frontal VP <b>shunts.</b> In more details, incidence of complications with occipitoparietal VP <b>shunt</b> was 10.4 % and with frontal type was 6 %.|$|R

5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (<b>shunting</b> most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{occupation}} {{ended on}} 30 August 1944 and Liberation slowly healed the town's wounds. It {{had been a}} catastrophe for the network: of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939, 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged; track and overhead lines had been mutilated; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still, service was slowly restored, thanks to the staff's hard work and above all passengers' help in <b>shunting</b> trailing cars. In 1945, 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational, but, despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946, the war had struck a fatal blow. Rouen was full of out-of-date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for <b>shunting</b> at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
