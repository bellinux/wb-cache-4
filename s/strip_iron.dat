50|$|In 1945 William P. Snyder Jr., {{president}} of Snyder Mining Company of Pittsburgh and a Crucible stockholder, brought in president William H. Colvin Jr. With the board's approval, Colvin closed {{four of the}} company's eleven operations and began a $46 million modernization. The Syracuse plants were consolidated in 1946 into the Sanderson-Halcomb Works. In 1949, Crucible began operations in an $18 million sheet and strip mill at the Midland works, becoming the first steel mill to use hot and cold rolling of stainless and high-alloy sheet and <b>strip.</b> <b>Iron</b> Age, manufacturer of the hot reversing mill, called this a transition from a curiosity to standard production practice; ovens {{on both sides of}} the rolls could better control the steel's temperature.|$|E
50|$|Before the Great Oxygenation Event {{happened}} approximately 2.3 {{billion years}} ago, {{there was little}} free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean. It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic. This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of banded iron formations from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, {{there was not enough}} oxygen to mix into the deep ocean. This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would <b>strip</b> <b>iron</b> ions from the sea water, resulting in iron sulfide (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic oxidant instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic. This has become {{what is known as the}} Canfield ocean, a model backed by the increase in presence of δ34S in sedimentary pyrite and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate evaporites.|$|E
40|$|Iron {{is crucial}} for many {{cellular}} processes including DNA synthesis and respiration. The majority of iron in mammals is in heme within hemoproteins, inside cells, or transported through circulation by the glycoprotein transferrin, which constitutes the greatest iron source in serum. Limiting iron availability is an important facet of nutritional immunity to help prevent infection. Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a human skin commensal and opportunistic pathogen capable of causing a variety of infections, including particularly aggressive endocarditis. It is an emerging pathogen with elevated virulence compared to other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The versatility of S. lugdunensis to infect multiple niches and cause aggressive infection indicates that it likely adapts its cellular physiology to overcome host defenses, including iron limitation. In chapter 2, we demonstrate that, contrary to other staphylococci, S. lugdunensis does not produce a siderophore – small (kDa) iron-chelating molecules that <b>strip</b> <b>iron</b> from host glycoproteins, including transferrin, and deliver it to microorganisms. As such, serum is growth-inhibitory to S. lugdunensis, unless it is supplemented with an iron source. We have identified and characterized several iron-compound transport processes through inactivation of genes required for acquisition of each respective compound. S. lugdunensis transports the staphylococcal carboxylate siderophores staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B through Hts and Sir, respectively, {{and is able to}} directly appropriate siderophores produced by S. aureus when in coculture, to support its growth. Heme and hemoglobin-iron is acquired via Isd. In chapter 3, we demonstrate that hemolysis enhances growth in blood, in an Isd-dependent manner. An iron-regulated ATPase, FhuC, is required for import of several carboxylate and hydroxamate siderophores, whereas Sst 1 transports catecholamine stress hormone-iron (ie. adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine). fhuC and sst 1 mutants are impaired for growth in absence of hydroxamates and catecholamines, indicating additional substrates acquired by these are vital to S. lugdunensis. Using a novel systemic model of S. lugdunensis infection, we show that a isd fhuC sst mutant is significantly impaired in its ability to colonize internal murine organs, and cause sickness. We have detailed several iron-acquisition systems in S. lugdunensis and are first to show specific transporters are important for pathogenesis in the host...|$|E

40|$|In the {{traditional}} manufacturing process for metal {{food and beverage}} containers, a food contact-safe lacquer is sprayed onto the can before filling. This time consuming and therefore expensive process can be eliminated using a polymer coated sheet metal provided that the polymer will survive the manufacturing operations. The most critical stage in can making is the ironing process {{because of the large}} deformations that occur. This paper presents experimental and numerical results regarding the ironing process of polymer coated aluminium and polymer coated steel. A plane strain <b>strip</b> <b>ironing</b> device has been constructed to investigate the influence of the ironing reduction, velocity and die angle on the process forces and friction. Furthermore, an in-situ study of the displacement and strain fields has been performed in the <b>strip</b> <b>ironing</b> experiments using a digital image correlation technique. Simulations of the process have been performed using an arbitrary Lagrange Euler method based on an operator splitting procedure (OS-ALE). The constitutive behaviour of metal and polymer has been modelled with a generalised compressible Leonov model with a Bodner–Partom and an Eyring viscosity function, respectively. The experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{determining}} phosphorus in sea water, using iron-impregnated strips of filter paper, was investigated and compared with standard colorimetric methods of phosphorus analysis. Laboratory experiments were undertaken {{to determine the}} number of <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> required to extract phosphorus from sea water, the length of time a strip needed to adsorb all P from solution, the reproducibility of the method, and whether the strips could measure P adsorbed to different particles. Field studies were carried out with <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> in Cleveland Bay and the Herbert estuary, and comparisons were made with concentrations of dissolved, particulate and organic phosphorus determined by standard techniques. The iron-strip method was shown to work well under laboratory conditions, but the field studies showed varying results for the different environments tested. Generally, most of the dissolved inorganic phosphorus present in sea water was taken up by the <b>strips.</b> The <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> also took up a proportion of other phosphorus fractions in sea water, but the nature of this uptake appears to vary with environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|The intensity-time {{behavior}} for protons and alpha-particles, {{as well as}} for carbon, oxygen, and iron ions, has been measured following the solar flare of September 19, 1974, for energies between 0. 5 and about 5 MeV per nucleon. The profiles display a time dispersion which is inversely proportional to velocity for each individual species. In addition, at a given velocity the time dispersion also depends on the charge-to-mass ratio of the ion. Based on this latter dependence, it is concluded that while carbon and oxygen are essentially fully <b>stripped,</b> <b>iron</b> nuclei are not, having an effective charge of 10 plus or minus 5. The observed dispersion cannot be explained by purely rigidity-dependent diffusive propagation...|$|R

The equivalent width is greater than previously predicted. It is found that detailed radiative transfer can {{have a significant effect}} on the observed line flux both for the K alpha line and for the L-shell emission. The ionization of the iron increases with temperature. Therefore the K alpha equivalent width and energy is a function not only of the ionization parameter, but also of the column depth and temperature. For a likely model of NGC 1068 it is found that the iron abundance is about twice solar, but that modifications of this model may permit a smaller abundance...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of properties of exotic nuclei, essential for fundamental nuclear physics, now confronts a formidable challenge for contemporary radiofrequency accelerator technology. A promising option {{can be found}} in the combination of state-of-the-art high-intensity short pulse laser system and nuclear measurement techniques. We propose a novel Laser-driven Exotic Nuclei extraction-acceleration method (LENex) : a femtosecond petawatt laser, irradiating a target bombarded by an external ion beam, extracts from the target and accelerates to few GeV highly-charged nuclear reaction products. Here a proof-of-principle experiment of LENex is presented: a few hundred-terawatt laser focused onto an aluminum foil, with a small amount of iron simulating nuclear reaction products, extracts almost fully <b>stripped</b> <b>iron</b> nuclei and accelerate them up to 0. 9 GeV. Our experiments and numerical simulations show that short-lived, heavy exotic nuclei, with a much larger charge-to-mass ratio than in conventional technology, can be obtained in the form of an energetic, low-emittance, high-current beam.

50|$|On arrival Bass {{found the}} colony awash with goods {{and he was}} unable to sell his cargo. Governor King was {{operating}} on a strict programme of economy and would not take the goods into the government store, even at a 50% discount. What King did though was contract with Bass to ship salt pork from Tahiti. Food was scarce in Sydney at that time and prices were being driven up, yet pigs were plentiful in the Society Islands and King could contract with Bass at 6 pence a pound where he'd been paying a shilling (12 pence) previously. The arrangement suited King's thrift, and was profitable for Bass. With his partner Charles Bishop, Bass sailed from Sydney in the Venus for Dusky Sound in New Zealand where they spent 14 days <b>stripping</b> <b>iron</b> from the wreck of Captain Brampton's old ship the Endeavour. This was made into axes which were used to trade for the pork in Tahiti before returning with the latter to Sydney by November 1802.|$|R

2500|$|Significant {{differences}} {{in the construction of}} the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask, solid neck guard, or cap made from one piece of metal, and only two have distinct cheek guards. The neck guards [...] "seem without exception to have [...] either <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> or protective mail curtains." [...] The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 brow bands, and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet, others would have hung alongside them. Camail was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6, 7 and 8, and from Vendel 1 and 12. Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10 and 11, and from Solberga, likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> used to protect the neck. The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of [...] "a differing version well forward on the face" [...] of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Though [...] "difficult to reconstruct," [...] fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet. Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed <b>iron</b> <b>strips,</b> while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand. The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10, and Broa, which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant; that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant; the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with [...] "elaborate" [...] Y-shaped <b>iron</b> <b>strips</b> creating a latticed effect; and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed <b>iron</b> <b>strips,</b> and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.|$|R
