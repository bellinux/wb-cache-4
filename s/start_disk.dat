40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of {{stationary}} provision of grinding surface by creating the uniform abrasive impact on it. Mechanisms of forming the non-uniform abrasive action on machined surface grinding with the periphery of a <b>start</b> <b>disk</b> have been defined. It was revealed that stationary breaking of micro and macro geometry of grinding surfaces basically occurs in the areas of input of grinding disk in contact with machined surface and output from it and in the areas of configuration changes of machined surface. On the basis of analysis of analytical expressions, a new construction of the grinding disk has been worked out. It was determined that uniform abrasive action on machined surface is being provided at grinding with varied grained disk, therefore high grinding efficiency. It is explained with the concentrating on the operating surface of anisomerous grinding disk of granularity, starting with rough and ending with thin, allows combining the elements of rough and smooth grinding in one processing step. ...|$|E
40|$|Excessive power {{consumption}} {{is becoming a}} major barrier to extracting the maximum performance from high-performance parallel systems. Therefore, techniques oriented towards reducing {{power consumption}} of such systems are expected to become increasingly important in the future. Since disk systems of high-performance architectures are known to constitute a large fraction of the overall power budget, they form an important optimization target. Previous work on disk power management focuses primarily on hardware based schemes. However, since disk access pattern, i. e., {{the order in which}} disks on a system are accessed, is mainly shaped by the program code access pattern and disk layout of data, software techniques can also {{play a critical role in}} disk power management. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes and evaluates a profile-driven disk layout optimization scheme for reducing energy consumption. The proposed scheme analyzes the array access traces obtained through profiling and determines, for each disk-resident data structure, the <b>start</b> <b>disk</b> from which the data is striped, the number of disks over which the data is striped, and the stripe unit. This paper discusses implementation details of our approach and presents an experimental evaluation of it. Our experiments with the entire suite of Spec 95 floating-point benchmarks that are modified to operate on disk-resident data show that the proposed approach is very effective in reducing disk energy consumption. The results also show that the performance degradation caused by our approach is very small. This paper also compares our approach to a code restructuring based optimization mechanism and discusses how the two techniques can be combined for achieving the best results...|$|E

The cur-rent transient produced by a step change of the rotation speed of a disk elec-trode held in the convective-diffusion limiting current region of some elec-troactive species has been derived. Studies of the reduction of Ag +, Fe 3 +, and Hg 2 2 + are in good agreement with theory and show that the relaxation process is limited by the convective-diffusion of the electroactive species rather than the hydrodynamic relaxation phenomenon.

We investigate the relationship between the phenomena of unsteady separation of the flow and the exponential decay of the Fourier spectrum of the solutions. We show that Prandtl’s solution develops a separation singularity in a finite time. Navier-Stokes solutions are computed over a range of Reynolds numbers from 3000 to 50000. We show that the appearance of large gradients of the pressure in the stream- wise direction, reveals that the viscous-inviscid interaction between the boundary layer flow and the outer flow starts before the singularity time for Prandtl’s equation.

40|$|We {{consider}} Prandtl’s equations for the impulsively <b>started</b> <b>disk</b> {{and follow}} {{the process of the}} formation of the singularity in the complex plane using the singularity tracking method. We classify Van Dommelen and Shen’s singularity as a cubic root singularity. We introduce a class of initial data, uniformly bounded in H 1, which have a dipole singularity in the complex plane. These data lead to a solution blow-up whose time can be made arbitrarily short within the class. This is a numerical evidence of the ill-posedness of the Prandtl equations in H 1. The presence of a small viscosity in the streamwise direction changes the behavior of the singularities. They stabilize at a distance from the real axis which depends on the amount of the viscosity. We show that the Van Dommelen and Shen singularity and the singularity predicted by E and Engquist in [W. E, B. Engquist, Blowup of the Solutions to the Unsteady Prandtl’s Equations, Comm. Pure Appl.

40|$|Type II migration, {{in which}} a newly formed large planet opens a gap in its {{precursor}} circumstellar nebula and subsequently evolves with it, has been implicated as a delivery mechanism responsible for close stellar companions. Large scale migration is possible in a viscously spreading disk of surface density sigma (r,t) when {{most of it is}} sacrificed to the primary in order to promote {{a small portion of the}} disk to much higher angular momentum orbits. Embedded planets generally follow its evolution unless their own angular momentum is comparable to that of the disk. The fraction of the <b>starting</b> <b>disk</b> mass, M (sub d) = 2 pi integral rsigma(r, 0) dr, that is consumed by the star depends on the distance at which material escapes the disk's outer boundary. If the disk is allowed to expand indefinitely, virtually all of the disk will fall into the primary in order to send a vanishingly small portion to infinity. For such a case, it is difficult to explain the survival of any giant planets, including Jupiter and Saturn. Realistically, however, there are processes that could truncate a disk at a finite distance, r(sub d). Recent numerical modeling has illustrated that planets can survive in this case. We show here that much of these results can be understood by simple conservation arguments...|$|R

40|$|The near wake of an impulsively <b>started</b> <b>disk</b> was studied {{computationally}} by {{a finite}} element code with a Smagorinsky turbulence model. The shear layer separating from the disk lip rolled {{up into a}} symmetric starting vortex ring at first. As time evolved, the vortex stretched in the downstream direction and flow instabilities caused the vortex ring to become wavy eventually leading to {{the breakup of the}} ring. The complete breakup and shedding of the starting vortex ring took a time of approximately 14 D/U, where D is the disk diameter and U is the freestream velocity. The starting vortex ring circulation attained a plateau of 2. 6 UD at a time of about 4 D/U, in good agreement with the experimental findings by Balligand(2000). The radial circulation profiles are Gaussian during the symmetric phase and collapse together at a time of 4 D/U. Beyond this time, the vortex ring celerity is constant and vorticity extends to the symmetry axis. The base pressure coefficient becomes positive as the vortex ring moves away from the disk and remains positive until the ring is completely shed. The breakup of the starting vortex ring is concurrent with the appearance of an azimuthal pressure gradient and core flow. Following the breakup of the starting vortex ring, the flow became three-dimensional and settled into an open wake. The mean drag and base pressure coefficients were nearly constant after a time of approximately 30 D/U and matched very well against experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{currently}} thought that planets around solar-type stars form by {{the accumulation of}} solid matter entrained in a gaseous protoplanetary disk. We model {{part of this process}} starting from small particles suspended in a gaseous disk, and ending up with most of the solid material aggregated into 1 – 10 –km– sized planetesimals. The radial distribution of solid material circumnavigating a star {{in the form of the}} planetesimal swarm is the major result of this study, inasmuch as it provides insight into the large-scale character of the emerging planetary system. The model simultaneously keeps track of the evolution of gas and solid particles due to gas-solid coupling, coagulation, sedimentation, and evaporation/condensation. For simplicity, we concentrate on solids made up solely of water–ice. We have found that the radial distribution of mass locked into planetesimals is sensitive to initial conditions. Two illustrative examples corresponding to two different initial conditions are presented: a high-mass, high-concentration case that <b>starts</b> with a <b>disk</b> of 0. 24 M ⊙ extending up to 15 A. U. from the star, and a low-mass, low-concentration case that <b>starts</b> with a <b>disk</b> of 0. 02 M ⊙ extending up to 250 A. U. from the star. The high-mass model leads to all solids being lost to the star; however, the low-mass model leads to a radial distribution of solid material quite reminiscent of what is found in our solar system.

40|$|AbstractA {{flexible}} {{circular plate}} with gravity as its {{main source of}} external loading is called a heavy disk. This paper studies the non-axisymmetric warping of a clamped-free heavy disk. In the theoretical formulation, von Karman’s plate model is adopted to derive the equations of motion of a rotating heavy disk. In the experiment, a 514 -inch floppy disk is used to demonstrate the non-axisymmetric deformations when the disk is either stationary or rotating. We first measured {{the shape of the}} floppy disk when it was stationary. It was observed that two non-axisymmetric deformations coexisted, one with shape cos 2 θ and the other cos 3 θ. We next rotated the floppy disk. It was observed that when the floppy <b>disk</b> <b>started</b> with shape cos 2 θ, the deformation switched to shape cos 3 θ as the rotation speed increased to 303 rpm. As the speed continued to increase, the shape cos 3 θ persisted {{all the way up to}} 1010 rpm. Beyond that the disk deformation became axisymmetric until 1313 rpm. Beyond 1313 rpm, aeroelastic flutter started to kick in and equilibrium state was no longer achievable. The rotation speed was then reduced gradually from high speed to 0. It was found that the deformation remained cos 3 θ all the way, instead of switching back to the cos 2 θ shape the <b>disk</b> <b>started</b> out with in the first place. The coexistence of two stable non-axisymmetric deformations of the stationary disk and the hysteresis behavior of the rotating disk observed in the experiment are consistent with theoretical predictions...|$|R
