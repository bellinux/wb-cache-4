5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance.

In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E
