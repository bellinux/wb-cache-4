25|$|The {{connection}} is private (or secure) because <b>symmetric</b> <b>cryptography</b> {{is used to}} encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and {{are based on a}} shared secret negotiated {{at the start of the}} session (see TLS handshake protocol). The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted (see Algorithm below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).|$|E
500|$|The {{notion of}} using public key {{cryptography}} for data kidnapping attacks was introduced in 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung. Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on <b>symmetric</b> <b>cryptography</b> alone, the fatal flaw being that the decryption key could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key crypto is used, the cryptovirus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private decryption key private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric decryption key it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that [...] "the virus writer can effectively hold {{all of the money}} ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user if it gets encrypted by a cryptovirus". They referred to these attacks as being [...] "cryptoviral extortion", an overt attack that {{is part of a larger}} class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology, which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. The cryptoviral extortion protocol was inspired by the forced-symbiotic relationship between H. R. Giger's facehugger and its host in the movie Alien.|$|E

40|$|Cryptography is {{the science}} of {{encrypting}} the information {{so that it is}} rendered unreadable for an intruder. Cryptographic techniques are of utmost importance in todayâ€™s world as the information to be sent might be of invaluable importance to both the sender and the receiver. Various cryptographic techniques ensure that even if an intruder intercepts the sent information, he is not able to decipher it thus render ending it useless for the intruder. Cryptography can be grouped into two types, that is <b>Symmetric</b> key <b>cryptography</b> and Asymmetric key <b>cryptography.</b> <b>Symmetric</b> key <b>cryptography</b> uses the same key for encryption as well as decryption thus making it faster compared to Asymmetric Key cryptography which uses different keys for encryption and decryption.
