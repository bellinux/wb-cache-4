40|$|Background—Invasive {{colorectal}} adeno-carcinomas have {{bundles of}} eosinophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells,</b> which are regarded asmyofi-broblasts, in their desmoplastic stroma, {{some of which}} are continuous with the muscularis mucosa. Aim—To investigate the relation between the eosinophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> and the mus-cularis mucosa based on their cytoskeletal phenotypes in early invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma. Methods—Formalin fixed, paraYn wax embedded tissues of 17 early invasive colorectal adenocarcinomas were immu-nostained for á-smooth muscle actin (á-SMA), desmin, and vimentin. Results—The phenotype of the muscularis mucosa was á-SMA positive, desmin posi-tive, and vimentin weakly positive, whereas the eosinophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> showed a decreased degree of immuno-reactivity for á-SMA and desmin in particular, and an increased degree of immunoreactivity for vimentin. The de-gree of phenotypic diVerence between the muscularis mucosa and the eosinophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> was greater in the eosi-nophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> in the centre of the invasive area that were not continuous with the muscularis mucosa than in the eosinophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> continuous with the muscularis mucosa. Conclusions—These findings suggest that the smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosa change their phenotype to be-come eosinophilic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells,</b> namely myofibroblasts, in the early invasive area of colorectal adenocarcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Pulmonary sclerosing {{hemangioma}} (PSH) is {{an uncommon}} pulmonary tumor. Histologically, PSH typically {{consists of two}} types of cells, surface cuboidal cells and polygonal cells, four architectural patterns including papillary, sclerotic, solid, and hemorrhagic. Herein, we present a case of PSH in a 59 -year-old Chinese female. The tumor was predominantly composed of solid area presenting with diffuse <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> rather than polygonal cells. Focally, classical papillary and sclerotic area could be seen. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> were positive for TTF- 1, EMA, Actin(SM) and Vimentin, and negative for cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 5 / 6, surfactant apoprotein A, surfactant apoprotein B, CD 34, CD 99, S- 100, HMB 45, Desmin, Synaptophysin, CD 56, ALK and Calretinin. The immunophenotype of the dense <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> {{in this case was}} {{similar to that of the}} polygonal cells, and thus the <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> may be the variants of polygonal cells. Based on morphologic features and the immunohistochemical profile, the tumor was diagnosed as a PSH. The significance of <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> change is unclear for us. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PSH showing dense <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> in solid area. This case represents a potential diagnostic pitfall, as it may be misdiagnosed as a mesenchymal tumor such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, synovial sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, leiomyoma, or even mesothelioma, especially if the specimen is limited or from fine- needle aspiration.

40|$|Abstract Background Desmoplastic {{melanoma}} is {{a variant}} of malignant melanoma that can range in appearance from sarcomatoid to scar-like. Cytomorphology of desmoplastic melanoma has been previously described on conventional smears; however, to our knowledge, detailed cytomorphology on ThinPrep has {{so far not been}} described. Herein, we describe the cytomorphology of two cases of desmoplastic melanoma on fine needle aspiration processed as ThinPrep slides and compare it to that seen on conventional smears. Pertinent immunocytochemical stains, performed on ThinPrep slides are also discussed. Case presentation The first case is a woman with a history of desmoplastic melanoma of the scalp with previous local recurrences and lymph node metastasis with a new submandibular mass. The second case is a man with a previously resected desmoplastic melanoma with his first local recurrence. Conventional smears, including air-dried Diff-Quik-stained and alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained smears, demonstrated aggregates of pleomorphic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> admixed with fibrous stroma and single <b>spindle</b> <b>cells.</b> In both cases, nuclei were elongated and plump with irregular nuclear contours, deep grooves, and folds. Chromatin was dark and coarse with either inconspicuous or multiple prominent nucleoli. Cytoplasm was located at the nuclear poles and was fine, wispy, and delicate. The background was clean with no evidence of necrosis or melanin pigment. Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep slides were prepared from needle rinses and demonstrated excellent correlation of nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of single <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> to that seen on conventional smears with the exception of only slight decrease in nuclear size; however, nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> embedded in stroma was markedly attenuated. Confirmatory immunostain for S- 100 protein in both cases was performed on ThinPrep slides demonstrating crisp cytoplasmic staining in the <b>spindle</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusion The cytomorphology of desmoplastic melanoma shows excellent correlation between cytomorphology of single <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> on conventional smears and on ThinPrep slides. The major difference noted on ThinPrep slides was attenuated nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> embedded in fibrous stoma. </p...|$|R
40|$|Up to now, {{the precise}} {{molecular}} and morphological changes underlying the invasive and metastatic properties of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain largely unresolved. We speculate that neoplastic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells,</b> which are prominently {{found in the}} invasive tumor front and the surrounding stroma, might {{be responsible for the}} aggressive patterns. Expression profiling of various biomarkers relevant to cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was performed by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry in NPC samples. The expression of EBER and LMP 1 was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We found that overexpression of CSCs-related markers (ALDH 1, Nanog and ABCG 2) and up-regulation of EMT markers (Fibronectin, MMP- 2, Periostin, SPARC, Snail and Slug), together with E- to N-cadherin switching, occurred preferentially in tumors containing a large proportion of spindle-shaped malignant cells. Furthermore, CSCs-like properties were highly present in <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> compared with non-spindle cells of tumors, and correlated strongly with EMT features. In addition, EBV-related factors EBER and LMP 1 were highly expressed and correlated strongly with CSCs and EMT characteristics in neoplastic <b>spindle</b> <b>cells.</b> Importantly, high proportion of <b>spindle</b> <b>cells</b> (≥ 20 %) correlated significantly with various aggressive aspects including lymph node metastasis (P = 0. 031) and local recurrence (P = 0. 014).
