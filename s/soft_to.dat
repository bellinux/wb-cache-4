5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} North American {{release of the}} original Final Fantasy by Nintendo in 1990, Square Soft, Square's North American subsidiary, began work on an English language localization of Final Fantasy II, to be called Final Fantasy II: Dark Shadow Over Palakia. Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for Final Fantasy IV and Secret of Mana (known as Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan). Although a beta version was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, {{the age of the}} original Japanese game and the arrival of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES's successor console, led Square <b>Soft</b> <b>to</b> cancel work on the Final Fantasy II localization in favor of the recently released Final Fantasy IV (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled Final Fantasy II to reflect the jump in releases).|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E

5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith <b>Soft</b> <b>to</b> Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E

This level of detail can be found in the NES version's soundtrack, as well as the 2014 Android and iOS mobile releases.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, the French chemist E. Caventou {{isolated}} {{a previously}} unknown hydrocarbon from the pyrolysis of amyl alcohol.

25|$|In {{the course}} of normal use, there are three {{predominant}} types of wear on a pointe shoe that will determine its useful lifetime. The {{most important of these}} is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, the shank gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when the shank breaks or becomes too <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> provide support. The second is the softening of the box and especially the platform on which the dancer balances.|$|E
40|$|<b>Soft</b> errors due <b>to</b> {{radiation}} {{are expected}} to increase in nanoelectronic circuits. Methods to reduce system failures due <b>to</b> <b>soft</b> errors include use of redundancy and making circuit elements robust such that soft errors do not upset signal values. Recent works have noted that electronic circuits have partial intrinsic immunity <b>to</b> <b>soft</b> errors since single event upsets on {{a large percentage of}} signal lines do not cause errors on circuit outputs. Using ISCAS- 89 benchmark circuits we present experimental evidence that the partial immunity to single event upsets is in most cases due to redundancy in the circuits and thus immunity <b>to</b> <b>soft</b> errors may not be available in irredundant circuits. Thus goals on immunity <b>to</b> <b>soft</b> errors may not be achievable in highly optimized circuits without adding circuit redundancy and/or relaxing the requirements on system failures due <b>to</b> <b>soft</b> errors...|$|R

25|$|Jawless {{fish were}} the {{earliest}} fish to evolve. There is current {{debate over whether}} these are really fish at all. They have no jaw, no scales, no paired fins, and no bony skeleton. Their skin is smooth and <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> the touch, {{and they are very}} flexible. Instead of a jaw, they possess an oral sucker. They use this to fasten onto other fish, and then use their rasp-like teeth to grind through their host's skin into the viscera. Jawless fish inhabit both fresh and salt water environments. Some are anadromous, moving between both fresh and salt water habitats.|$|E
25|$|Because {{strontium}} titanate {{and glass}} are too <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> survive {{use as a}} ring stone, they {{have been used in}} the construction of composite or doublet diamond simulants. The two materials are used for the bottom portion (pavilion) of the stone, {{and in the case of}} strontium titanate, a much harder material—usually colorless synthetic spinel or sapphire—is used for the top half (crown). In glass doublets, the top portion is made of almandine garnet; it is usually a very thin slice which does not modify the stone's overall body color. There have even been reports of diamond-on-diamond doublets, where a creative entrepreneur has used two small pieces of rough to create one larger stone.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile steam engine allowed steam power {{to be applied to}} {{ploughing}} from about 1850. In Europe, soil conditions were often too <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> support the weight of heavy traction engines. Instead, counterbalanced, wheeled ploughs, known as balance ploughs, were drawn by cables across the fields by pairs of ploughing engines on opposite field edges, or by a single engine drawing directly towards it at one end and drawing away from it via a pulley at the other end. The balance plough had two sets of ploughs facing each other, arranged so when one was in the ground, the other set was lifted into the air. When pulled in one direction, the trailing ploughs were lowered onto the ground by the tension on the cable. When the plough reached the edge of the field, the other engine pulled the opposite cable, and the plough tilted (balanced), putting the other set of shares into the ground, and the plough worked back across the field.|$|E

25|$|The Central Coast, {{which extends}} from Cascade Head to Reedsport, while {{similar to the}} North Coast, {{possesses}} fewer sandy beaches, more sea cliffs and terraces, and {{a greater number of}} bays. Several small urban areas exist in this region. Among these are the cities of Lincoln City, Depoe Bay, Newport, Waldport, and Yachats. Because the usable lands of the region are squeezed between the mountains and the ocean, most urban areas are relatively small but are still larger than those of the South Coast region. The southernmost area of Central coast is the intermediary zone for this region and the more mountainous South Coast region. Exposed sandstone cliffs are also common along the beaches and highway. Local sandstones of the Central Coast were uplifted during the Neogene Era. Higher layers of exposed sandstone are often varying shades of orange, and are often quite <b>soft</b> <b>to</b> the touch, often being very brittle, and relatively easily eroded. Lower exposed layers, though less frequent, reveal harder sandstone deposits. Unlike the higher layers, they are often gray-brown in color and hard in comparison. This lower sandstone often breaks off in large, squared chunks.|$|E
