40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) yields important clinical informa-tion which often cannot {{be obtained from}} other imaging modalities. Cardiac pacemakers have conventionally been considered a contraindication to CMR, and relatively few data exist on CMR in such patients. Methods and results: We present 5 patients who underwent 6 CMR scans in a 0. 5 Tesla scanner. The patients were non-pacemaker dependent, and the pacemakers were reprogrammed prior to scanning to have sub-threshold output. Spin echo, gradient echo and real-time sequences were used with specific absorption rates of up to 0. 1 W/kg. A cardiologist was present during each scan, and the patient had continuous electrocardiographic and non-invasive monitoring of vital signs. Five of the scans were carried out without incident providing useful diagnostic information, which was not compromised by obvious artifact from the pace-maker box. In one case, the pacemaker began pacing at maximum voltage at a fixed rate of 100. This patient {{was removed from the}} magnet, and there were no clinical sequelae. The mean pre-and post-scan ventricular lead voltage threshold was the same (2. 28 V vs 2. 28 V).

This paper {{addresses}} the problem caused by motion vector coding dependencies on the error resilience {{performance of the}} emergent High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard.

Then, a subset of prioritised MVs is transmitted as redundancy (referred to as side information in the paper), to reduce the use and propagation of mismatched MV predictions in case of transmission errors or data loss. The simulation results show that the proposed MV selection method can effectively identify the most relevant motion field, achieving improved error robustness with a reduced redundancy overhead. Exploiting only 30 % of the generated MVs for redundancy, average quality gains of up to 1 dB are achieved compared to a uniform MV selection scheme, and up to 2 dB compared to the original HEVC standard with no redundant encoded information...|$|R

40|$|Untolerated load {{instruction}} latencies {{often have}} a significant impact on overall program performance. As one means of mitigating this effect, we present an aggressive hardware-based mechanism that provides effective support for reducing the latency of load instructions. Through the judicious use of instruction predecode, base register caching, and fast address calculation, it becomes possible to complete load instructions up to two cycles earlier than traditional pipeline designs. For a pipeline with one cycle data cache access, this results in what we term a zero-cycle load. A zero-cycle load produces a result prior to reaching the execute stage of the pipeline, allowing <b>subsequent</b> <b>dependent</b> instructions to issue unfettered by load dependencies. Programs executing on processors with support for zero-cycle loads experience significantly fewer pipeline stalls due to load instructions and increased overall performance. We present two pipeline designs supporting zero-cycle loads: one for pipelines with a single stage of instruction decode, and another for pipelines with multiple decode stages. We evaluate these designs in a number of contexts: with and without software support, in-order vs. out-of-order issue, and on architectures with many and few registers. We find that our approach is quite effective at reducing the impact of load latency, even more so on architectures with in-order issue and few registers. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the regulation of compulsory licence in international and Serbian sources of patent law. From international sources the subjects of analysis are the Paris Convention, TRIPS Agreement and the Community Patent Convention, whereby the last one has not come into force yet, but also contains rules on compulsory license. As far as Serbian law is concerned, all patent laws are analyzed, from the first one adopted as early as 1922 in the first Yugoslavia, until the effective Patent Law from 2011. The evolution of compulsory license is traditionally paralleled to the institution of forfeiture of patent. As the forfeiture of patent, as a sanction against the patent owner who does not intend to exploit the invention, was gradually losing its significance, so were the rules on compulsory license becoming more detailed and nuanced. Nevertheless, at present compulsory license is an instrument rarely applied in practice. This is primarily true of cases of compulsory licenses that are usually referred to as classical, such as the one issued when the patent holder does not exploit the invention or exploits it insufficiently and the one issued for the purpose of exploitation of a <b>dependent</b> <b>patent,</b> on the one hand, and the compulsory license issued in public interest in narrower sense, on the other. It is to be expected, however, that two latest subcategories of compulsory license, the one issued as a remedy for the infringement of the rules of competition and the one issued for the production of medicines for the purpose of export into countries with problems relating to public health, will be applied more frequently in practice...|$|R

A survey of students (45) who took calculus during this period was administered, and analyzed for attitudinal differences between those who took traditional and those who took reform calculus. There were no statistically significant differences in reported attitude. Volunteers (14) were solicited from those who had been freshmen during the change to participate in interviews. These interviews included students taught by each method, and were analyzed by using concept maps to determine if there is a difference in retained knowledge. Although consortium (reform) students showed slightly improved retention, the differences were not statistically significant. University computerized grade records were used to determine if there was a difference between students who took consortium calculus and those who took the traditional course. Both retention and grades in subsequent calculus-dependent mathematics, science, and engineering courses were examined. A pattern of comparisons emerged which showed that consortium students somewhat outperformed traditional students. The patterns were indicative of better teaching and cannot be directly attributed to the materials. There is good evidence that the consortium students were not at a disadvantage in subsequent course work.
