The location on the 78th parallel north is favorable to communication with satellites in low polar orbits. The facility consists of 31 antenna systems, both multi-mission and customer dedicated, making SvalSat the world's largest commercial ground station. They are variously capable of communication in the C, L, S and X bands.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to propose a {{frequency}} domain approach for irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> on "R"-super-"d". We extend the original definition of a periodogram for time series to that for irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> and define non-parametric and parametric spectral density estimators {{in a way that}} is similar to the classical approach. Introduction of the mixed asymptotics, which are one of the asymptotics for irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data,</b> makes it possible to provide asymptotic theories to the spectral estimators. The asymptotic result for the parametric estimator is regarded as a natural extension of the classical result for regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> to that for irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data.</b> Empirical studies are also included to illustrate the frequency domain approach in comparisons with the existing spatial and frequency domain approaches.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} uneven <b>data</b> <b>spacing</b> on the computations of MTIE and TDEV. We evaluated MTIE and TDEV with unevenly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> having the five different power-law noise types. Each simulated data set had 3600 evenly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> points <b>spaced</b> one second apart. In the next step, we removed data points for each file according to the parameter p. Each data point in a file was removed with probability p and not removed with probability (1 − p). And for the unevenly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> files, the average spacing was recomputed. Then we computed MTIE and TDEV for these data files with different p values. The {{results show that the}} difference among the performance of various p values is not significant when the observation time τ is larger than 100 seconds. In addition, the discrepancy between the computation results of evenly and slightly unevenly (p is small) <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> files can be negligible. It reveals that we can ignore the effect of slightly unevenly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> on the computations of MTIE and TDEV. Based on the results, one can employ a simple model to conduct the network synchronization measurement. In other words, in the telecommunications synchronization measurement, a clock recovery device that recovers the timing signal from the data bits is no longer required. We can input the network data signal to the time interval counter (TIC) directly. The measured data are often not evenly <b>spaced,</b> since the <b>data</b> bits of “ 1 ” and “ 0 ” are not distributed regularly. But based on the previous results, this novel measurement model can still be validated...|$|R

The extension is aimed at noisy <b>data</b> and irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data,</b> which is necessary for widespread applicability of EMD. The proposed algorithm, called statistical EMD (SEMD), uses a smoothing technique instead of an interpolation when constructing upper and lower envelopes.

40|$|Abstract The {{classical}} power spectrum, computed in {{the frequency}} domain, outranks traditionally used periodograms derived in the time domain (such as the c 2 periodogram) regarding the search for biological rhythms. Unfortunately, classical power spectral analysis is not possible with unequally <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> (e. g., time series with missing data). The Lomb-Scargle periodogram fixes this short-coming. However, peak detection in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of une-qually <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> requires some careful consideration. To guide researchers in the proper evaluation of detected peaks, therefore, a novel procedure and a com-puter program have recently become available. It is recommended that the Lomb-Scargle periodogram be the default method of periodogram analysis in future biomedical applications of rhythm investigation.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} {{valuable tool}} for modelling a nonstationary time series, X(t), is time deformation. In this procedure time, t, is transformed to a 'time' scale, u = g(t), {{on which the}} process Y(u) = X(g(t)) is stationary. However, since the time scale is transformed, equally <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> on the original time scale <b>data</b> become unequally <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> in transformed time. In practice interpolation in the original time scale is currently used to obtain equally <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> in transformed time which can then be modelled using the classical autoregressive moving average modelling techniques. In this article, the need for interpolation is eliminated by employing the continuous time autoregressive model and estimating the parameters using the Kalman filter. The resulting improvements include more accurate estimation of the spectrum, and {{the separation of the}} data into its time-varying latent components. The technique is applied to simulated and real data for illustrations. Copyright 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Denoising is an {{essential}} ingredient of any data processing task because real data are usually contaminated by some amount of uncertainty, error or noise. The ultimate objective {{in this study is}} to handle the multiresolution denoising of an arbitrarily <b>spaced</b> multidimensional <b>data</b> set contaminated with arbitrary noise. Denoising is closely related to function estimation from noisy samples, which is best achieved by complexity control in a structured function space. Multiresolution analysis and wavelets provide a suitable structured space for function estimation. However, conventional wavelet decompositions, such as the fast wavelet transform, are designed for regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data.</b> Furthermore, the projection and lifting scheme approaches for dealing with irregular data cannot be easily extended to higher dimensions and their application to denoising is not straightforward. In contrast, the least squares wavelet decomposition offers a method for direct decomposition and denoising of multidimensional irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data.</b> We show that the frequently applied level by level multiresolution least squares wavelet decomposition suffers from gross interpolation error in the case of irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data.</b> The simultaneous least squares wavelet decomposition, with careful wavelet selection, is proposed to overcome this problem. Conventional wavelet domain denoising techniques, such as global and level dependent thresholding, work well for regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> but more sophisticated coefficient dependent thresholding is required for irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data.</b> We propose a new data domain denoising method for Gaussian noise, referred to as the Local Goodness of Fit (LGF) algorithm, which is based on the local application of the conventional goodness of fit measure in a multiresolution structure. We show that the combination of the simultaneous least squares wavelet decomposition and the LGF denoising algorithm is superior to the projection and coefficient dependent thresholding and can handle arbitrarily <b>spaced</b> multidimensional <b>data</b> contaminated with independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, Gaussian noise. For denoising of data contaminated with outliers and/or non-Gaussian long tail noise, the decomposition methods based on mean estimation are not robust. We develop a new robust multiresolution decomposition, based on median estimation in a dyadic multiresolution structure, referred to as the Interpolated Block Median Decomposition (IBMD). The IBMD method overcomes the limitations of existing median preserving transforms and can handle multidimensional irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> of arbitrary size. Thresholding methods for the coefficients of robust median preserving decompositions are currently limited to regular data contaminated with noise drawn independently and identically from a known symmetric distribution. To overcome these serious limitations, we develop a fundamentally new data domain robust multiresolution denoising procedure, called the Local Balance of Fit (LBF) algorithm, which is based on local balancing of the data points above and below the denoised function in a dyadic multiresolution structure. The LBF algorithm, which was inspired by the intuitive denoising style carried out by a human operator, is a distribution free method that can handle any arbitrary noise without a priori knowledge or estimation of the noise distribution. The combination of the robust IBMD decomposition and the LBF denoising algorithm can effectively handle a wide spectrum of denoising applications involving multidimensional arbitrarily <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> contaminated with arbitrary and unknown noise. The only limitation is that the noise samples must be independent or uncorrelated...|$|R

We argue that this is not the case for irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> in two or higher dimensions. This article develops three methods for the multiscale analysis of irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>data</b> based on the recently developed lifting paradigm by “lifting one coefficient at a time”. The concept of scale still exists within these transforms but as a continuous quantity rather than dyadic levels. We develop empirical Bayes methods that take account of the continuous nature of the scale. We apply our new methods to the problems of estimation of krill density and rail arrival delays. We demonstrate good performance in a simulation study on new two-dimensional analogues of the well-known Blocks, Bumps, Doppler and Heavisine and a new piecewise linear function called maartenfunc. ...|$|R
