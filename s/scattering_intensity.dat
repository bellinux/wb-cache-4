40|$|Abstract. The {{determination}} of the spherical particle-sizes in colloidal suspension by Angular Light Scattering presents a lot of advantages, i. e. : the relative simplicity of the experimental installations, and its non-destructive character. The <b>intensity</b> of the <b>scattered</b> light is related with the radius of a particle by Mie Theory. However, the dynamic characteristic of the measurements establish a variations of the <b>scattered</b> <b>intensity</b> with the time which it has not considered. In {{the case of the}} particle suspended in water, the <b>intensity</b> of the <b>scattered</b> light measured in each angle θ is the superposition of the <b>scattered</b> <b>intensity</b> for each particle. In consequence, the intensity of the light scattered will be related with a particle-size distribution function, that in this work is assumed as a δ function. Then, the dependence of the <b>scattered</b> <b>intensity</b> with time is studied evaluating the variation of the center point of δ function with time taking account to the standard deviation of angular <b>scattered</b> <b>intensity.</b> The accuracy of the method is evaluated throw the deviation of the particle-size distribution taking in to account the standard deviation of the angular <b>intensity</b> <b>scattered</b> by calibrated particles of latex. A correct evaluation of the dynamic method is realized in terms of the static approach...|$|R
2500|$|Thus, if the {{elasticity}} is {{inferred from}} the {{measurements of the}} <b>scattering</b> <b>intensity,</b> and the viscosity is determined independently (via mechanical methods such as ultrasonic attenuation) measurement of the relaxation rate yields information on the pore size distribution contained within the polymer network, e.g. large fluctuations in polymer density near the critical point yield large density differentials with a corresponding bimodal distribution of porosity. The difference in average size between the smaller pores (in the highly dense regions) and the larger pores (in regions of lower average density) will therefore depend upon the degree of phase separation which is allowed to occur before such fluctuations become thermally arrested or [...] "frozen in" [...] {{at or near the}} critical point of the transition.|$|E
2500|$|Confusingly, {{there are}} two {{different}} mathematical expressions in use, both called 'structure factor'. [...] One is usually written it is more generally valid, and relates the observed diffracted intensity per atom to that produced by a single scattering unit. [...] The other is usually written [...] or [...] and is only valid for systems with long-range positional order — crystals. [...] This expression relates the amplitude and phase of the beam diffracted by the [...] planes of the crystal ( [...] are the Miller indices of the planes) to that produced by a single scattering unit at the vertices of the primitive unit cell.

50|$|The total <b>scattering</b> <b>intensity</b> in GED {{is given}} as a {{function}} of the momentum transfer, which is defined as the difference between the wave vector of the incident electron beam and that of the scattered electron beam and has the reciprocal dimension of length. The total <b>scattering</b> <b>intensity</b> is composed of two parts: the atomic <b>scattering</b> <b>intensity</b> and the molecular <b>scattering</b> <b>intensity.</b> The former decreases monotonically and contains no information about the molecular structure. The latter has sinusoidal modulations as a result of the interference of the scattering spherical waves generated by the scattering from the atoms included in the target molecule. The interferences reflect the distributions of the atoms composing the molecules, so the molecular structure is determined from this part.|$|E

The simulations {{are performed}} using rigorous simulation of the integral equations {{derived from the}} Helmholtz equation, describing a scalar wave above a non-penetrable surface with a hard wall or free surface boundary condition.

Compared with simulations of electromagnetic waves scattered from a perfect conductor, without recording the polarisation of the scattered light, our simulations give similar results when using a hard wall boundary condition.
