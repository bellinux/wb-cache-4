25|$|By Lee's estimation, {{the fort}} {{could not be}} reduced by {{bombardment}} or direct assault, only by starvation. As long as supplies could be built up, they would be. The last Confederate supply ship to Fort Pulaski was the small workhorse steamboat Ida. On February 13, {{it was on a}} routine run to the fort down the North Channel. The new battery of Federal heavy guns on the north bank opened up for the first time. The old <b>side-wheeler</b> ran for Pulaski and the battery got off nine shots before the guns recoiled off their platforms. Union troops went back to work modifying platform construction and resetting the cannon. Two days later Ida ran up the South Channel under the extinguished lighthouse and returned to Savannah through Tybee Creek.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{compared}} to later steamers, Jennie Clark was a primitive design, the essential features {{proved to be}} the model for almost all other steamers later built in the Northwest. [...] The sternwheel design was recognized in March 1855 as superior to the <b>side-wheelers</b> which up until then had been the dominant craft. [...] Jennie Clark could steam up the rapids driven by the sternwheel alone, when the <b>side-wheelers</b> were forced to line through, that is, stop the boat below the rapids, run out a line or a cable to a tree or rock alongside the river, wrap the line around a windlass and crank in the line, drawing the vessel up through the rapids.|$|R

[...] The work was done under the supervision of shipbuilder J.H. Steffen, who along with Capt. James W. Troup was one of the designers of the new vessel. [...] Wide West was almost unrecognizable once the works had been transferred to the new hull, which was to be a <b>side-wheeler</b> rather than a sternwheeler. [...] According to one source, new cylinders were bored for the side-wheel engines. [...] According to another source, the old engines would be used in the new steamer.|$|E

She was built at Cincinnati, Ohio in 1843 and her home port was Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River in the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The boat frequently steamed to both Louisville, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana. She was a <b>side-wheeler,</b> with three boilers, only one deck, no masts, no figurehead, and an above-deck cabin. Thomas F. Eckert, John Cochran, and Thomas J. Halderman had successively served as master or captain of the Lucy Walker. Captain Halderman was a very experienced river man, who since 1820 had worked as fireman, deck hand, engineer, and captain on steamboats, and later was a steamboat inspector. For some unknown reason, Halderman was replaced in Louisville just before departure, and her owner, Joseph Vann, took over the duties as captain.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the middle}} of an {{afternoon}} in May. An old <b>side-wheeler</b> was steaming south toward Puget Sound across the land-locked waters that lie between Vancouver Island and the state of Washington. A little astern on one hand Mount Baker lifted its heights of eternal snow. On the other, and a little ahead, the Olympians rose white and majestic; and between, vast, dim forests rolled down to the ruffled, blue water. It seemed to Frank Whitney, sitting on the steamer's upper deck in the lee of her smokestack, that it was a wild and wonderfully beautiful country he had reached at last; for since leaving Vancouver, British Columbia, they had steamed past endless rocks and woods, while island after island faded into the smoke trail down the seething wake and great white mountains opened out, changed their shapes, and closed in on one another as the steamer went by. He had, however, not come there to admire the scenery, and as he watched the wonderful panorama unroll itself he looked back upon the troubles that had befallen him since he set out from Boston a little less than a year ago.|$|E
50|$|Steamboats, {{including}} <b>side-wheelers</b> and stern-wheelers, sometimes encountered tragedies on Dorcheat Bayou. An early steamer {{caught fire}} as it returned south; a woman leaped from the vessel {{with a child}} under each arm. She but {{only one of the}} children were rescued. In 1850, the Shamrock also burned with the loss of one person. The ships carried cargo and passengers and often offered mostly musical entertainment. Among these ships were the Danube, the Jewel, and the Marie Louise, a reference to the second wife of Napoleon I. The steamboat era on Dorcheat ended in 1892, with the enhanced access to railroads, one of which was the Sibley, Lake Bistineau, and Southern Railway. Passenger rail service along Dorcheat Bayou ended in 1969.|$|R
60|$|In 1838 our {{commander}} {{was made}} a captain. There was no war now in which he might engage, but his mind was very busily occupied {{in regard to the}} proper construction of war vessels. In 1841 the United States Navy did not possess a single steamship. They were all old-style sailing vessels. Several steamers had been planned: one had blown up, and two others were still on the stocks. But Captain Stockton did not believe that if these were finished they would be effective as vessels of war. One great reason for this was the fact that their engines were situated so near the upper deck, that a shot from an enemy might easily destroy them, and so render the vessel worthless. Another objection was that they were <b>side-wheelers,</b> {{and it would be a}} very easy thing for a cannon ball to knock an exposed side-wheel into a worthless condition.|$|R
