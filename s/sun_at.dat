5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} {{extremely}} {{close to the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion, generally within a few million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|After Kepler-40b was confirmed, the French and Swiss science team {{worked to}} clarify the stellar {{parameters}} its star by analyzing the star's spectrum as collected by SOPHIE.

5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b orbits {{its host}} star every 3.5485 {{days at a}} mean {{distance}} of 0.05064 AU.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the <b>Sun</b> (<b>at</b> which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
5|$|The MESSENGER {{space probe}} may provide {{evidence}} regarding vulcanoids. Its opportunities {{will be limited}} because its instruments need to be pointed away from the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> all times to avoid damage. The spacecraft has already taken a few of a planned series of images of the outer regions of the vulcanoid zone.|$|E

5|$|The first {{satellites}} {{designed to}} observe the Sun were NASA's Pioneers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> a distance {{similar to that of}} Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.|$|E
5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4° {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (or over) the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> or near one of its nodes—the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)—and appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4°, Venus can be as far as 9.6° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge was {{exhibited}} in unfinished form in 1886 as The <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> St Jude's Church, Whitechapel; Samuel Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London {{in an effort}} to bring beauty into the lives of the poor; he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents.

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing {{the movements of}} celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting <b>sun</b> <b>at</b> the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E

5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, {{greater than that of}} Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more eccentric orbit.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the morning sky and had passed extremely close to the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> perihelion. One suggestion was that all three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to {{the ceiling of the}} Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the <b>Sun</b> <b>at</b> noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
