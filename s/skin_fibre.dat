Epoxidized palm oil (EPO) was added as a plasticizer in this project. The effect of EPO content 0 – 10 wt% was investigated over the tensile properties of PLA. EPO at 5 wt% was found to provide the highest tensile properties on PLA biocomposite. The plasticized PLA was then investigated for the effect of DSF content by varying the DSF at 1, 3 and 5 wt%.

The experimental results also showed that the fibre orientation of the skin has an effect on the failure mode and stiffness of the slab. As expected, the flexural stiffness of 18 mm thick slab is higher than the 15 mm thick slab. Finally, the restraint conditions did not affect much on the failure load and stiffness of the one-way and two-way slab systems. ...|$|E

40|$|When {{the surface}} {{membrane}} {{is removed from}} a frog muscle fibre the myofibrils swell, so that the spacing between the filaments increases by 10 - 30 %. In this study, the stiffness of <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> was measured when the lateral spacing of the filament lattice was reduced osmotically using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), a synthetic linear polymer. In the absence of PVP, the apparent stiffness of relaxed <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> measured during ramp stretches was about 0. 05 - 0. 1 of the stiffness of intact fibres. The stiffness increased when the lattice spacing was decreased. The mechanical characteristics of resting stiffness {{in the presence of}} PVP (or bovine serum albumin) were {{similar to those of the}} short-range elastic component of resting intact fibres. However, when the spacing of <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> was reduced osmotically to that of the intact lattice, the stiffness of <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> was about 1. 6 times higher. In the absence of PVP, Ca 2 +-activated <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> were less stiff than are fully active intact fibres during isometric tetani. The <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> force-extension relation was markedly curved. As the filament spacing was reduced, the stiffness of the Ca 2 +-activated <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> increased, with little change in isometric tension, and the force-extension curve became more linear. Experiments at varied filament overlap and during feed-back control of sarcomere length, monitored by laser diffraction, showed that PVP increased the stiffness of the sarcomeres. The increase of active stiffness in the presence of PVP could be partially dissociated from the increase of resting stiffness by inclusion of Mg tripolyphosphate in the bathing solutions. It is concluded that the low stiffness and the non-linearity of the force-extension curve observed in fully activated <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> are due primarily to the increase of filament separation that occurs when a <b>fibre</b> is <b>skinned.</b> The mechanism may be related to an increased angle between the subfragment- 2 part of the cross-bridge and the backbone of the thick filament, perhaps leading to buckling of cross-bridges under compression...|$|R

These two different fundamental release types in mammalian muscle could occur in combination at the same location. The two peaks of the frequency of occurrence for ECRE of mammalian skeletal muscle coincided with the expected locations of the transverse tubular system within the sarcomere, suggesting that ECRE mainly originate at triadic junctions. ECRE in adult mammalian muscle could also be identified {{at the onset of the}} global Ca 2 + release evoked by membrane depolarisation in mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres.</b> In addition, the frequency of ECRE was significantly increased by application of 0. 5 mm caffeine and reduced by application of 2 mm tetracaine.

The restraints types considered are free, screws, and glue. A 3 D numerical finite element model was developed to find the mode shape of different panels. It was found that the natural frequency of this panel is non-linear with respect to span variations.

The diameter of the extracted durian skin nanofibre (DSNF) was {{in the range of}} 49 - 81 nm. The changes of chemical composition of DSNF were clearly seen after evaluated via TAPPI standard test methods. Verification via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) confirmed the deduction of hemicelluloses and lignin in DSNF in the range of 1200 to 1000 cm- 1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrated increment in the crystallinity from 58. 3 to 72. 2 % after biological fermentation. DSNF was then incorporated into polylactic acid (PLA) via extrusion and injection moulding processes. The effect of 1 - 5 wt. % DSNF content on PLA biocomposites was investigated for its mechanical and thermal properties. The presence of only 1 wt. % improved the tensile and impact strength by 14. 1 MPa and 33. 1 kJ/m 2, respectively. The thermal properties of PLA- 1 DSNF biocomposite also recorded higher thermal stability, glass transition temperature (Tg), crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm).

This thesis documents {{the findings of a}} three year experimental investigation into the impact damage resistance and damage tolerance of composite honeycomb sandwich panels. The primary area of work focuses on the performance of sandwich panels under quasi-static and low-velocity impact loading with hemispherical and flat-ended indenters. The damage resistance is characterised in terms of damage mechanisms and energy absorption. The effects of varying the skin and core materials, skin thickness, core density, panel boundary conditions and indenter shape on the transverse strength and energy absorption of a sandwich panel have been examined. Damage mechanisms are found to include delamination of the impacted skin, core crushing, limited skin-core de bonding and top <b>skin</b> <b>fibre</b> fracture at high loads. In terms of panel construction the skin thickness is found to dominate the panel strength and energy absorption with core density having a lesser influence. Of the external factors considered the indenter noseshape has the largest effect on both failure load and associated damage area. An overview of existing analytical prediction methods is also included and the most significant theories applied and compared with the experimental results from this study. The secondary area of work expands the understanding obtained from the damage resistance study and assesses the ability of a sandwich panel to withstand in-plane compressive loading after sustaining low-velocity impact damage. The importance of the core material is investigated by comparing the compression-after-impact strength of both monolithic carbon-fibre laminates and sandwich panels with either an aluminium or nomex honeycomb core. The in-plane compressive strength of an 8 ply skinned honeycomb sandwich panel is found to be double that of a 16 ply monolithic laminate, with the type of honeycomb also influencing the compressive failure mechanisms and residual compressive strength.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of elevated, physiological levels of intracellular free [Ca 2 +] on depolarization-induced force responses, and on passive and active force production by the contractile apparatus in mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> of toad iliofibularis muscle. Excitation–contraction (EC) coupling was retained after skinning and force responses could be elicited by depolarization of the transverse-tubular (T-) system. Raising the cytoplasmic [Ca 2 +] to ∼ 1 μm or above for 3 min caused an irreversible reduction in the depolarization-induced force response by interrupting the coupling between the voltage sensors in the T-system and the Ca 2 + release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This uncoupling showed a steep [Ca 2 +] dependency, with 50 % uncoupling at ∼ 1. 9 μm Ca 2 +. The uncoupling occurring with 2 μm Ca 2 + was largely prevented by the calpain inhibitor leupeptin (1 mm). Raising the cytoplasmic [Ca 2 +] above 1 μm also caused an irreversible decline in passive force production in stretched <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> in a manner graded by [Ca 2 +], though at a much slower relative rate than loss of coupling. The progressive loss of passive force could be rapidly stopped by lowering [Ca 2 +] to 10 nm, and was almost completely inhibited by 1 mm leupeptin but not by 10 μm calpastatin. Muscle homogenates preactivated by Ca 2 + exposure also evidently contained a diffusible factor that caused damage to passive force production in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. Western blotting showed that: (a) calpain- 3 was present in the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> and was activated by the Ca 2 +exposure, and (b) the Ca 2 + exposure in stretched <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> resulted in proteolysis of titin. We conclude that the disruption of EC coupling occurring at elevated levels of [Ca 2 +] {{is likely to be}} caused at least in part by Ca 2 +-activated proteases, most likely by calpain- 3, though a role of calpain- 1 is not excluded...|$|R

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composite {{sandwich structures}} are increasingly {{used in the}} construction of civil engineering applications because of their outstanding strength and light weight properties. However, the use of FRP products has some design difficulties {{as a result of the}} composition of the fibre and matrix. The design variables usually are fibre and matrix properties, fibre direction, laminate composition, and core thickness. The combination of the design variables leads to a complex design problem, and the optimisation of fibre composite sandwich structures is rarely straightforward. This is due to the complicated behaviour, and the multiple design variables and objectives required to be considered. This research deals with the presentation of a glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) sandwich structure analysis and design. Based on the literature review, a design optimisation methodology was proposed for the FRP composite structures. The methodology contains three parts; experimental investigation, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with modelling verification, and design optimisation of the GFRP sandwich structures. Several experimental static and free vibration tests were made on the GFRP sandwich beams and slabs. The experimental investigation provided good information about understanding the behaviour of the GFRP sandwich structures. A user subroutine UMAT was written to model the GFRP sandwich skins in three dimensions (3 D) FEA. The FEA model was verified with the structural experimental behaviour in static and free vibration tests. The FEA analysis helped in-depth understanding of the GFRP sandwich structure behaviour, and provided an acceptable model for design optimisation. The design optimisation considered the Adaptive Range Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (ARMOGA) as an optimisation method. ARMOGA has robustness, ability in dealing with both continuous and discrete variables, and it has excellent searching for a global optimum. A design optimisation was done with the multi-objective cost and mass minimisation. The design optimisation was done on GFRP slab designs in one-way and two-way spaning. In addition, the optimisation of the single and glue laminated GFRP sandwich beam was also investigated. Single and glue laminated GFRP sandwich beams behaviour was investigated. Static four point tests were conducted for the beam investigation. The investigation showed that shear span to depth ratio (a/d) is the main factor controlling the behaviour of the GFRP sandwich beam under combined shear and moment. Single sandwich beams showed higher shear and bending strength than glue laminated beams. The static experimental results indicated that there are three types of failure that can be seen in the GFRP sandwich beam; core crushing, core shear, and top skin compression failure. The GFRP sandwich beam did not show debonding as a failure mode because the skin-core interaction strength is close to the tensile and shear strengths of the core. The prediction shear equation showed acceptable results for beams with an a/d less than 2, and the bending equation showed good results for the beams of a/d greater than 4. 5. One-way and two-way GFRP sandwich slabs were tested under static point load. GFRP sandwich slab tests showed that the core to skin ratio and the total slab thickness have a big effect on the GFRP sandwich slab load capacity. Slabs with 18 mm thickness and with a 3 mm skin thickness showed double load capacity compared to 15 mm slab thickness with a 1. 8 mm skin thickness. In addition, the support system has an effect on the slab behaviour and it represents an important aspect in the design. The two-way supported slab has approximately double loading capacity compared to the one-way supported slab. Square slabs with ± 45 degrees fibre orientation have a lower deformation and higher stiffness than 0 degrees/ 90 degrees orientation two-way square slabs. The effect of screw boundary restraint has a small influence on the behaviour of GFRP sandwich slabs. The effect of the slab width to length ratio is small at service load levels while it has more impact on the ultimate failure load level. The ultimate failure load decreases as the slab width to length ratio is increasing. One-way and two-way slabs were tested for free vibration behaviour in single and continuous support systems. The free vibration tests showed that the span length of the slab had an impact on the natural frequency with an increase in span length reducing the natural frequency of the slab. Two-way slabs have a higher natural frequency than one-way slabs. Three boundary restraint types were investigated. Moreover, glue restraints have a larger frequency than screw restraint slabs. The 0 degrees/ 90 degrees and ± 45 degress <b>skin</b> <b>fibre</b> orientations were also studied. GFRP one-way sandwich slabs with ± 45 degrees fibre orientation had a lower frequency than slabs with 0 degrees/ 90 degrees fibre orientation, while, the GFRP two-way sandwich slab with ± 45 degrees fibre orientation had a higher frequency than slabs with 0 degrees/ 90 degrees fibre orientation. Non-linear FEA revealed that the material models for the skin and phenolic core give an acceptable behaviour. The comparison of the FEA results was done with different experimental tests for the slabs and beams. The FEA model using the CRUSHABLE FOAM model and Hashin model gave a good prediction for the GFRP sandwich structure’s behaviour. The core part did not reach the hardening behaviour when the structure failed due to core shear and top skin compression. The same FEA model was used to predict the free vibration of the GFRP sandwich slabs. The FEA model developed in this work provided a good prediction of the free vibration behaviour of GFRP sandwich beams and slabs. This model can be used for design optimisation with confidence. Multi-objective optimisation revealed that slab thickness is affected by the slab span. The required slab skin thickness and core thickness have an approximately linear relationship with the slab span length. The slab and beam designs are controlled by mid-span deflection limits. The strength constraints showed no contribution to the design optimisation. The design showed that the optimum core to skin thickness ratio of the beam is 11. 0. The glue laminated beam optimisation indicated that the single sandwich beam has an optimum depth design less than the glue laminated beam. The depth of the glue laminated beam increases with the increase of sandwich layers. From this study, it was concluded that experimental investigations gave a better understanding of the behaviour of novel GFRP sandwich structure. In addition, the FEA modelling added more knowledge to understanding the behaviour of such structures. The optimisation design presented the design variables of the GFRP sandwich beams and slabs. Screw restraint slabs have a higher frequency than the simple restraint slabs. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) function {{of exposure to}} high intracellular [Ca 2 +] was studied in mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> from the extensor digitorum longus muscle of the rat, using caffeine to assay the SR Ca 2 + content. A 15 s exposure to 50 μm Ca 2 + irreversibly reduced {{the ability of the}} SR to load/retain Ca 2 + and completely abolished depolarization-induced Ca 2 + release, whereas a 90 s exposure to 10 μm Ca 2 + had no detectable effect on either function. The reduction in net SR Ca 2 + uptake: (a) was near-maximal with treatment at 50 μm Ca 2 +, (b) was unrelated to voltage-sensor function, and (c) persisted unchanged for > 20 min. The reduction was primarily due to a threefold increase in leakage of Ca 2 + out of the SR. This increased leakage was not substantially blocked by the presence of 10 mM Mg 2 + or 2 μm Ruthenium Red. The adverse effect on SR function of exposure to high [Ca 2 +] could also be observed by the reduction in the ability of the SR to maintain a low [Ca 2 +] within the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> in the face of elevated [Ca 2 +] in the bathing solution. When bathed in a solution with ≈ 1. 5 μm Ca 2 + (0. 75 mM CaEGTA-EGTA), <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> produced only low force responses for many minutes, but after high [Ca 2 +] treatment (15 s exposure to 50 μm Ca 2 +) they showed large, steady or oscillatory force responses. These findings indicate that, in addition to uncoupling the Ca 2 + release channels from the voltage sensors, exposure of <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> to high [Ca 2 +] causes a persistent increase in resting Ca 2 + efflux from the SR. Such efflux in an intact fibre would alter the distribution of Ca 2 + between the SR, the cytoplasm and the extracellular solution.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the transverse-tubular (T-) system Cl− conductance on membrane excitability in skeletal muscle fibres of toad and rat was examined because of conflicting conclusions of previous studies on Cl− conductance. A mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> preparation was used that permitted investigation of Ca 2 + release via the normal T-system voltage-sensor mechanism after complete removal of the surface membrane, which thereby allowed estimation of the T-system potential from force measurements. When a <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> was bathed in a high-[K+] solution, the sealed T-system became polarized and could be rapidly depolarized by replacing the K+ with Na+, thereby eliciting Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In rat <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres,</b> addition of 20 mM Cl− to the ‘myoplasm’ (i. e. bathing solution) partially depolarized the T-system, inducing Ca 2 + release and subsequent voltage-sensor inactivation. These effects were completely abolished with 100 μM of the Cl− channel blocker 9 -anthracene carboxylic acid (9 -AC). Voltage-sensor inactivation increased in a graded manner over the range 3 - 20 mM myoplasmic Cl−. In toad fibres, voltage-sensor inactivation was only detectable at > 10 mM myoplasmic Cl−, and 20 mM Cl− was only able to depolarize the T-system sufficiently to trigger Ca 2 + release if the myoplasmic [K+] was reduced by 50 %. In toad fibres, 100 μM 9 -AC caused little if any block of the T-system Cl− conductance. It was also found that when <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> were obtained from muscles that had been bathed in a zero Cl− extracellular solution, the initial Na+ substitutions were more effective at depolarizing the T-system. This is consistent with Cl− trapped in the sealed T-system exerting a polarizing effect on T-system potential.

40|$|Many {{marine organisms}} {{accumulate}} {{high concentrations of}} solutes in their tissues to maintain osmotic balance. Osmoregulatory solutes are usually end-products of metabolism rather than inorganic ions (Prosser, 1973). For example, skeletal muscle from marine elasmobranchs, holocephalans and the coelacanth contains high con-centrations of both urea (300 - 600 HIM) and methylamine compounds, such as tri-methylamine oxide (175 - 250 mM) (Pang, Griffith & Atz, 1977). Urea is a potent protein destabilizer, and most elasmobranch enzymes examined are inhibited by urea (Yancey, 1978). However, it has recently been found that TMAO acts as a general protein stabilizer and can offset the effects of urea on enzyme Km and maximal velocity in vitro (Yancey & Somero, 1979, 1980). <b>Skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> provide a more complex and more physiological model than isolated proteins, and {{in the present study}} the effects of osmoregulatory solutes on tension generation in <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> isolated from dogfish myotomal muscle have been investigated.

An increase in temperature from 5 to 22 degrees C reversibly shifted the isometric steady-state force-pCa curves towards higher Ca 2 + concentration for individual fibres {{of each of the}} muscle types. A further increase in temperature to 35 degrees C in mammalian fibres resulted in an additional decrease in Ca 2 + sensitivity. The temperature dependence of Ca 2 + sensitivity was greater in the 'faster' fibre types: fast-twitch greater than slow-twitch; twitch greater than slow. The maximum isometric force response, P 0, of both rat and toad <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> was found to be strongly dependent on temperature below 22 degrees C.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine on depolarization-induced force responses (DIFRs) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in single, mechanically <b>skinned</b> skeletal muscle <b>fibres</b> of the rat. In this study, the DIFRs in the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> normally underwent an irreversible loss of excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) after 10 – 15 responses. Chelerythrine (12 μM) was shown to restore ECC in these fibres. Restored force responses were similar in peak (control 50. 8 ± 6. 4 %, chelerythrine 56. 9 ± 12. 4 % of maximum force, P= 0. 42, n= 21), but significantly broadened compared to initial control responses (full-width at half maximum, control; 3. 7 ± 0. 3 s, chelerythrine; 13. 3 ± 1. 1 s, P< 0. 001). Early exposure to chelerythrine prevented run-down of DIFRs. Chelerythrine also induced spontaneous force responses in some fibres. The PKC inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine did not restore ECC, and the PKC activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate did not promote loss of ECC in the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres.</b> Chelerythrine significantly increased SR Ca 2 + loading by 8. 4 ± 1. 7 % (P= 0. 02, n= 9) and SR Ca 2 + release by at least 14. 1 ± 2. 7 % (P= 0. 004, n= 11) in the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres.</b> Chelerythrine had no significant effect on maximum force production or the [Ca 2 +] producing half maximal activation of the myofilaments.

40|$|Mechanically <b>skinned</b> {{skeletal}} muscle <b>fibres</b> from the twitch {{region of the}} iliofibularis muscle of cane toads were used to investigate the relationship between fibre glycogen content and fibre capacity to respond to transverse tubular (T-) system depolarization. A large proportion of total fibre glycogen remained in mechanically <b>skinned</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> exposed to aqueous solutions. This glycogen pool (about 80 % of total fibre glycogen) was very stable when the preparation was incubated in a rigor solution (pH 7. 0) but decreased gradually {{at a rate of}} 0. 59 ± 0. 20 % min− 1 in a relaxing solution (200 nm [Ca 2 +]). The rate was considerably higher (2. 66 ± 0. 38 % min− 1) when the preparations were exposed to 30 μm [Ca 2 +]. An even greater rate of glycogen loss was found after T-system depolarization-induced contractions. The Ca 2 +-dependent loss of fibre glycogen was caused by endogenous glycogenolytic processes. Silver stained SDS gels of components eluted into relaxing solution from single <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> revealed a rapid (2 min) loss of parvalbumin and at least 10 other proteins varying in molecular mass between 10 and 80 kDa but there was essentially no loss of myosin heavy and light chains and actin. Subsequent elution for a further 30 min in either relaxing or maximally Ca 2 +-activating solution did not result in additional, appreciable detectable loss of fibre protein. Depletion of fibre glycogen was associated with loss of fibre ability to respond to T-system depolarization even though the bathing solutions contained high levels of ATP (8 mm) and creatine phosphate (10 mm). The capacity of mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> to respond to T-system depolarization was highly ositively correlated (P < 0. 0001) with initial fibre glycogen concentration. In conclusion, the results show that (i) the capacity of {{skeletal muscle}} to respond to T-system depolarization is related directly or indirectly to the non-washable glycogen pool in fibres, (ii) this relationship holds for conditions where glycogen is not required as a source of energy and (iii) the mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> preparation is well suited to study the regulation of endogenous glycogenolytic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the utilisation of four analogues of creatine by cytosolic Creatine Kinase (CK), using 31 P-NMR in the porcine carotid artery, and by mitochondrial CK (Mt-CK), using oxygen consumption studies in isolated heart mitochondria and <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres.</b> Porcine carotid arteries were superfused for 12 h with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 22 °C, containing 11 mM glucose as substrate, and supplemented with either 20 mM β-guanidinopropionic acid (β-GPA), methyl-guanidinopropionic acid (m-GPA), guanidinoacetic acid (GA) or cyclocreatine (cCr). All four analogues entered the tissue and became phosphorylated by CK as seen by 31 P-NMR. Inhibition of oxidative metabolism by 1 mM cyanide after accumulation of the phosphorylated analogue resulted in the utilisation of PCr, β-GPA-P, GA-P and GA-P over a similar time course (∼ 2 h), despite very different kinetic properties of these analogues in vitro. cCr-P was utilised at a significantly slower rate, but was rapidly dephosphorylated {{in the presence of}} both 1 mM iodoacetate and cyanide (to inhibit both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism respectively). The technique of creatine stimulated respiration was used to investigate the phosphorylation of the analogues by Mt-CK. Isolated mitochondria were subjected to increasing [ATP], whereas <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> received a similar protocol with increasing [ADP]. There was a significant stimulation of respiration by creatine and cCr in isolated mitochondria (decreased Km and increased Vmax vs control), but none by GA, mGPA or β-GPA (also in <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres),</b> indicating that these latter analogues were not utilised by Mt-CK. These results demonstrate differences in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of creatine and its analogues by cytosolic CK and Mt-CK in vivo and in vitro...|$|R
40|$|A microvolumetric {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} to measure the endogenous concentrations of diffusible elements in muscle cells. Single twitch fibres from frog muscle were skinned under oil and 0. 2 nl drops of isosmotic sucrose solution, held in the tips of specially constructed pipettes, were placed {{in contact with the}} <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres.</b> After 0 - 10 min, the microdrops were removed and analysed with a wave-length dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The uptake of Na, K, Mg, and P into the microdrops was well fitted by a single exponential function, while the uptake of Ca was better represented by the sum of two exponential functions. All elements analysed except Ca reached diffusional equilibrium within 5 min of placing the microdrop on the fibre, while Ca was still not equilibrated at 10 min. For freshly isolated muscle fibres, diffusible element concentrations in the microdrops at equilibrium were (in mM, mean +/- S. D.) : Na, 7. 6 +/- 7. 2; K, 82 +/- 36; Mg, 5. 8 +/- 3. 0; P, 51 +/- 19. Diffusible Ca concentration (at 10 min elapsed sampling time) was 0. 7 +/- 0. 4 mM. Results from experiments in which microdrops were equilibrated with <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> pre-soaked in an artificial (Ca-free) solution support the notion that the exogenous solutes can replace the endogenous diffusible contents of a <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> by soaking the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> in a relatively large volume of the artificial solution. Total Na, K, Mg, Ca, and P content of whole muscle was measured by electron probe analysis of muscle extracts. In freshly isolated muscle, whole muscle element content was (in mmol/kg wet weight, mean +/- S. D.) : Na, 21 +/- 8; K, 120 +/- 26; Mg, 9. 7 +/- 2. 6; Ca, 2. 2 +/- 0. 5; P, 76 +/- 18. Extracellular fluid volumes of freshly isolated whole muscles were estimated by compartmental analysis of Na efflux. Extracellular element concentrations were measured by electron probe analysis of frog plasma. Using the extracellular fluid volume and concentration estimates, extracellular contributions were subtracted from measurements of the element content of whole muscle to yield estimates of total intracellular element concentration (in mmol/l myoplasmic water). Based on the values for the intracellular total and diffusible element concentrations, the diffusible/total content fraction in freshly isolated muscle is estimated to be: Na, 0. 38; K, 0. 48; Mg, 0. 42; Ca, 0. 22; and P, 0. 47...|$|R

40|$|Glycerol-skinned {{skeletal}} muscle fibres retain the defined sarcomeric {{structure of the}} myofibrils. We show here that {{a small fraction of}} two enzymes important for energy metabolism, the cytosolic muscle isoform of creatine kinase (EC 2. 7. 3. 2), MM-creatine kinase (MM-CK), and enolase (EC 4. 2. 1. 11), remains bound to <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres.</b> CK is slowly exchangeable, whereas enolase is firmly bound. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analyses demonstrates that both alpha (ubiquitous) and beta (muscle-specific) subunits of enolase are present in these preparations. Enolase and CK were co-localized at the M-band of the sarcomeres, as observed by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Cross-linking experiments were performed on <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> with three bifunctional succinimidyl esters of different lengths and yielded a protein complex of 150 kDa that reacted with antibodies directed against either M-CK or beta-enolase. The cross-linking efficiency was greatest for the longest reagent and zero for the shortest one. The length of the cross-linker giving a covalent complex between the two enzymes does not support the notion of a direct interaction between M-CK and enolase. This is the first demonstration of the presence of an enzyme of energy metabolism other than CK at the M-band of myofibres...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{differences}} {{are known to}} exist between the vasomotor control of hairy and hairless skin, but it is unknown whether they are regulated by common central mechanisms. We made simultaneous recordings from sympathetic cutaneous vasoconstrictor (CVC-type) <b>fibres</b> supplying back <b>skin</b> (hairy) and tail (hairless) in urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. The animal's trunk was shaved and encased in a water-perfused jacket. Both tail and back <b>skin</b> CVC-type <b>fibres</b> were activated by cooling the trunk skin, and independently by the resultant fall in core (rectal) temperature, but their thresholds for activation differed (skin temperatures 38. 8 ± 0. 4 °C versus 36. 8 ± 0. 4 °C, core temperatures 38. 1 ± 0. 2 °C versus 36. 8 ± 0. 2 °C, respectively; P < 0. 01). Back <b>skin</b> CVC-type <b>fibres</b> were more responsive to skin than to core cooling, while the reverse applied to tail <b>fibres.</b> Back <b>skin</b> CVC-type <b>fibres</b> were less responsive than tail fibres to prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) microinjected into the preoptic area. Spectral analysis showed no significant coherence between tail and back <b>skin</b> CVC-type <b>fibre</b> activities during cooling. After preoptic PGE 2 injection, a coherent peak at 1 Hz appeared in some animals; this disappeared after partialization with respect to ventilatory pressure, indicating that it was attributable to common ventilatory modulation. Neuronal inhibition in the rostral medullary raphé by microinjected muscimol (2 mm, 60 – 120 nl) suppressed both tail and back <b>skin</b> CVC-type <b>fibre</b> activities, and prevented their responses to subsequent skin cooling. These results indicate that thermoregulatory responses of hairless and hairy skin vessels are controlled by independent neural pathways, although both depend on synaptic relays in the medullary raphé...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} the ability of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) to cause contractions of mechanically <b>skinned</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> of frog and barnacle. InsP 3 (10 – 500 μM) did not cause any tension development in 25 frog <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> and 26 barnacle myofibrillar bundles, although contractions could be readily evoked by caffeine and by replacement of an impenneant anion by Cl−, treatments known to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Four barnacle bundles did give responses to InsP 3. InsP 3 did not modify responses to caffeine or calcium-induced calcium release. Free Mg 2 + was lowered to 40 μM and 15 mM D- 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate was added in order to inhibit the possible breakdown of InsP 3 by inositol trisphosphatase. Neither measure revealed a response to InsP 3. Arsenazo III absorbance measurements failed to detect any binding of Mg 2 + (0 – 0. 5 mM) by 0. 35 mM InsP 3 in our solutions. Inhibitors of SR calcium uptake (cadmium, quercetin, furosemide), omission of EGTA from the solution and varying the temperature from 4 ° to 22 °C also failed to reveal a response of frog <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> to InsP 3. The nucleotide GTP, which {{has been reported to}} enhance InsP 3 -induced calcium release from rat liver microsomes, had no effect at 50 μM on the response of frog fibres to InsP 3. It is concluded that under conditions in which other calcium release mechanisms operate well, InsP 3 is relatively ineffective at releasing calcium from the SR in amounts sufficient to induce contraction. Although we have been unable to find evidence to support the proposed role of InsP 3 as an essential link in excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal muscle, we cannot entirely reject its role if essential cofactors are lost in the skinned preparations...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{transport}} {{activity of}} isolated cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) including Ca 2 + uptake and release is decreased in animals with chronic heart failure (CHF) following myocardial infarction. The {{present study was}} undertaken to determine whether an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril, improves cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular function in animals with CHF following myocardial infarction. CHF was induced by left coronary artery ligation in rats, which resulted in an infarction of approximately 45 % of the left ventricle. Aortic flow and cardiac output index were decreased, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased 8 weeks after the operation, suggesting the development of CHF. The developed force transients of cardiac <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> of the rats with CHF were decreased when the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> was preloaded for 0. 25 – 1 [*]min with 10 − 5 [*]M Ca 2 + (48 – 88 %) and when preloaded with 10 − 6 [*]M Ca 2 + and then exposed to 0. 1 – 1 [*]mM caffeine (45 – 93 %). The [3 H]-ryanodine-binding activity in SR-enriched fractions was reduced by 23 % in the CHF group. These {{results suggest that the}} amount of Ca 2 + released from SR is decreased due to a reduced rate of SR Ca 2 + uptake and a downregulation of the SR Ca 2 +-release channel. Rats were treated orally with 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1 trandolapril from the 2 nd to the 8 th week after the coronary artery ligation. Treatment with trandolapril attenuated the reduction in aortic flow and cardiac output index and the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and improved the developed force transients of the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> of the animal with CHF without causing a reduction of infarct size. Treatment with trandolapril also attenuated the reduction in ryanodine receptor density in the viable left ventricle of the rat with CHF. It is concluded that long-term treatment with trandolapril attenuates cardiac SR dysfunction in rats with CHF and that the mechanism underlying this effect is, at least in part, attributed to prevention of downregulation of Ca 2 + release channel...|$|R

The relative content of the basic (LC 17 b) and acidic (LC 17 a) isoelectric variants of the 17 kDa myosin light chain was determined in different mammalian smooth muscle tissues. The relative content of LC 17 b varied between muscles: rabbit rectococcygeus 0 %, rabbit trachea 5 %, guinea-pig taenia coli 21 %, rat uterus 38 %, rabbit aorta 56 % and rat aorta 60 %. The rate of tension development was determined following photolysis of caged-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> activated with thiophosphorylation of the regulatory light chains. The half-time for force development was 0. 67 s in rabbit rectococcygeus, 1. 6 s in rabbit trachea, 1. 13 s in guinea-pig taenia coli and 1. 38 s in rabbit aorta. The maximal shortening velocity (Vmax) was determined with the isotonic quick release technique in <b>skinned</b> <b>fibre</b> preparations activated with thiophosphorylation. Vmax was 0. 25 muscle lengths per second (ML/s) in rabbit rectococcygeus, 0. 24 ML/s in rabbit trachea, 0. 17 ML/s in guinea-pig taenia coli, 0. 11 ML/s in rat uterus and 0. 03 ML/s in rabbit aorta.

40|$|Studies on rats {{have shown}} that lactic acid can improve excitability and {{function}} of depolarized muscles. The effect has been related to the ensuing reduction in intracellular pH causing inhibition of muscle fibre Cl− channels. However, since several carboxylic acids with structural similarities to lactate can inhibit muscle Cl− channels {{it is possible that}} lactate per se can increase muscle excitability by exerting a direct effect on these channels. We therefore examined the effects of lactate on the function of intact muscles and <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> together with effects on pH and Cl− conductance (Gcl). In muscles where extracellular compound action potentials (M-waves) and tetanic force response to excitation were reduced by (mean ±s. e. m.) 82 ± 4 % and 83 ± 2 %, respectively, by depolarization with 11 mm extracellular K+, both M-waves and force exhibited an up to 4 -fold increase when 20 mm lactate was added. This effect was present already at 5 mm and saturated at 15 mm lactate, and was associated with a 31 % reduction in GCl. The effects of lactate were completely blocked by Cl− channel inhibition or use of Cl−-free solutions. Finally, both experiments where effects of lactate on intracellular pH in intact muscles were mimicked by increased CO 2 tension and experiments with <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> showed that the effects of lactate could not be related to reduced intracellular pH. It is concluded that addition of lactate can inhibit ClC- 1 Cl− channels and increase the excitability and contractile function of depolarized rat muscles via mechanisms not related to a reduction in intracellular pH...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether Viso (the maximum speed of shortening extrapolated from force-velocity curves) equalled Vu (the unloaded speed of shortening determined by the slack test) in both living fibres from Rana temporaria and mechanically <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> from Rana pipiens. In living fibres (R. temporaria) we obtained improved estimates of Viso by performing force clamps (isotonic) and length ramps (isovelocity) down to very low loads (0. 005 isometric tension, P 0). Force-velocity characteristics determined by force clamps and length ramps were the same. The hyperbolic Hill curves deviated from the force-velocity data at both high and low loads and underestimated Viso by varying degrees. A better estimate of Viso was obtained by linear extrapolation of data at loads from 0. 005 - 0. 02 P 0 and the mean Viso at 7. 5 degrees C was 4. 08 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 11 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). Improved estimates of Vu in living fibres were obtained by photographically calibrating the slack test. The mean Vu was 4. 05 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 13 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14) and the intercept was 0. 0156 fibre lengths (L 0) +/- 0. 0013 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). The step-ramp photographic method, in which the motor speed is matched to Vu, was developed as an independent way to measure Vu in living fibres. Vu measured in this way agreed well with Vu measured by the slack test. In all living fibres, the improved estimates of Vu agreed well with the improved estimates of Viso. Vu/Viso = 0. 99 +/- 0. 01 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). In mechanically <b>skinned</b> R. pipiens <b>fibres,</b> force clamps were performed down to loads of 0. 01 mN. The force-velocity curve of the <b>skinned</b> <b>fibres</b> differed in shape {{from that of the}} living fibres. Although there was significant deviation from the Hill equation at low loads, the data at high loads were well fitted by the Hill curve. Viso determined by extrapolating the Hill equation to zero load was 5. 87 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 38 (mean +/- S. E., n = 9) at 7. 5 degrees C. In five fibres, the linear extrapolation of low loads (0. 01 - 0. 05 P 0) showed that the Hill equation underestimated the true Viso by 6 %.
