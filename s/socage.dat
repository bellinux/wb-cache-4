25|$|<b>Socage,</b> a feudal {{tax system}} based on land rent.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the Great Reduction of 1680 in the {{following}} year the general government of Swedish Bremen-Verden revoked the enfeoffment of seignorial Himmelpforten to the Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt counts, so that Gustaf Mauritz Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt lost the Amt Himmelpforten to the Swedish crown. In 1681 two conventuals were still alive and received again their annuities. In 1684 the reestablished Bremen-Verden general government ordered a greater repair of the decayed former abbey church, and also the remaining convent buildings were restored to some extent, all carried out by the <b>socage</b> farmers. At that time the former Vorwerke were not run with the labour of the <b>socage</b> farmers any more, but all leased to tenants.|$|E
25|$|Porta Coeli never {{developed}} a sustainable farming of its own. Its landed estates and other revenue-yielding assets did not form a closed compound but were dispersed {{in the central}} and northeastern part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (Stade Geest and Bremian Elbe Marshes). Like many other nunneries Porta Coeli lived of feudal leases, tithes and other dues, earlier often in kind, such as also <b>socage</b> and serjeanty. Porta Coeli let out most of its farmland on <b>socage</b> to farmers, and ran only smaller and closer parts of all its lands through its Vorwerke using labour of farmers subject to serjeanty. The Vorwerke were managed by the (ad)vocate (Vogt). Besides his military task of protecting, his task was to prevent farmers from poaching, pasturing on nunnery's land, forbidden lumbering and peat-cutting and of pursuing culprits, collecting the dues and leases.|$|E
25|$|The former Vorwerk in Neuland {{comprised}} five buildings, {{a residential}} house, a bakehouse, a pigsty, a granary and a crop barn. It is recalled by the field name Vorwerk in Neuland. The Vorwerk at Horst {{was in fact}} located in Breitenwisch on a plot now covered by the Jarck Farm. The outlying former <b>socage</b> farms attached to the Vorwerk at Horst, located at bit more northwest of the Vorwerk now form the village of Horst upon Oste.|$|E
25|$|The main {{complaint}} {{made by the}} Baltringen peasants was {{the fact}} that they were serfs. They also requested the reduction of rents and annual duties in kind, as well as the abolition of death duty. Furthermore, they asked not to be burdened with <b>socage</b> any longer and to be allowed to utilise timber from the forests. They also opposed the little tithe but were prepared to pay great tithe in order to provide for the upkeep of their respective local priest.|$|E
25|$|Prince-Archbishop Valdemar confederated {{with the}} free peasants of Stedingen, a region within the Prince-Archbishopric whose {{inhabitants}} rejected to be subjected as serfs, sparing them from <b>socage.</b> Earlier Burchard, then still provost of the Bremian Chapter, had failed to subject the free peasants by military means. This weakness provoked his mother's cousin Count Maurice I of the neighbouring Oldenburg to subject them and annex Stedingen – also in vain. The free peasants of Stedingen agreed to provide Prince-Archbishop Valdemar with mercenaries, who in return retained any further attack on their freedom.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter {{the three}} men {{formally}} seized the convent in favour of the new Jesuit college founded in Stade in order to Catholicise the local population. Jesuit Father Kalkhoven literally appropriated the abbatial ring, the kitchen pothook, the keys of the convent, and a sod from the convent garden, representing its landed estates. Kalkhoven also took possession of the Lutheran former abbey church by ceremonially posing his hands over the altar. Already on 26July/ 5August 1630O.S./N.S. <b>socage</b> farmers from Himmelpforten had been gathered {{in order to make}} them render homage to their new lord, the Society of Jesus. Kalkhoven then usurped the title of Provost of Himmelpforten. Kalkhoven appointed Erich Raschke as administrator, later expelled by the Swedes who took Himmelpforten in early May 1632.|$|E
25|$|Bibescu {{eventually}} abdicated {{during the}} Wallachian Revolution of 1848. Vulpache fled the country, returning after pacification with the Imperial Russian Army, which controlled part of Bucharest, and serving {{for a while}} as Minister of the Interior. His father stayed behind in Bucharest. As the revolutionary government fell and Cantacuzino, as Caimacam, inaugurated a conservative regime, he was reappointed to the school board alongside Poenaru, Băleanu, and, from 1851, Apostol Arsache and Ion Emanuel Florescu. While there, he ordered budget cuts, sacking teachers {{who had participated in}} the Revolution and were unrepentant. His son, as Secretary of State, carried out the order, and, as records of the time suggest, the number of active schools dropped rapidly. Meanwhile, Vulpea was also given a position on a committee which evaluated the agrarian issue. Composed of conservatives, it outlined the standard alternative to land reform, suggesting a gradual termination of <b>socage</b> and corvée through boyar–peasant contracts.|$|E
2500|$|... one farm in Hammah, however, {{subject to}} <b>socage</b> and dues to the (ad)vocate of Vörde (today's Bremervörde) ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{enfeoffment}} of Count Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt {{with the}} former convent this seigniorial entity with its three Vorwerke, its <b>socage</b> farmers and revenues from dues and fines in its jurisdictions was called the Amt Himmelpforten. The last Convent Scribe Erich Everdt Gröning(k) officiated as administrator of the Amt between 1658 and 1663, in 1663 and 1666 his sons Franz and then Heinrich Gröning became Himmelpforten's first bailiffs (Amtmann/Amtleute [...] ). The term convent continued to be in use, but referred more to the buildings and the pertaining glebe and <b>socage</b> farms than to the wider administrative subdivision, also including neighbouring villages (Breitenwisch, Großenwörden, Horst upon Oste) subject to the former convent's jurisdiction and to dues to be collected.|$|E
2500|$|The Vorwerk farm {{buildings}} on Stubbenkamp, a main timber-framed building measuring Bremian ft 236 (...) times Bremian ft 50 (...) and a barn measuring Bremian ft 120 (...) times Bremian ft 50, were demolished in 1717, subsequently {{the site was}} let out on <b>socage</b> to a farmer. At the Stubbenkamp Vorwerk and at the Diekenbrook plot there were stewponds for the fish as fasting dishes at lent.|$|E
2500|$|In later years, {{the feature}} of tenure of frankalmoin which {{attracted}} {{the notice of}} lawyers was {{the absence of any}} service that could be enforced by the secular courts. Grants from the Crown “in free, pure and perpetual alms” would be free from all secular service. However, if a mesne lord was involved, then services such as <b>socage,</b> fee and other services might be extracted from the land, either in part or in total.|$|E
2500|$|The provost also wielded {{the summary}} {{jurisdiction}} in Porta Coeli's temporal judicature precinct. Furthermore the provost held the ius collationis in the Hechthausen parish. Besides the provost {{there was also}} a (ad)vocate (...) , exerting military protection, managing the Vorwerke, and exercising police function in the convent's jurisdictions. Each nun, and later each conventual, had a home of her own, with her personal maid. All feudal estates (Meierhöfe) in Eulsete (Himmelpforten) were let out on <b>socage</b> (Meierverhältnis) to farmers, and each comprised less land than a family needed for self-sustenance, so that the farmers, men and women alike, depended on work for the convent as farmhands and maids. The convent ran a village school, usually staffed with an educated schoolmaster, and therefore known for its higher standard than ordinary village schools.|$|E
2500|$|Vulpea later {{transferred}} to the Foreign Ministry. He had become especially powerful, but owed his influence to his [...] "absolute adherence to the Russian political line in Wallachia." [...] During the 1830s, he befriended Kiselyov's aide, Karneev, who was passionate about coin collecting. Vulpea fed this hobby by providing the Russian with coins dug up at Caracal and elsewhere, which Karneev transported to his museum in Saint Petersburg. Meanwhile, however, Vulpea continued his marginal contribution to the nationalist project when, as Logothete, he donated [...] "a years' worth" [...] of estates' <b>socage</b> to Câmpineanu's Philharmonic Society, and allegedly wanted to have Wallachia ruled by a foreign prince, as a guarantee against Russian and Ottoman interference. He also continued to have fights with the other boyars, especially so in 1835, when he asked treasurers Câmpineanu and Iancu Filipescu-Buzatu for a refund of his alleged expenses and damages incurred in 1821, which he claimed ran at 287,000 thaler.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Sam absently. He {{was finding}} Widgery stiff reading. He had {{just got to}} the bit about Raptu Haeredis, which--as of course you know, is a writ for taking away an heir holding in <b>socage.</b>|$|E
60|$|But nothing {{called for}} redress {{more than the}} {{disorders}} in the king's own household. It was considered as an incident annexed to their tenure, that the <b>socage</b> vassals of the crown, and so of all the subordinate barons, should receive their lord and all his followers, and supply them in their progresses and journeys, which custom continued for some ages after in Ireland, {{under the name of}} coshering. But this indefinite and ill-contrived charge on the tenant was easily perverted to an instrument of much oppression by the disorders of a rude and licentious court; insomuch that the tenants, in fear for their substance, for the honor of their women, and often for their lives, deserted their habitations and fled into the woods on the king's approach. No circumstance could be more dishonorable to a prince; but happily, like many other great abuses, it gave rise to a great reform, which went much further than its immediate purposes. This disorder, which the punishment of offenders could only palliate, was entirely taken away by commuting personal service for a rent in money; which regulation, passing from the king to all the inferior lords, in a short time wrought a great change {{in the state of the}} nation. To humble the great men, more arbitrary methods were used. The adherence to the title of Robert was a cause, or a pretence, of depriving many of their vast possessions, which were split or parcelled out amongst the king's creatures, with great injustice to particulars, but in the consequences with general and lasting benefit. The king held his courts, according to the custom, at Christmas and Easter, but he seldom kept both festivals in the same place. He made continual progresses into all parts of his kingdom, and brought the royal authority and person home to the doors of his haughty barons, which kept them in strict obedience during his long and severe reign.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not without}} some emotion that he looked upon the scene around him, for, {{in spite of his}} secluded life, he knew enough of the ancient greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they had held undisputed and {{paramount}} sway over all that tract of country. His father could trace his pure Saxon lineage back to that Godfrey Malf who had held the manors of Bisterne and of Minstead at the time when the Norman first set mailed foot upon English soil. The afforestation of the district, however, and its conversion into a royal demesne had clipped off a large section of his estate, while other parts had been confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive Saxon rising. The fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his descendants. During three hundred years their domains had gradually contracted, sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment, and sometimes through such gifts to the Church as that with which Alleyne's father had opened the doors of Beaulieu Abbey to his younger son. The importance of the family had thus dwindled, but they still retained the old Saxon manor-house, with a couple of farms and a grove large enough to afford pannage to a hundred pigs--"sylva de centum porcis," [...] as the old family parchments describe it. Above all, the owner of the soil could still hold his head high as the veritable Socman of Minstead--that is, as holding the land in free <b>socage,</b> with no feudal superior, and answerable to no man lower than the king. Knowing this, Alleyne felt some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been associated. He pushed on the quicker, twirling his staff merrily, and looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old Saxon residence. He was suddenly arrested, however, by the appearance of a wild-looking fellow armed with a club, who sprang out from behind a tree and barred his passage. He was a rough, powerful peasant, with cap and tunic of untanned sheepskin, leather breeches, and galligaskins round legs and feet.|$|E
60|$|This {{custom of}} an annual {{property}} probably continued amongst the Germans {{as long as}} they remained in their own country; but when their conquests carried them into other parts, another object besides the possession of the land arose, which obliged them to make a change in this particular. In the distribution of the conquered lands, the ancient possessors of them became an object of consideration, and the management of these became one of the principal branches of their polity. It was expedient towards holding them in perfect subjection, that they should be habituated to obey one person, and that a kind of cliental relation should be created between them; therefore the land, with the slaves, and the people in a state next to slavery, annexed to it, was bestowed for life in the general distribution. When life-estates were once granted, it seemed a natural consequence that inheritances should immediately supervene. When a durable connection is created between a certain man and a certain portion of land by a possession for his whole life, and when his children have grown up and have been supported on that land, it seems so great an hardship to separate them, and to deprive thereby the family of all means of subsisting, that nothing could be more generally desired nor more reasonably allowed than an inheritance; and this reasonableness was strongly enforced by the great change wrought in their affairs when life-estates were granted. Whilst according to the ancient custom lands were only given for a year, there was a rotation so quick that every family came in its turn to be easily provided for, and had not long to wait; but the children of a tenant for life, when they lost the benefit of their father's possession, saw themselves as it were immured upon every side by the life-estates, and perceived no reasonable hope of a provision from any new arrangement. These inheritances began very early in England. By a law of King Alfred it appears that they were then of a very ancient establishment: and as such inheritances were intended for great stability, they fortified them by charters; and therefore they were called Book-land. This was done with regard to the possession of the better sort: the meaner, who were called ceorles, if they did not live in a dependence on some thane, held their small portions of land as an inheritance likewise,--not by charter, but by a sort of prescription. This was called Folk-land. These estates of inheritance, both the greater and the meaner, were not fiefs; they were to all purposes allodial, and had hardly a single property of a feud; they descended equally to all the children, males and females, according to the custom of gavelkind, a custom absolutely contrary to the genius of the feudal tenure; and whenever estates were granted in the later Saxon times by the bounty of the crown with an intent that they should be inheritable, so far were they from being granted with the complicated load of all the feudal services annexed, that in all the charters of that kind which subsist they are bestowed with a full power of alienation, et liberi ab omni seculari gravamine. This was the general condition of those inheritances which were derived from the right of original conquest, as well to all the soldiers as to the leader; and these estates, as it is said, were not even forfeitable, no, not for felony, as if that were in some sort the necessary consequence of an inheritable estate. So far were they from resembling a fief. But there were other possessions which bore a nearer resemblance to fiefs, at least in their first feeble and infantile state of the tenure, than, those inheritances which were held by an absolute right in the proprietor. The great officers who attended the court, commanded armies, or distributed justice must necessarily be paid and supported; but in what manner could they be paid? In money they could not, because there was very little money then in Europe, and scarce any part of that little came into the prince's coffers. The only method of paying them was by allotting lands for their subsistence whilst they remained in his service. For this reason, in the original distribution, vast tracts of land were left {{in the hands of the}} king. If any served the king in a military command, his land may be said to have been in some sort held by knight-service. If the tenant was in an office about the king's person, this gave rise to sergeantry; the persons who cultivated his lands may be considered as holding by <b>socage.</b> But the long train of services that made afterwards the learning of the tenures were then not thought of, because these feuds, if we may so call them, had not then come to be inheritances,--which circumstance of inheritance gave rise to the whole feudal system. With the Anglo-Saxons the feuds continued to the last but a sort of pay or salary of office. The trinoda necessitas, so much spoken of, which was to attend the king in his expeditions, and to contribute to the building of bridges and repair of highways, never bound the lands by way of tenure, but as a political regulation, which equally affected every class and condition of men and every species of possession.|$|E
50|$|Land {{was subject}} to feudal tenure and could be held in allod or fief, the latter coming in two {{distinct}} forms—either free <b>socage</b> (seigneurie) or villein <b>socage</b> (roture). Free <b>socage</b> was considered 'noble' (but the owner {{did not have to}} be a member of the nobility) and the latter 'peasant'.|$|E

As feudalism declined, the prevalence of <b>socage</b> tenure increased until it became the normal form of tenure in the Kingdom of England. In 1660, the Statute of Tenures ended the remaining forms of military service and all freehold tenures were converted into <b>socage.</b>|$|E

50|$|The main {{demands of}} the peasants were the {{abolition}} of hunting privileges, the abolition of <b>socage,</b> the prohibition of the conversion of contributions in kind into financial interest by the lords or Saxon district offices.

50|$|Under feudal tenure, a fief {{could not}} be owned {{outright}} but was instead divided into competing interests known as estates in land; thus, a single tract of land could be held both in villein <b>socage</b> by a tenant and in free <b>socage</b> by {{the lord of the}} manor. Villein <b>socage</b> was subject to a number of real burdens and feudal incidents owed to the manorial landlord. For example, the Custom provided for the payment of an annual feu-duty (the cens) by villein socagers to the landlord as both revenue and as a token of submission. The entry fine (lods et ventes) was another mandatory payment, a conveyance fee for villein socages and amounting to a twelfth of the sales price, and derived from the feu-duty, as were other fees and the right of laudatio (retrait lignager).|$|E
