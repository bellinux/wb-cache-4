5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders.

The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Coordinating <b>sucking,</b> {{swallowing}} {{and breathing}} to achieve effective <b>sucking</b> {{is a complex}} process and even though <b>sucking</b> is essential for nutrition, {{little is known about}} sticking patterns after birth. Our objective was to study <b>sucking</b> patterns in healthy fullterm infants and to describe the age-specific variations. Method: We studied the <b>sucking</b> patterns of 30 healthy, fullterm infants longitudinally from 2 or 3 days after birth to 10 weeks of age. During this time we recorded five to seven feeding episodes that we assessed off-line with the Neonatal Oral-Motor Assessment Scale (NOMAS). Results: We found a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern on the second or third day after birth in 27 out of 30 infants. During the following weeks we found abnormal <b>sucking</b> patterns in 23 out of 171 feeding episodes (14 %) and normal patterns in 148 episodes (86 %). Altogether, between 38 and 50 weeks' postmenstrual age (10 weeks after birth), 10 infants displayed a deviating, arrhythmical <b>sucking</b> pattern. Dysfunctional <b>sucking</b> patterns and problems of coordinating <b>sucking,</b> swallowing and breathing did not occur. Birth weight, gestational age, type of labour and gender did not influence <b>sucking</b> patterns. Arrhythmical <b>sucking</b> was seen more often in bottle-fed infants. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that practically all healthy fullterm infants started off with a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern soon after birth. One-third of the infants displayed one or more deviating episodes up to the age of 10 weeks. Apart from bottle-feeding, no other factors were found that influenced <b>sucking</b> patterns.

To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether the development of <b>sucking</b> patterns in small-for-gestational age (SGA) preterm infants differs from appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) preterm infants. Study design We assessed <b>sucking</b> patterns in 15 SGA and 34 AGA preterms (gestational age Results SGA preterms developed a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern later than did AGA preterms (median, 50 versus 44 weeks PMA, P =. 002). At term-equivalent age, none of the SGA and 38 % of the AGA preterms showed normal <b>sucking</b> (P <. 05); at 48 to 50 weeks PMA this was 54 % and 81 %, respectively (P =. 064). Abnormal <b>sucking</b> including "incoordination'' and dysfunctional <b>sucking</b> were more prevalent in SGA preterms than in AGA preterms (median, 11 % versus 0 % per infant, P <. 05). A higher gestational age and z-score for birth weight were predictive of normal <b>sucking</b> at 50 weeks PMA. Conclusions SGA preterms developed a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern later than AGA preterms.

5|$|The walrus has {{a diverse}} and {{opportunistic}} diet, feeding {{on more than}} 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The walrus <b>sucks</b> the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant <b>sucks</b> water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E

40|$|The {{main part}} of this thesis sets out to study the {{sequential}} organisation of <b>sucking</b> during normal breast feeding. Data on breast feeding are scarce {{when compared with the}} large body of work on <b>sucking</b> during bottle feeding. One of the initial outcomes is that on the first breast, as compared with the second, <b>sucking</b> is slower overall. The widely-quoted dichotomy between nutritive and non-nutritive modes of <b>sucking</b> is not upheld. Rather, the organisation of <b>sucking</b> exhibits complete gradation between these two rhythms, and pausing is always a feature of <b>sucking</b> on the breast. <b>Sucking</b> patterns were also seen to change progressively through the feed, and attempts are made to account for these changes using several different approaches. <b>Sucking</b> patterns, in particular <b>sucking</b> rate, during breast feeding appear to be determined largely by the rate of milk flow rather than by the baby's hunger, fatigue or behavioural state, although the concurrent changes in milk composition cannot be ruled out since changes in milk flow and composition on the breast cannot be dissociated. However, the probability of the baby <b>sucking</b> at any one time is less strongly correlated with milk flow rate. An attempt is made to place the findings in their evolutionary and social context...|$|R

5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that <b>sucks</b> {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E

40|$|Thumb <b>sucking</b> is {{the process}} of <b>sucking</b> on the thumb for oral pleasure. Thumb and finger <b>sucking</b> habits, or nonnutritive <b>sucking,</b> are {{considered}} to be the most prevalent of oral habits. Some parents are concerned by thumb <b>sucking</b> and may even try to restrain the infant or child. In most cases, this is not necessary. Most children stop thumb <b>sucking</b> on their own. When older children continue to <b>suck</b> their thumbs, it could mean they are bored, anxious, or have emotional problems such as depression.
