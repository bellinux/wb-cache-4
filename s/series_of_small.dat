5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stages of the}} First World War the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable {{to operate in the}} narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. By 18 August 1914, two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium, the planning of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> coastal submarines had already begun.|$|E
5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{made his}} film debut {{as an extra}} in the 1933 film, The Private Life of Henry VIII, which starred Charles Laughton in the title role; Terry-Thomas {{continued}} to undertake a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> and uncredited film roles while his reputation grew on radio and television.

They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{water levels}} in the moors and levels are {{controlled}} by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> narrow canals called rhynes (known as 'rhines' in Avonmouth and Gloucestershire - both are pronounced 'reens'). along with larger drains, gates and pumping stations. The rhynes are often used as field boundary ditches instead of hedges. Some parts are allowed to flood in winter. The area is mainly used for grazing but some peat extraction is carried out.|$|E

George Lake lies between Ruth Lake and Beaufort Lake.|$|R
5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken in a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate {{to side with}} Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by {{the representatives of the}} two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E
5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 22 August, a force of eight Fireflies and six bomb-armed Hellcats from Indefatigable raided Kaafjord again. This {{was the first in}} what was {{intended}} to be a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> harassing attacks conducted to wear down the German defences. German forces did not detect the aircraft before they arrived over Kaafjord at 7:10 pm, and the Fireflies' strafing attacks on German gun positions killed one member of Tirpitzs crew and wounded ten. However, the Hellcats' bombs failed to inflict any damage on the battleship. The British fighters also attacked German ships and radar stations on their return flight, damaging two tankers, a supply ship and a patrol boat. No British aircraft were lost during this raid.|$|E

5|$|Geologists {{classify}} {{the falls}} at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend in a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> steps, forming waterfalls that {{are said to}} resemble a wedding cake. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is grey sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, with a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle {{much smaller than the}} other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Junius, the route follows an {{alignment}} parallel to that of the Thruway as it passes south of a large housing development and by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> lakes collectively known as Junius Ponds. NY318 continues on, passing through a mixture of forested areas and cultivated fields as it heads eastward through the town. Just past an intersection with Nine Foot Road (County Route108 or CR108), NY318 serves the Waterloo Premium Outlets, a large collection of outlet stores situated between NY318 and the Thruway. Past the outlet mall, the route continues through largely rural surroundings to the community of Stone Church Corner, where it briefly curves to the northeast before veering back to the east as it enters the town of Tyre.|$|E

5|$|On January 10, 1910, the Tanana Tribune {{was absorbed}} by the News-Miner. The owners of the Tribune {{received}} shares in the News-Miner (which were later bought back by Thompson), {{and one of the}} Tribune's owners received its printing plant, which was moved to Tacoma, Washington. In 1911, Thompson feared the declining state of the Fairbanks economy and decided to leave Alaska. He sold his shares in the company, but returned after several months absence and demanded the shares back. Los Bernard, who briefly served as the paper's publisher, returned the shares to Thompson, who resumed his role as publisher and editor. Thompson's return coincided with a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> gold discoveries at Livengood and Shushanna that boosted the Fairbanks economy, as gold-seekers bought supplies in the town.|$|E
5|$|Past Duck Pond, {{the route}} {{turned to the}} southeast, passing by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> ponds and {{crossing}} under an old railroad grade as it ran along {{the base of a}} series of peaks known as the Loon Lake Mountains. NY99 continued to follow the range to the northwestern edge of Loon Lake, where it veered to the northeast and ran along the northern and eastern shores of the lake to the hamlet of Loon Lake at its southeastern tip. NY99 passed generally northwest–southeast through the small lakeside community before reentering another sparsely developed area of the town of Franklin. The highway progressed southeastward, crossing over the northern branch of the Saranac River and passing through the largely undeveloped community of Merrillsville before ending at an intersection with NY3.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
