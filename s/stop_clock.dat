50|$|Electronic {{timekeeping}} had {{debuted in}} alpine skiing at the previous Winter Olympics. Omega and Longines were the official timekeepers of the 1968 Games. The {{reliability of the}} timing had athletes on their toes when they completed their performances. The most notable incident of the 1968 Winter Olympics which involved electronic timing took place with the women's alpine skiing giant slalom event. Canada's Nancy Greene had skied a perfect race, but when she turned {{around to look at}} the <b>stop</b> <b>clock,</b> the numbers were still moving. It took two or three seconds to correct the <b>stop</b> <b>clock</b> malfunction. Greene thought originally that the officials missed her time, causing her blood pressure to rise to the point that she had a headache for two days. Her margin of victory was 3.24 seconds over France's Annie Famose.|$|E

50|$|The ECSL {{is played}} under International Ice Hockey Federation rules and {{incorporates}} some modifications from Ice Hockey Australia {{as well as}} some of its own special rules. Games are played with three twenty minute running time periods with only the last five minutes using a <b>stop</b> <b>clock.</b> Team rosters must have at least 40% of their players aged 25-and-under. Players aged 23 or older are limited to playing five Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL) games. Once they have exceeded this limit they are not permitted to return to the ECSL until the following season. There is no cap on the number of AIHL games a player under the age of 23 can play. The minimum age for players to compete in the ECSL is 17. Midget-aged players playing in both the ECSL and in Midget competition must prioritise Midget competition if there is a schedule clash. Full-time rostered players must have competed in a minimum of seven ECSL regular season games to be eligible for the playoffs. Players competing in either the AIHL or a Midget competition must have played a minimum of five games in the ECSL and seven games in their other league to be eligible for the playoffs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Verilog is {{the most}} widely used {{hardware}} description language. It can be used in the modeling, synthesis, and simulation stages of the hardware system designing. This thesis is about applying Verilog HDL to design the multifunctional electronic timing system. This system has brought about the timing function, the Alarm clock function, the time checking module, the <b>stop</b> <b>clock</b> module, the exact hour alarming module, the alarm clock’s shielding and alarming function module and the <b>stop</b> <b>clock</b> Prompting function module. The modules which have applied this design can be transplanted to other kinds of electronic control systems conveniently. This system uses the Verilog HDL to design, so {{it has nothing to do}} with the craft. It allows us to attain the applicable actual circuit easily without considering much about the details of the gate level and the realization of the craft in the function designing stage and the logic verification stage. We just need to exert different conditions according to the demand of the design of the system...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the effects of variability of training on the acquisition of motor skill of closed loop type tracking task using Rotary Pursuit, and to determine if there was a bilateral transfer effect to the non-dominant hand following practice with the dominant hand. Twelve healthy vol-unteer students (5 males and 7 females, aged 25 to 37) were randomly divided into a constant practice group and a variable practice group. A photoelectric rotary pursuit apparatus with <b>stop</b> <b>clock</b> and repeat cycle timer by Lafayette Instrumentation Co. was used for this study. Rotary pursuit is a closed loop task in which a subject attempts to keep a photoelectric stylus on a lighted target in motion. Subjects per-formed the clockwise circular pursuit task while standing. Experimental procedure was divided into three sessions, namely, pre-test, training, and post-test. The constant group practiced all 60 trials at 30 rpm. Variable practice group did a varied practice session with 15 trials at speeds of 20 rpm, 26 rpm, 34 rpm, and 46 rpm. No one in either group practiced with their non-dominant arm. A Mann-Whitney test and a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test were used for statistical analyses. The results of this study showed no differ-ent training effect between groups on the post-test with the dominant hand. However, bilateral transfer ef-fect of rotary pursuit task between hands was demonstrated. Possible mechanisms are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Government {{targets to}} reduce waiting times are putting {{enormous}} pressures on outpatient services. The implementation of an electronic care records service (CRS) at our hospital in 2008 {{has led to}} widespread press coverage of ensuing chaos in clinical administration. We {{wanted to know how}} this new electronic system impacted on our working patterns in outpatient clinics and – more specifically – on the time actually spent with the patients. Material & methods: This study was performed 4 and 12 months after implementation of CRS to assess its impact on the time distribution in clinic. Senior doctors were monitored with a <b>stop</b> <b>clock</b> during consultations. Timings for pre- and post-consultation administration, and the actual consultation with the patient were recorded. A total of 170 consultations were evaluated in this way. Results: The key findings were that the total time needed to spend on a urological outpatient of 16 minutes remains unchanged from the pre-CRS era, but a majority (57 %) of this time is spent in administration on the computer without the patient involved. Conclusion: No more than 15 patients should be seen in a 4 hour outpatient clinic per doctor. This recommendation drawn up by BAUS before CRS remains still valid. Patient administration related to the consultation that has previously been done by administrative aides is now to be done by the doctors on the computer in the same consultation session. Intended to streamline patient pathways, this does reduce the quality interaction-time between doctor and patients significantly...|$|E
