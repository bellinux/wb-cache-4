40|$|The TF coils for ITER {{will use}} {{the concept of a}} {{circular}} thin walled Nb 3 Sn cable in conduit superconductor completely enclosed in an insulated groove in steel plates to form the coil pancakes. These are then stacked together to form the winding pack and supported by a AISI 316 LN stainless steel case. The concept is being demonstrated by the fabrication of a racetrack shaped model coil (TFMC) which is designed to operate mecanically, electrically and hydraulically in conditions representative for the ITER T F coils. For this purpose the TFMC will be assembled in the TOSKA facility at FZK Karlsruhe, together with the EURATOM LCT coil which provides an external field. The objectives of the TFMC are as follows: • to develop and verify the full scale TF coil manufacturing techniques; • to establish realistic manufacturing tolerances; • to bench-mark methods for the ITER TF coil acceptance; • to gain information on the coil's behaviour, operating margins and in-service monitoring techniques. The TFMC is actually in an advanced <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> Thus {{a large part of the}} first three objectives is reached.

40|$|Abstract—Rotating {{stages in}} semiconductor, display {{industry}} {{and many other}} fields require challenging accuracy to perform their functions properly. Especially, Axis of rotation error on rotary system is significant; such as the spindle error motion of the aligner, wire bonder and inspector machine which result in the poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> goods. To evaluate and improve the performance of such precision rotary stage, unessential movements on the other 5 degrees of freedom of the rotary stage must be measured and analyzed. In this paper, we have measured the three translations and two tilt motions of a rotating stage with high precision capacitive sensors. To obtain the radial error motion from T. I. R (Total Indicated Reading) of radial direction, we have used Donaldson’s reversal technique. And the axial components of the spindle tilt error motion can be obtained accurately from the axial direction outputs of sensors by Estler face motion reversal technique. Further more we have defined and measured the sensitivity of positioning error to the five error motions. Keywords—Donaldson’s reversal methods, Estler face motion reversal method, Error motion, sensitivity, T. I. R (Total Indicated Reading) ...|$|R

2500|$|The art {{historian}} Nikolaus Pevsner {{has said that}} exhibits in the Great Exhibition showed [...] "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, {{the integrity of the}} surface" [...] and [...] "vulgarity in detail". Design reform began with the organisers of the Exhibition itself, Henry Cole (1808–1882), Owen Jones (1809–1874), Matthew Digby Wyatt (1820–1877) and Richard Redgrave (1804–1888), who deprecated excessive ornament and impractical and badly made things. The organisers were [...] "unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits." [...] Owen Jones, for example, complained that [...] "the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter" [...] produce [...] "in art novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence." [...] From these criticisms <b>of</b> the contemporary <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's Supplementary Report on Design (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for [...] "more logic in the application of decoration." [...] Other works followed in a similar vein: Wyatt's Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century (1853), Gottfried Semper's Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst ("Science, Industry and Art") (1852), Ralph Wornum's Analysis of Ornament (1856), Redgrave's Manual of Design (1876) and Jones's Grammar of Ornament (1856). The Grammar of Ornament was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.|$|R
