5000|$|Justine Braisaz {{made her}} Biathlon World Cup debut on 12 December 2014 in Hochfilzen (2014/2015 season), Norway. She ranked 17th in the sprint, {{becoming}} the youngest athlete {{in the world}} top 20. The next day she placed 9th in the relay with her French team mates; Marine Bolliet, Enora Latuillière and Anaïs Bescond. A week later, she improved her best performance by finishing 14th in the Pokljuka sprint and managed {{to qualify for the}} Mass Start with the top 30 biathletes.

5000|$|The Horizon {{was named}} by CNET's editors [...] "Best of CES PCs and Tablets" [...] for 2013. CNET stated, [...] "Lenovo's Horizon Table PC {{received}} the award in the PCs and tablets category {{because it offers}} multiple new ways to use a computer, including {{a new way to}} integrate a PC into your home. It inspires conversation and some new thinking, and for that the Horizon deserves recognition." [...] In a review, Alex Roth of TechRader wrote, [...] "When you like at it as an all-in-one, the Lenovo Horizon Table PC isn't so niche. Packing everything inside that 27-inch touch display for the sort of simple, elegant presentation we usually see from Apple. While the reclined mode is the most fun, it's also the least practical. If you've got the space, {{it would be a great}} way to share vacation photos or play a board game or two. The fact that Lenovo has garnered support from EA Games and Ubisoft, giants of the gaming space, has us hopeful that more apps will be designed for this unique device. Finally, it's not terribly expensive either, at least for the lower end version. i3 configurations <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>only</b> $999, so even if you're not running your own graphic design firm, the Horizon Table PC isn't out of your reach." ...|$|E

25|$|One reason Olympic runners Cram and Coe {{found the}} {{challenge}} so tough {{is that they}} <b>started</b> <b>at</b> {{the middle of one}} side of the court, thereby having to negotiate four right-angle turns.

40|$|UnrestrictedAutism is a {{disorder}} that affects a child's development in social interaction and communication. Children with autism also have limited interests or suffer from repetitive behaviors. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{one in every}} 150 children is born with autism. It is the fastest growing developmental disability in the United States.; The autism diagnosis, however, {{is in no way}} a death sentence. Irma Martinez is a notary public from Compton, CA. She has two sons with husband Carlos Martinez, an embroiderer. Her younger son, Christian, was recently diagnosed with autism. He went from being non-verbal to talking all the time.; His long journey to finding his voice took three years of therapy which <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>only</b> two years old.

50|$|This idea is used {{explicitly}} in {{the method}} for drawing phase diagrams.

40|$|The new {{theories}} of Complexity {{arise from the}} description of deterministic problems in Mechanics and other areas such as Biology, Economics and Meteorology as nonlinear equations [1] [2]. Analysis of non-linear equations tells us that very complex motion can result from very simple equations. Behaviour that looks quite random can result from deterministic equations, with substantially different outcomes by <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>only</b> minutely different inputs. This behaviour {{is referred to as}} chaotic. The fundamental problem in human affairs is to predict consequences of our actions. Hence is it important to know when such aperiodic disturbed behaviour can occur. The problem of software project management is one which has been a fertile ground for substantial investigation over the years. Much data has been accumulated about the level and scope of problems based on cost, delays and accumulated errors in the software products produced. This is not the primary cause of the problem but only the effects. Abdel-Hamid & Madnick [3] and others have used System Dynamics to investigate a dynamic model of the behaviour of the management process. System Dynamics wa...|$|R

3000|$|Overall, {{the model}} {{reasonably}} predicts votes from submitter’s fans and non-fans, but {{is much less}} accurate for votes from other fans. One reason for this difference is the {{relatively small number of}} other fan votes while a story is upcoming. Specifically, the number of other fans F <b>starts</b> <b>at</b> zero. <b>Only</b> a vote by a non-fan can increase F, and upcoming stories have low visibility to non-fan voters. Even after a number of other fans becomes available, it takes some time for those users to return to Digg.

Just as the 1967 Browns returned to the playoffs following a one-year absence, so, too, did the '71 club, which was in its first season under new head coach Nick Skorich after Blanton Collier's final team in 1970 had finished just 7-7, ending a string of three consecutive postseason berths.|$|R
