50|$|Telemark skiing, or teleskiing, is a skiing {{technique}} that combines elements of Alpine and Nordic skiing. Telemark skiing {{is named after}} the Telemark region of Norway, where the discipline originated. Sondre Norheim is often credited for first demonstrating the turn in ski races, which included cross country, slalom and jumping, in Norway around 1868. Sondre Norheim also experimented with ski and binding design, introducing <b>side</b> <b>cuts</b> to <b>skis</b> and heel bindings (like a cable).|$|R
50|$|The Spatula was a ski {{manufactured}} by Volant skis from 2001 to 2003. It {{was the first}} production ski to feature reverse camber as well as reverse <b>side</b> <b>cut.</b> The <b>ski</b> was initially envisioned by professional freeskier Shane McConkey as early as 1996, and he convinced the company to manufacture the first prototypes {{in the summer of}} 2001. The Spatula gained a cult following, and along with its successor the K2 Pontoon (2006), inspired other ski manufacturers to experiment with a variety of camber shapes.|$|R

50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of jack rafters. This corresponds to the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|R
50|$|If a right {{triangle}} has two angles that equal 45° {{then the two}} sides are equidistant. The rafter is the hypotenuse and the legs or catheti of the triangle are the top wall plates of the structure. The <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> is located at the intersection of the given pitch column and the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of the hip/valley row. The regular hip/valley rafter runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and jack rafters have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.The <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of the hip/valley rafter = (Tangent)(12) = <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> in inches. The <b>side</b> <b>cuts</b> in the rafter table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devises use 90° as 0° in construction. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used with tools like the speed square.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to use the}} square tool, construction calculators are also used to verify and determine roofing calculations. Some are programmed to calculate all <b>side</b> <b>cuts</b> for hip, valley and jack regular rafters to be exactly 45° for all rafter pitches. The rafter table is expressed in inches, and the higher the numerical value of the pitch, the greater the difference between <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> angles within a given pitch. Only a level roof, or a 0 pitch will require a 45° angle <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> (cheek cut) for hip and jack rafters.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to report the visual, refractive, and wound healing pattern {{outcomes}} of femtosecond assisted deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) compared to the conventional manual technique. DALK was performed on 50 eyes of 47 advanced keratoconus patients. The patients were divided into two groups, 25 eyes each, depending on whether femtosecond assisted or manual DALK technique was performed for the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of the procedure only. Patients were followed up at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year for visual acuity, clinical refraction, corneal cylinder, date of suture removal, and <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> corneal healing pattern according to new grading classification of the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> scar (Grade 0 = transparent scar, 1 = faint healing opacity, 2 = evident healing opacity, 3 = significant opacity with some cosmetic imbalance, and 4 = highly significant opacity with very significant cosmetic imbalance). Outcomes are reported at one year. In conclusion, femtosecond assisted and manual DALK show comparable visual and refractive outcomes but femtosecond assisted DALK shows more evident corneal wound healing patterns at the <b>side</b> <b>cut.</b> This observation may indicate that an activated cornea wound healing might allow earlier suture removal when femtosecond technology is used to perform the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> for DALK...|$|R

50|$|Ski {{design has}} evolved {{enormously}} since {{the beginnings of}} the modern sport in mid-19th-century Norway. Modern skis typically have steel edges, camber, <b>side</b> <b>cut,</b> and possibly reverse camber. During the 1990s <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> became more pronounced {{to make it easier to}} carve turns. Alpine skis typically have fixed-heel bindings. Specialised types of alpine skis exist for certain uses, including twin-tip skis for freestyle skiing, alpine touring ski, and monoski.|$|R

5000|$|In 1813, the U.S. Federal Government {{purchased}} from James Gibbons 12 acre in Gibbonsville, in 1828 another 30 acre, along with later purchases from S. S. Wandell and others. This land {{was used as}} the site for the Watervliet Arsenal, founded in 1813 during the War of 1812, it is the oldest Federal arsenal in the country; and is the sole manufacturing facility for large caliber cannon. John C. Heenan, U.S. heavyweight boxing champion and contender for the world title in 1860, was once employed at the Arsenal. The main route of the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany ran through Watervliet, and because the canal bypassed the city of Troy, the business community of Troy decided that a [...] "short cut" [...] was needed for convenient access to the Erie Canal without having to go through the Albany Basin. A side-cut to the Hudson was located at Watervliet's present-day 23rd Street (the Upper <b>Side</b> <b>cut)</b> finished in 1823, and another just south of the Arsenal (the Lower <b>Side</b> <b>cut).</b> A weigh station and a center for paying canal boat operators was located here as well. As a result of canal boat crews being paid {{at the end of their}} trip, the areas around the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> was once famous for gambling, saloons, and prostitution; there were more than 25 saloons within two blocks, with names like The Black Rag and Tub of Blood. The neighborhood around the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> had the nickname of [...] "Barbary Coast of the East", Buffalo being the [...] "Barbary Coast of the West". In the 1880s, Watervliet had a reputation for over 100 fights a day and a body once in the week in the Canal.|$|R
