25|$|Directly east {{of these}} areas, the weather becomes much harsher: {{precipitation}} drops to between 150 and 300mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao {{is a couple}} hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5°C warmer, rising up to 35°C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is −35°C, {{and it is not}} uncommon to see <b>some</b> <b>nights</b> 10°C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below −20°C every once in a while.|$|E
25|$|Amsterdam {{is famous}} for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many cafés (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy.

A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable.

The Paradiso, Melkweg and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on <b>some</b> <b>nights.</b> Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape, Air, John Doe and Club Abe.

500|$|After the Fear of the Dark Tour, Dickinson {{decided to}} leave Iron Maiden to {{concentrate}} on his solo career. At that point the band had already booked a following tour in 1993, which Dickinson did not enjoy. Throughout the tour, Dickinson drew {{a lot of criticism}} from his bandmates, with Steve Harris in particular saying, [...] "I really wanted to kill him." [...] According to Harris, Dickinson would only perform when the press was there, [...] whereas at other concerts he would only mumble his way through songs. Dickinson has since denied the accusations that he was deliberately under-performing, arguing {{that it was impossible to}} give a decent performance <b>some</b> <b>nights</b> because of the atmosphere. His last performance with the band was filmed by the BBC at Pinewood Studios and released as a live video, entitled Raising Hell.|$|E

It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared <b>some</b> <b>nights</b> ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'.
