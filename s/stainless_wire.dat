[...] The active elements, owing to mechanical activation, react with {{the surface of}} the materials generally considered difficult to solder without premetallization. The active solders can be protected against excessive oxidation of their active element by addition of rare earth elements with higher affinity to oxygen (typically Ce, La). Another common additive is Ga - usually introduced as a wetting promoter. Mechanical activation, needed for active soldering, can be performed by brushing (for example with use of <b>stainless</b> <b>wire</b> brush or steel spatula) or ultrasonic vibration (20 - 60 kHz). Active soldering has been shown to effectively bond ceramics, aluminium, titanium, silicon, graphite and carbon nanotube based structures [...] at temperatures lower than 450 °C or use of protective atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The <b>stainless</b> <b>wire</b> braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|E

5000|$|A {{standard}} channel letter is a three-dimensional graphic sign element. Its channel is fabricated from sheet metal, most often aluminum since {{it will not}} rust. A flat sheet of aluminum is typically cut on a table by a computer-controlled router, laser, or water jet, based on a vector-based art file (.cdr, [...]eps, [...]ai, [...]scv, [...]sci, or [...]fs). This creates {{the back of the}} channel and is the basis for the letter shape. The sides of the channel letter, called the returns, are then formed by bending a 3 to 6 in [...] of aluminum sheet around the aluminum back. This return can be welded at the seam or flanged and riveted or, with a metal stitcher, can be fastened with galvanized or <b>stainless</b> <b>wire</b> to the back to create a solid can {{in the shape of the}} letter. The letter can is painted and fitted with any lighting components necessary such as neon gas tubes or light-emitting diode (LED) modules. A translucent plastic face usually of 3/16" [...] thick sheet acrylic fiber or polycarbonate is cut to fit the open face of the letter can. A [...] cap border is applied to its edges which gives the letter face a finished appearance and creates a fastening surface to attach it to the letter can.

25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often <b>stainless</b> steel <b>wire,</b> <b>stainless</b> steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid <b>stainless</b> steel <b>wire</b> {{is by far}} the most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSome robots {{often have}} to be made compact as they work in limited spaces, for example, in {{disaster}} rescue sites and operation theatres for surgery. One of the problems in downsizing the robots is how to fabricate the joints which are complicated and tend to be large. Coiled springs with high rectangular ratio recently have started to be used as the joint mechanism, because they are compact, easy to be bent, and able to convey strong twist force. However, these springs are now made by machining, resulting in low productivity and high cost. In this study, a new and inexpensive forming method is proposed, where a <b>stainless</b> <b>wire</b> is wound around into the shape of coiled spring, and subjected to upset in the spring axis direction. The finite element analysis was conducted for estimation of the work-hardening. The high work-hardening will realize the high yield stress, which is one of important features required for robot joints, as they must be used without plastic deformation. Based on the analysis, a series of experiments were carried out, and the formed springs were evaluated in terms of tension, torsion and bending characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} {{efficiency of}} ZnO nanoparticles in removal of organic pollutants deteriorates {{over time as}} {{a high percentage of}} the nanoparticles can be drained away by water during the wastewater treatment.
