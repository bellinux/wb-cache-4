2500|$|Personal {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{on the inner}} rear cover of the passport, which {{was covered with a}} <b>security</b> <b>laminate.</b> Details included were: ...|$|E
5000|$|From 27 November 2003, 'M' series {{passport}} issued, {{which included}} enhanced security features. The personal data page printed by ink-jet onto the adhesive {{surface of the}} <b>security</b> <b>laminate,</b> the laminate itself containing a holographic design.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, ‘L’ series {{passports}} introduced, with kangaroo motif <b>security</b> <b>laminate.</b> The {{personal data}} pages initially included a photograph and a cut out {{piece of paper}} with the holders signature under a sheet of adhesive laminate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} {{pages of a}} German {{passport}} are <b>security</b> <b>laminated</b> and the second page includes the following data: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Idea is {{exported}} in {{two different}} trim levels (the ELX with the 1.4-litre engine and the HLX with the 1.8 engine) and it has four airbags, anti-lock braking system with EBD; parking, rain and lights sensor, <b>security</b> <b>laminated</b> glass, the SkyDome, 15" [...] alloys, Bluetooth phone system, and leather seats among other features.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{a regular}} passport, the {{information}} pages in a Kinderreisepass are not <b>security</b> <b>laminated</b> (yet do have other security features) {{and have a}} different format. The information included {{is more or less}} the same, with the following differences: The type of passport is PC (Passport for children) instead of P (Passport). As in other passports, the main information page ends with a 2-line machine-readable code, according to ICAO standard 9303.|$|R
5000|$|In late June 2014, 'P' series {{passports}} issued with innovative {{security features}} {{that make it}} {{even more difficult to}} forge. They have an Australian flag blue with gold embossed cover, printed using the same technologies as Australian banknotes. Visible security features include a new <b>security</b> <b>laminate</b> with the world’s first colour floating image.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the {{interlayer}} provides three {{beneficial properties}} to laminated glass panes: first, the interlayer functions to distribute impact forces across a greater {{area of the}} glass panes, thus increasing the impact resistance of the glass; second, the interlayer functions to bind the resulting shards if the glass is ultimately broken; third the viscoelastic interlayer undergoes plastic deformation during impact and under static loads after impact, absorbing energy and reducing penetration by the impacting object as well as reducing {{the energy of the}} impact that is transmitted to impacting object, e.g. a passenger in a car crash. Thus, the benefits of laminated glass include safety and <b>security.</b> <b>Laminated</b> glass also has decorative applications. The interlayer can be colored or patterned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front cover}} of the {{temporary}} passport is clearly marked with the white band on {{the lower half of}} the cover to distinguish it from a regular passport. The temporary passport only has 16 pages as opposed to Pass 03, which has 32 pages. There is no polycarbonate card, a <b>laminated</b> <b>security</b> paper page with the personal information of the bearer. The temporary passport matches the international security standards for these types of documents and is machine readable.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of explosive}} {{can be regarded}} with different methods. A solid TNT model describes the explosive by solving a JWL Equation. An alternative method will be presented with a bubble with overpressure inside. This method will be compared with a solid TNT calculation and with experimental data. The calculation of an urban environment shows good correlation with experiments. The windows of trains are in most cases built with <b>laminated</b> <b>security</b> glass (LSG). There are different ways simulating LSG which vary {{in the number of}} elements through the thickness. The differences between a smeared model with two layers and models with three layers through the thickness loaded by an air blast load will be presented. JRC.
