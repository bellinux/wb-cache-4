Many ponies used by the military in Europe were left behind after the war, and in many cases they were slaughtered for food. The population declined during the war {{to such an extent that}} only four new fillies were registered in 1955. However, the post-war future of the Dales pony was preserved by a small group of breeders, who began to search for unregistered ponies of the proper type. The 1960s saw three Fell pony stallions interbred with Dale mares, to help save the breed. In 1964 the Dales Pony Society underwent reorganisation. At the same time, a [...] "Grading-Up Register" [...] was developed, with the aim of identifying and breeding ponies with characteristics of the original Dales type. The grading-up program was successful, and by 1971, populations had been rebuilt to the point that the program was discontinued. By the 1990s, the population had grown enough to allow some ponies to be exported – twelve to Canada in 1991 and four to the US in 1994. By 1999, there were 60 registered ponies in North America, and an estimated 800 worldwide.

50|$|Joypurhat was {{an area of}} Pala Empire & Sena dynasty from a long age. Till 16th and 17th centuries, {{there was}} no clear info about Joypurhat. In old age 'Baghabarihat(Bengali-বাঘাবাড়ীহাট)' was the local name of Joypurhat and Later 'Gopendraganjahat (Bengali-গোপেন্দ্রগঞ্জহাট)' was used in many archives. Once 'Lalbazar Thana(Bengali-লালবাজার থানা)' was {{established}} by containing the present Joypurhat Sadar Upazila and Panchbibi Upazila. The thana (upazila/sub-district) was located at east side of Small Jamuna River named 'Puranapoil (পুরানাপৈল)'. Then Puranapoil Union was known as 'Karimanagar(করিমনগর)'. Post office was established in Lalbazar Thana. The <b>sub-registry</b> office was in 'Nawabganj(নবাবগঞ্জ)' named place, east side of Akkelpur Railway Station. There were many 'NeelKuthi(নীলকুঠি)' established in this area. At that era Lalbazar Thana was a town. Then {{that was the only}} one work place of ordinary people for their livelihood. From Lalbazar Thana, Small Jamuna River gorge, the whole travel, commerce and trade were maintained. At that period Lalbazar Thana, Khetlal Upazila & Badalgachhi Upazila were contained by Dinajpur District. For being big size of Dinajpur District, Rangpur District & Rajshahi District a new district came out named Bogra District from the three districts. It was declared 1821. At that time Bogra District occupied by Adamdighi, Bogra Sadar, Sherpur from Rajshahi District; two upazila from Rangpur District and Khetlal Upazila, Badalgachhi Upazila, Lalbazar Thana from Dinajpur.Later in December 16, 1868, Lalbazar Police Thana was moved in 'Khasbaguri(খাসবাগুড়ী)'. The local name of Khasbabri was Panchbibi.In 1884, from Kolkata District to Jalpaiguri District in British Raj the rail way line established. Among this rail way line 8 railway station was built in the present Joypurhat District. In that time 'Baghabari(বাঘাবাড়ী)' was the local name of Joypurhat and Baghabari Railway Station was the name of Joypurhat Railway Station.After establishing the railway station the people gathered more in railway beside area more than the river beside area of Small Jamuna River. People in the surrounding villages of railway have increased gradually settled. Gradually the 'Khanjanapur (খঞ্জনপুর)' and 'Lalbazar Hat (লালবাজার হাট)' goes extinct. Baghabari Hat became famous. After Being popular area, the name of 'Baghabari Railway Station' was replaced by the name Joypurhat Railway Station. And from that the whole area are known to Joypurhat to all.|$|E
40|$|Despite strong {{beliefs that}} {{property}} titling and registration will enhance credit access, empirical {{evidence in support}} of such effects remains scant. The gradual roll-out of computerization of land registry systems across Andhra Pradesh’s 387 <b>sub-registry</b> offices (SROs) allows us to combine quarterly administrative data on credit disbursed by all commercial banks for a 11 year period (1997 - 2007) aggregated to the SRO level with the date of shifting registration from manual to digital. Computerization had no credit effect in rural areas but led to increased credit-supply in urban ones. A marked increase of registered urban mortgages due to computerization supports the robustness of the result. At the same time, estimated impacts from reduction of stamp duty are much larger, suggesting that, without further changes in the property rights system, impacts of computerization will remain marginal.

Objetivos: elevar el nivel de conocimientos de médicos y alumnos internos sobre la shigellosis. Métodos: se realizó un estudio cuasi {{experimental}} antes-después, de una intervención educativa sobre la shigellosis y su manejo epidemiológico. La investigación se hizo en los policlínicos comunitarios docentes "Marcio Manduley" y "Nguyen Van Troi" en el período {{de enero}} a junio de 2008. La muestra quedó conformada por 64 médicos, de ellos 21 eran alumnos internos. Todos expresaron su consentimiento para participar en la investigación.

Objectives: to confirm the knowledge level of medical staff on the Shigellosis. Methods: a quasi-experimental study was conducted before and after a educational intervention on the Shigellosis and its epidemiological management. Research was made in the "Marcio Manduley" and "Nguyen Van Troi" Teaching and Community polyclinics from January to June, 2008. Sample included 43 physicians and 21 internal students in which the intervention was applied. Information was obtained by application of anonymous questionnaire. Results: before intervention it was possible to verify that taxonomic knowledges were satisfactory in only 9 polled persons for a 14, 06 %, after it, the figure of persons with a good level of knowledges raised to 90, 63 %. Authors confirmed that the medical staff had limited knowledges on the main symptoms of Shigellosis onset. The persons polled with high knowledges on main prophylactic measures to prevent this disease, increase significantly after intervention and a similar behavior was noted in relation to subject on suitable treatment in Shigella patients. Conclusions: educational intervention raised the knowledge level on Shigella in the medical staff. It is necessary to continue promoting and researching this subject matter at primary care level and to extend an action plan not only to hospitals, polyclinics and consulting rooms but also to involve family...|$|E
