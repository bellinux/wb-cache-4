With increased site-specific information comes the need for joint soil strength models to account for the correlation characteristics between shear strength properties. In this study, using 16 sets of soil shear strength observations (consisting of 391 samples) as examples, the suitability of the dependence structure for these experimental observations is firstly identified by a goodness-of-fit test based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with the normal, Student's t, Clayton, Frank, Gumbel, and Plackett copulas. The dependence structure between shear strength components is found to be asymmetric in most cases. Secondly, a set of paired samples of shear strength simulated from the different bivariate copulas, which contributed to various dependencies, is implemented as input for two typical geotechnical probabilistic analyses, e. g., infinite slope <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> a single <b>sliding</b> plane and the bearing capacity of a shallow foundation. The impact of the different choices for these dependence structures on the resulting reliability index is discussed.

The {{coastline}} of KPK {{was subjected to}} severe erosion due to high energy waves during Thane (2011), Nilam (2012) and Madi (2013) cyclones. The Tamil Nadu Fisheries department facilities located near the coast is subjected to damage as the coastline has receded by 45 m {{in the last few}} years following the severe erosion caused by cyclones. Since most of the erosion occurred after the storm waves hit the shoreline, sustainable option for shoreline protection would be to shift wave breaking to deeper depths. Based on numerical model studies and assessment of shoreline behaviour over two years, it is proposed to construct a submerged segmented breakwater. The submerged breakwater is proposed to be constructed at 4 m water depth up to a height of 3. 5 m using sand filled geosynthetic tubes. Geosynthetic tubes shall be placed in a stacked manner with 2 tubes of 1. 5 m high each at the bottom and a tube of 2. 5 m height at the top accounting for height loss due to settlement. Design and stability checks are carried out by using available literature as no standard methods or design codes are available for design or stability checks for the geosynthetic tubes. The breakwater structure is checked for <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> <b>sliding,</b> overturning and bearing capacity.

40|$|A {{desk study}} {{has been carried out}} in order to develop a {{conceptual}} model for the erosion of inner dike slopes with reinforced grass cover. Based on the results the following can be concluded: The presence of a geosynthetic in a grass slope can be taken into account in the EPM method by increasing the critical flow velocity. In particular, a factor Cgeo has been added to the Mirtskhoulava formula. The value of Cgeo in this formula is unknown. Prediction of the failure of a reinforced grass cover did not result in a failure as the erosion is less than the thickness of the layer on top of the geosynthetic. In summary, it is recommended to continue with the results obtained, because the elements for a prediction are available although a correct prediction is not possible yet. In this respect it is recommended to incorporate the failure mechanism of slope material underneath the geosynthetic which probably can be treated in a similar way as geosynthetics in erosion control applications. The Mirtskhoulava formula is valid for the stability of individual elements, but probably there exists a relation with the Edelman-Joustra method for the <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> <b>sliding</b> based on the Mohr-Coulombrelation. It is recommended to attempt to develop this relationship because it might link the stability of individual elements with the stability of soil layers. Furthermore, it is recommended to develop depth-dependant strength parameters in accordance with the observed strength as shown in Figure 4. 2 : high strength at the surface due to roots, then decreasing to a depth of about 10 cm due to decreasing number of roots, and then increasing again due to clay properties.

However, changes in the container shipping market, international conflicts and new generations of vessels are some examples that could drive the desire the relocate or adapt quay wall structures. The objective of this thesis is to design a flexible quay wall structure for panamax container vessels that can be reused and can be reconstructed within a relatively short reconstruction period. Several quay wall structures have been designed and assessed, finally resulting in a quay wall, which consists of concrete caissons of 100 m long, 33 m wide and 11 m high. The application of floating structures was considered too, but the required stability could not be guaranteed and motions are likely to exceed the tolerances for container lifting operations. Two caissons are placed {{on top of each}} other, resulting in a retaining height of 22 m. The lower caissons are filled with water, to make de-ballasting relatively easy. The upper ones are filled with sand to create sufficient weight to satisfy <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> <b>sliding</b> and overturning. The structural strength has been calculated, resulting in an optimum wall thickness and applied amount of reinforcement steel. Determination of floating stability, resistance against earthquakes and slide planes in the subsoil has proven that the structure is a technically feasible alternative. To determine the financial feasibility, the flexible quay wall is compared to a traditional quay wall, for various scenarios. The initial construction costs are about 64 % higher than the average constructions costs of traditional structures, but the reconstruction costs are about 28 % lower. In combination with a faster reconstruction period and a higher residual value, {{it turned out that the}} flexible quay wall structure could be a financially feasible alternative to traditional quay wall structures too.

40|$|The {{new policy}} of flood risk {{management}} {{is to give}} more attention to non-structural measures, allowing people to “live with floods” rather than “fight floods”. To protect existing buildings {{there are two main}} mitigation strategies: dry proofing and wet proofing. One measure of dry proofing is the shielding, consisting in the use of flood barriers, which can be installed at the entrance of the buildings or at a certain distance from them (including the placing along the banks or crossing a street). These flood protection structures are easier and faster to install rather than sandbags. This paper shows the results applied to a case study in the city of Barcellona, Sicily, Italy that is crossed by a river and suffered a severe inundation in November 2011. To study the effectiveness of using these flood barriers, a 2 D hydrodynamic model has been used: the barriers has been placed along a road to inhibit the flow from flooding the protected area. While in North Europe these types of barriers are commonly used, because those areas are typically interested in clear water floods, in Italy flash floods and mud-debris-flows are more frequent and limit their use. The purpose of this work is to verify if these types of barriers are effective when placed along Mediterranean river courses and, especially, to be sure about their stability while subjected to the hydrodynamic effects of these kind of events. To gain this aim, the computed stresses from the modelling have been compared with the stability values of the barriers provided by the producers, evaluating barriers’ <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> overturning and <b>sliding.</b> Simulations show how the flood barriers can mitigate the hydraulic risk, being able to withstand the hydrodynamic pressures and managing to divert the flow of water, thus avoiding that the flood water hits very exposed areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of models for the structural analysis of soil retaining structures. The soil retaining structures being looked at are; block revetments, flexible retaining walls and bored tunnels in soft soil. Within this context typical structural behavior of these structures is discussed too. The emphasis within the context of model development is on the use of Finite Element analysis as a generic toolbox for model development. In chapter 3 a methodology for the development of models is formulated. Both verification, the testing of the integrity of a model and the relation with models of lower hierarchy, and evaluation, testing the accuracy of a model are important. Accuracy and uncertainty are related aspects of model development. In chapter 4 an analytical toolbox for the development of models for structural analysis is given. One of the observations in the formulation of this chapter was that groundwater flow can be evaluated based on the same principle as equilibrium of stresses; the principle of virtual work. In the next three chapters 5, 6, and 7 three examples are given of development of models for the structural analysis of soil retaining structures. In chapter 5, a model for the <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> <b>sliding</b> of the top-layer of a revetment is put forward. The model is evaluated against prototype information. The validity to use Delta flume measurements to validate models for the design of a revetments cover-layer is being reconsidered, as {{there is reason to believe}} that the undrained response which is attributing to'the strength of a cover-layer has 3 dimensional effects being overlooked in a 2 D measurement. In chapter 6, the models for sheet-pile retaining walls are described. The development of finite element analysis for sheet pile walls is described. Subsequently some of the verification analyses are described including an analytical solution derived from plasticity theory. Finally the finite element model is validated against prototype measurements, i. e. the Karlsruhe sheet pile test (1993). Within this context the test is evaluated applying inverse analysis. One of the conclusions was that a distinct difference between the in-situ stiffness of a sand layer and the stiffness as derived from a laboratory test was found. The reason for this is thought to be the breaking up of structure during sampling in advance of the laboratory testing. This structure is not recovered during preparation in the laboratory. The model evaluation indicates that the application of Finite Element analysis improves the accuracy in comparison to the empirical models. In chapter 7, the structural models for the design of a tunnel liner are discussed. The problems related to bored tunnelling in soft soil are discussed. The model hierarchy for the evaluation of the tunnel liner is discussed. In the second part of this chapter, a back-analysis of the measurements from the Second Heinenoord tunnel, with a finite element model is described. From this it comes forward that the uncertainty with respect to tunnel liner design is mainly related to the construction phase, i. e. tunnel ring assembly. In comparison to sheet pile walls, the soil loading of tunnel liners are easier to model. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|In the {{classical}} design method for gravity dams, the designs are {{conducted in the}} linear elastic isotropic material domain. For many decades the so-called ‘classical method’ (or conventional method) was used to design gravity dams. This method {{is based on the}} Bernoulli shallow beam theory. Despite much criticism expressed by academics regarding the basis of the theory, dam design engineers are still using {{the classical}} method to design gravity dams. Currently, in most dam building countries the various codes of practice are standardised and based on this method, and engineers have confidence in these codes. This state of affairs will probably continue until structural engineers come up with a viable alternative for designing gravity dams more precisely. The perception of increased risk is always a critical aspect to overcome when introducing an alternative design method, especially when the established, well-known methodology has proved to be safe. However, when so-called ‘back analyses’ are performed on existing dams, it is not so straightforward to assess the safety margin of these structures. Material properties and their yielding or failure characteristics are now becoming important in evaluating these structures accurately in the non-linear domain. With the growing popularity of roller compacted concrete as a dam building material, the attractiveness of gravity dams has also increased and the author is of the opinion that the finite element method could be utilised more efficiently to optimise gravity dams. But, as with any new or alternative design method, the parameters and means of evaluation should be developed to establish a workable and reliable technique. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a practical methodology for the non-linear analysis of gravity dams by means of the non-linear finite element method. A further aspect of this dissertation is the inclusion of a broad guideline on the application of the latest dam design standards used in South Africa for both the classical and finite element methods. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the basic design criteria, a literature survey was conducted on the evolution of dams and the various theories developed in the past to design and optimise gravity dams. The literature survey included the examination of gravity dam safety criteria and some available statistics on dam failures. The International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) has interesting statistics on dam failures and their causes. A few typical dam failures are presented to illustrate what can go wrong. During this literature research, a thorough study was done on the non-linear material theory, with special reference to the Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker Prager material models. The findings of the study are used to illustrate how the non-linear material models are incorporated into the finite element method and in what manner the different material parameters have an influence on the accuracy of the results. As already mentioned, currently the classical method is still a recognised design standard and for this reason a summary is presented of the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry’s practice for designing gravity dams. This includes the latest concepts on load combinations and factors of safety for these load conditions. This summary of current practice is used as a stepping stone for the proposed load combinations that could be used for the finite element method as these are not always compatible. However, this dissertation does not deal with the full spectrum of load combinations and the scope is limited to hydrostatic loads. Although the finite element method is a very powerful structural engineering tool, it has some serious potential deficiencies when used for dam design. The most serious problem concerns the singularities and mesh density, which develop high stress peaks at the heel of the dam wall. This problem is illustrated and some practical finite element examples are given. Some solutions for addressing this problem are also presented. It is concluded that an effective method for overcoming the singularity problem is to use the non-linear material yielding model. In order to calibrate the non-linear Drucker Prager model, several finite element benchmarks were conducted, based on work done by other researchers in the fracture mechanics field. Although the theory of the Drucker Prager model is not based on fracture mechanics principles, this model simulates the failure of the concrete material very well. To demonstrate this, various benchmarks were conducted, such as a pure tension specimen, a beam in pure bending, a beam combined with bending and shear, the flow models of Chen (1982), a model of a gravity dam and, finally, a full-size gravity dam. The next step in the study was to calibrate the Drucker Prager model with the concrete material properties used in existing dams of different construction methods and ages. The material strength of the concrete was statistically analysed and the average strength was calculated. The important ratio of tensile strength to compression strength (ƒt/ƒc) was also examined and the findings are presented. This ratio is important to get accurate results from the Drucker Prager model. The normal input parameters for the Drucker Prager model are the internal friction angle of the material (φ) and the cohesion (c). Scrutiny of the work done by Chen (1982) helped to find a useful solution to obtaining the parameters for the non-linear finite element method without determining the ö and c values, but by using the material tensile and compression strengths instead. The formulation is demonstrated in the chapter on theory. To illustrate the usefulness of the non-linear yielding model a few case studies were conducted. A hypothetical triangular gravity dam structure was analysed because it was widely used in other literature studies and a useful comparison could be made. Then, a case study of an 80 -year-old concrete gravity dam was performed. The uniqueness of this dam lies in the fact that it was designed before the theory of underdrainage was used in South Africa and the dam has a characteristic shape due to its relatively steep downstream slopes compared with today’s standards. A study of material strength sensitivity was also done on this dam to evaluate its stability under severe load conditions. The last case study presented is on a recently designed 75 -m-high roller compacted concrete gravity dam, optimised primarily by the classical method. The non-linear Drucker Prager yield model was used to evaluate this structure, with the actual material strengths taken from the laboratory design mix results. Although the finite element method was used during the design stage of this dam, it was used mainly to check the results of the classical method. The finite element method was also used to do studies on this dam where the classical method could not be used, such as studies of temperature and earthquake load conditions (not included in this research). The factor of safety against sliding was also determined using the results obtained from the finite element method and compared with the results obtained from the classical method. This case study gives an approximate comparison between the classical method and the finite element method. Finally, a methodology is proposed for analysing a gravity dam. Procedural steps are given to describe the methodology. With regard to the future, the advantage of the non-linear finite element method is that it can easily be extended to contemporary 3 -D analysis, still using the same concept. Many dams can only be accurately evaluated by a full 3 -D analysis. There is a modern tendency to design gravity dams in 3 -D as well so as to evaluate their <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> <b>sliding</b> in the longitudinal direction. The non-linear 3 -D finite element method is also used for arch dams, for which very few alternative numerical analysis methods are available. Moreover, the non-linear finite element method can be extended to earth and rock-fill embankments. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Civil Engineeringunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|As a {{sediment}} control facility, sabo dam has {{to prevent}} erosions, {{to stabilize the}} riverbank, to reduce the velocity of debris flow, and to store the flow of sediment. Recently, sabo dam is not only intended to control the sediment but also to be utilized as connection bridge. To design sabo dam, {{it has to be}} taken into account the stability of the dam beside its structural - strength. The stability analysis of sabo should be done in 3 points as stability analysis includes <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> overturning and tensile stress, sliding of the base and bearing capacity of ground. To do so, it is considered three conditions. The first is normal condition, the second is the condition when the flood taken place, and the third is when the debris flow happen. As a road bridge, sabo dam will receive significant traffic load therefore the strength of the slab must be analyzed. The standard design used was RSNI T- 02 - 2005 “Pembebanan untuk Jembatan”, and structural analysis used was SAP 2000 software. The results indicated that the safety factor for <b>stability</b> <b>against</b> overturning and tensile stress is 7, 95 and 6, 19 that is larger than the suggested safety factor (Sf), 1, 5 therefore the sabo dam is safe for overturning moment and tensile stress. The safety factor for sliding was a 2, 64 and 2, 33 that is also larger than suggested safety factor 2, 0, then the structure is also safe <b>against</b> <b>sliding.</b> Based on three conditions : normal, flood and debris flow, the calculated maximum stress () were 27, 40 t/m 2, 29, 72 t/m 2 and 29, 28 t/m 2, those are less than allowable bearing capacity of soil under the base of the dam 60 t/m 2. The result of concrete slab analysis indicated that the area of reinforced bar is 3166, 67 mm 2 that is more than existing structure using longitudinal bar D 16 - 200 (1005, 31 mm 2), it means that the slab is not strong enough to resist the load according to RSNI T- 02 - 2005 having the truck load of 50 ton. Suggested maximum vehicle load is 8 ton that results the reinforced area 988, 97 m...|$|R
