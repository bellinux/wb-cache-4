Lionel responded by targeting advertising at children, telling them its products were the most realistic toy trains. Additionally, Lionel criticized the durability of competitors' products in ads targeted at parents.|$|R
50|$|Color washing is an {{easy and}} {{forgiving}} form of faux finishing often used by beginners, but perfected by professional finishers. It was historically created with oil-based products because of the long drying time, but today's environmental and health conscious companies are producing user-friendly water based glazes. Color washing {{can be done in}} any <b>color</b> of <b>paint</b> and is generally applied with brushes over a <b>solid</b> <b>paint</b> <b>color,</b> using long sweeping strokes to meld the glaze colors together.|$|R

50|$|As in {{literary}} costumbrismo, Madrid and Andalusia (particularly Seville) were Spain's two great centers of costumbrismo {{in the visual}} arts. Andalusian costumbrista paintings were mainly romantic and folkloric, largely devoid of social criticism. Much of their market was to foreigners for whom Andalusia epitomized their vision of a Spain distinct {{from the rest of}} Europe. The costumbrista artists of Madrid were more acerbic, sometimes even vulgar, in portraying the life of lower class Madrid. More of their market was domestic, including to the often snobbish (and often Europeanizing and liberal) elite of the capital. Among other things, the School of Madrid often used large masses of <b>solid</b> <b>color</b> and <b>painted</b> with a broad brush, while the School of Seville painted more delicately. The Madrid paintings have a certain urgency, while the Seville paintings are typically serene, even misty. The Madrid painters focus more on unique individuals, the Sevillianos on individuals as representatives of a type.|$|R

Slocum.As the parish continued to make great progress St. Mary Church grew {{into one of the}} most magnificent churches in Connecticut. It reached its climax in 1906.A new renovation was done in 1931 and they added a side door on the south side (right on photo).Changes were in the air, and in 1961 another renovation dramatically changed the interior of St. Mary Church. The altar rail was taken out and the marble was covered over with carpet. All three marble altars were reduced in size, and the <b>solid</b> <b>color</b> of <b>paint</b> covered the details of earlier generations. In 2013 the renovation was complete. The side altars were added at the sides. The Assumption was painted by Leonard Porter and is the center piece of the altar.

50|$|With the mid-1977 {{introduction}} of Versailles, Lincoln {{was the first}} American car manufacturer to produce a two-stage base-coat/clear-coat paint process for their mid-sized luxury sedan. For 1978, this new two-stage paint process was expanded to both the Mark V and Continental, (for metallic colors only). This process produced a rich, deep, and especially glossy finish, because the paint pigment was protected beneath a layer of high-gloss clear acrylic enamel. Non-metallic, <b>solid</b> <b>paint</b> <b>colors</b> still continued to use the traditional, single-stage paint process (no clearcoat).|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} on roof tile waste treatment {{has attempted to}} find the appropriate technology to reuse old roof tile waste by  create  wall  cladding  materials  from  it.   Through  exploration  and  experimentation,  a  treatment  method  has  been discovered  to  transform  the  tile  fragments  into  artificial  stone  that  resembles  the  shape  of  coral.   This  baked  clay artificial stone material is then processed as a decorative element for vertical surfaces that are not load-bearing, such as on the interior and exterior walls of a building. Before applying the fragments as wall tiles, several steps must be taken: 1)   Blunting,  which  changes  the  look  of  tile  fragments  using  a  machine  created  specifically  to  blunt  the  roof-tile fragment  edges,  2)   Closing  the  pores  of  the  blunted  fragments  as  a  finishing  step  that  can  be  done  with  a  transparent coat or a <b>solid</b> <b>color</b> of <b>paint,</b> 3) Planting the transformed roof-tile fragments on a prepared tile body made of concrete. In this study, the second phase is done using the method of ceramics glazing at a temperature of 700 °C. The finishing step is {{the strength of this}} product because it produces a rich color artificial pebble. </p...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Color</b> Field <b>painting</b> is a {{style of}} {{abstract}} painting that emerged in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to Abstract Expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering Abstract Expressionists. Color Field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, <b>solid</b> <b>color</b> spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favour of an overall consistency of form and process. In <b>color</b> field <b>painting</b> [...] "color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself." ...|$|R

30|$|Titanium {{white is}} not only absent in the white paints {{but also in the}} <b>colored</b> <b>paints.</b> Due to the high {{refractive}} index of titanium white, zinc white was preferred at Royal Talens to adjust the hue of a <b>color</b> <b>paint</b> tube (personal communication Bert Klein-Ovink). This is confirmed in the present dataset. Of all the (averaged) measurements of <b>colored</b> <b>paints,</b> 25 have lead as the main peak, 50 have zinc as the main peak and only 10 have titanium as the main peak. The latter are likely related to non-oil paintings. This suggests that, while white oil paints may be at risk for photocatalytic degradation, this risk is minor for TiO 2 -induced color fading.|$|R
