40|$|In {{the present}} world, modern power system networks, being a {{complicated}} combination of generators, transmission lines, transformers, circuit breakers and other devices, {{are more vulnerable}} to various types of faults causing stability problems.

30|$|Therefore, a {{comprehensive}} {{study on the}} <b>swing</b> <b>curves</b> of generators measured by the WAMS is performed in this paper. First, four indexes, i.e., the angle deviation similarity, swing direction similarity, rotating speed deviation similarity, and corner deviation similarity, are defined for identifying the coherency of generators based on the <b>swing</b> <b>curves</b> or trajectories of generators. Then, four indexes are combined into a synthesized index by using the entropy weight theory, which could take most {{of the characteristics of}} generator trajectories into consideration in identifying the coherent generator groups. For a given power system, each generator can be considered as a cluster, and the generators with highest coherency can be clustered into one group. Thus, the agglomerative method of the hierarchical clustering which could be used to build a hierarchy of clusters is employed to identify the coherent groups of generators. Then, the optimization model of controlled islanding schemes based on the coherent group of generators is developed to seek the optimal cutset. Finally, a 16 -generator 68 -bus power system and the reduced WECC 29 -unit 179 -bus power system are used for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed WAMS-based islanding schemes.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we found optimum {{exposure}} parameters and determined a process window for a 1 X Stepper tool used in MEMS fabrication. Compared to older full-wafer imaging, Stepper lithography has a smaller exposure field that enables to maintain high Depth of Focus (DOF) even at submicron dimensions. Even though its resolution limit {{is far from}} the modern step-and-scan tools used in IC industry today, its higher depth of focus makes it a suitable tool for MEMS, where lithography over severe topography is often mandatory. For the optimization of our Stepper tool, photoresist profiles obtained with different exposure parameters and test masks were analysed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and optical microscope delegated to measurement of Critical Dimensions (CD). Both profiles on top of thermal oxide and on top of bare silicon were investigated. A <b>Swing</b> <b>Curve</b> was constructed to determine photoresist thickness by RPM. Photoresist profiles were analysed with different focus and exposure energies to construct Bossung plots. These Bossung plots were used to determine our process window. Different types of submicron structures were investigated with the optimum parameters found. Optimum photoresist thickness obtained in <b>Swing</b> <b>Curve</b> analysis was 1, 67 μm for planar surfaces. The process window of our Stepper tool is quite large, with DOF of 4 μm. The optimum exposure energy of our Stepper tool was 230 mJ and optimum focus was - 1, 0 μm. The isofocal CD was about 150 nm lower than CD on mask. The resolution limit of our Stepper tools is slightly lower than 1, 0 μm: submicron lines are exposed and defined clearly, but they are sloped and thus quite narrow at top. After final oxide etching, photoresist profiles were almost identical on top of bare silicon and oxide. Our Stepper tool has sufficient resolution and high DOF suitable for MEMS fabrication. The optimal exposure parameters found in this work allow for smaller safety tolerances in chip design and thus more efficient use of silicon area. This allows reducing the size and cost of the MEMS without reducing device performance. In a farther future with more strict resolution requirements, either creative solutions or new kind of lithography tools are needed. Tässä työssä tutkimme 1 X Stepperin optimivalotusparametreja, tarkoituksena määrittää laitteen prosessi-ikkuna. Stepperilitografian koko kiekkoaluetta pienempi valotusalue mahdollistaa paremman fokustason alle mikrometrin dimensioiden rakenteille. Vaikka laitteemme resoluutio ei vastaa moderneja step-and-scan valottimia, on sen tarjoama korkea fokustaso erittäin hyödyllinen topografiaa sisältävissä valmistusprosesseissa, kuten monissa MEMS-tuotteissa. Tutkimme sähköelektronimikroskoopilla (SEM) photoresistiprofiileja eri valotusenergioilla ja testimaskeilla löytääksemme optimaaliset valotusparametrit. Arvioimme optimaalista resistinpaksuutta <b>Swing</b> <b>Curve</b> –kuvaajista. Eri valotusenergioiden ja fokuksien näytteiden SEM:llä tehtyjen profiilimittausten perusteella piirsimme Bossung-kuvaajat, joiden pohjalta arvioimme Stepperin prosessi-ikkunaa. Vertailimme profiileja paljaan piin ja termisen oksidin välillä sekä tutkimme yleisesti alle mikrometrin rakenteiden valotuksen onnistumista. Optimiresistipaksuudeksi tasaiselle pinnalle määritettiin 1, 67 μm. Stepperin prosessi-ikkunan huomattiin olevan varsin suuri, fokustason ollessa 4, 0 μm. Optimivalotusenergiaksi määritettiin 230 mJ ja optimifokukseksi - 1, 0 μm. Stepperin resoluutio oli alle mikrometrin: tätä pienemmät rakenteet valottuivat hyvin, joskin ne olivat varsin kapeita yläosastaan. Resistiprofiilien huomattiin olevan samanlaisia paljaan piin ja oksidin päällä oksidietsausprosessivaiheen jälkeen. Stepperillämme on riittävä fokustaso ja resoluutiokyvykkyys MEMS-tuotantoon. Tämän työn tuloksena saatiin optimivalotusparametrit, jotka mahdollistavat tehokkaamman piirisuunnittelun ja piikiekkopinta-alan käytön. Tämä mahdollistaa MEMS-tuotteiden koon ja hinnan pienentämisen.

This study proposes a hybrid algorithm {{to determine whether}} the post-fault power system is secure due to both transient rotor angle stability and oscillatory rotor angle stability subsequent to a set of known contingencies.
