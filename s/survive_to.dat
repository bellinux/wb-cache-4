5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not normally <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Head eagle was a ten-dollar gold piece, or eagle {{struck by}} the United States Mint {{continuously}} from 1907 until 1916, and then irregularly until 1933. The obverse and the reverse, designed by the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, were originally commissioned for use on other denominations. Saint-Gaudens was suffering from cancer, and did not <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> see the coins released.|$|E
5|$|The Lime Walk, {{constructed}} by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground {{which was the}} original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine.|$|E
5|$|The Parrett Navigation was {{a series}} of {{improvements}} to the river to allow increased boat traffic between Burrowbridge and Thorney. The work, done in the 1830s and 1840s, was made mostly obsolete by the coming of railways in 1853, though some aspects <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his lifetime, Saint-Just {{continued}} to work on books and essays {{about the meaning of}} the Revolution, but he did not <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> see any of them published. They have been collected and edited in various Œuvres complètes. These include Organt, L'Esprit de la Revolution, published speeches and legislative proposals, as well as military orders, notes, drafts, and private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Architect Edmund Anscombe was a Caversham resident. Anscombe was {{responsible}} for numerous important buildings in early 20thcentury New Zealand, many of which <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> the present day. Among them are the Sarjeant Art Gallery in Wanganui and the Former Post and Telegraph Building in Wellington. Noted local buildings with work by Anscombe include extensions to the University of Otago Clocktower complex in Dunedin North, the main building of Otago Girls' High School in central Dunedin, and the Allied Press building in Lower Stuart Street, Dunedin.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> meet.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> this day. Most surviving specimens of both Khitan scripts are epitaph inscriptions on stone tablets, {{as well as a}} number of inscriptions on coins, mirrors and seals. Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E

5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> five years.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, more towers were {{built around the}} islands. The first group, the Wignacourt towers, were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|Philipp's mother, {{who never}} married, was the eighth child of {{relatively}} poor parents. Her father {{made a living}} as a driver and as a laborer in the construction business. The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to <b>survive.</b> <b>To</b> support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially he had to be reminded by his mother of his obligations. Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917, taking the name Johannes Fritz, and was confirmed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford Birchard Hayes {{was born}} in Delaware, Ohio, on October 4, 1822, the son of Rutherford Hayes, Jr. and Sophia Birchard. Hayes's father, a Vermont storekeeper, took the family to Ohio in 1817. He died ten weeks before Rutherford's birth. Sophia {{took charge of the}} family, {{bringing}} up Hayes and his sister, Fanny, the only two of their four children to <b>survive</b> <b>to</b> adulthood. She never remarried; Sophia's younger brother, Sardis Birchard, lived with the family for a time. He was always close to Hayes and became a father figure to him, contributing to his early education.|$|E
