In the later years of the state penitentiary, the A-Block was mainly used for extra storage and a law library was installed here at one point and it was a place where inmates could type legal documents.|$|E

5000|$|Early rails {{were used}} on horse drawn wagonways, {{originally}} with wooden rails, {{but from the}} 1760s using <b>strap-iron</b> rails, which consisted of thin strips of cast iron fixed onto wooden rails. [...] These rails were too fragile to carry heavy loads, but because the initial construction cost was less, this method was sometimes used to quickly build an inexpensive rail line. Strap rails sometimes separated from the wooden base and speared into {{the floor of the}} carriages above, creating what was referred to as a [...] "snake head". However, the long-term expense involved in frequent maintenance outweighed any savings.|$|E

5000|$|In 1936, the locomotive, {{under the}} {{guidance}} of Kurtz, was cosmetically restored to resemble what he believed to be its wartime appearance. The engines smokestack was replaced with one resembling the balloon design of the Civil War era, its horizontal <b>strap-iron</b> slat cowcatcher was restored, as were the nameplates {{on the sides of the}} boiler. The basement in which the engine was placed, while adequate to protect the engine, had been criticized for its small size which made viewing the engine difficult. As with the General, several proposals had been made as to where the Texas should be displayed, including placing it on display in the Atlanta Union Station, at the site of present-day Underground Atlanta, at Stone Mountain Park, among others - none of which materialized.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{construction}} was done until the Chemung Canal was built along a similar course in 1833 via Seneca Lake and Elmira, diverting trade from Ithaca and Owego. [...] At this point {{construction was}} started {{and the work}} was completed by 1834. The chief engineer for the construction was John Randel Jr. The track was standard gauge <b>strap-iron</b> rails - [...] strips of cast iron attached to wooden rails. The line covered a distance of approximately 30 mi. It comprised an ascent from Cayuga Lake of 602 ft in 8 mi followed by a descent to Owego of 276 ft. Two inclined planes accomplished the lift from Ithaca, one driven by a stationary engine and the second by a horse-drawn windlass. [...] Originally the cars were pulled by horse power, An engine, [...] "The Pioneer", [...] built by Walter McQueen of Albany, was purchased in 1840. [...] This engine was in service {{for a few years}} before crashing through a bridge killing the engineer and fireman, and the railroad returned to horse power.|$|E
5000|$|Cast iron strips {{could be}} laid {{on top of}} timber rails, {{and the use of}} such {{materials}} probably occurred in 1738, but there are claims that this technology went back to 1716. [...] In 1767, Ketley ironworks began producing cast iron plates, which were fixed to the top of wooden rails with nails, to provide a more durable running surface. This construct was known as <b>strap-iron</b> rail (or strap rail) and was widely used on pre-steam railways in the United States. Although relatively cheap and quick to build, they were unsuited to heavy loads and required 'excessive maintenance'. Train wheels rolling over the spikes loosened them, allowing the rail to break free and curve upwards sufficiently that a car wheel could get beneath it and force the end of the rail up through the floor of the car, writhing and twisting, endangering passengers. These broken rails became known as [...] "snake heads". When wrought iron became available, wrought iron plates provided an even more durable surface. The rails had projecting lugs (or ears) with a hole to enable them to be fixed to the underlying wooden rail.|$|E
