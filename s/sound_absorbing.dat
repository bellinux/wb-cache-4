50|$|Reflective thermal {{insulation}} is typically fabricated from aluminum foil {{with a variety}} of core materials such as low-density polyethylene foam, polyethylene bubbles, fiberglass, or similar materials. Each core material presents its own set of benefits and drawbacks based on its ability to provide a thermal break, deaden <b>sound,</b> <b>absorb</b> moisture, and resist combustion during a fire. When aluminum foil is used as the facing material, reflective {{thermal insulation}} can stop 97% of radiant heat transfer. Recently, some reflective thermal insulation manufacturers have switched to a metalized polyethylene facing. The long-term efficiency and durability of such facings are still undetermined.|$|R

5000|$|Lyle stated over a phone {{interview}} with the host of [...] "Living in Illinois" [...] (a radio show based in Springfield, Illinois) that [...] "in the mid-1920s, three 50,000-watt radio stations created a triangular area and bombarded it with live music, introducing musical sounds from around the United States and the world. Those who lived in that golden triangle of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbed</b> it all.

30|$|Sound {{absorption}} {{is defined}} as the incident sound that strikes a material and is not reflected. The absorption coefficient of a material indicates the proportion of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the material relative to the total incident sound. There are many different methods {{that can be used to}} determine the acoustic properties of materials, most of which involve exposing the materials to known sound fields and measuring the effects. There is a range of standards for material testing which prescribe well-controlled acoustical conditions and special instrumentation to ensure accuracy and repeatability. There are two common methods for measuring the sound absorption coefficient. Usually the measurement of absorption coefficient is conducted in a reverberant room, according to the ISO 354 standard, or using the traditional standing wave tube method described in the ISO 10534 standard. Neither method allows in situ measurement, and the standing wave tube method requires single frequency measurements, thus it takes a long time to complete and requires small samples.|$|R

50|$|An {{acoustic}} duct or plane wave tube {{is a test}} facility used in acoustics. Anechoic chambers are typically subject to a low frequency limit, governed by {{the length of the}} <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> wedges employed to prevent reflections within the chamber. Test and measurement microphone calibration services are often required to be undertaken at frequencies where anechoic chambers cannot be used effectively. In this case, a plane wave {{acoustic duct}} with anechoic termination provides a practical alternative.|$|E

5000|$|Noise absorption: In {{architectural}} acoustics, unwanted <b>sounds</b> can be <b>absorbed</b> {{rather than}} reflected {{inside the room}} of an observer. This is useful for noises with no point source and when a listener needs to hear sounds only from a point source and not echo reflections. Example: In a recording studio, sound proofing is accomplished with bass traps and anechoic chambers. Wallace Sabine, an American physicist, is credited with studying sound reverberations in 1900, and Carl Eyring revised his equations in 1930 for Bell Labs. Another example is the ubiquitous use of dropped ceilings and acoustical tiles in modern office buildings with high ceilings. Submarine hulls have special coatings that <b>absorb</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|R
