5000|$|One {{method for}} {{treating}} <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> streams is {{by using a}} process that is also used for phosphorus recovery. Another benefit for sewage treatment plant operators of treating <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> streams for phosphorus recovery is that it reduces the formation of obstructive struvite scale in pipes, pumps and valves. Such obstructions can be a maintenance headache particularly for biological nutrient removal plants where the phosphorus content in the sewage sludge is elevated. For example, the Canadian company Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies is marketing a process based on controlled chemical precipitation of phosphorus in a fluidized bed reactor that recovers struvite in the form of crystalline pellets from <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> streams. The resulting crystalline product is sold to the agriculture, turf and ornamental plants sectors as fertiliser under the registered trade name [...] "Crystal Green".|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} pH on {{chemical}} conditioning with potassium ferrate (K 2 FeO 4) for improving <b>sludge</b> filtration <b>dewatering</b> performance has been studied. The variation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in conditioning process {{was investigated in}} detail to unravel the reaction mechanism. The results indicated that sludge dewaterability was improved by decreasing solution pH in terms of filtration rate and cake solids content. At acid conditions, protonation of EPS resulted in reduction of negative charge and densification of sludge floc. Sludge conditioning efficiency was improved with decrease in pH. Ferrate can solubilize EPS through oxidation process and also remove a portion of soluble EPS (SEPS) by charge neutralization and interfacial adsorption of hydrolyzed ferric ions, consequently compressing EPS and decreasing total extractable EPS content. In addition, when pH and potassium ferrate were 3 and 0. 1 g/gTSS, the <b>sludge</b> filtration <b>dewatering</b> rate and extent reached the maximum. Deterioration of sludge dewaterability was observed as the ferrate was overdosed (> 0. 2 g/gTSS). This {{could be attributed to}} the release of a large amount of bound EPS (BEPS) as a result of ferrate oxidation, consequently increasing the sludge filtration resistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

This study provides experimental data to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} combination of gypsum (CaSO 4 x 2 H 2 O) and an organic polymer in alum <b>sludge</b> conditioning and <b>dewatering.</b> Experimental results demonstrated that the filterability of dually conditioned alum sludge was significantly improved by the addition of gypsum at a 1 : 1 ratio (WT/WT) to original <b>sludge</b> solids. <b>Dewatering</b> tests showed that a further decrease of almost seven percentage of sludge cake equilibrium moisture content was achieved by the involvement of gypsum compared to the situation of single polymer conditioning.

50|$|Both the conical plate {{centrifuge}} and chamber bowl centrifuge can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation.

50|$|Both conical plate {{centrifuge}} and tubular bowl centrifuge can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the advantage of conical plate centrifuge over tubular bowl centrifuge is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of solids in tubular bowl is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the liquid discharge in conical plate centrifuge is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl centrifuges unless special skimming or centripetal pumps are used. Tubular bowl centrifuges are easier to clean and good <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> as compared to conical plate centrifuge.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} aspects {{that can be}} {{improved}} from the current solid bowl centrifuges {{in order to increase}} its performance and reliability.

Moreover, the operating parameters can be adjusted to optimize the <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> process. It relies on rotational force in order to throw the solids out and for the sludge to stick to the outer all surfaces.

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{investigation}} {{was made on}} whether a petroleum based polyelectrolyte could {{be replaced by a}} biodegradable polymer. This was done to enable the use of sludge from the biogas plant of the dairy in UmeÃ¥, Sweden, as fertilizer. The properties and effectiveness of a starch based polyelectrolyte were compared to polyacrylamide in laboratory tests. Other biodegradable polyelectrolytes were also presented. The tests were made on sludge from the dairy. In tests with a waste water with a low dry substance content (< 0, 1 %) the dewatering effects were similar between polyacrylamide and the starch based polymer. Starch had a small effect on <b>dewatering</b> <b>sludge</b> with a higher dry substance content (4 %). Cellulose fibers in combination with starch increased the amount of dewatered sludge, but polyacrylamide was still the most effective polyelectrolyte. A starch based polymer could be an alternative to polyacrylamide, if cellulose fibers are added. Other biodegradable polyelectrolytes which could have sufficient dewatering effects are chitosan and tannins. There were methodical problems in this study with the accuracy of measuring dry substance content and a difference in dilution of sludge samples when adding chemicals.

50|$|Water {{content of}} sludge {{may be reduced}} by centrifugation, filtration, and/or {{evaporation}} to reduce transportation costs of disposal, or to improve suitability for composting. Centrifugation may be a preliminary step to reduce sludge volume for subsequent filtration or evaporation. Filtration may occur through underdrains in a sand drying bed or as a separate mechanical process in a belt filter press. Filtrate and centrate are typically returned to the sewage treatment process.

50|$|Sludge {{treatment}} {{technologies that}} are used for thickening or dewatering of sludge have two products: the thickened or dewatered sludge, and a liquid fraction which is called sludge treatment liquids, <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> streams, liquors, centrate (if it stems from a centrifuge), filtrate (if it stems from a belt filter press) or similar. This liquid requires further treatment as it is high in nitrogen and phosphorus, particularly if the sludge has been anaerobically digested.

5000|$|Phosphorus {{recovery}} from sewage sludge or from <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> streams is receiving increased attention particularly in Sweden, Germany and Canada, as phosphorus {{is a limited}} resource (a concept also known as [...] "peak phosphorus") and is needed as fertilizer to feed a growing world population.

Research on phosphorus recovery methods from sewage sludge has been carried out in Sweden and Germany since around 2003, but the technologies currently under development are not yet cost effective, given the current price of phosphorus on the world market.|$|E

40|$|The {{vane shear}} {{strength}} and total solids content of dewatered sludge from Hong Kong were determined {{in order to}} evaluate their geotechnical suitability for disposal in landfills. The results obtained indicate that (i) the total solids and vane shear strength of dewatered sludge from different treatment plants varied considerably {{depending on the type}} of <b>sludge</b> and <b>dewatering</b> method; and, (ii) percent total solids alone is not sufficient to guarantee geotechnical stability in terms of vane shear strength. The critical state model for soils provided a good fit for the characteristics relationship between vane shear strength and total solids, which can be used to estimate vane shear strength from total solids only. No relationship between volatile solids and vane shear strength was found. The results of the laboratory vane shear test correlated well with those obtained by a pocket shearmeter indicating the usefulness of this method for rapid determination of vane shear strength on site.

40|$|AbstractTo {{identify}} the key characteristics of cationic polyacrylamide (c-PAM) for evaluating sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> performance, {{we examined the}} properties of 13 types of c-PAMs that come from different manufacturers via a laboratory assay. The <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> performance was determined through a full-scale test at a large wastewater treatment plant in Beijing. We checked the cationic degree, solution viscosity, dissolution time, and 1 mm sieve residue of c-PAM. The 1 mm sieve residue was found to affect the dissolution time, solution viscosity, and conductivity. The full-scale test indicated that the cationic degree {{is the most important}} factor that affects the dosage and treatment capacity of the belt filter press when the cationic degree ranges from 25 % to 45 %. However, the moisture content of sludge cake is mainly relevant to raw sludge organic content. The <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> performance of the 13 types of c-PAMs showed that the c-PAM should be selected based on cationic degree, solution viscosity, and 1 mm sieve residue.

The topic became important in juncture of fast growth of {{water supply and sewerage}} networks and higher water consumption. In the same time substantial changes in the Romanian legislation have been made in order to become harmonized with EU environmental legislation. Whatever water treatment technology is used there are certain methods to settle the obtained sludge: thickening, dewatering, stabilization, conditioning, thermal sludge reduction.

40|$|The {{salinity}} {{effect on}} electro-osmosis dewatering was investigated {{by measuring the}} solid content of <b>sludge</b> after <b>dewatering.</b> Three levels of salinity were studied, 5, 000, 10, 000, and 12, 500 ppm. Coagulant chemicals such as alum, ferrous sulfate, and organic polyelectrolytes were used for some tests. Increasing the salinity from 5, 000 to 10, 000 ppm and 10, 000 to 12, 500 ppm was found to increase the sludge solid content about 88 and 28 %, respectively. A 2 V/cm increase in voltage intensity can also increase the solid content about 46 %. The effect of chemicals is evident at low salinity. At 5, 000 and 10, 000 ppm, addition of chemicals in average can enhance the sludge solid content about 44 and 16 %, respectively. Because of the electrolysis of salt solution {{and the release of}} chlorine gas, the pH of the sludge increased. Consequently the zeta potential of the sludge increased, which in turn results in an increase in dewatering rate. Therefore an S-shape solid content-time curve was observed for most of the operating conditions, contrary to the conventional shape of a linear increase followed with a decrease of rate before reaching zero rate...|$|R
