40|$|Abstract. The common {{transportation}} {{methods for}} the consumers of the ironwork {{such as the}} <b>steel</b> roll <b>coils</b> manufactured from the steelworks were either by the land transportation or the sea transportation. In order to transport the <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> effectively and safely to the destination, {{the stability of the}} <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> which induced the minimum movements during the transportation was strongly required. The basic transportation equipment for the <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> such as the dunnage is made of 100 % imported wood known as the apitong. However, the material characteristic such as the rigidity has caused permanent damages to the <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> and the damaged <b>steel</b> roll <b>coils</b> were not easily restorable thus they were unsuitable for other purposes. Therefore, the introduction of new materials manufacturing dunnages which would have a good recovery performance and thus enable the damage prevention or reduction to the <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> or any other products during the transportation is needed. This investigation was to develop the new and improved type of a dunnage from observing the current dunnage in the following areas; the array or the types of reinforcements that established the construction of the dunnage, the dunnage forming shapes of a rectangle and a trapezoid, the direct impacts to dunnage in the presence of vibration when the carrier was moving and stopping, and the critical impact to the dunnage due to the edge loading. Ultimately, the development of new type of dunnage that consisted of characteristics being soft and recoverable than the existing apitong dunnage and induces little or no damages to the <b>steel</b> roll <b>coils</b> are required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The present {{work was}} {{performed}} to investigate the effect of coiling temperature on the annealed texture in Cu/Nb-added ultra-low-carbon steels. The ultra-low-carbon <b>steels</b> were <b>coiled</b> at 650 and 720 oC, respectively. The result showed that the Cu-added ultra-low-carbon steel at a low coiling temperature produced a desirable annealed texture related to good formability. On the other hand, Nb-added ultra-low-carbon steel at a high coiling temperature also produced a desirable texture. This is attributed {{to the effect of}} Nb, which retards recrystallization during the coiling process.

40|$|Abstract. Ironwork, {{especially}} <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil,</b> {{is usually}} {{transported to the}} customers over land or by sea. For fast and safe transportation of <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> without damaging it, {{it is necessary that}} <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil</b> is surely fixed. These days, apitong, which is fully imported from abroad, is being used to fix the <b>steel</b> roll <b>coil.</b> However, because of apitong harshness, it often damages the coil that would be hard to fix. Recovering damaged coil is almost impossible, and we have to look for a new type of dunnage, which would be able to substitute apitong. This paper discusses various types of reinforcement, as well as rectangular and trapezoid dunnages. We will consider how rolling occurs and what happens when the carrier starts and stops moving. Thus, {{it will be possible to}} design a dunnage, which would not damage ironwork and had better recovery and softness than the existing apitong...|$|R
