5|$|The {{media have}} been criticized for {{focusing}} more on the First Lady's fashion <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E

He {{is a member of}} a group of friends called the Little Busters, which originally consisted of four members, but expanded to five with Riki during his childhood. The leader of the Little Busters is Kyousuke Natsume, who is the eldest member. He often comes up with absurd ideas, but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, renowned British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas {{described}} Oryzomys wavrini as a {{new species}} of Oryzomys from Paraguay. In the next decades, it was viewed as an aberrant species of Oryzomys (then used in a much broader <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> now), but it was moved to a separate genus, named Pseudoryzomys, by Hershkovitz in 1959, who noted that although it is similar to Oryzomys palustris in appearance, other features suggest it is {{more closely related to}} Phyllotis. Thus, he viewed the animal {{as a member of the}} phyllotine group of rodents, which includes Calomys and Phyllotis, not of the oryzomyine group, which includes Oryzomys, and his opinion was mostly accepted in the next few decades. Scientific knowledge of the rare Pseudoryzomys wavrini—only three specimens were known when Hershkovitz described the genus Pseudoryzomys in 1959—increased in the following years, and in 1975 the Bolivian population was named as a separate subspecies, Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi, because Bolivian animals are slightly larger and darker than those from Paraguay.|$|E

25|$|The Oath, {{ascribed}} to Hippocrates, forbade {{the use of}} pessaries to induce abortion. Modern scholarship suggests that pessaries were banned because they were reported to cause vaginal ulcers. This specific prohibition has been interpreted by some medical scholars as prohibiting abortion in a broader <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> by pessary.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness (now called bipolar disorder) and dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia) was made by Emil Kraepelin, who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th century psychiatrists, by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms. Kraepelin used the term 'manic depressive insanity' to describe the whole spectrum of mood disorders, in a far wider <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> it is usually used today.|$|E
25|$|Satchel Pooch is Rob's overweight, naïve, {{and easily}} amused dog. His father, named Copernicus, a Labrador Retriever and retired guide dog, and his mother, a Shar Pei, live in Cheticamp, Nova Scotia. It is {{suggested}} by Rob's friend Joe Doman, that he is named after the Baseball Hall of Fame player Satchel Paige. Satchel is kind, gentle, and sympathetic. These traits, coupled with his naïvete and gullibility, make him a natural target for the scheming Bucky. Satchel's personality serves as foil to that of Bucky's: easy to please, optimistic to the extreme, having (barely) less common <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> Bucky, and perfectly content to peacefully coexist with everyone. He is good friends with Bucky's nemesis, Fungo Squiggly, much to Bucky's dismay.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} the first whose images were made with leadcuts instead of the more common woodcuts, and showed a greater depth of {{character}} and cinematic <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> previous wordless novels. [...] The book inspired American artist Lynd Ward to tackle the medium, beginning with Gods' Man in 1929. [...] Ward's success brought about an American publication of Destiny in 1930 which sold well. [...] The book has impressed critics and {{has become one of}} the best-known wordless novels.|$|E
500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in is what you get out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> divine revelation." ...|$|E

[...] He also attributed the quality of every track of Blackout to economic reasons, since {{one of the main}} causes album sales began to suffer during the digital era is due to the [...] "unbundling" [...] of albums in online stores – making it easier for consumers to buy some tracks rather than the entire album. Ewing explained that [...] "The Revolver blueprint for pop albums – every track good, every track a potential hit – makes more <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> ever. Especially if a star can keep sonically up-to-date in a fast-moving market." ...|$|E

500|$|While Simon Blackquill {{speaks in}} an old-fashioned and [...] "rough" [...] {{way in the}} Japanese version, {{matching}} what a ronin {{would be expected to}} sound like, Hsu said that this cultural shorthand of a ronin character did not exist in the West to build his character upon, so his characterization had to be rendered in a different way to be more accessible to Western players. Hsu and the translators had the same problem with this as Fuse had when balancing the prosecutor and convict aspects of the character, but eventually leaned more towards the prosecutor side, and made him speak Victorian English. They felt that this made more <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> portraying him as a cursing delinquent due to his high intelligence, and his Victorian-era clothes, due to their different cultural connotations in the West compared to Japan.|$|E
500|$|Blake, whom Macdonald biographer Gwyn {{describes}} as the Liberal Party's [...] "worst campaigner until Stéphane Dion early in the twenty-first century", resigned after the defeat, {{to be replaced by}} Wilfrid Laurier. Under Laurier's early leadership, the Liberals, who had accepted much of the National Policy under Blake while questioning details, rejected it entirely, calling for [...] "unrestricted reciprocity", or free trade, with the United States. Advocates of Laurier's plan argued that north–south trade made more economic <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> trying to trade across the vast, empty prairies, using a CPR which was already provoking resentment for what were seen as high freight rates. Macdonald was willing to see some reciprocity with the United States, but was reluctant to lower many tariffs. American advocates of what they dubbed [...] "commercial union" [...] saw it as a prelude to political union, and did not scruple to say so, causing additional controversy in Canada.|$|E
500|$|During {{his service}} as ambassador, Hay {{attempted}} {{to advance the}} relationship between the U.S. and Britain. The latter country had long been seen negatively by many Americans, a legacy of its colonial role that was refreshed by its Civil War neutrality, when British-built raiders such as the Alabama preyed on US-flagged ships. In spite of these past differences, according to Taliaferro, [...] "rapprochement made more <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> at any time in their respective histories". In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897, Hay echoed these points, [...] "The great body of people in the United States and England are friends... that intense respect and reverence for order, liberty, and law which is so profound a sentiment in both countries". Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.|$|E

500|$|Her {{greatest}} critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 {{production of}} Titus Andronicus, commenting that she [...] "receives {{the news that}} {{she is about to}} be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber." [...] He was also critical of her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role. After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as [...] "one of the worst errors of judgment" [...] he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, [...] "made more <b>sense...</b> <b>than</b> the usual battle-axe" [...] portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.|$|E

[...] The [...] "Billy Idol" [...] entry on TrouserPress.com skewered Cyberpunk as a [...] "third-rate self-parody... that trusses him up in sci-fi lingo and futurist mumbo jumbo."

[...] "There is a positive message to be found in Cyberpunk," [...] Giangiordano wrote, [...] "the only problem is that techno plus early-'80s equals a big yawn, especially when the lyrics that accompany are annoyingly repetitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his newfound}} top {{prospect}} status Houtteman remained in Buffalo {{at the beginning}} of the 1947 season before being recalled to the Tigers in July. He was relegated to the bullpen for a time, and saw little action. But after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were used in two days, Tiger manager Steve O'Neill decided to start Houtteman against the Washington Senators for only the second start of his career. He tossed a five-hit shutout and Tiger general manager Billy Evans said, [...] "In 40years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first-year pitcher. We now know that Houtteman is really a big leaguer". He followed this with another five-hit victory against the Boston Red Sox, then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the St. Louis Browns. He finished the season at 7–2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games and two shutouts. His performance in 1947 caught the attention of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, [...] "They have more stuff and more pitching <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while".|$|E
