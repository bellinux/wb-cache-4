40|$|Introduction 2. Segmentation {{components}} such as {{photos and}} figures occur in large bounding boxes, characters {{are contained in}} medium <b>size</b> <b>boxes,</b> and noise in small boxes. Segmentation proceeds by projecting the medium <b>size</b> <b>boxes</b> first vertically and then horizontally to detect gaps indicating columns and paragraph breaks [2]. In addition, large bounding boxes are further analyzed by projecting both the contained medium <b>size</b> bounding <b>boxes</b> and the pixels contained {{in the area in}} order to determine whether it is a framed text area or a table. Also, collinear large boxes of similar height are detected to recognize oversized headlines. This procedure distinguishes non-text and text regions at the paragraph level. We keep pointers to the coordinates of each block and all contained boxes to facilitate subsequent reading order determination and higher level layout analysis.

5000|$|Following the 1922 Partition of Ireland, the Irish Free State {{continued}} to commission foundries to make boxes of similar design to those installed under Colonial rule, {{but without a}} royal cipher and repainted the red boxes in green. Many of these were from the foundry of IVI at Athy, Co. Kildare, who held the contract for several decades. Earlier Irish Free State boxes, such as the large A <b>size</b> <b>box</b> seen below, have the elaborate wreathed harp emblem on the door. However, {{with the formation of}} the Irish Government Department of Posts and Telegraphs, their Gaelic script logo [...] "P&T" [...] (using a Tironian [...] "et" [...] instead of ampersand) began to appear on wall boxes, such as that seen below at Clonmany, Co. Donegal. In recent times the department has become a free-standing commercial organisation known as An Post. No cast iron wall boxes have been made with An Post's wavy line logo, {{but there are plenty of}} sheet steel wall boxes across the Republic bearing adhesive decals or screen printed with An Post's distinctive yellow on green logo.|$|E
5000|$|Relative to Microsoft's other 3 ERP products, the Dynamics NAV's {{sector is}} for small {{distribution}} and manufacturing companies that {{want more than}} [...] "out of the box" [...] functionality. Very few installations are actually made [...] "out of the box" [...] as all sales of the product are through Microsoft-approved resellers who base their entire businesses on how many consulting hours they can apply to any given installation. The solution has a standard feature set, {{but it can also}} be thought of as an [...] "ERP System construction set" [...] if, at the end of the installation, you want to end up with every erector piece that was in the box still attached to your system. A better analogy would be to think of the NAV program as a 4'x8' sheet of pegboard, with 4,600 evenly spaced holes. It is used to cover various sized company boxes, ranging in size from shoebox, through pizza box, knockdown furniture box, up to double-doored refrigerator box. No matter the <b>size</b> <b>box</b> the underlying company is, the 4'x8' sheet of pegboard remains the same. It then becomes the reseller's job to link up whichever pegholes are needed to the specific company under the interface. They may not need all of the holes; some company boxes may need less than 1,000 links, but all of the holes remain visible to the end-user after the installation is complete. The Pascal-like development language is easily accessible to appropriate developers and is designed for rapidly customizing the software.|$|E
40|$|The particle-mesh Ewald (PME) {{method is}} {{considered}} to be both efficient and accurate for the evaluation of long-range electrostatic interactions in large macromolecular systems being studied by molecular dynamics simulations. This method assumes "infinite" periodic boundary conditions resembling the symmetry of a crystal environment. Can such a "solid-state" method accurately portray a macromolecular solute such as DNA in solution? To address this issue, we have performed three 1500 -ps PME molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, each with a different box size, on the d(CGCGA 6 CG) -(CGT 6 CGCG) DNA dodecamer. The smallest box had the DNA solvated by a layer of water molecules of at least 5 A along each orthogonal direction. The intermediate <b>size</b> <b>box</b> and the largest box had the DNA solvated by a layer of water molecules of at least 10 A and 15 A, respectively, along each orthogonal direction. The intermediate <b>size</b> <b>box</b> in the present study is similar to the box size currently chosen by most workers in the field. Based on a comparison of RMSDs and curvature for this single DNA dodecamer sequence, the larger two box sizes do not appear to afford any extra benefit over the smallest box. The implications of this finding are briefly discussed...|$|E

The formation of the Kondo screening cloud in the box strongly depends on the ratio between the Kondo temperature and the box level spacing. By weakly connecting two metallic reservoirs to the quantum dot, a detailed spectroscopic analysis can be performed. Since the transport channels and the screening channels are almost decoupled, such a setup allows an easier access to the measure of finite-size effects associated with the finite extension of the Kondo cloud.

The random walk undergone by an entity in the MDLA model is modified {{such that the}} trajectories are ballistic in nature, leading to a magnetically controlled ballistic deposition (MBD) model. This allows to obtain important ingredients about a difficult problem that of the nonequilibrium segregation of polydisperse sandpiles and heterogeneous adsorption of a binary distribution of particles which can {{interact with each other}} and with an external field. Our detailed results from many simulations of MBD clusters on a two dimensional triangular lattice above a flat surface in a vertical finite <b>size</b> <b>box</b> for binary systems indicates intriguing variations of the density, ''magnetization'', types of clusters, and fractal dimensions.

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{ultrasound}} technique, developed at the Institute of Textiles & Clothing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, offers numerous advantages during wet processing of textiles. The ultrasonic technique {{has been applied to}} different areas of wet processing including desizing, scouring and bleaching, washing and in dyeing, and finishing. The application of ultrasonics in the <b>size</b> <b>box</b> and steaming on the affinity of the sizing agent for cotton, polyester, and their blend warp yarns, gives a considerable potential for enhancing the affinity of the size for fibers. The use of degraded starch followed by ultrasonic desizing could lead to considerable energy savings as compared to conventional starch sizing and desizing. Scouring of wool with the ultrasonic technique in neutral or very light alkaline baths reduces fiber damage and enhances the rate of processing. The use of ultrasound in reactive dyeing of cellulosic fabrics can result in energy savings, less water consumption, increased depth of color, and better process conditions. It can also increase wool coloration and makes it possible to reduce dyeing time and save on textile auxiliary products. Application to dyeing seems to be the most advantageous of all the textile wet processes, followed by finishing and preparation processes. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from self-consistent 3 D {{numerical}} simulations of cosmic structure formation with a multi-frequency radiative transfer scheme and non-equilibrium molecular chemistry of 13 primordial species (e-, H, H+, H-, He, He+, He++, H 2, H 2 +, D, D+, HD, HeH+), performed {{by using the}} simulation code GADGET. We describe our implementation and show tests for ionized sphere expansion in a static and dynamic density field around a central radiative source, and for cosmological abundance evolution coupled with {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation. As a demonstrative application of radiative feedback on molecular gas, we run also cosmological simulations of early structure formation in a ~ 1 Mpc <b>size</b> <b>box.</b> Our tests agree well with analytical and numerical expectations. Consistently with other works, we find that ionization fronts from central sources can boost H 2 fractions in shock-compressed gas. The tight dependence on H 2 lead to a corresponding boost of HD fractions, as well. We see a strong lowering of the the typical molecular abundances up to several orders of magnitudes which partially hinders further gas collapse of pristine neutral gas, and clearly suggests the need of re-ionized gas or metal cooling for the formation of the following generation of structures.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the genus topology of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 catalog, with unprecedented statistical significance. To estimate the uncertainties in the measured genus, we construct 81 mock SDSS LRG surveys along the past light cone from the Horizon Run 3, {{one of the largest}} N-body simulations to date that evolved 7210 ^ 3 particles in a 10815 Mpc/h <b>size</b> <b>box.</b> After carefully modeling and removing all known systematic effects due to finite pixel size, survey boundary, radial and angular selection functions, shot noise and galaxy biasing, we find the observed genus amplitude to reach 272 at 22 Mpc/h smoothing scale with an uncertainty of 4. 2 %; the estimated error fully incorporates cosmic variance. This is the most accurate constraint of the genus amplitude to date, which significantly improves on our previous results. In particular, the shape of the genus curve agrees very well with the mean topology of the SDSS LRG mock surveys in the LCDM universe. However, comparison with simulations also shows small deviations of the observed genus curve from the theoretical expectation for Gaussian initial conditions. While these discrepancies are mainly driven by known systematic effects such as those of shot noise and redshift-space distortions, they do contain important cosmological information on the physical effects connected with galaxy formation, gravitational evolution and primordial non-Gaussianity. We address here the key role played by systematics on the genus curve, and show how to accurately correct for their effects to recover the topology of the underlying matter. In a forthcoming paper, we provide an interpretation of those deviations {{in the context of the}} local model of non-Gaussianity. Comment: 23 pages, 18 figures. APJ Supplement Series 201...|$|E
