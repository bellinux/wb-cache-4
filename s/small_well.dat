25|$|The area's Jewish {{community}} remained <b>small</b> <b>well</b> into Ottoman times, {{with the}} next major influx of Jews to the area coming with the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, and Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire welcomed Jews {{who were able to}} reach his territories. They were granted significant autonomy, with various rights including the right to buy real estate, to build synagogues and to conduct trade throughout the Ottoman Empire. Wealthy merchant cities in the present-day Republic of Macedonia such as Skopje, Monastir (present-day Bitola) and Štip attracted many Jews. Jews in this area prospered in the fields of trade, banking, medicine, and law, with some even reaching positions of power. The Jewish cemetery in Bitola was established in 1497, soon after the first Sephardic Jews moved to the area. The cemetery is the oldest Jewish cemetery in Macedonia, if not in the Balkans overall.|$|E
2500|$|After that assault, Henry took {{account of}} the desperate {{conditions}} in the Portuguese camp. [...] The army was starving, horses and beasts of burden were eaten. Thirst also began taking its deadly toll – the siege camp contained but a single <b>small</b> <b>well,</b> sufficient to slake only about one hundred men per day. [...] With so many wounded and weakened, Henry {{did not have enough}} men to garrison the full length of the stockade. [...] With the tacit permission of the Moroccan leaders, in an overnight operation on Saturday evening, Henry had his men reduce the circumference of the siege camp (and shift it slightly closer to the sea), allowing the Portuguese to defend themselves more effectively against renegade skirmishers. There were no more assaults on the Portuguese siege camp. [...] The truce was observed from Sunday, October 13 onwards.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile Hodgson's Australian Mounted Division, {{spent most}} of 9 November searching for water, which was {{eventually}} found at Huj. By the evening of 8 November, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had not watered since 7 November and the 5th Mounted Brigade since the evening of 6 November, and that if these two brigades were not watered the following day, the divisional war diary reported, [...] "results will be most serious." [...] After relieving these two brigades at 07:30 on 9 November, the 4th Light Horse brigade sent out patrols searching for water. The 12th Light Horse Regiment found one <b>small</b> <b>well</b> at Nejed, while another patrol found two wells at Simsim with basic lifting appliances which made watering very slow. They also found touch with the Anzac Mounted Division. By noon on 9 November the division was watering at Jemmameh, which was {{not expected to be}} completed until 18:00. After most of the horses had been watered, they advanced [...] to the Kastina–Isdud line capturing prisoners, guns, and transports on the way. This march made during the night of 9/10 November was the only night march made during the Sinai and Palestine campaign, through Ottoman territory.|$|E

60|$|Just {{outside the}} front door, not more than ten feet away, was a <b>small</b> <b>well,</b> which had once been stoned up properly, but was now fallen into such a state of decay that I {{questioned}} whether the water in it could be wholesome. At the time this seemed of but little moment, for {{it would not be}} a great task to bring from the river all the water one would need to drink, and I failed to give heed to the fact that if we were ever to use this cabin as a place of refuge the hour might come when we would suffer from thirst.|$|E

Yet about half-way we passed some old Indian ruins near Punta Gorda: I noticed also in front of some of the valleys which branch off from the Despoblado, two piles of stones placed a little way apart, and directed so as to point up the mouths of these small valleys.
