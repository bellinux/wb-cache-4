40|$|Twenty-six {{samples of}} hybrid maizes (ROSSO flint maize, VOLGA dent maize, DEA and MONARQUE flint-dent maizes) were dry-milled and {{separated}} into fractions. The milling yield was determined. Particle size {{was measured by}} mechanical sieving for grits, and by laser diffraction for coarse and fine <b>semolina</b> and <b>flours.</b> Bimodal particle size distributions of fine <b>semolina</b> and <b>flours</b> were analyzed {{as a function of}} mode size and proportion. Despite inherent variations in culture conditions, differences were apparent between VOLGA and the three other hybrids. The principal mode was characteristic of the fraction considered, without clear varietal differentiation. Analysis of the secondary mode of fine <b>semolina</b> and <b>flours</b> showed that it was principally due to particles similar in size to starch granules (14 to 17 /*m), VOLGA particles being smaller than the others. The relative "weight" of the secondary mode was greater with VOLGA than with the three other maize types. The small differences observed between DEA and the ROSSO and MONARQUE hybrids were not significant. A technological behaviour index is proposed: the calculated quantity (g) of very fine particles constituting the secondary modes of fine <b>semolina</b> and <b>flours</b> (per 1 g of ground maize). This index is inversely correlated with the yield of grits (r= 0. 913 for the 26 samples), and may therefore prove useful in the cultivation and processing of maize...|$|R
25|$|Additives in dried, commercially sold pasta include {{vitamins}} and minerals that are lost from the durum wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the <b>semolina</b> <b>flour</b> once it is ground. Vitamins added include niacin (Vitamin B3), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), folic acid (Vitamin B9) and thiamine (Vitamin B1), added back {{in the form of}} thiamin mononitrate. Ferrous iron is also included as a supplement.|$|E
25|$|Ingredients to make pasta dough include <b>semolina</b> <b>flour,</b> egg, {{salt and}} water. Flour is first mounded {{on a flat}} surface and then a well in the pile of flour is created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and flour. There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta {{depending}} on the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti, and macaroni.|$|E
25|$|Grain color (red, {{white or}} amber). Many wheat {{varieties}} are reddish-brown due to phenolic compounds {{present in the}} bran layer which are transformed to pigments by browning enzymes. White wheats have a lower content of phenolics and browning enzymes, and are generally less astringent in taste than red wheats. The yellowish color of durum wheat and <b>semolina</b> <b>flour</b> made from it {{is due to a}} carotenoid pigment called lutein, which can be oxidized to a colorless form by enzymes present in the grain.|$|E

25|$|Durum wheat {{is ground}} into <b>semolina</b> <b>flour</b> which is sorted by optical {{scanners}} and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing <b>semolina</b> <b>flour</b> with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E

2500|$|Dried pasta {{can also}} be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually {{produced}} in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. Dried pasta is mainly shipped over to farther locations and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make dried pasta include <b>semolina</b> <b>flour</b> and water. Eggs can be added for flavour and richness, but are not needed to make dried pasta. In contrast to fresh pasta, dried pasta needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. Dried pastas are best served in hearty dishes like ragu sauces, soups, and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the dried pasta will usually increase in size by double of its original proportion. Therefore, approximately [...] of dried pasta serves up to four people.|$|E
2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are <b>semolina</b> <b>flour</b> and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E

40|$|In the {{durum wheat}} industry, the milling process {{leads to the}} {{production}} of different fractions such as <b>semolina,</b> <b>flours,</b> bran and thirds. The histological origin and composition of these fractions are not easy to determine. Moreover, the proportions of kernel tissue in a given fraction depend on the wheat cultivar. In the present work, 4 batches of durum wheat were processed in an experimental semolina pilot plant leading to the extraction of 18 representative fractions. Multispectral images of both the final fractions and wheat kernels have been acquired with an in-house imaging system. By performing principal component analysis and a Kmeans procedure on the multispectral images of each fraction, a reference spectral fingerprint was assessed for every fraction. For each pixel of the images of kernel cross-section, it was possible to calculate its probability of belonging to a typical group of fingerprint, and then to build up a probability image. These probability images, presented in false colors, emphasized the areas in the kernels from which a given milled fraction was extracted. The images obtained in this way enable a more precise identification of the histological origin of the different milled fractions...|$|R
