40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{meteoroid}} and space debris impacts on LDEF experiment M 0003 was performed. The purpose of this survey was to document significant impact phenomenology and to obtain impact crater data for comparison to current space debris and micrometeoroid models. The survey consists of the following: photomicrographs of significant impacts {{in a variety of}} material types; accurate measurements of impact crater coordinates and dimensions for selected experiment surfaces; and databasing of the crater data for reduction, manipulation, and comparison to models. Large area surfaces that were studied include the experiment power and data system (EPDS) <b>sunshields,</b> environment exposure control canister (EECC) <b>sunshields,</b> and the M 0003 signal conditioning unit (SCU) covers. Crater diameters down to 25 microns were measured and cataloged. Both leading (D 8) and trailing (D 4) edge surfaces were studied and compared. The EPDS <b>sunshields</b> are aluminum panels painted with Chemglaze A- 276 white thermal control paint, the EECC <b>sunshields</b> are chromic acid-anodized aluminum, and the SCU covers are aluminum painted with S 13 GLO white thermal control paint. Typical materials that have documented impacts are metals, glasses and ceramics, composites, polymers, electronic materials, and paints. The results of this survey demonstrate the different response of materials to hypervelocity impacts. Comparison of the survey data to curves derived from the Kessler debris model and the Cour-Palais micrometeoroid model indicates that these models overpredict small impacts (less than 100 micron) and may underpredict large impacts (greater than 1000 micron) while having fair to good agreement for the intermediate impacts. Comparison of the impact distributions among the various surfaces indicates significant variations, which may be a function of material response effects, or in some cases surface roughness. Representative photographs and summary graphs of the impact data are presented...|$|R

40|$|Deployable space {{structures}} such as <b>sunshields</b> {{and solar}} sails are extremely thin and highly flexible with limited bending rigidity.

The solid shell element formulation that models a shell as a three-dimensional solid is convenient in that no rotational parameters are needed for the description of kinematics of deformation. However, shell elements may suffer from element locking as the thickness becomes smaller unless special care is taken. It is shown that, when combined with the assumed strain formulation, the solid shell element formulation results in finite element models that are free of locking even for extremely thin structures. Accordingly, they can be used for analysis of highly flexible space structures undergoing geometrically nonlinear finite rotations...|$|R

Examples include <b>sunshields</b> for large aperture telescopes, solar sails, and membrane optics. The development of capabilities for testing and analyzing pre-tensioned, thin film membrane structures is an important and challenging aspect of gossamer spacecraft technology development.

The test article is a 500 mm square membrane subjected to symmetric comer loads. Data is presented for loads ranging from 0. 49 N to 4. 91 N. The experimental results show that as the load increases the number of wrinkles increases, while the wrinkle amplitude decreases.

Comparisons were made with experimental results for the wrinkle angle and wrinkled region.

40|$|The Experimental Probe of Inflationary Cosmology (EPIC) is an {{implementation}} of the NASA Einstein Inflation Probe mission, {{to answer questions about}} the physics of Inflation in the early Universe by measuring the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The mission relies on a passive cooling system to cool the enclosure of a telescope to 30 K; a cryocooler then cools this enclosure to 18 K and the telescope to 4 K. Subsequently, an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator further cools a large focal plane to approx. 100 mK. For this mission, the telescope has an aperture of 1. 4 m, and the spacecraft's symmetry axis is oriented approx. 45 degrees relative to the direction of the sun. The spacecraft will be spun at approx. 0. 5 rpm around this axis, which then precesses on the sky at 1 rph.
