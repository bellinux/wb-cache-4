25|$|When the French troops {{left after}} about one week of occupation, they again looted Pforzheim {{and put it}} on fire. This time, all houses which had survived the two {{previous}} fires, were destroyed. In the Au suburb, only three houses survived. The Au bridge was heavily damaged. Only four houses survived in the Broetzingen suburb. The town church of St. Stephen and {{a large part of the}} Dominican monastery complex were also destroyed. The Castle Church (Schlosskirche) of St. Michael was heavily damaged, and the family tombs of the Margraves of Baden in the church were desecrated by the soldiers. The last remaining church bell and the churches' clockworks were stolen as well. The town wall was damaged again, including the town gates. After the week-long presence of 30,000 soldiers in a town of only a few thousand citizens, all food was gone, including the seeds saved for next spring's <b>sowing</b> <b>season.</b> Every tree and grapevine on the valley slopes had been used up as firewood.

The cowpea cultivars sown in December produced the lowest numbers of pods per plant and grains per pod, resulting in the lowest grain yields. The cultivar BRS - Tumucumaque had the highest grain yield in the January sowing.

The experimental design was Randomized Complete Block with two factorial split plot arrangement. Two <b>sowing</b> <b>seasons</b> i. e. autumn and spring and four row spacing i. e. 40, 50, 60 and 70 cm were studied for seeing the effect on seed germination, plant height, umbel appearance, umbel maturity, seed weight/umbel and seed yield.

40|$|Intercropping {{of annual}} crops with {{tropical}} forages {{is an effective}} cultivation method to maximize grain production and pasture formation. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of sunflower and the productive and nutritional characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha cultivars grown with intercropping during two different <b>sowing</b> <b>seasons</b> in the interim harvest of the Center-West region of Brazil. The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Rio Verde, Goiás (GO), using a randomized block design with a 3 x 2 + 4 factorial scheme and three replicates per treatment. The following factors were tested: three Brachiaria brizantha cultivars (Marandu palisadegrass, Piata palisadegrass and Xaraes palisadegrass) grown with intercropping in the inter-row with the sunflower cultivar Charrua in two different <b>sowing</b> <b>seasons</b> (February and March); four additional treatments of sunflower; and the three tested Brachiaria brizantha cultivars grown in monoculture. Intercropping of sunflower with the Xaraes palisadegrass cultivar negatively affected the agronomic characteristics of sunflower, and intercropping with Marandu palisadegrass and Piata palisadegrass cultivars is recommended. Preference should be given to the Xaraes palisadegrass cultivar for forage production and to the Piata palisadegrass cultivar for the production of forage with higher nutritional value. Sowing in March led to the best sunflower agronomic characteristics, without affecting the productive and nutritional characteristics of the forages. Intercropping of sunflower with Brachiaria brizantha cultivars is therefore a promising cultivation method for the production of achenes and forage during the inter-harvest in the Center-West region of Brazil...|$|R

In each leaf, the linear dimensions were measured (length, width, length/width ratio and length × width product) and the specific leaf area was determined through Digimizer and Sigma Scan Pro software, after scanning images. Then, 3, 200 leaves were randomly separated to generate mathematical models of leaf area (Y) in function of linear dimension (x), and 800 leaves for the models validation. In C. juncea, the leaf areas determined by Digimizer and Sigma Scan Pro software are identical. The estimation models of leaf area as a function of length × width product showed superior adjustments to those obtained based on the evaluation of only one linear dimension.
