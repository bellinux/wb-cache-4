An experimental program is being conducted at NASA-Lewis to measure the drop size and velocity distributions in <b>shear</b> coaxial injector <b>sprays.</b> A phase/Doppler interferometer is used to obtain drop size data in water air <b>shear</b> coaxial injector <b>sprays.</b> Droplet sizes and axial component of droplet velocities are measured at different radii for various combinations of water flow rate, air flow rate, injector liquid jet diameter, injector annular gap, and liquid post recess. Sauter mean diameters measured in the spray center 51 mm downstream of the liquid post tip range from 28 to 68 microns, and mean axial drop velocities at the same location range from 37 to 120 m/s. The <b>shear</b> coaxial injector <b>sprays</b> show {{a high degree of}} symmetry; the mean drop size and velocity profiles vary with liquid flow rate, post recess, and distance from the injector face. The drop size data can be used to estimate liquid oxygen/hydrogen spray drop sizes by correcting property differences between water-air and liquid oxygen/hydrogen...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the technical development and validation of a multiphase {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) numerical method using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) model and a Lagrangian tracking model which can be employed to analyze general multiphase flow problems with free surface mechanism. The gas-liquid interface mass, momentum and energy conservation relationships are modeled by continuum surface mechanisms. A new solution method is developed such that the present VOF model can be applied for all-speed flow regimes. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to develop and verify the fractional volume-of-fluid cell partitioning approach into a predictor-corrector algorithm and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach by simulating benchmark problems including laminar impinging jets, shear coaxial jet atomization and <b>shear</b> coaxial <b>spray</b> combustion flows...|$|R
40|$|Average {{production}} from longwall mining {{operations in the}} United States has risen from approximately 800 tons per shift in 1980 to over 4, 600 metric tons per shift in 1999. Such a large increase in production {{has the potential to}} generate significantly more dust. Previous NIOSH research has shown that, on average, respirable dust levels generated by the shearer accounts for 50 % of the airborne dust generated during longwall mining. Ventilating air and water are primary controls being used in an effort to reduce longwall dust levels. Longwall operators are applying more air and water than ever before and have expressed concern over reaching maximum practical limits for these controls. Full-scale laboratory tests are being conducted to evaluate the impact on shearer-generated dust levels for changes in face air velocity, water quantity at the <b>shearer,</b> water <b>spray</b> pressure, spray system design, mining height and cutting direction. Results of this research should identify the most appropriate control levels for various operating conditions. In addition, general recommended dust control practices for longwall mining will be discussed. KEYWORDS Longwall, coal dus...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of externally bonded sprayed {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (<b>Sprayed</b> GFRP) in <b>shear</b> strengthening of RC beams under quasi-static loading is investigated. Different techniques were utilized {{to enhance the}} bond between concrete and Sprayed GFRP, involving the use of through bolts and nuts paired with concrete surface preparation through sandblasting and {{through the use of a}} pneumatic chisel prior to Sprayed GFRP application. It was found that roughening the concrete surface using a pneumatic chisel and using through bolts and nuts were the most effective techniques. Also, Sprayed GFRP applied on 3 sides (U-shaped) was found to be more effective than 2 -sided <b>Sprayed</b> GFRP in <b>shear</b> strengthening. <b>Sprayed</b> GFRP increased the shear load-carrying capacity and energy absorption capacities of RC beams. It was found that the load-carrying capacity of strengthened RC beams was related to an effective strain of applied Sprayed GFRP. This strain was related to Sprayed GFRP configuration and the technique used to enhance the concrete-FRP bond. Finally, an equation was proposed to calculate the contribution of Sprayed GFRP in the shear strength of an RC beam...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of propellant mixing near the injector {{have a profound}} effect on the liquid rocket engine performance. However, the flow features near the injector of liquid rocket engines are extremely complicated, for example supercritical-pressure spray, turbulent mixing, and chemical reactions are present. Previously, a homogeneous spray approach with a real-fluid property model was developed to account for the compressibility and evaporation effects such that thermodynamics properties of a mixture at a wide range of pressures and temperatures can be properly calculated, including liquid-phase, gas- phase, two-phase, and dense fluid regions. The developed homogeneous spray model demonstrated a good success in simulating uni- element <b>shear</b> coaxial injector <b>spray</b> combustion flows. However, the real-fluid model suffered a computational deficiency when applied to a pressure-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The deficiency is caused by the pressure and enthalpy being the independent variables in the solution procedure of a pressure-based code, whereas the real-fluid model utilizes density and temperature as independent variables. The objective of the present research work is to improve the computational efficiency of the real-fluid property model in computing thermal properties. The proposed approach is called an efficient real-fluid model, and the improvement of computational efficiency is achieved by using a combination of a liquid species and a gaseous species to represent a real-fluid species...|$|R
40|$|Intermediate {{filaments}} (IFs) {{assembled in}} vitro from recombinantly expressed proteins have {{a diameter of}} 8 â€“ 12 nm and can reach several micrometers in length. IFs assemble from a soluble pool of subunits, tetramers {{in the case of}} vimentin. Upon salt addition, the subunits form first unit length filaments (ULFs) within seconds and then assembly proceeds further by endto-end fusion of ULFs and short filaments. So far, IF subunits have mainly been observed by electron microscopy of glycerol sprayed and rotary metal shadowed specimens. Due to the <b>shear</b> forces during <b>spraying</b> the IF subunits appear generally as straight thin rods. In this study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) combined with molecular modeling to investigate the conformation of the subunits of vimentin, desmin and keratin K 5 /K 14 IFs in various conditions. Due to their anisotropic shape the subunits are difficult to image at high resolution by cryo-EM. In order to enhance contrast we used a cryo-negative staining approach. The subunits were clearly identified as thin, slightly curved rods. However the staining agent also forced the subunits to aggregate into two-dimensional networks of dot-like structures. To test this conformational change further, we imaged dried unfixed subunits on mica by AFM revealing a mixture of extended and dot-like conformations. The use of divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium, as well as glutaraldehyde exposure favored compact conformations over elongated ones. These experimental results as well a...|$|R
40|$|Atomization {{characteristics}} of liquid fuel sprays control combustion efficiency and emissions in engines. The present work {{is motivated by}} the need to study the atomization and spray structure of vegetable oil biofuels for which no data in the literature exists. In this work, various laser-based diagnostic techniques such as laser shadowgraphy, Particle/Droplet Image Analysis (PDIA) and Laser Sheet Dropsizing (LSD) are applied for studying atomization characteristics, tip penetration, droplet size and liquid volume fraction of Pongamia vegetable oil (SVO) and its blends with diesel. A constant volume high pressure spray visualization chamber is designed and fabricated to study SVO sprays at high gas pressure and temperature conditions. This optical chamber can be used for gas pressures up to 60 bar and temperatures up to 600 K. Optical access inside the chamber is provided through four quartz windows to perform various optical spray diagnostic studies. A high pressure spray injection facility based on components of common rail diesel injection system is designed. This facility can provide an injection pressure of up to 1700 bar with independent control over injection duration and timing. A marked difference is observed between diesel and SVO spray structures under atmospheric gas pressure condition. A very interesting observation related to the behavior of 100 % SVO fuel when sprayed into atmospheric pressure is the presence of an intact liquid core even at injection pressure as high as 1600 bar. The presence of liquid core at high injection pressures is attributed to the high viscosity of SVOs and the non-Newtonian behavior of these oils under high pressure and <b>shear.</b> The <b>spray</b> characterization of the oil and its blends at high gas pressure shows that although the atomization is dramatically different from that at atmospheric gas pressure, it is still incomplete even at very high injection pressures. For a gas pressure of 30 bar, it is observed that the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) for Pongamia oil is more than twice that of diesel. A new method of simultaneously obtaining two-dimensional droplet size and quantitative liquid volume fraction data in sprays has been developed. Measurements with this method reveal a higher liquid volume fraction at the central axis of spray for Pongamia oil compared to that of diesel indicating potentially poor air-fuel mixing. The experimental data obtained and the spray tip penetration correlations developed for the vegetable oils and blends serve as useful inputs for fuel injection and engine system designers...|$|R
40|$|Spray drift {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} issues facing aerial applicators. Material not applied to the target crop or pest is a financial loss for the farmer and a potential liability for the applicator. Off-site drift also represents an environmental liability, particularly as habitat and water quality concerns demand greater attention with larger buffer and/or no-spray zones. Current practice delivers liquid material through a nozzle, under pressure, and utilizes air shear for at least a portion of the atomization, creating a range of droplets with those less than 200 microns, known as fines, particularly susceptible to off-site drift. As airspeed increases, so does the effect of air <b>shear</b> on the <b>spray</b> leaving the nozzle, resulting in further shatter/fracture of droplets producing even more fines, leading to more off-site drift. Control of the nozzle environment allows for control of air velocity where atomization occurs, reducing the production of driftable fines and reducing off-site movement of spray material. Control of nozzle environment is accomplished using a chamber having three sections, called a Reverse Venturi Atomization Chamber (RVA). Air enters the first section (diffuser), with a restricted opening, and flows into a larger area (settling chamber) where air velocities are reduced, the nozzle is located, and where atomization occurs. The atomized spray and air then travel through the third chamber section (constrictor) where they are accelerated to match the aircraftâ€™s air speed. By reducing the air speed were atomization occurs, the atomization profile demonstrates fewer fines, leading to less drift. Data to date, using the prototype RVA, water as the test medium, and a selection of commercially available nozzles, we have demonstrated up to a 74 % reduction in fines at 100 mph and 58 % reduction in fines at 150 mph air speed...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology is the {{manipulation}} of matter and devices on the nanometer scale. Below the critical dimension length of 100 nm, materials begin to display vastly different properties than their macro- or micro- scale counterparts. The exotic properties of nanomaterials may trigger {{the start of a}} new technological revolution, similar to the electronics revolution of the late 20 th century. Current applications of nanotechnology primarily make use of nanoparticles in bulk, often being made into composites or mixtures. While these materials have fantastic properties, organization of nano and microstructures of nanoparticles may allow the development of novel devices with many unique properties. By analogy, bulk copper may be used to form the alloys brass or bronze, which are useful materials, and have been used for thousands of years. Yet, organized arrays of copper allowed the development of printed circuit boards, a technology far more advanced than the mere use of copper as a bulk material. In the same way, organized assemblies of nanoparticles may offer technological possibilities far beyond our current understanding. In the first project, 1 D assemblies of nanoparticles were explored. 1 D anisotropic assemblies of nanoparticles are the simplest organized nanostructures which may be fabricated. One of the greatest difficulties in developing commercial products is in the transfer of a process from the laboratory to manufacturing scale. While many techniques may be used to develop 1 D assemblies in lab, simple techniques are needed to allow the fabrication of these assemblies on a large, cost effective scale. Use of shear, shown previously to induce colloidal ordering in solutions, is a technique that may be readily adapted from the coatings industry as a process for forming 1 D assemblies, if the optimal conditions can be found. Atomic force microscopy was used to study the role of shearing forces produced by drawdown and spraying application in the formation of 1 D assemblies of nanoparticles. Formation of 1 D strings was observed to increase with greater application of simple <b>shear,</b> but greater <b>spraying</b> forces were found to decrease formation of strings. This is explained in terms of greater simple shear providing a greater driving force for string formation, while greater <b>spraying</b> <b>shear</b> acted to irreversibly disperse the particles. The second project focused on the development of a learning module for education of students at various academic levels on the significance of the surface area of nanomaterials. This project was commissioned by the Global Waste Research Institute, a multidisciplinary organization based at Cal Poly, concerned with performing research and education in areas related to waste management, particularly of emerging waste streams. As nanotechnology and nanoparticles become more prevalent in consumer products and industrial processes, the volume of nanowaste is increasing rapidly. To address challenges associated with processing this unique form of waste, understanding of the fundamental processes controlling the unique properties of nanoparticles is necessary. A learning module was developed using a laboratory demonstration and video presentation to illustrate concepts related to differences in the properties between microparticles and nanoparticles. The laboratory demonstration was designed to be simple to understand, and quick, simple, and inexpensive to perform. The video presentation was designed to be a 15 minute presentation relating the concepts of nanotechnology, nanoparticles, surface area, and fundamental differences as compared to conventional materials. Dispersions of particles within aqueous media were used as a framework for the discussion, in a manner comprehensible by students ranging from 12 th grade high school students to graduate students in relevant programs. The third and final project focused on self-assembly of particles in nematic liquid crystalline colloids. Dispersions of colloidal particles in liquid crystals (LCs) are a relatively new set of composite materials, host to a variety of interactions not seen in colloids in isotropic media. Presence of colloidal particles disrupts the local nematic director, resulting in a loss of long-range elastic energy. Interactions between particles and LC molecules results in dipolar or quadrupolar defects, depending on the nature of the interactions between particle and LC. The loss of long-range elastic energy can be minimized through aggregation of particles. The defects formed by interactions between particles and LC stabilize these aggregations as linear chains, either along the nematic director in the case of dipolar defects, or at an offset angle in the case of quadrupolar defects. Dispersions of silica microspheres in the nematic phase of a thermotropic liquid crystal were studied using polarizing light microscopy. Strong homeotropic anchoring was observed, indicated by the abundant formation of hedgehog defects. These defects were found to play a role in self-assembly of particles along the nematic director, resulting aggregates containing up to a dozen aligned particles. In addition, particles were observed to aggregate in chains along grain boundaries in the liquid crystal, acting to stabilize the high energy interface between different grain directions, an effect not previously reported in the scientific literature for nematic colloids...|$|R
40|$|Incorporation of {{probiotic}} {{cultures in}} products {{in order to}} replenish or supplement the normal gastrointestinal microflora is a well known and accepted practice. However survival of these cultures is a problem due {{to a number of}} reasons including effects of storage conditions. Various researchers from different countries around the world have reported probiotic product instability. Microencapsulation has been used in an attempt to solve this problem. However, most methods involve the use of organic solvents which is not ideal because their toxicity may cause destruction of the microbial cells. A novel encapsulation method for probiotics, which excludes the use of organic solvents, was developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) (US Patent Application no. 20050112205). This thesis investigated the efficiency/potential of this new method for increasing stability of sensitive probiotic cultures, specifically bifidobacteria. Early studies using both culture dependent and culture independent techniques showed reduced numbers of viable cultures in probiotic products, mainly yoghurts, from all around the world. These results were confirmed in this study for similar products sold in South Africa. Most of the product labels did not specify viable numbers of probiotics nor the identity (genus and species names) of the microorganisms incorporated. Successful encapsulation of bifidobacteria was achieved using the CSIR patented method. Complete encapsulation was indicated by absence of cells on surfaces of the encapsulated particles and production of a product with an acceptable particle size distribution was obtained. It was also demonstrated that the encapsulation process produced no visible morphological changes to the bacterial cells nor did it {{have a negative effect on}} cell viability over time. The potential of interpolymer complex formation in scCO 2 for the encapsulation of sensitive probiotic cultures was demonstrated for the first time. Once ingested, probiotic cultures are exposed to unfavourable acidic conditions in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It is desired that these cultures be protected from this in order to increase the viability of the probiotics for efficient colonization. Interpolymer complex encapsulated B. longum Bb- 46 cells were therefore exposed to simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and subsequently to simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). It was found that the interpolymer complex protected bifidobacteria from gastric acidity, displaying pH-responsive release properties, with little to no release in SGF and substantial release in SIF. Thus the interpolymer complex demonstrated desirable characteristics retaining the encapsulated bacteria inside when conditions were unfavourable and only releasing them under favourable conditions. Survival was improved by the incorporation of glyceryl monostearate (GMS) in the matrix and by use of gelatine capsules. Protection efficiency of the interpolymer matrix was better when higher loading of GMS was used. Use of polycaprolactone (PCL) as an alternative to poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and incorporation of ethylene oxide-propylene oxide triblock copolymer (PEO-PPO-PEO) affected the interpolymer complex negatively, rendering it swellable in the low pH environment exposing the bifidobacteria to gastric acidity. The use of beeswax seemed to have a more protective effect though results were inconclusive. Probiotic cultures must also remain viable in products during storage. Encapsulated bacteria were either harvested from the reactor after 2 h of equilibration followed by depressurization, and then ground to a fine powder or after 2 h of equilibration the liquefied product was sprayed through a capillary tube with a heated nozzle at the end, into the product chamber. Encapsulated bacteria were stored in either sterile plastic bags or glass bottles under different conditions and then viable counts were determined over time. Survival of bacteria was generally better when the products were stored in glass bottles than in plastic bags. Bacteria encapsulated in an interpolymer complex formed between PVP and vinyl acetate-crotonic acid copolymer (VA-CA), (PVP:VA-CA) survived better than non-encapsulated bacteria under all storage conditions when the product was recovered from the reaction chamber. When the product was recovered from the product chamber, numbers of viable non-encapsulated bacteria were higher than the encapsulated bacteria for all interpolymer complex formulations. This was probably due to some exposure to high <b>shear</b> during <b>spraying</b> into the product chamber. The interpolymer complex between PCL and VA-CA i. e. PCL:VA-CA seemed weaker than the PVP:VA-CA nterpolymer complex as viable counts of bacteria released from it were lower than those from the latter complex. Addition of PEO-PPO-PEO to both the PVP:VA-CA and PCL:VA-CA complexes decreased the protection efficiency. However, results indicated that sufficient release of encapsulated bacteria from the interpolymer complexes was obtained when the encapsulated material was incubated in SIF rather than in Ringerâ€™s solution. When SIF was used for release of encapsulated bacteria, the shelf life of B. longum Bb- 46 was doubled. Encapsulation in an interpolymer complex therefore provided protection for encapsulated cells and thus has potential for improving shelf life of probiotic cultures in products. Further studies will investigate the effects of encapsulating probiotics together with prebiotics in the interpolymer complex as well as effects of encapsulating combinations of different probiotic strains together, both on survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract and during storage. The unique particles produced using the patented encapsulation technique increased the stability of probiotic cultures. This technique may find significant application in industries manufacturing probiotic products, especially food and pharmaceuticals, thereby improving the well being of consumers.
