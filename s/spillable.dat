He, too, an ambitious, formidable man, who showed alike in his practice {{and in his}} theory, in his lack of sympathy for Rossetti and Landor, for instance, that he never understood how small a fragment of our own nature {{can be brought to}} perfect expression, nor that even but with great toil, in a much divided civilization; though, doubtless, if our own Phase be right, a fragment may be an image of the whole, the moon's still scarce crumbled image, as it were, in a glass of wine. He would be, and have all poets be, a true epitome of the whole mass, a Herrick and Dr. Johnson in the same body and because this--not so difficult before the Mermaid closed its door--is no longer possible, his work lacks music, is abstract, as even an actor's movement can be when the thought of doing is plainer to his mind than the doing itself: the straight line from cup to lip, let us say, more plain than the hand's own sensation weighed down by that heavy <b>spillable</b> cup. I think he was content, when he had called before our eyes--before the too understanding eyes of his chosen crowd--the violent burly man that he had dreamed, content with the mere suggestion, and so did not work long enough at his verses. He disliked Victor Hugo as much as he did Rossetti, and yet Rossetti's translation from Les Burgraves, because of its mere technical mastery, out-sings Henley in his own song-- ...|$|E
