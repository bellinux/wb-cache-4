In this article we address the increasing importance of virtual <b>social</b> <b>worlds,</b> and discuss how companies can make use of their potential. We first present how virtual <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> evolved historically, how they fit into the postmodern paradigm of our time, and how they differ from other social media, such as content communities (e. g., YouTube), social networking sites and blogs (e. g., Facebook), collaborative projects (e. g., Wikipedia), and virtual game worlds (e. g., World of Warcraft). We subsequently present how firms can make use of virtual <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> in the areas of advertising/communication, virtual product sales (v-Commerce), marketing research, human resources, and internal process management. We also highlight the points companies should pay particular attention to in their activities, the 5 Cs of success in virtual <b>social</b> <b>worlds,</b> and the future evolutions that we expect to shape this sector over the next 5 - 10 years: a trend toward standardization and interoperability, improvements in software usability, increasing interconnection between reality and virtual worlds, establishment of law and order, and the transformation of virtual <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> to business hubs of the future. <b>Social</b> media Virtual <b>worlds</b> Virtual <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> Second Life...|$|R

25|$|Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the {{subjective}} {{structures of the}} habitus can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> explains {{the continuity of the}} social order through time. As the individual habitus is always a mix of multiple engagements in the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.|$|E
25|$|As {{humans are}} a highly social species, {{there are many}} {{adaptive}} problems associated with navigating the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making). Researchers in the emerging field of evolutionary social psychology have made many discoveries pertaining to topics traditionally studied by social psychologists, including person perception, social cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, group dynamics, leadership, motivation, prejudice, intergroup relations, and cross-cultural differences.|$|E

Almost all new wives come into a village from other settlements, and daughters marry out. All villagers have close kinship ties with families in other villages, and marriage go-betweens shuttle from village to village.|$|E

25|$|In part two, Unger {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; {{we want to see}} the self as transcending all of the fixed <b>social</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
40|$|Though {{children}} {{are capable of}} describing themselves and their lives in candid and lucid fashion (e. g., Coles, 1970), their voices are easily supplanted or discredited by the adult (Cahan, Mechling, Sutton-Smith, & White, 1993). A similar phenomenon, girls' loss of self-identity and voice, has been studied by Gilligan (1982). The research design of this dissertation, a qualitative, phenomenological approach, facilitates the documentation of children's <b>social</b> <b>worlds.</b> Extensive observations, interviews, home visits, monolingual and bilingual dialogue journal interactions, and a researcher as "peer" role are among the methodological tools used to provide a panoramic of Mexican and Mexican American language minority children's <b>social</b> <b>worlds.</b> Additionally, the dissertation has been guided by an interdisciplinary approach {{to the study of}} children's <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> and inner lives. This approach is reflected in the dissertation itself, as found, for example, in the following chapters: A Socio-Historic Perspective to Understanding the Development of Childhood in South Tucson, Arizona; A Phenomenological Approach to the Construction of Reality; An Ecological Approach to Human Development and its Social Context; Bronfenbrenner's Ecology of Human Development; and Consequences of El'konin's Theoretical Premise. Children's <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> or peer cultures are at worst viewed pejoratively, as inferior subcultures, especially for minority children. This perception is misleading, inferring that these worlds are necessarily insignificant and detrimental to the child (Marsh, Rosser & Harre, 1978). Within the many <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> children create for themselves and those which they participate in, children gain vital knowledge and create networks of support crucial to their development and survival as humans. Those worlds are evidenced in ecological environments where children lead creative, meaningful, and sometimes problematic lives. The educational and societal potential for understanding those <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> lies in its contributions to the development and practice of pedagogically relevant theory...|$|R

25|$|Prominent {{themes in}} Hindu beliefs include the four Puruṣārthas, the proper goals or aims of human life, namely Dharma (ethics/duties), Artha (prosperity/work), Kama (desires/passions) and Moksha (liberation/freedom/salvation); karma (action, intent and consequences), Saṃsāra (cycle of rebirth), {{and the various}} Yogas (paths or {{practices}} to attain moksha). Hindu practices include rituals such as puja (worship) and recitations, meditation, family-oriented rites of passage, annual festivals, and occasional pilgrimages. Some Hindus leave their <b>social</b> <b>world</b> and material possessions, then engage in lifelong Sannyasa (monastic practices) to achieve Moksha. Hinduism prescribes the eternal duties, such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings (ahimsa), patience, forbearance, self-restraint, and compassion, among others. The four largest denominations of Hinduism are the Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartism.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{of these}} ideas on current {{thinking}} on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> these animals are under strong competitive pressure not to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might {{prove to be a}} fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.|$|E

25|$|Doxa {{refers to}} the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, {{unconscious}} beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent's actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus, being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may {{be thought of as}} a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the 'subjective', internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state, the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.|$|E
25|$|For Bourdieu, the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> has {{gradually}} divided {{into what he}} calls fields. For him, the differentiation of social activities led to the constitution of various, relatively autonomous, social spaces in which competition centers around particular species of capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basis—with economic power usually governing—wherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of social actors trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of conflict theory like Marx. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> in which one comes to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E
500|$|Structure and agency, {{sometimes}} referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: [...] "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" [...] In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology ("What is the <b>social</b> <b>world</b> made of?", [...] "What is a cause in the <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> and what is an effect?"). A perennial question within this debate is that of [...] "social reproduction": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals? ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{conceptual}} essay {{we argue}} {{that the study of}} migration can substantially benefit from an interactionist notion of integration. Basing our considerations on Berger’s and Luckmann’s sociology of knowledge, we develop a differentiated understanding of integration as an ongoing process which comes to be institutionalized in characteristic forms. With regard to these forms of institutionalization, we focus our attention on the relatively stable spheres of social action characterized by Anselm Strauss as <b>social</b> <b>worlds,</b> structures that are continuously produced anew and altered through processes of segmentation, intersection and legitimation. Furthermore, we propose five ideal types of <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> reflecting the perspective of migrants. In addition, we indicate the transnational scope of <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> and the importance of personal coping strategies. We emphasize the significance of the conflicts occurring in and between <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> as part of processes of integration and highlight a number of strategies that make symbolic integration within the public sphere possible. Furthermore, we list central institutionalized cultural forms and social modes which have a decisive impact on interaction between migrants and the autochthonous population: categorization, stereotyping and drawing boundaries, negotiating, conflict and permanent reflection. Finally, we explain the specific contribution our approach offers to the current theoretical discussion in the field of migration studies and close with a summary of our arguments...|$|R
