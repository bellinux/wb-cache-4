5|$|In October 1940, {{as part of}} a {{reorganisation}} of the Commando formations, {{the unit}} was amalgamated with No. 8 (Guards) Commando into a single <b>special</b> <b>service</b> battalion known as the 4th <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock. As a part of this organisation, the unit's name was changed to 'A' <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Company. At the end of 1940, the <b>special</b> <b>service</b> battalions were reorganised into a headquarters and two Commandos {{and the name of the}} unit reverted to No. 3 Commando. In January 1941 the <b>special</b> <b>service</b> battalions were broken up, the Commandos were delinked and raised back to full battalion-sized units themselves.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from North Africa, No. 6 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. The grouping of the commandos into brigades underneath the divisional-sized <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Group headquarters was part of the general reorganisation that took place in late 1943 as the evolution of their role from raiding to assault infantry was formalised. This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in the allocation of indirect and direct fire support weapons at commando level. Further support units were added at brigade level, including administration, transport, logistics and signals.|$|E

In November 1940 the new army units were organised into a <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade under Brigadier J. C. Haydon, with four <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Battalions. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training.|$|E

5|$|The Commando units {{went through}} a number of {{organisational}} structures as the concept was refined and their roles became clearer throughout the course of the war. Upon formation, No. 3 Commando had an establishment of 535 all ranks organised into ten troops each with 50 men underneath a headquarters troop. In late 1940, the Commando units were merged into a <b>special</b> <b>service</b> brigade which was made up of five <b>special</b> <b>service</b> battalions, each of which were made up of two company-sized elements. By the end of the year, this was changed again as the battalions were organised around a headquarters and two Commandos. The <b>special</b> <b>service</b> battalion organisation was discontinued in March 1941, and the unit establishment was set at 470 all ranks, with a headquarters troop of 80 officers and men and six troops of three officers and 62 other ranks.|$|E

5|$|When it {{was clear}} at 03:00 that the German Army {{in front of the}} {{division}} was pulling back, the first divisional unit to follow up was the 3rd Parachute Brigade. By 07:00 Bures was occupied by the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions and by 08:00 the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was in the Bois de Bavent. The rest of the division started advancing around the same time. The 4th <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade headed for Troan and Saint Pair, while the 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade made for Bavent and Robehomme. In the north, the 6th Airlanding Brigade started moving along the road from Bréville to Merville.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from Italy, No. 3 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. It marked the end of the unit's independence, as from then {{they were part of a}} larger organisation, and the role of the Commandos had evolved from small scale raiding and precision operations, to more large scale operations in which they were mainly used as highly trained infantry assault units.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade, No.4 Commando {{took part}} in the Normandy Landings in June 1944. Landing on Sword beach 30 minutes before the rest of the brigade, their first {{objectives}} were to capture a strong point and gun battery in Ouistreham. After the commandos eliminated these positions they rejoined the brigade, reinforcing the 6th Airborne Division at the Orne bridges. Before the invasion the brigade had been informed that they would stay in France for only a few days. The commando remained there for a further 82 days, protecting the beachhead's left flank. During that period, No.4 Commando endured over 50 percent casualties. Finally withdrawn to Britain in September 1944, they were reassigned to the 4th <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade for the assault on Walcheren island. At {{the end of the war}} No.4 Commando became part of the occupation force in Germany, but together with all other army commando units were disbanded in 1946.|$|E
5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used {{in the formation of the}} four <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} unit became {{involved}} in largely defensive operations as the 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they kept up {{the pressure on the}} Germans by carrying out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando was involved in this advance, moving to Varaville where they caught up with the German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August {{a patrol}} from the 13th Parachute Battalion succeeded in {{crossing}} the eastern {{branch of the}} river, and was quickly reinforced {{by the rest of}} the battalion.

The next day, patrols from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night, and they therefore crossed the river and secured the high ground to the north, closely followed {{by the rest of the}} brigade. On 25August the 1st <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade took over as the lead formation, and headed towards Beuzeville, but once again German defences held up the advance. The 3rd Parachute Brigade and the 4th <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Brigade carried out a left flanking attack to capture the village, suffering heavy losses from German mortar fire.|$|E
