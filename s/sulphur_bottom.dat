25|$|Sulphur Springs Ball Park, as it {{was first}} known, was located in an area {{referred}} to by early settlers as French Lick Springs. Pioneers came to this bottomland, or dell, for trading and watering at a natural sulphur spring. Also known as <b>Sulphur</b> Springs <b>Bottom,</b> this later became a popular area for picnicking and recreation.|$|R
25|$|Nashvillians {{started playing}} {{baseball}} {{as early as}} the 1850s. Many local amateur baseball teams played their games at <b>Sulphur</b> Springs <b>Bottom.</b> In order to meet the city's need for a dedicated baseball field, a portion of the dell was designated for this purpose and called Sulphur Springs Ball Park. By 1870, the baseball grounds were referred to as Athletic Park.|$|R
50|$|After {{the war he}} {{operated}} with a gang {{he organized}} with outlaw Lee Rames in the late 1860s, operating out of the <b>Sulphur</b> River <b>bottoms</b> near Bright Star, Arkansas, committing acts of robbery and murder. Authorities credit him officially with killing at least 30 people, though many of these no doubt were killed by his men. Unlike the romanticized versions of his exploits, the reality was that he killed most of them from ambush or in the back, and many with a shotgun, and he almost always had his victims outnumbered. Like many of the ex-Confederates who operated after the war, Baker {{was regarded as a}} hero by some because he opposed the Union occupation, but his record shows a merciless killer who killed anyone who angered him, regardless of their loyalties.|$|R

60|$|BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur Bottom).--Another {{retiring}} gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping {{along the}} Tartarian tiles {{in some of}} his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu, <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom!</b> I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.|$|E
50|$|From 1903 to 1907, the Nashville {{club was}} unable to muster {{anything}} better than a fifth-place finish. 1904 was their only winning season and by 1907 the team was in last place. Still lacking an official team name, the club {{was referred to as}} the Finnites when Mickey Finn managed the team from 1905 to 1906, the Dobbers when John Dobbs managed the team in 1907, and the Senators, probably due to the nearby Tennessee State Capitol building which overlooked Athletic Park.In 1908, Nashville Tennessean sports writer Grantland Rice held a contest to name the team. The public was invited to mail in votes for one of three team names: the Limerocks (from the abundance of limestone in and around Nashville), the Rocks, and the Volunteers (from the state's nickname, The Volunteer State). The winner and new official team name was the Volunteers, though this was often shortened to Vols. Rice also gave Nashville's Athletic Park a new name: Sulphur Dell, a reference to the location's prior name of <b>Sulphur</b> Springs <b>Bottom.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first Europeans {{to enter}} {{what would become}} Tennessee {{were part of the}} {{expedition}} led by Hernando de Soto in the 16th century. Although the exact route of the Desoto expedition is unclear, they do not appear to have reached Middle Tennessee or the Nashville area. Instead, the earliest Europeans in what would become Nashville were French fur traders such as Jean du Charleville (aka Charles Charleville), who in 1710 established a trading post at a natural sulphur and saline spring near what is now Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park. The natural salt lick attracted animals, which in turn attracted Native American hunters with whom the French could trade, and the area became known as [...] "French Lick." [...] This same portion of Nashville would later be known as <b>Sulphur</b> Spring <b>Bottom</b> and <b>Sulphur</b> Dell. In 1769, French-Canadian hunter Timothy Demonbreun began a series of trips up the Cumberland to Nashville and built a cabin near the lick to use as a base of operations for fur trapping during his visits to the area. Demonbreun settled in Nashville permanently in 1788, and ran a tavern and mercantile business.|$|R

50|$|Home {{from the}} Hill (1958) is Humphrey’s {{first and most}} famous novel. It {{is the story of}} the aristocratic Hunnicutt family. Captain Wade Hunnicutt, though admirable in many ways, is a philanderer; and his wife, Hannah, {{encourages}} his affairs, even picking his partners, and she unwittingly becomes the catalyst for the catastrophic undoing of the family. The love between their son Theron and Libby Halstead ends when the captain is murdered by Libby’s father: Theron disappears into the <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Bottom</b> swamp as he pursues his father’s killer. Hannah lives another fifteen years in a mental asylum. The Hunnicutt family is a holdover from the Old South; the family is fated to end in destruction for the same reason that the Old South itself was destroyed—because of a moral corruption at its core.|$|E
