5|$|One Kclass rebuild has survived: No.A806 River Torridge – {{converted}} to Uclass No.1806 – was rescued from Woodham Brothers <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales in October 1976 {{for use on}} the Watercress Line. It was restored to ex-British Railways condition as No.31806. In August 2014, the locomotive entered service with the Swanage Railway.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a <b>scrap</b> <b>yard.</b> At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, {{during the}} cold war era, Hughes was {{approached}} by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. However, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters during a burglary in June 1974. Though he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean Inc. (an offshore oil and gas drilling rig company) and was sent to the <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.|$|E

40|$|Metal theft {{has become}} a {{substantial}} crime problem in many areas. In response, several countries have introduced legislation to regulate scrap-metal recycling yards. However, at present {{there is little evidence}} to support this use of the market reduction approach (MRA) in preventing metal theft. The present study sought to test the underlying assumption of the MRA that the presence of a market for stolen property (in this case provided by <b>scrap</b> <b>yards)</b> drives thefts in a local area. This study tested for a spatial association between the locations of <b>scrap</b> <b>yards</b> and those of metal thefts. The density of industry, local burglary rate and road-accessibility of an area were controlled for. Metal thefts from railway lines in England were shown to be significantly more common in areas with more scrap-metal yards, high road accessibility and high population density. The results support the use of the MRA in relation to metal theft...|$|R

500|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} an estimated 4,000 additional students, existing commercial buildings were sought {{to convert into}} high school buildings. After scouring the city, two possible sites were chosen. One near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds and the other near the school's current location. The proposed area was the former site of an auto <b>scrap</b> <b>yard.</b> Officials were worried that the location would be polluted and would require an expensive cleanup. As a result, the location was moved to a site approximately [...] west. Of the current [...] acre campus, roughly [...] were from a failed housing project and the other [...] were from homes that were bought and cleared. Some of the soil on the site was unstable and was replaced. Critics considered the location for being too close to Como Park and Johnson high schools and for being located in a residential neighborhood. Original estimates for the project cost $54.3 million {{and as a result}} the Saint Paul school district authorized a $20 million bond. Knutson Construction Co. was chosen for the project.|$|E
500|$|Petty thief Louis [...] "Lou" [...] Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) {{is caught}} {{stealing}} from a Los Angeles construction site by a security guard. He attacks the guard, steals {{his watch and}} leaves with the stolen material. After selling the material at a <b>scrap</b> <b>yard,</b> Lou asks for a job, but the foreman {{says he does not}} hire thieves. While driving home, Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record two police officers pulling a woman from the wreck. One of the stringers, Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), tells Lou that they sell their footage to local news stations. Inspired, Lou steals a bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) tells him the station is especially interested in footage of violent incidents in affluent areas. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate for money. To give his footage more impact, Lou begins tampering with crime scenes and in one case moves a body. As Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car.|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby [...] "the most raucous racing {{experience}} of the fall". He believed that its [...] "graphics are almost all you could want for a game" [...] of this type, but wrote that [...] "nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all {{out and try to}} make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most fun to be had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably [...] "lacking" [...] but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.|$|E
