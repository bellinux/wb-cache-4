5|$|The Icelandic {{financial}} crisis {{was a major}} economic and political event in Iceland that involved the default of {{all three of the}} country's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008, following their difficulties in refinancing their <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history. The crisis led to a severe economic depression in 2008–2010 and significant political unrest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their <b>short-term</b> <b>debt.</b> At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} capital structure of selected quoted companies in Nigeria between 1990 and 2004. The analyses are performed using panel data pertaining to 50 non-financial firms. Static tests are conducted and panel data specifications are used. Considering the results for all the firms, leverage is negatively correlated with profitability. Tangibility is positively correlated with total debts and long-term debts, but negatively related to <b>short-term</b> <b>debts.</b> In addition, collateral appeared to influence all bank borrowing in Nigeria, whether short-term or long-term. Growth opportunity is positively related to both total <b>debts</b> and <b>short-term</b> <b>debts.</b> The size of the companies is positively correlated with total <b>debts</b> and <b>short-term</b> <b>debts,</b> suggesting that large firms can better support higher debt ratios than small firms. The empirical result shows that debt financing for listed companies in Nigeria corresponds mainly to a <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> nature, with a mean value of 60 %. Nigeria firms should adopt appropriate steps to lengthen the maturity structure of corporate debt. In addition, government should endeavour to develop capital market {{to be able to}} absorb the increase in demand for funds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} total <b>debts,</b> <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> and long-term debts on the output, gross investments and technology-upgrading strategies of the firms in certain oligopolistic industries in India. We first develop a simple theoretical model to motivate the analysis. The empirical analysis shows that debt as a whole may {{have a negative impact}} on the choice of output and investment levels of the firms. However, the <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> make firms behave in a conservative fashion while the long-term debts make firms behave more aggressively in this respect. Debt, irrespective of its structure, forces the firms to upgrade their technology. Total debt has a negative impact on profitability, however, firms with higher long-term debts have higher profitability...|$|R

25|$|The strike {{severely}} impacted the company's financial status. International Harvester lost $257.2 {{million in}} the second quarter, {{for a total of}} $479.4 {{million in the}} first half of the year, while sales slid 47.3 percent. The company confirmed earlier rumors and put its Scout utility vehicle division up for sale to help cover the losses, and by the end of April 1980 was forced to take out loans which increased its <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> from $442 million to a staggering $1 billion.|$|E
50|$|Ratios {{relating}} {{reserves to}} other external sector variables are popular among credit risk agencies {{and international organizations}} to assess the external vulnerability of a country. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total external debt to gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money to <b>short-term</b> external <b>debt,</b> and <b>short-term</b> external <b>debt</b> to <b>short-term</b> external <b>debt</b> on residual maturity basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics accumulate reserves to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.|$|R

25|$|The crisis, which {{eventually}} became {{the catalyst for}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their <b>short-term</b> <b>debt,</b> potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, {{and do not have}} cash on hand to pay it back, they will default on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} capital structure of agro-listed firms in Nigeria, using data generated from the financial statements of twenty eight (28) agro-allied firms, which have been listed in the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2005 to 2010. The major tool for data analysis was Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which was {{used to analyze the}} identified firm-specific variables that affect short and long term debt ratios. All measured capital structure were scaled by the book value of total assets. In terms of short term debt ratio, large firms were perceived to have enough tangible assets at their disposal to pledge as collateral and access debt capital. Highly tangible firms also use more <b>short-term</b> <b>debts,</b> as high tangible asset reduced the magnitude of debt loss incurred by debt providers if the firms default. Growing listed firms used more short term debts, presumably due to their huge capital requirement for financing new short term investment opportunities and the need to meet current liabilities and other overhead expenses. Growing firms are presumed to lack both tangible assets and cheap long term credit sources of information and as such depends mostly on short term debts. The result further shows agro-listed firms with high taxes use more short term debts in their finances. Highly profitable firms do not depend on <b>short-term</b> <b>debts,</b> as they are perceived to be liquid enough to finance their short term investment through retained earnings at the expense of taking short term debts.

2500|$|Turkey's {{impressive}} {{economic performance}} in the 1980s won high marks from Wall Street's credit-rating agencies. In 1992 and 1993, the government used these ratings to attract funds to cover its budget deficits. International bond issues over this period amounted to US$7.5 billion. These capital flows helped maintain the overvalued exchange rate. In a market economy, {{a high level of}} government borrowing should translate into higher domestic interest rates and even possibly [...] "crowd out" [...] private-sector borrowers, thereby eventually slowing economic growth. But the government's foreign borrowing took the pressure off domestic interest rates and actually spurred more private-sector borrowing in an already overheated economy. Sensing an easy profit opportunity during this period, commercial banks borrowed at world interest rates and lent at Turkey's higher domestic rates without fear of a depreciating currency. As a result, Turkey's foreign <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> rose sharply. External and internal confidence in the government's ability to manage the impending balance of payments crisis waned, compounding economic difficulties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the yield curve {{indicates}} the cumulative priorities of all lenders relative to a particular borrower (such as the US Treasury or the Treasury of Japan), or the priorities of a single lender relative to all possible borrowers. With other factors held equal, lenders will prefer to have funds at their disposal, {{rather than at the}} disposal of a third party. The interest rate is the [...] "price" [...] paid to convince them to lend. As the term of the loan increases, lenders demand an increase in the interest received. In addition, lenders may be concerned about future circumstances, e.g. a potential default (or rising rates of inflation), so they demand higher interest rates on long-term loans than they demand on shorter-term loans to compensate for the increased risk. Occasionally, when lenders are seeking long-term debt contracts more aggressively than <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> contracts, the yield curve [...] "inverts", with interest rates (yields) being lower for the longer periods of repayment so that lenders can attract long-term borrowing.|$|E
2500|$|Managing the corporation's {{working capital}} {{position}} to sustain ongoing business operations {{is referred to}} as working capital management. These involve managing the relationship between a firm's short-term assets and its short-term liabilities. In general this is as follows: As above, the goal of Corporate Finance is the maximization of firm value. In the context of long term, capital budgeting, firm value is enhanced through appropriately selecting and funding NPV positive investments. These investments, in turn, have implications in terms of cash flow and cost of capital. The goal of Working Capital (i.e. short term) management is therefore to ensure that the firm is able to operate, and that it has sufficient cash flow to service long-term debt, and to satisfy both maturing <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> and upcoming operational expenses. In so doing, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital; See Economic value added (EVA).
