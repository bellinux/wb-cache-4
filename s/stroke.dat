40|$|Massage is {{an ancient}} {{treatment}} that still is commonly used in humans. Massage {{is reported to have}} several beneficial effects including activation of the relaxation and growth response that is proposed to be mediated by oxytocin (OT). In the present thesis the effects of repeated massage-like <b>stroking</b> (<b>stroking)</b> in rats has been studied. The experimenter restraints the rat with one hand and with the other hand the abdomen of the rat was firm but gently <b>stroked</b> at a speed of 30 - 40 strokings/min for 5 minutes. In order to analyze the individual behavioral treatment response the <b>stroking</b> sessions were video recorded (paper III and IV). In paper I, the effects of <b>stroking</b> on plasma levels of gastrin, insulin, CCK, somatostatin and glucose were investigated. Plasma levels of gastrin and insulin decreased after 14 <b>stroking</b> sessions, whereas plasma levels of glucose and body weight increased. In paper II, rats were treated postnatally with either <b>stroking</b> early in life or with OT injections. Both postnatal <b>stroking</b> and OT-treatment decreased the diastolic blood pressure measured with the tail-cuff method in adulthood in these rats. In paper III, female rats surgically prepared with telemetric blood pressure equipment were used. The rats were their own controls and the experiment started with a 5 days control period followed by 10 days with <b>stroking.</b> Each <b>stroking</b> session was video recorded and blood pressure measured with telemetry. Blood pressure increased during <b>stroking</b> and was maintained high during the 10 days <b>stroking</b> period compared to the control period. Latency time to relaxation decreased during the <b>stroking</b> period. In paper IV, the effects of <b>stroking</b> on social interaction were studied. <b>Stroking</b> in male rats did not alter the social interaction or the plasma levels of OT and corticosterone. However, home-cage dominance as well as interaction between dominance and <b>stroking</b> altered the social behavior. In conclusion, most of the results indicate that the rat experiences distress rather than anti-stress during <b>stroking.</b> Since rats had to be restrained during <b>stroking,</b> the sympathetic nervous system probably was activated. This might have hidden the suggested <b>stroking</b> induced reflex activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. For future studies another animal model that can be <b>stroked</b> without restraint, i. e. dog is recommended...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to strictness in character size and shape, Chinese characters are written with very precise rules. The most important rules regard the strokes employed, <b>stroke</b> placement, and <b>stroke</b> order. Just as each region that uses Chinese characters has standardized character forms, each also has standardized <b>stroke</b> orders, with each standard being different. Most characters {{can be written}} with just one correct <b>stroke</b> order, though some words also have many valid <b>stroke</b> orders, which may occasionally result in different <b>stroke</b> counts. Some characters are also written with different <b>stroke</b> orders due to character simplification.|$|E
