40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} of skinning {{process has been}} carried out, and an automatic measurement system in order to record the drawing-force on the animal’s body during skinning tests, has been designed. Moreover, some mechanical criteria have been fixed to design specific <b>skinning</b> <b>machines</b> or adapt cattle <b>skinning</b> <b>machines</b> to ostrich slaughtering. Experimental results partially confirm theoretical analysis; {{they point out that}} the angle of inclination of drawing-force with back-line is a parameter which mostly influences the value of drawing-force and that this influence tends to increase as the angle is near to 90 ° or exceeds this limit. In any case, the applied drawing-force must not exceed 300, 0 daN. Therefore ostrich skinning should be done with vertical-drawing machines and the animal should be suspended by its wings at the track walking beam, in relation to their anatomy structure and the tensile strength of the hide. In the case of low working capacity (8 - 10 heads per hour) the animal could be skinned suspended by the legs, considering some limitations pointed out during experimental trials...|$|R

This is more commonly used in liners, but is known to be used on shader machines, more typically for portrait work. Machines are usually categorized into long stroke and short stroke varieties. The longer-stroked {{machines are}} good for coloring and shading, as well as sculpting lines, while doing less damage to clients' <b>skin.</b> Shorter-stroke <b>machines</b> are commonly used for lining in a single pass style, and also in a shader setup to achieve a more subtle gradation of black such as would be found in portraits. Length, width, tension, angle, and stiffness of the spring varies the functionality of the machine.

40|$|Understanding the driver’s {{cognitive}} load {{is important for}} evaluating in-vehicle user interfaces. This paper describes experiments to assess machine learning classification algo-rithms {{on their ability to}} automatically identify elevated cognitive workload levels in drivers, leading towards the development of robust tools for automobile user interface evaluation. We look at using both driver performance as well as physiological data. These measures can be collected in real-time and do not interfere with the primary task of driving the vehicle. We report classification accuracies of up to 90 % for detecting elevated levels of {{cognitive load}}, and show that the inclusion of physiological data leads to higher classification accuracy than vehicle sensor data evaluated alone. Finally, we show results suggesting that models can be built to classify cognitive load across indi-viduals, instead of building individual models for each per-son. By collecting data from drivers in two large field stud-ies on the highway (20 drivers and 99 drivers), this work extends prior work and demonstrates feasibility and poten-tial of such measures for HCI research in vehicles.

"Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{machining}} operations. An Aircraft skin consists of hundreds of different-sized holes distributed over a large area. Automated drilling/riveting machines are used today to perform the drilling/riveting process on large aircraft <b>skins.</b> These <b>machines</b> are capital intensive and their maximum utilization is vital to their economic viability. An issue that affects the utilization of these machines is the drilling sequence because usually there is ’n’ number of holes that has to be visited. Determination of drilling sequence is similar to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and exhibits characteristics of an NP-hard problem. Two types of setups complicate this process further. Depending on the size of the holes, different-sized drills are selected, each size requiring a different setup for changing the tool. Also, as holes are drilled, the drill bits wear out and need to be replaced at the end of their tool life. This thesis presents an Ant-algorithm meta-heuristic to solve this sequencing problem. Results indicate that the procedure is effective in arriving at good solutions...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} practice of tattooing as a material, affective and superficial technology of shifting subjectivity, that is, in its power of inducing effects of subjectivity. Moreover, it argues that tattooing {{can be considered a}} micropolitical resource toward the production of experimental, creative and subversive paths of subjectificationa nd against machineso f homogenisationa nd bodily conformity. Drawing from Spinoza, Deleuze and Guattari, and from personal accounts of body modification, I discuss tattooing as a technology of empowerment and mobilization of subjectivity whose intensity, by way of the dis-organization of the bodily surface it induces, is capable of instigating lines of escape and liberation and entering into the production of new subjectivities. I have developed my argument by following several lines of investigation: the historical and cultural location of {{the practice of}} tattooing; an overview of Spinoza's philosophy; the production of subjectivity by way of Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari's thought; and the analysis of the skin as the material site of tattooing and as a contested trope of identity. Finally, by looking at the distinction between <b>skin</b> shedding <b>machines</b> and botox machines, I have claimed tattooing as a micropolitical tool of liberation. Both the skin and subjectivity have been examined in terms of their production. I have discussed the skin as the site of manoeuvres of dis/organization of corporeal matter. I argue that its continuous unfolding radically questions the polarization surface vs. depth and a notion of identity predicated upon the skin seen as a boundary. This research aims at being a contribution to current debates on subjectivity and embodiment and, as such, it pertains to the wider project of rethinking the bodily roots of subjectivity. It is concerned, in particular, with how to create, express and sustain new forms of subjectification that resolutely place embodiment, desire and becoming at their core.

The characterization of the mechanical properties of grape berries seems to be an important parameter for understanding grape ripening. In this work, these changes were studied in seven grapevine varieties (Riesling, Blaufränkisch, Pinot Noir, Cerason, Malverina, Laurot, and Hibernal) harvested during six consecutive weeks. Mechanical behaviour was measured using compression and puncture tests using of TIRATEST 27025 testing <b>machine.</b> <b>Skin</b> mechanical properties were evaluated using a puncture test carried out on the equatorial side. The dependence of these properties on the chemical composition has been evaluated.

The crushing force, the plate displacement at the crushing strength and the berry crushing energy were studied from force/time curves by compression test. Results of the puncture test shows that there the skin break strength and the acidity content are monotonic functions of the time.

5000|$|The {{foundations}} of a textile industry in Neilston were laid by the monks of Paisley Abbey who mastered the local woollen {{trade in the}} Middle Ages.

Bleachfields and textile processing brought rapid socioeconomic growth to the village. Neilston {{was one of the}} earliest centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution; the process of bleaching linens was introduced into Neilston in 1765, and a mill in the parish was the second erected in Scotland. By 1780, cotton manufacturing and bleaching had become the main industry in Neilston; the clear busy waters of the River Levern being well suited for power and processing. In the [...] "Old" [...] Statistical Account of Scotland (1792), compiled under the direction of Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, Neilston was noted to have two cotton mills employing together more than 300 people, over half of them children. The local Minister was concerned for the children's welfare, remarking on how they missed school to work in the mills where their lungs would be filled with cotton fluff and their <b>skin</b> spoiled by <b>machine</b> oil.Crofthead Mill (known locally as Neilston Mill) was established in 1792. It was one of seven large cotton mills {{on the banks of the}} River Levern between Neilston and Dovecothall, and although it closed for business in the early 1990s, it is the only industrial structure from this period still standing. Because of the large size of the complex, coupled with its short distance from the main residential core of Neilston, it was described in 1830, at the peak of the industry's prosperity, as [...] "a little town of its self". Other mills and factories have existed but have been demolished, including Broadley Spinning and Weaving Factory, and Gateside village and Spinning Mill.|$|R
