2500|$|... 24 April 1905 – {{the driver}} {{lost control of}} a {{locomotive}} descending the branch, head-first, {{at the head of}} 32 wagons. The train demolished the <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> and smashed into and through the goods office {{at the end of the}} branch. Luckily the crew managed to jump clear before impact.|$|E
2500|$|Stockyards {{remain at}} the sites of Mount Stuart, Beaumont, Evans Flat, and Millers Flat stations, with the latter two also still in {{possession}} of their platforms. [...] Loading banks {{can be found in}} Manuka, Evans Flat, Bowlers Creek, and Craigellachie, and a now preserved goods shed is in Teviot (With a Historic Places Trust plaque explaining its significance to the district). [...] A number of relics remain in Roxburgh from its days as a railway terminus; these include a water tank for steam locomotives, the station building converted for farm use, loading banks, a turntable pit, the old rail cement discharge silos {{at the southern end of}} the yard (used when cement was transported by rail for the Roxburgh dam construction), and even the concrete <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> that signified the end of the branch.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Matangi EMUs in 2010, two have crashed into the <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> {{at the north end of}} the platform. In the first incident, on 15 April 2013, nine passengers and 2 crew were aboard the 7.50am train that hit the <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> in a low-speed collision. [...] No serious injuries were reported and the line reopened the same day.|$|E
5000|$|Airleg raise, {{using an}} airleg (jackleg) machine {{to develop a}} sub {{vertical}} raise into the <b>stoping</b> <b>block.</b> This method {{has the advantage of}} giving geological and geotechnical teams further analysis of the <b>stoping</b> <b>block</b> prior to mining.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>blocks</b> used in {{metalworking}} {{usually have a}} small rod that slides parallel to the vise jaws and can be tightened in a particular position. <b>Stop</b> <b>blocks</b> in woodworking are typically nothing more than wood blocks clamped to a rip fence or auxiliary fence so that {{a distance from the}} saw blade can be maintained between cuts.|$|R
40|$|The {{mixing of}} wood-polymer {{composites}} inside an extruder was modelled using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the software Ansys CFX. The {{motions of the}} mixing blocks inside the extruder were modelled using the immersed boundary method, which avoids re-meshing in each time step. Two different models were used; one with a <b>stopping</b> <b>block</b> and one without. The purpose of the <b>stopping</b> <b>block</b> {{is to ensure that}} the flow stays inside the mixing region for a longer time. The flow field was initialized in two different ways; one starting from a steady state-solution, and one starting directly from a specified flow field and specific volume fraction. The results indicate that the <b>stopping</b> <b>block</b> works as intended. The general conclusion is that immersed solids is a promising method, but more work is required.

5000|$|The process {{involves}} the mechanical {{disintegration of the}} surrounding country/host rock, typically through fracturing due to pressure increases associated with thermal expansion of the host rock in proximity of the interface with the melt. Once fractures are formed, melt and/or volatiles will typically invade, widening the fracture and promoting the foundering of host rock <b>blocks</b> (i.e. <b>stoped</b> <b>blocks).</b> Once suspended in the melt, <b>stoped</b> <b>blocks</b> may either sink or float depending upon {{the density of the}} block relative to that of the melt. Additionally, blocks submerged within melt are subject to further thermally-induced fracturing which may account for the often observed [...] "lack of evidence" [...] for the process of stoping.|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the search}} for a seismic {{isolator}} for low-rise buildings, this paper proposes a marble-graphite slide seismic isolation system composed of marble-graphite slides, an upper foundation beam, the lower counter{{part of the}} upper beam, and the corresponding <b>stop</b> <b>blocks,</b> with the <b>stop</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of restrictive screws, positioning plates, nut connectors and stop holes linking the two foundation beams. To provide the desired isolation performance, plain mortar bars can be included at the beam interface to better control the initiating loads for foundation slippage. Tests of low-reversed cyclic loading were performed on four different masonry specimens: a recycled brick wall, a clay brick wall, an integrated recycled brick wall with flay ash blocks sandwiched between, and its clay brick counterpart. The four specimens were provided with marble-graphite slide isolators placed at the foundations. The isolator thickness was 20 mm, and the graphite and the marble served as a lubricant and a bearing, respectively. This paper then analyses all of the specimens in terms of the damage that occurred, the initiating load for slippage, the hysteretic performance, the bearing capacity and the performance of the <b>stop</b> <b>blocks.</b> The results indicate that mortar bars embedded in the marble-graphite slide isolator offer effective control of the initiating load, and the isolation system delivers good hysteretic performance. The <b>stop</b> <b>blocks</b> are capable of withstanding a large-magnitude earthquake and are a good choice for constraining the slippage displacement. Damage or failure of the specimens occurs only when the low-reversed cyclic loading continues after slippage takes place. The design is shown to be an outstanding and flexible seismic scheme for use in low-rise buildings...|$|R

50|$|A <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> is {{a simple}} {{reusable}} jig used in metalworking and woodworking to locate a common edge of a workpiece so that multiple workpieces can get the same operation performed quickly.

50|$|The {{speed limit}} for trains on the Melling Line is 50 km/h, with a 40 km/h limit through the {{junction}} with the Hutt Valley Line and 25 km/h entering Melling station. The speed limits were lowered in mid-2014 following two incidents when trains overran Melling station {{and hit the}} <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> {{at the end of}} the line.|$|E

In the spring, employees would pull the <b>stop</b> <b>blocks</b> out and the logs would roll down the hill into the pond. They were cleaned off and dragged into the mill with grabs attached to a huge rope.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 May 2014, unit 4472 overran the station {{and took out the}} <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> and the {{overhead}} line pole behind it. Passengers reported the driver leaving the cab telling them the brakes had failed and they should brace for impact shortly before the crash. Two passengers were taken to hospital for minor injuries and shock.|$|E
50|$|The roadway {{had special}} junctions, {{allowing}} the trucks to reverse into special {{loading and unloading}} docks. Loading/unloading was done automatically, usually by contact with the truck reversing in, {{but in the case}} of the crane, bulldozer and airport the movement was driven by the reversing trucks revolving wheels, as it was held against a <b>stop</b> <b>block.</b> The truck chassis were all basically of the same mechanical design. There was a universal clip in type motor that drove the rear axle, with pick-ups and guide pins at each end. Some trucks had a pivot for attaching a trailer, some had headlights, the wrecker had a flashing amber light, the fire engine a flashing red light and a bell. The flashing lights and bell were all mechanically activated.|$|E
50|$|The {{closure of}} the Silver Bell {{smelters}} in 1913 virtually ended mining in the Dundas district, leaving the railway with {{only a small amount}} of passenger and timber traffic. By 1921, Dundas had only 55 people. Between 1922 and 1924, the line carried no revenue passengers and only very small amounts of freight. By 1926, timetables merely listed stations on the line and noted that trains ran 'as required'. After a derailment in August, 1931, the TGR refused to work the line. The EBR provided a locomotive to work whatever trips ran thereafter, until a <b>stop</b> <b>block</b> was placed at the junction in June, 1932. The official closure date is given as 5 July 1932, after which contractors were permitted to work timber over the line by horse-power. The rails were lifted in 1940.|$|E
