2500|$|An English-style saddle is {{required}} for riding dressage, specifically a [...] "dressage saddle" [...] which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight <b>saddle</b> <b>flap,</b> mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage saddles have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English saddles to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider's legs. The saddle is usually placed over a square, white saddle pad. Colored trim on the white saddle pad is permitted. A dressage saddle {{is required}} in FEI classes, although any simple English-type saddle may be used at the lower levels.|$|E
50|$|Girth Buckle guard: {{the billets}} are {{threaded}} through the Girth buckle guard, which protects the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> from getting worn {{away by the}} buckles of the girth. These are not always present on saddles with long billets, which are intended to be buckled below the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap.</b>|$|E

50|$|Aori (<b>saddle</b> <b>flaps),</b> a pair {{of large}} leather pieces that would hang from {{either side of the}} saddle (kura) and protect the sides of the horse from the abumi (stirrups) and from the {{branches}} of trees and shrubs.|$|R
5000|$|The polo saddle is {{designed}} specifically for the mounted game. It has a relatively flat seat and the <b>saddle</b> <b>flaps</b> are long and fairly straight to accommodate the longer leg position, although more forward than the dressage saddle.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{presently}} little figures sheathing swords {{come out}} from the houses and walk to the debris of the flying-machines the bomb had destroyed. Others appeared wheeling undamaged aeroplanes upon their wheels as men might wheel bicycles, and sprang into the <b>saddles</b> and <b>flapped</b> into the air. A string of three airships appeared far away {{in the east and}} flew towards the zenith. The one that hung low above Niagara city came still lower and dropped a rope ladder to pick up men from the power-house.|$|R
50|$|Stirrup leather keeper: keeper sewn {{onto the}} <b>saddle</b> <b>flap,</b> {{through which the}} extra stirrup leather is passed. Keeps it neatly {{out of the way}} so it doesn't get under the rider's leg. Some saddles simply have a slot cut into the saddle flat, through which the leather is passed.|$|E
50|$|Saddle flap: The {{large piece}} of leather on the {{exterior}} of an English saddle that goes between the rider's leg and the billets and girth buckles. The shape and length of the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> {{is directly related to}} the intended use of the saddle, as it must mirror the rider's leg position.|$|E
50|$|This belt {{consists}} of three groups of royal tombs. Most of the tumuli are shaped like domes or mounds of earth. However, some are shaped like gourds or half-moons. Excavated tombs reveal wooden coffins covered with gravel and rich grave goods of gold, glass, and quality ceramics. A famous example of a tomb in this park is the Heavenly Horse Tomb which contained a mural painting on birch bark <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> of a winged horse.|$|E
25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo <b>saddles</b> lack a <b>flap</b> under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by a neck strap. Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|R
50|$|Sweat flap: The {{large piece}} of leather on the {{underside}} of the saddle that goes between the billets and the horse. It helps to protect the rest of the saddle from the sweat of the horse, and the horse's skin from being pinched by the girth straps and buckles. In monoflap saddles it is lightweight and sewn to the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap,</b> with extended girth points enabling the girth to be buckled below the flap.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the seat and panels, English saddles feature leather flaps on either side; the underside flap is called the sweat flap, and the upper flap is called the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> (or, simply and appropriately, the [...] "flap"). The flaps sit between the rider's leg and the horse's side and protects the horse from being pinched by the stirrup leather or girth, and the rider's leg from being chafed by the girth buckles. On some saddles it is also specially padded to protect or support the rider's knee.|$|E
50|$|Billets or points: Straps {{which are}} secured over the saddle tree on stout webbing and hang down, {{to which the}} girth is buckled. They have several holes in them to adjust the {{tightness}} of the girth. There are generally three billets, allowing a spare in the event one billet is torn or frayed. Some saddles have very long billets to buckle the girth below the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> to reduce the bulk underneath the rider's leg, allowing for closer contact with the horse. The foremost point is usually attached to a narrow web, and the rear two to a wider web.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between the styles of English saddle are small but significant. The most important distinctions are the location and therefore {{the balance of the}} seat, and the flap length and shape. A saddle used for a discipline where the rider sits more upright with a longer leg, such as in dressage, has a flap that is longer to accommodate the leg, and less inclined forward (as the knee does not need to go forward). The seat will also be closer to the withers, to keep the rider's center of gravity in the correct spot. However, in disciplines where the rider needs shorter stirrups for better balance and security, such as in the jumping disciplines, the <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> is moved proportionately forward and shortened, and the seat is moved further back. A jumping saddle will have a shorter and more forward flap than a dressage saddle, with the seat slightly more towards the cantle. If the flap was not inclined forward, the rider’s knee would hang over the flap, and the flap would constantly push the leg out of position (usually backward), so that the rider would become unstable and interfere with his horse. If the seat was not moved rearward, the rider would be forced ahead of the saddle over a fence. A racing saddle, where jockeys ride with incredibly short stirrups, will have an extremely forward and short <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> (almost more horizontal than vertical), and the seat will be extended well back from the pommel to keep the rider’s center of gravity correctly situated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{chamber of}} the tomb {{contained}} a lacquered wooden coffin which had burial goods placed around it. [...] A total of 11,500 artifacts were recovered from the tomb. The name of the tomb derives from a famous painting of a white horse which is depicted on a birch bark <b>saddle</b> <b>flap,</b> {{also referred to as}} a mud-guard. [...] The horse, a Cheonma (Korean pegasus), has eight legs and is depicted with wings on its feet. This painting is a rare example of extant Silla painting and indicates a strong influence by the Korean Goguryeo Kingdom. [...] The burial of horse trappings and the sacrifice of a horse with the king shows the importance of horse culture in Silla society and indicates the central role of the king in shamanism practiced by the people. [...] The other side of the saddle flaps depict horsemen and the phoenix. The tomb also yielded many other treasures including a gold crown and a gold girdle, both replete with jade comma-shaped beads. These trappings of royalty indicate that a king was buried in the tomb. Additionally, the fact that the girdle in the Heavenly Horse Tomb is similar to a girdle found in the Gold Crown Tomb {{and the use of the}} dragon motif in gold plates which matches treasures in the Baekje King Muryeong also indicate a royal king was interred in the tomb. [...] Besides the crown and girdle, the chamber also held gold bracelets and gold rings for every finger of the buried king. [...] The tomb also contained a chest full of burial goods which including the aforementioned painted <b>saddle</b> <b>flap,</b> and also iron kettles, pottery, bronze vessels, lacquerware, saddles, and a 98 centimeter long sword.|$|E
50|$|Supportive padding in the seat, {{size and}} shape of knee rolls and the use of {{additional}} blocks behind the leg is also considered when developing a saddle. While a polo saddle is constructed with a minimum of padding so as to allow the polo player great freedom to twist and reach for his shot, a saddle used for jumping or eventing may have more padding to help give the rider support over fences. Another development is the monoflap saddle, in which both the sweat flap and <b>saddle</b> <b>flap</b> are made of lighter weight leather, stitched together around the edges leaving only a passgae point for the girth straps, thus reducing the thickness of leather between the rider and the horse, and giving a closer feel, while still protecting the horse's skin from straps.|$|E
