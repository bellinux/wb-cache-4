Use of well-designed cool storage can offset the peak demand to a large extent. In this study, an air conditioning system with naturally <b>stratified</b> storage <b>tank</b> was designed, constructed and tested. A new type of diffuser was designed and used in this study. Factors that influence the performance of chilled water storage tanks were investigated. The results indicated that <b>stratified</b> storage <b>tank</b> consistently <b>stratified</b> well without any physical barrier. Investigation also showed that storage efficiency decreased with increasing flow rate due to increased mixing of warm and chilled water.

The key to the new control strategy is to avoid a Richardson number that decreases during solar collection. The analytical model is an approximate solution based on assumptions that (1) the solution is a function of elevation and time, only, (2) plug flow exists, (3) flow rate is constant, (4) the cross-sectional areas of the tank and tank wall are constant, (5) there is a step change of inlet temperature, (6) there is heat transfer between the tank wall and the water, and (7) thermal losses from the tank are negligible. Empirical constants in the theory are determined by adjusting them until the best least-squares fit with experimental data is obtained and correlating the constants with the Fourier and Richardson numbers. The new control strategy allows <b>tanks</b> to <b>stratify</b> and reduces the average collector operating temperature by as much as 20 /sup 0 /C.
