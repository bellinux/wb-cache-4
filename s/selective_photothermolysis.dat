At infrared wavelengths, water in tissue was heated by the laser, but at wavelengths corresponding to 915, 1210 and 1720 nm, subsurface lipids were differentially heated more strongly than water. The possible applications of this <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> (heating tissues using light) include the selective destruction of sebum lipids to treat acne, as well as targeting other lipids associated with cellulite and body fat as well as fatty plaques that form in arteries which can help treat atherosclerosis and heart disease.|$|E

Lasers can cause localized damage by selectively heating dark target matter, melanin, {{in the area that}} causes hair growth, the follicle, while not heating the rest of the skin. Light is absorbed by dark objects, so laser energy can be absorbed by dark material in the skin, but with much more speed and intensity.

The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment.

40|$|Exposure of skin to nanosecond-domain laser pulses {{affects the}} {{pigmentary}} system {{by a process}} called <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis,</b> in which melanosomes and pigmented cells are preferentially altered. Due to the broad absorption spectrum of melanin, this effect may occur with wavelengths that penetrate to vastly different depths within tissue, potentially producing different biologic responses. The effects of single near-ultraviolet (355 nm), visible (532 nm), and near infrared (1064 nm) pulses of 10 – 12 nsec duration were determined in guinea pig skin using gross, histologic, and electron microscopic observations. Threshold response in pigmented skin was a transient immediate ash-white discoloration, requiring 0. 11, 0. 20 and 1. 0 J/cm 2, at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, respectively. At each wavelength, melanosomes were reputed within keratinocytes and melanocytes, with cytoplasmic and nuclear alterations.

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} {{increased}} sun exposure, oral contraceptives, and phototoxic drugs {{has led to}} an in-creased prevalence of conditions such as dyschromia, melasma, rhytides, and other signs of photoaging over the past few decades. Through the application of <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis,</b> laser surgery has attempted to create therapeutic options for these medically recalcitrant conditions. To date, however, this technology has been met with limited success, due to a high incidence of posttreatment side effects, inability to treat off the face, and a safety profile tailored to Fitzpatrick skin types I to III. More recently, a novel approach coined ‘‘fractional photothermolysis’ ’ was developed in an attempt to overcome these limitations. This new laser treatment modality has allowed for effective treatment of a diverse array of dermatologic conditions on and off the face with a wider therapeutic index and improved safety profile independent of Fitzpatrick skin type. This review sheds light on the technical aspects, biologic mech-anisms, and clinical effects of fractional photothermolysis that help set it apart from previous modes of laser surgery. Basil M.

Although treatment outcomes are not affected by the laser system preferred, laser parameters are important when choosing the appropriate system for the patient. The shorter the wavelength, the more the laser energy may cause epidermal damage and side effects [2]. Alexandrite and diode lasers do not affect the more superficial epidermal tissue and were designed to prevent potential side effects by penetrating deeper layers of the skin.

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades much {{research}} on selective photo-thermolysis of port wine stain vasculature has been devoted to optimizing laser parameters. Unfortunately, 60 % of patients still respond suboptimally to laser therapy, despite significant innovations in treatment strategies and laser technology. Here we present a novel treatment approach based on combining <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> with the administration of prothrombotic and/or anti-fibrinolytic pharmaceutical agents, with the aim of enhancing vaso-occlusion and post-treatment remodelling in difficult-to-target vessels. A hypercoagulable state of blood will instill laser-induced occlusive thrombosis in a wider array of vessel diameters at greater dermal depths, whereby larger vascular segments will ultimately undergo the chronic inflammatory processes that result in blood volume reduction, and thus lesional blanching. With thrombosis as a primary trigger for these inflammatory processes,we have extrapolated the threshold damage profile that is required for clinically relevant thrombus formation. Consequently, a recently proposed model of thrombus organization, in which recanalization is associated with endothelial progenitor cell-mediated neovasculogenesis, is elaborated in the framework of lesional blanching and juxtaposed to angiogenic reconstruction of affected dermal vasculature. Since neovasculogenesis and angiogenesis are regulated by the degree of vaso-occlusion and corollary drop in local oxygen tension, both can be manipulated by the administration of procoagulant pharmaceuticals. Lastly, in an effort to optimally balance <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> with pharmacokinetics and clinical safety, the use of a gold nanoshell drug delivery system, in which the procoagulant drugs are encapsulated by a wavelength-modulated, gold-coated polymer matrix, is proposed.

40|$|Laser hair removal, {{through a}} process known as <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis,</b> is a new trendy way to remove all that {{unwanted}} hair. Traditional methods such as waxing, tweezing, shaving and electrolysis each have their disadvantages. However, <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> provides a simple and relatively painless way to achieve that hair free physique. From our knowledge of the procedure, we found that the most ideal way to model the hair follicle would be in an axis-symmetric model that divides the follicle and its surrounding tissue in half. The follicle was modeled at a depth of. 0035 m. Other parts of the hair are neglected as we concluded them to be insignificant. After calculating the laser?s power and inputting it as a flux over the surface of the follicle, we found very pleasing results that agree with our target values. These values include a threshold of 60 degrees C for the follicle in order to completely damage it and a threshold of 50 degrees C for the skin that would cause a mild pinching sensation because of the minute sizes we are dealing with. To obtain optimal results the following three laser parameters were varied: fluency, pulse duration and thermal relaxation time. After rigorous testing we found the optimum values as follows: pulse duration of 10 ms, thermal relaxation time of 40 ms and finally a fluency of 50 J/cm^ 2. We also found through sensitivity analysis that the specific heat and conductivity do not vary with temperature within a certain range.

40|$|Tattoo removal {{has long}} been a vexing problem. Although many methods have been involved, most of them are {{destructive}} and frequently cause scarring. However Q-switched ruby lasers have been successfully used to remove blue and black tattoos without the usual risks of textural change or scarring (Reid et al 1983). The major difference between this method and the others is that radiation from this laser induces preferential injury to cells containing tattoo pigment only. A major disadvantage of this method is the very high cost of the equipment, and in additional the red tattoos do not respond to red ruby light. This thesis investigates using a high power density xenon flashlamp for the removal of tattoos. The proposed method is based on the same principle as the Q-switched ruby laser, but has potential to remove various coloured tattoos, and to cost rather less than one tenth of the cost of a Q-switched ruby laser. In this thesis the spectral match between absorption of tattoo dyes and radiation of xenon flashlamp has been analysed. I suggest suitable treatment parameters for removal of tattoo using <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> after calculation base on some histological studies. The theory of the xenon flashlamp system was analysed in order to design a flashlamp system, and some experimental trials on different pulse durations and brightness were carried out. I report on preliminary clinical trials on a volunteer's tattoos, using different pulse length and energy densities produced by various xenon flashlamps. The overall findings given by our preliminary experiments confirm that a xenon flashlamp with an appropriate energy density and pulse duration can selectively induce responses in a tattooed area by the mechanism of <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis.</b> These clinical trials suggest that an energy density of 8 J cm-² is probably the useful treatment threshold for 100 μs pulses...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{cutaneous}} applications of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (laser) concerns the treatment of vascular lesions. During the past two decades, very significant advances in the application of laser technology in dermatology have occurred, with <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> being the most important. This review focuses on the application of modern laser devices (Pulsed Dye Laser, or PDL; potassium titanyl phosphate laser, or KTP; diode laser; and neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser, or Nd:YAG), as well as the combination of laser and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of vascular lesions. In particular, both congenital (haemangiomas and port-wine stains) and acquired vascular lesions (facial and leg telangiectasias, rosacea, Poikiloderma of Civatte, spider angioma, pyogenic granuloma, and venous lakes) are discussed. The review of many recent research studies demonstrates that modern applications of lasers in dermatology constitute the finest method for the treatment of vascular lesions, combining the advantages of invasive therapy with the security offered by non-invasive therapy, while in certain cases they are the single and only choice for the treatment of these lesions...|$|E
40|$|CHAPTER SUMMARY • Lasers {{and light}} sources are the {{treatments}} {{of choice for}} a variety of congenital and acquired cutaneous vascular lesions. • Based on the principles of <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis,</b> laser lights induce photocoagulation of vessels by using wavelengths well absorbed by hemoglobin. • Appropriate pulse durations, equal to or shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the vessels, are chosen to confine the thermal damage. • Lights with longer wavelengths have increased optic penetration and are employed to target deeper dermal vessels. • Epidermal cooling techniques can protect against epidermal injury and improve treatment efficacy by allowing use of higher fluences. • Light-based treatments can be used effectively in the skin of color, but special caution should be made to prevent complications. • Fractional photothermolysis has a potential role in treating hypertrophic portwine stains and involuted hemangiomas. • Photodynamic therapy works by activation of photosensitizer by light sources and can be used to treat recalcitrant or nodular portwine stains. • Lesions treated with light sources include portwine stains, infantile hemangiomas, telangiectasia, facial erythema, poikiloderma, hypertrophic scars and leg veins...|$|E

Significant variation existed between and within tattoos. Electron microscopy of untreated tattoos revealed membrane-bound pigment granules, predominantly within fibroblasts and macrophages, and occasionally in mast cells. These granules contained pigment particles ranging from 2 -in diameter. Immediately after exposure, dose-related injury was observed in cells containing pigment. Some pigment particles were smaller and lamellated. At fluences ≥ 3 J/cm 2, dermal vacuoles and homogenization of collagen bundles immediately adjacent to extracellular pigment were occasionally observed. A brisk neutrophilic infiltrate was apparent by 24 h. Eleven days later, the pigment was again intracellular. Half of the biopsies at 150 d revealed a mild persistent lymphocytic infiltrate. There was no fibrosis except for one case of clinical scarring. These findings confirm that short-pulse radiation {{can be used to}} selectively disrupt cells containing tattoo pigments. The physical alteration of pigment granules, redistribution, and elimination appear to account for clinical lightening of the tattoos...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{variations}} of length {{and type of}} hair (vellus or terminal), the growth of human hair in all body sites is cyclic. Phases of active hair growth, or anagen, are separated by periods of quiescence, or telogen. The duration of both phases varies greatly depending on the body site. Whether hairs are in anagen/telogen {{at the time of}} hair removal is important because only anagen hairs are particularly sensible to physical insults. Photo-epilation is a technique for long-term removal of unwanted hair by thermal destruction of the hair follicle and its reproductive system (stems cells). As melanin is the main chromophor existing in hair follicles the corresponding wavelength spectrum would range from ultraviolet up to infrared light. Furthermore longer wavelengths are preferred as the cromophor lies deep in the skin and the penetration of light is increasing with the wavelength. Thus, in the range of 600 – 1100 nm melanin absorption may be used for <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> of hair follicles.

We hypothesized that light-absorbing microparticles could be delivered into sebaceous glands, enabling local injury by optical pulses. A suspension of topically applied gold-coated silica microparticles exhibiting plasmon resonance with strong absorption at 800 nm was delivered into human pre-auricular and swine sebaceous glands in vivo, using mechanical vibration. After exposure to 10 – 50 J cm − 2, 30 milliseconds, 800 nm diode laser pulses, microscopy revealed preferential thermal injury to sebaceous follicles and glands, consistent with predictions from a computational model. Inflammation was mild; gold particles were not retained in swine skin 1 month after treatment, and uptake in other organs was negligible. Two independent prospective randomized controlled clinical trials were performed for treatment of moderate-to-severe facial acne, using unblinded and blinded assessments of disease severity. Each trial showed clinically and statistically significant improvement of inflammatory acne following three treatments given 1 – 2 weeks apart.

40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> is {{the basic}} {{principle}} for laser treatment of vascular malformations such as port wine stain birthmarks (PWS). During cutaneous laser surgery, blood inside blood vessels is heated due to selective absorption of laser energy, while the surrounding normal tissue is spared. As a result, the blood and the surrounding tissue experience a local thermodynamic non-equilibrium condition. Traditionally, the PWS laser treatment process was simulated by a discrete-blood-vessel model that simplifies blood vessels into parallel cylinders buried in a multi-layer skin model. In this paper, PWS skin is treated as a porous medium made of tissue matrix and blood in the dermis. A two-temperature model is constructed following the local thermal non-equilibrium theory of porous media. Both transient and steady heat conduction problems are solved in a unit cell for the interfacial heat transfer between blood vessels and the surrounding tissue to close the present two-temperature model. The present two-temperature model is validated by good agreement with those from the discrete-blood-vessel model. The characteristics of the present two-temperature model are further illustrated through a comparison with the previously-used homogenous model, in which a local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption between the blood and the surrounding tissue is employed. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|E

Conjugates of colloidal gold and alkaline phosphatase (aP) are presented as a model system for investigating pro-tein inactivation in the vicinity of strongly absorbing nanoparticles. aP was coupled either directly or via antibodies to 15 nm gold particles. These conjugates were irradiated with picosecond pulses emitted by a frequency doubled Nd:YLF laser. Denaturation was detected as a loss of protein function {{with the help of a}} fluorescence assay. Irradiation with lo 4 pulses resulted in the inactivation of aP at an irradiance of 50 mJ/cm 2 per pulse when the pro-tein was coupled directly to the particles. With similar irradiation parameters a significant inactivation of aP which was coupled not directly but via two antibodies to the gold, was not observed. This shows that inactivating proteins with nanoabsorbers under irradiation with picosecond laser pulses is possible with a high spatial confinement. However, from these experiments it is difficult to determine whether the aP was destroyed thermally or whether it was inactivated by a photochemical reaction.

AIM: To evaluate PDL and a two-compound formulation of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment for the treatment of localized, recalcitrant plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Eight psoriatic patients were treated for 4 weeks with both PDL and topical calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate in an open, intra-patient, left-right comparison. Biopsies were analyzed for T-cell subsets, cells expressing NK-receptors, epidermal proliferation, differentiation and epidermal thickness. RESULTS: After active treatment, both treatments showed statistically significant but comparable improvements of T-cell subsets, epidermal proliferation, differentiation and epidermal thickness. In line with the clinical results, after an 8 -week follow-up period statistically significant further reductions were observed for dermal CD 3 (+), CD 4 (+), CD 45 RO(+), CD 2 (+) T cells, epidermal CD 3 (+), CD 8 (+), CD 45 RO(+), CD 2 (+), CD 25 (+) T cells and the epidermal parameters for the PDL-treated plaques, in contrast to the topically treated plaques. CONCLUSION: After 8 weeks of follow-up, PDL treatment for localized and recalcitrant plaque psoriasis resulted in persistent reductions of activated and memory effector T-helper cells in the dermis, cytotoxic T cells in the epidermis, and normalization of epidermal proliferation and keratinization, in contrast to treatment with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{indications}} of the laser in treating vascular malformations and infantile haemangiomas {{is based on the}} theory of <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis,</b> in which the oxyhaemoglobin is the target chromophore on which the light of the laser acts, thus avoiding damage to neighbouring tissues. The pulsed dye laser is the most employed and at present is the treatment of choice in capillary malformations (port-wine stains). A variable response is obtained, with a substantial clearing of the colour of the lesion after several sessions. Application at early ages seems to improve the results. Venous malformations, especially those localised in the mucosa, respond better to the Nd:YAG laser; lymphatic malformations to the CO 2 laser. Arteriovenous malformations rarely respond. Use of the pulsed dye laser in the phase of proliferation of the haemangiomas is subject to controversy, except where there is ulceration. A rapid re-epithelialization is obtained in these cases following its use. In the involution phase, patients with residual vascular lesions can benefit from other lasers such as KTP or Nd:YAG. If they show an atrophic surface and scars these complications improve with the CO 2 laser or Er:YAG. New treatment modalities are emerging, such as photodynamic therapy, whose efficacy and safety, both in the treatment of haemangiomas and vascular malformations, have yet to be confirmed...|$|E

A scheme to do so was devised by measuring the skin response to pairs of 585 -nm dye laser pulses (250 – 360 microseconds each) {{as a function of the}} time interval between the two pulses, in five volunteers with port-wine stains. After a pump pulse delivering 80 % of the fluence necessary for causing purpura, the fluence of a second probe pulse necessary to cause purpura was determined and was found to increase with the interval between the two pulses, in a manner consistent with thermal diffusion theory. Biopsy specimens were obtained from four of the five subjects to examine the nature and extent of vessel damage and to measure the port-wine stain vessel diameters. Using diffusion theory, the thermal relaxation time was calculated based on the measured vessel diameters. These calculated values are consistent with the increase in radiant exposure (fluence) of the probe pulse necessary to induce purpura for longer time delays. Two simple models for thermal relaxation of port-wine stain vessels are presented and compared with the data. The data and histologic assessment of the vessel injury strongly suggest that pulse durations for ideal laser treatment are in the 1 - 10 -millisecond region and depend on vessel diameter.

METHODS: 532 -nm laser-irradiated hamster dorsal skin fold venules were studied by intravital fluorescence microscopy following fluorescent labeling of platelets with 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein. Heparin and fluorescently labeled anti-glycoprotein Ib-α (GPIbα) and anti-P-selectin antibodies were administered to investigate the role of coagulation and platelet receptors, respectively. Lesional sizes were quantified by software. RESULTS: Laser irradiation consistently produced sub-occlusive thermal coagula. Thrombosis was triggered in all irradiated venules in a thermal coagulum-independent manner and peaked at 6. 25 min post-irradiation. Heparin decreased the maximum thrombus size and caused thrombosis to reach a maximum at 1. 25 min. Immunoblocking of GPIbα abated the extent of thrombosis, whereas immunoblocking of P-selectin had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic response ensues the photothermal response in a thermal coagulum-independent manner and involves primary and secondary hemostasis. Primary hemostasis is mediated by constitutively expressed GPIbα but not by activation-dependent P-selectin. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> with pulsed lasers is {{presumably the}} most {{successful}} therapy for port-wine stain birthmarks (flammeus nevi). Selectivity is obtained by using an optical wavelength corresponding to high absorption in blood, together with small absorption in tissues. Further on, the pulse length is selected to be long enough to allow heat to diffuse into the vessel wall, but simultaneously short enough to prevent thermal damage to perivascular tissues. The optical wavelength and pulse length are therefore dependent on vessel diameter, vessel wall thickness and depth in dermis. The present work demonstrates {{that in the case}} of a 0. 45 ms long pulse at 585 nm wavelength, vessels of 40 - 60 Μm require minimum optical fluence. Smaller vessels require higher fluence because the amount of heat needed to heat the wall becomes a substantial fraction of the absorbed optical energy. Larger vessels also require a higher dose because the attenuation of light in blood prevents the blood in the centre of the lumen from participating in the heating process. It is shown that the commonly used optical dose in the range of 6 - 7 J cm - 2 is expected to inflict vessel rupture rather than thermolysis in superficially located vessels. The present analysis might serve to draw guidelines for a protocol where the optical energy, wavelength and pulse length are optimized with respect to vessel diameter and depth in dermis. © 1995 W.

40|$|Background: Pulsed {{dye laser}} (PDL) is the gold {{standard}} for treatment of port-wine stain (PWS) birthmarks but multiple treatments are required and complete resolution is often not achieved. Posttreatment vessel recurrence is thought to be a factor that limits efficacy of PDL treatment of PWS. Imiquimod 5 % cream is an immunomodulator with antiangiogenic effects. Objective: We sought to determine if application of imiquimod 5 % cream after PDL improves treatment outcome. Methods: Healthy individuals with PWS (n = 24) were treated with PDL and then randomized to apply posttreatment placebo or imiquimod 5 % cream for 8 weeks. Chromameter measurements (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage Lab colorspace) for 57 PWS sites (multiple sites per patient) were taken at baseline and compared with measurements taken 8 weeks posttreatment. The Δa (change in erythema) and ΔE (difference in color between normal-appearing skin and PWS skin) were measured to quantify treatment outcome. Results: Two patients developed minor skin irritation. Other adverse effects were not noted. Average a was 0. 43 for PDL + placebo sites (n = 25) and 1. 27 for PDL + imiquimod sites (n = 32) (P value =. 0294) indicating a greater reduction in erythema with imiquimod. Average E was 2. 59 for PDL + placebo and 4. 08 for PDL + imiquimod (P value =. 0363), again indicating a greater color improvement with imiquimod. Limitations: Effects were evaluated after a single treatment and duration of effect is unknown. Conclusion: Combined <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis</b> and antiangiogenic therapy may enhance PWS treatment efficacy. © 2011 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The optimal {{treatment}} of port-wine stains is laser-induced <b>selective</b> <b>photothermolysis.</b> Lesion color and location {{and the age}} of the patient are reported to influence the therapeutic outcome. This study was initiated to analyze the outcome not only by the clinical response of lightening, but also in terms of photothermally induced necrosis to the vessel wall. Punch biopsy specimens were taken from 51 patients before treatment. Post-treatment biopsies were taken after exposure to a pulsed dye laser (585 -nm wavelength, 0. 45 -ms pulse length) with an irradiant fluence of 6. 5 J/cm 2. Vessel diameter, depth, and wall thickness were measured in all histologic slides. The viability of the vessel walls was evaluated using an enzyme histochemical method. Port-wine stains with good blanching had significantly more superficially located vessels than the moderate and poor responders (p < 0. 000). The moderate and good responding lesions consisted of moderate-sized vessels with diameters of 38 ± 17 μm and 38 ± 19 μm (mean ± SD), respectively. The lesions showing poor blanching had significantly smaller vessels, with a diameter of 19 ± 6. 5 μm (p < 0. 000). Analyses of the post-treatment specimens showed that coagulated vessels were superficially located and of moderate size, whereas the viable vessels were small with a median diameter of 14 μm. The probability of coagulation correlated with the thickness of the vessel wall. These data indicate that the therapeutic outcome of port-wine stains can be improved by using the lesional vessel parameters to select the optimal laser wavelength, pulse duration, and dose...|$|E
