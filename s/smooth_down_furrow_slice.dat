2500|$|The {{mouldboard}} is {{that part}} of the plough which receives the <b>furrow</b> <b>slice</b> from the share. The mouldboard is responsible for lifting and turning the <b>furrow</b> <b>slice</b> and sometimes for shattering it, {{depending on the type of}} moldboard, plowing depth, and soil conditions. The intensity of this action depends on the type of the moldboard. [...] To suit different soil conditions and crop requirements, mouldboards have been designed in different shapes, each producing its own furrow profile and surface finish, but they still basically conform to the original plough body classification. Traditionally, the various types of plough body have been classified as general purpose, digger, and semi-digger, as described below.|$|R
50|$|Huachucocha or Huachococha (possibly from Quechua wachu <b>furrow</b> <b>slice,</b> ridge {{turned up}} by the plough between two furrows / row, qucha lake,) is a lake in Peru east of the Cordillera Blanca at a {{mountain}} of the same name. It is situated in the Ancash Region, Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald Province, San Luis District.|$|R
50|$|Wachuqucha (Quechua wachu <b>furrow</b> <b>slice,</b> ridge {{turned up}} by the plough between two furrows / row, qucha lake, hispanicized spellings Huachoccocha) is a lake in Peru. It is {{situated}} in the Apurímac Region, Andahuaylas Province, San Jerónimo District. Wachuqucha lies northeast of the lakes Suytuqucha and Quriqucha, {{and south of the}} lake Antaqucha.|$|R
2500|$|... 2. The digger {{mouldboard}} has a short, abruptly curved with a concave cross-section both {{from top to}} bottom and from shin to tail. It turns the <b>furrow</b> <b>slice</b> rapidly, giving maximum shatter and deeper than its width. It is normally used for very deep plowing (300mm deep or more). It has a higher power requirement and leaves a very broken surface. Digger ploughs are mainly used for land to be or planted with potatoes and other root crops.|$|R
2500|$|... 1. The {{general-purpose}} mouldboard. This {{is a low}} draft {{body with}} a gently curved and a cross-sectional convex curve from top to bottom, which turns a furrow three parts wide by two parts deep, e.g. 300mm wide by 200mm deep. It turns the <b>furrow</b> <b>slice</b> slowly almost without breaking it, and is normally used for shallow plowing (maximum 200mm depth). It is useful for grassland ploughing and sets up the land for weathering by winter frosts, which reduces the time taken to prepare a seedbed for spring sown crops.|$|R
40|$|There the {{interactions}} of Asymmetrical Plane-Cutting Tool (APCT) with soil have been studied. The mathematical modelling of break-down of soil <b>furrow</b> <b>slices</b> with the APCT has been realized. The results of experimental study have been processed with the method of regression analysis. The dependences of agrotechnical and energy indeces of APCT operation on its dimensions have been ascertained. The APCT has been developed. The APCT application in the main mouldboarless tillage in 16 - 18 cm depth allows to decrease the energy consumption by 28, 7 % and the specific material consumption of process by 49, 7 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

25|$|Driving {{the tractor}} with the furrow-side wheels in the furrow bottom {{provides}} the most efficient line of draft between tractor and plough. It is also easier to steer the tractor and driving with the front wheel against the furrow wall will keep the front furrow at the correct width. This is less satisfactory when using a tractor with very wide front tyres, for although they make better use of the tractor power, the tyres may compact part of the last <b>furrow</b> <b>slice</b> turned on the previous run. The use of furrow widener or a longer mouldboard on the rear body will overcome the problem. The latter moves the soil further towards the ploughed land leaving more room for the tractor wheels on the next run.|$|R
