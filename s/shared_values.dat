Broadly similar in both languages, Chrétien promoted the virtues of Canadian federalism to Quebec, touched on the <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> of the country, warned that Parizeau would use the referendum result as a mandate to declare independence from Canada (while explicitly not stating the result would be accepted), and announced that Quebec would be recognized as a distinct society and that any future constitutional reform that impacted Quebec would be made with the province's consent.|$|E

Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves {{as members of a}} larger, nationwide gentry class with <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian {{society has been}} shaped {{by two of the}} more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{field of}} CSR has {{developed}} from charity into an integration of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> {{into the business}} model. In developing countries there are enormous needs for better housing. This therefore could be an area where companies {{might be able to}} create <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> It is however unclear how <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> would look like in the building supply network and to what extent this already exists. Purpose: The purpose is to detect future areas of research by identifying opportunities for <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> in the building material supply chain. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> is viewed as a possible example of synergy for quality and sustainability research and development. Methodology: A literature review is carried out searching for “shared value” and “Porter”. The findings are combined with stakeholder theory, the process view and customer focus. Additionally the sustainability reports of the 15 largest cement and building material companies in the world were studied with the purpose of identifying examples of the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> concept. Working with <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is visualised with an example using the process of building material supply in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Findings: Findings indicate that the concept of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is widely spread, but that its application in the cement and building material supply industry still is limited. The concept seems to have a good potential in identifying and creating value for both business and other stakeholders. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> can be seen as enlarged business focus from shareholders to stakeholders. Practical implications: The results provide both ideas for further research and indicate how companies within the building material network could work with <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> Originality/value: The paper more clearly links <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> to stakeholder focus...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

At the beginning, the drivers and challenges of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation are investigated in a systematized manner, in order to better understand why this new way of doing business is needed. Then, the concept and the three levels of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation are investigated as sources of economic, environmental and social benefits that a business creates. These benefits depend on how efficient and diligent the company works. We are advancing the social innovation as main strategy having the greatest potential to create value with economic, environmental and social benefits. Finally, a framework for measurement of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation is included. This framework is aiming at giving a tool for checking up the potential the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation has for solving environmental and social issues...|$|R

30|$|Creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is the {{opportunity}} driven approach of business entities to benefit the less addressed segment of the society through their core products and services. For bank financial institutions, {{the opportunity}} driven approach signifies that banking corporations ought to identify bankable needs that are less addressed or unaddressed and invest on purpose to benefit both society and business. The study strives to develop a conceptual model of how Private Commercial Banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh are creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> (a popular concept developed by ([Porter ME, Kramer MR], [The big idea: creating shared value; how to reinvent capitalism—and unleash a wave of innovation and growth], [2011])) through reviewing the products and services of PCBs in light of available literature {{in the field of}} strategic corporate social responsibility and creating <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> The model has identified core products and services that are creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> for both the bank and the society concurrently. It has also identified factors that are limiting <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation capacity of PCBs. Thus, the model will assist the money market policy planners especially bankers to identify the products, services, markets, and value chain that could augment capacity of creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> and remove the road-blocks for creating upscale <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> in the developing country context.|$|R

30|$|Unlike CSR, which assume {{businesses}} to consider social responsibility as supplementary, the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> approach assumes that social responsibility {{is the center}} of every business performance. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> is not about personal values, nor about “sharing” the value already created by firms as is assumed by CSR. Instead, <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is about expanding the total pool of economic and social value (Porter and Kramer, 2011). That means <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is created when business undertake various unmet or less addressed social needs and challenges as business opportunity. Hence, earning fair profit from social purpose is justified. This concept takes into account philanthropy only when it creates social as well as business value.|$|R

25|$|Within the Roman Catholic Church, {{there has}} existed a {{sometimes}} tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives, {{such as those}} on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. Usually, this theological free thinking is academically oriented, being prevalent at the university level. From this standpoint, the function of this debate is less to challenge the magisterium than to publicize the results of historical research or to illustrate the church's ability to compromise in a pluralist society based on <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> that do not always align with religious teachings.

25|$|Humans often form ethnic groups, {{such groups}} {{tend to be}} larger than kinship {{networks}} and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype.

Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining social identity and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th century.|$|E
