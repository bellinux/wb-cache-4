5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back on Cybertron, Bumblebee {{struggles to}} {{maintain}} control, particularly after Ratbat's plots to have Skywarp assassinate him during a memorial for the Lost Light (which was presumed destroyed during its launch). Prowl and Arcee foil the attempted murder thanks to Starscream, who sees no benefit to restarting the war, {{and begins to}} work with Bumblebee and Metalhawk {{to form a new}} united government for Cybertron. Though many Decepticons are provided with jobs and fall into line, Bombshell continues with mysterious experiments that result in Prowl, {{at the end of his}} tether and increasingly emotionally closed-off, executing him. Fortunately, Ironhide is able to prevent chaos by successfully petitioning to have the I/D chips installed in the Decepticons turned off, restoring a sense of equality. Ironhide then recruits the Dinobots to join him in venturing into the wilderness to searching for the missing Aerialbots, only to go missing themselves. It is while they are being searched for by the other Autobots, Decepticons and NAILs that <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> discovered instead: a Metrotitan has returned to Cybertron, and it dubs Starscream the destined leader of the Transformer race. Before Starscream can exploit this new standing to any great extent, Megatron makes a surprising return and is taken into custody, causing the Decepticons to riot in the streets. It turns out that Megatron has secretly been working with a small team of Decepticons within Iacon to perfect the combination process, and he creates a new, more-powerful Devastator out of the Constructicons and Prowl, who has been under the mind-control of the still-living Bombshell. Ironhide, the Dinobots and the Aerialbots—now Superion—make a triumphant return to take Devastator down, while Megatron himself is neutralized by a failsafe created by Wheeljack. In the chaos, however, Starscream kills Metalhawk and uses his death to secure his position as sole ruler of Iacon, casting the Autobots and Decepticons out into the wilderness.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} this genus' integument, be it scales or <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} unknown, although potential evidence exists: Charles Gilmore described patches of carbonized material near the shoulders as possible epidermis, with a [...] "punctured" [...] texture, but no regular pattern, and William J. Morris suggested that armor was present, {{in the form of}} small scutes he interpreted as located at least along the midline of the neck of one specimen. Scutes have not been found with other articulated specimens of Thescelosaurus, though, and Morris's scutes could be crocodilian in origin.|$|E

500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent {{gave the}} album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "Williams' albums have {{increasingly}} come to focus upon the singer himself, which has consequently made them {{less and less}} appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five. She said that [...] "Reality Killed the Video Star is littered with references to his fall from grace, most of which hinge {{on the premise that}} someone or <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> truly responsible for his diminishing popularity." [...] Swash said that [...] "If there's a theme here it's not obvious, but it turns out Williams can be quite interesting when he moves off the topic of himself." [...] Swash concluded that the album swings between [...] "mawkish strings and piano overproduction" [...] and [...] "flashes of genuine pop frivolity".|$|E
500|$|In polymeters {{typically}} used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4. One particular example of Haake's use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, {{in which he}} keeps the hi-hat and ride cymbal in 4/4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23/16 time. On [...] "Rational Gaze" [...] (from Nothing), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat. Hagström notes about the polymeters, [...] "We've never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core. It's just that we arrange parts differently around that center {{to make it seem}} like <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Logic (dialectic) is {{the process}} of correct reasoning. [...] The {{traditional}} text for teaching logic was Aristotle's Logic. [...] In the modern renaissance of classical education, this logic stage (or dialectic stage) refers to the junior high or middle school aged student, who developmentally is beginning to question ideas and authority, and truly enjoys a debate or an argument. [...] Training in logic, both formal and informal, enables students to critically examine arguments and to analyze their own. The whole goal is to train the student's mind not only to grasp information, but to find the analytical connections between seemingly different facts/ideas, to find out why something is true, or why <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> false (in short, reasons for a fact).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many artists}} who {{appeared}} on the show, Nirvana filmed its entire performance in a single take. The band's fourteen-song setlist included a single song from its debut album, Bleach, four songs from the 1991 album Nevermind, three tracks from the then-recently released In Utero, and six cover songs. The group shied away from playing its better-known songs; the only contemporary hit the band performed was its 1992 single [...] "Come as You Are". Ten songs in, Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets joined the band onstage to perform three of their group's songs with Nirvana. The set ended with a performance of the traditional song [...] "Where Did You Sleep Last Night", following the arrangement of blues musician Lead Belly, whom Cobain described right before the song as [...] "his favorite performer ever". This rendition has been {{regarded as one of}} the greatest live single song performances of all time. As The Atlantic critic Andrew Wallace Chamings described, [...] "For the final line, 'I would shiver the whole night through,' Cobain jumps up an octave, forcing him to strain so far he screams and cracks. He hits the word 'shiver' so hard that the band stops, as if a fight broke out at a sitcom wedding. Next he howls the word 'whole' and then does something very strange in the brief silence that follows, something that's hard to describe: He opens his piercingly blue eyes so suddenly it feels like someone or <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> looking out under the bleached lank fringe, with a strange clarity. Then he finishes the song." [...] After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not top the performance of that song.|$|E

60|$|In {{my opinion}} a man's first {{duty is to}} find a way of {{supporting}} himself, thereby relieving other people of the necessity of supporting him. Moreover, the learning to do work of practical value in the world, in an exact and careful manner, is of itself a very-important education, the effects of which make themselves felt in all other pursuits.

50|$|The double arrow stands symbolizes if {{and only}} if, {{necessary}} and sufficient conditions. A necessary condition {{is something that}} must be the case for <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>Being</b> literate, for instance, is {{a necessary condition for}} reading about the accessibility relation. A sufficient condition a condition that is good enough for <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>Being</b> literate, for instance, is a sufficient condition for learning about the accessibility relation. In other words, it is enough to be literate in order to learn about the accessibility relation, but may not be necessary because the relation could be learned in different ways (such as through speech).
