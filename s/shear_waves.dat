Several {{methods have been}} developed to measure the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity, however, it is difficult to obtain quantitative <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> image in real-time by low cost system. In this paper, a novel <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> imaging method for continuous <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> is proposed. This method uses a color flow imaging which is used in ultrasonic imaging system to obtain <b>shear</b> <b>wave's</b> wavefront map. Two conditions, <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> frequency condition and <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> displacement amplitude condition, are required, however, these conditions are not severe restrictions in most applications. Using the proposed method, <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity of trapezius muscle is measured.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 93 - 97). This {{study is}} aimed at developing a workflow, and ultimately a model, for quantitative interpretation of sonic and seismic data. Measured data collected {{at the point of}} logging can be fraught with errors that can lead to wrong interpretation. One of such data is the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity which in most cases is collected with the compressional wave velocity. The measured <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity log may contain errors that are due to drilling conditions, mud invasion etc. It may also contain cycle skips and might contain a lot of missing data and information. It is because of the poor quality of this type of log that has often made well log analysis companies and log interpreters neglect the measured <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log and subsequently generate or create an estimated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log which they use for interpretation and modelling to check how the amplitudes vary with increasing offsets, among other uses. The workflow presented in this study considers the effect of working with the measured data, a reprocessed <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log and a locally estimated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log. Specific correction procedures for invasion of the logs was done and synthetic seismograms were created for each type after correction for comparison to a 3 D seismic data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that oil based mud invasion can cause significant problems to sonic logs especially the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log. It also suggests that, if a <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log is of low or bad quality, a reprocessed <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log would be better for interpretation and modeling rather than a locally calibrated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log or an estimated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log using global predictions.

25|$|These {{different}} waves (compression {{waves and}} the different polarizations of <b>shear</b> <b>waves)</b> may have different speeds at the same frequency.

25|$|One {{positive}} {{aspect of}} soil liquefaction is {{the tendency for}} the effects of earthquake shaking to be significantly damped (reduced) {{for the remainder of the}} earthquake.

25|$|The {{speed of}} sound is {{variable}} and depends on {{the properties of the}} substance through which the wave is travelling.

25|$|In {{a static}} sense, the {{fundamental}} difference between a liquid and a solid is that the solid has elastic resistance against a shearing stress while a liquid does not. Thus, a simple liquid will not typically support a transverse acoustic phonon, or shear wave. Gels have been described by Born as liquids in which an elastic resistance against shearing survives, yielding both viscous and elastic properties. It has been shown theoretically that in a certain low-frequency range, polymeric gels should propagate <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> with relatively low damping. The distinction between a sol (solution) and a gel therefore appears to be understood in a manner analogous to the practical distinction between the elastic and plastic deformation ranges of a metal.

25|$|Seismologists can use {{the arrival}} times of seismic waves in reverse to image the {{interior}} of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances {{led to the development of}} a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of {{the interior of the}} Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of <b>shear</b> <b>waves,</b> which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.|$|E
30|$|First, we {{discussed}} {{the threshold of the}} temporal influence of rainfall on the near-surface <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity. In a recent study, Dong and Lu (2016) used bender element technique to measure the dependencies of <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity on saturation for seven different types of unsaturated soils. They reported there are two thresholds of the influence of water content on <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity. The laboratory test results show that, as the volumetric water content varies from zero to the first threshold of around 0.15, the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocities of different soils decrease sharply. When the water content is in the range of approximately 0.15 – 0.40, the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocities gradually decrease with a mild rate as the water content increases. After the water content exceeds the second threshold of about 0.40, the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocities decrease significantly with the water content increases. The velocity reduction is mainly caused by the decreased effective stress (Dong and Lu 2016; Snieder and Beukel 2004). The detailed properties of tested soils and the classifications can be found in Dong and Lu (2016).|$|R
