5|$|In {{the absence}} of {{intervention}} in the foreign exchange market by national government authorities, the exchange rate of a country's currency is determined, in general, by market forces {{of supply and demand}} at a point in time. Government authorities may intervene in the market {{from time to time to}} achieve <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> objectives, such as maintaining its balance of trade or to give its exporters a competitive advantage in international trade.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{is divided}} into {{departments}} known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> area such as Agriculture or Justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as Human Resources and Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved {{by a majority of}} Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General, currently Alexander Italianer. The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the Commission's operation and organisation.|$|E

5|$|The {{visit was}} largely {{ceremonial}} and mainly focused on mutual praise rather than <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> planning and negotiations. Diệm {{stayed in the}} capital for four days, meeting with Eisenhower and high-ranking members of the State Department on the last of these days. However, the meeting with Dulles turned into a farce after the Secretary of State and his subordinates decided to visit Diệm at Blair House. Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the American diplomats were unable to raise whatever issues they had wanted to discuss.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes {{published}} The Means to Prosperity, which contained <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|In May 1929 Baldwin {{called a}} general election. As {{a member of}} Labour's National Executive, Wilkinson helped to draft her party's manifesto, {{although}} her preference {{for a list of}} <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> proposals was overruled in favour of a lengthy statement of ideals and objectives. In Middlesbrough she was re-elected with an increased majority over her Conservative and Liberal opponents. Overall, Labour emerged from the election as the largest party, with 288 members (nine of whom were women), while the Conservatives and Liberals won 260 and 59 respectively. MacDonald formed his second minority administration, and included two women in ministerial posts: Margaret Bondfield as Minister of Labour and Susan Lawrence as Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister) at the Ministry of Health. Wilkinson was not given office, but was made Lawrence's Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS), an indication that she was marked down for future promotion.|$|E

5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

25|$|Increasingly, {{recovery}} became both {{a subject}} {{of mental health services}} research and a term emblematic of many of the goals of the Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient Movement.

As of 2010, there was no <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> or strategy document outlining the government’s policy in the sector. The Ministry seems to focus on energy and to pay less attention to water, not to speak of sanitation.|$|E
25|$|During his tenure, Woodruff {{announced}} a <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> of sealing individuals only to their direct ancestors.

25|$|The term White Australia policy {{comprises}} various historical {{policies that}} effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia. There {{was never any}} <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia. These policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.|$|E

The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was published in 1936, and served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession.|$|E

40|$|How does {{national}} crisis management affect the electoral fortunes of coalition governments? Drawing on micro-level data from {{just before the}} 2009 federal elections in Germany, this article investigates how voters' evaluation of <b>specific</b> <b>policies</b> against the global financial crisis affected approval of and voting intentions for the then-governing grand coalition. We find that voters in favour {{of the two most}} prominent anti-crisis policies, the car-scrap bonus and the public guarantee for banks, were more likely to approve of and to vote for the two incumbent parties. These evaluations of <b>specific</b> <b>policies</b> influenced individuals' vote choice in addition to their assessments of the economic situation more generally and in addition to party identification. This suggests that even in the greatest economic turmoil with blurred political responsibilities, government parties can win or lose voters through the implementation of <b>specific</b> economic <b>policies...</b>|$|R

Another element which increases the risk for sexual harassment is the job’s gender context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a field which is atypical for women).|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini {{wrote that}} the {{perceived}} post-9/11 unilateralism of the 2003 invasion of Iraq fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe. Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion. Thus it is the unilateral policy process and the arrogance of policy makers, not the <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> decisions, that are decisive.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Arthur Waskow {{said that}} far from {{enabling}} antisemitism, most of the authors the AJC attacked (Tony Kushner, Adrienne Rich, and Daniel Boyarin, among others) are in fact major contributors to the renewal and revitalization of Jewish culture, cutting across the conventional Jewish diaspora and religious-secular divides. He holds that Rosenfeld and the AJC see no value in such contributions because they see Jewish value only in supporting {{the policies of the}} State of Israel. He also argued that the AJC has done far more to undermine Israel and its Jewishness than the questions raised by these intellectuals, by the AJC's support for some <b>specific</b> <b>policy</b> decisions by the U.S. and Israeli governments: especially the Iraq War, which has increased dangers to Israel, and the settlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Israeli Jews into Palestinian areas.|$|E
