Lumiere broke quickly and tracked to the rail to set the early pace, with Minding, Fireglow, Turret Rocks, Jet Setting and <b>Sharja</b> Queen close behind. As the fillies approached the cutaway two furlongs from the finish Lumiere began to struggle and dropped back quickly. Minding, racing towards {{the centre of the}} leading group, went to the front and opened up a clear advantage as Alice Springs moved into second and Ballydoyle, who had struggled to obtain a clear run, began to make rapid progress along the rail. Most of the other runners were under pressure with only Fireglow able to stay in contention with the O'Brien trio. Minding never looked in any anger of defeat in the final furlong and won by thee and a half lengths from Ballydoyle with Alice Springs completing a 1-2-3 for the trainer by beating Fireglow for third. Nathra took fifth ahead of Turret Rocks and the 50/1 outsider Mix and Mingle. Lumiere finished last.|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pedagogy: Theories, Approaches 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentDescribed through asymmetric sans serif typography, modular grid systems and denotative photography, The Basel School of Design is often described as dogmatic and conservative in respect to post-modern trends in graphic design. While this description may accurately reflect certain aesthetic tendencies, it does not reflect the essence of its pedagogy. This paper will argue that the Basel approach to teaching design fosters formal discovery conducive to contextual awareness. The studio experience in Basel endorses form making as a structure for knowledge production. Ideas arise from the rigorous study of visual form. This approach does not impart aesthetic preference, neither does it entail adherence to a formal dogma, but rather offers a basic set of tools with which to engage the environment. The case study for this paper is based in the United Arab Emirates, a country undergoing massive infrastructural and socio-cultural transformation. A claimed capital of the world's construction activity, Dubai is home to thousands of cranes supporting ever more ambitious projects that have transformed fishing villages into dynamic urban environments. As a result, design pedagogy must address students who live in a place subject to constant change, and prepare them for a practice of improvisation. Students should primarily experience design as a process of critical observation, of assessing the past, present and potential qualities of a given situation. By analyzing the relevance of teaching methods refined in Basel to our studio-based program in visual communication design at the School of Architecture and Design, American University of Sharjah, we will discuss the significance of the Kunstgewerbeschule to contemporary design education.

Background: Self-medication and {{acquisition}} of over-the-counter (OTC) medications are emerging community health issues. Besides being a cheap alternative for treating common illnesses, the behavior entails serious ramifications, such as medication wastage, increasing pathogen resistance, and adverse drug reactions. The {{present study was}} conducted to explore the extent of OTC medications in households in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE), including native UAE and expatriate families. Methods: The study employed a population-based, cross-sectional, analytical study design. The study population included native and expatriate households residing in the Emirate of Sharjah, UAE. The snowball sampling technique was used, and the sample included a total of 335 households. Results: Expatriate households acquired more OTC medications than did native households (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1. 7). The demographic determinants for expatriate households were number of family members (aOR= 1. 6), age of children in the family (aOR= 1. 8), and annual income (aOR= 0. 5). Expatriate households purchased more OTC medication practices than did native households (aOR= 2. 2). In the statistical sense, expatriate household practices were buying medication upon relatives&# 39; advice (aOR= 0. 3), storage condition of medication (aOR= 2. 4), and disposal of expired medication (aOR= 0. 6). The highest percentages of OTC medications in native and expatriate households were those related to gastric and ear, nose, and throat illnesses. Conclusion: The presence of OTC medications in expatriate households was two-fold more common than in native households in Sharjah, UAE. There were significant associations for behaviors related to the reasons why OTC medications were purchased and stored within the household for both native and expatriate families.
