(English: Sometimes there's Happiness, Sometimes there's Sorrow), {{also known}} as K3G, is a 2001 Indian family drama film written and {{directed}} by Karan Johar and produced by Yash Johar. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor in leading roles, with Rani Mukerji appearing in an extended special appearance. The music was composed by Jatin Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava, with lyrics penned by Sameer and Anil Pandey. The background score was composed by Babloo Chakravarty. The film tells the story of an Indian family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>group</b> than them.|$|E

This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential <b>socio-economic</b> <b>group</b> that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E

He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest <b>socio-economic</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{influence}} {{of social support}} on health was explored among gender and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> {{with the aim of}} contributing to the explanation of socio-economic health differences among Slovak adolescents. METHODS: The sample consisted of 2616 Slovak adolescents (52. 4 % male, 47. 6 % female, mean age 15 years). The data were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire including measures of social support, socio-economic status and health. RESULTS: There are significant gender differences in social support, which are unfavourable for males. On the other hand, there are significant gender differences in health, unfavourable for females. Low social support is significantly related to worse health. There are significant socio-economic differences in both health and social support, which are unfavourable for lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> Three groups, females, adolescents from lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups,</b> and also adolescents reporting low social support, less frequently consider their health as excellent or very good. Females suffer from more health complaints, report worse psychological health, vitality and mental health in comparison to males, to adolescents from higher <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups,</b> and to adolescents reporting high social support. Males and adolescents from lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> more frequently reported low social support in comparison to females and adolescents from higher <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> No significant differences in the {{influence of}} social support on health among gender and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> of adolescents were confirmed. CONCLUSION: Social support is related to health and it is unequally distributed among gender and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> Social support had a positive impact on health, but this effect was independent of gender and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> Record 11 of 12 - SilverPlatter MEDLINE(R) ...|$|R

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Background. Previously, some Norwegian cause-effect {{studies of}} social {{inequality}} documenting a social gradient in healthy diet {{and physical activity}} and knowledge about interventions offered by the health services have been reported. Among lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups,</b> fewer eat healthy foods than among higher <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> There are few effect studies about interventions for helping lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> to eat healthy foods and to be physically active. OBJECTIVE The objectives were to assess {{the effects of the}} following interventions: 1) to improve dietary habits among different <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups,</b> 2) to improve dietary habits in lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups,</b> 3) to increase physical activity among different socioeconomic groups, and 4) to increase physical activity in lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in the following electronic databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, Cinahl, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Eric, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Social Sciences Citation Index, Social Care Online, C 2 -SPECTR, SveMed, BiblioMap, Bibsys and Google Scholar until April 2007. Relevance and study quality is appraised according to the Knowledge Centre’s methodological handbook ([URL] We included effect studies dealing with improving diet and/or increasing physical activity in <b>groups</b> with low <b>socio-economic</b> status, or a reduction in differences in dietary quality and/or level of physical activity between <b>groups</b> with different <b>socio-economic</b> status. RESULTS A total of five reviews and 14 primary studies are included in this report.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of poverty on access to {{maternal}} health care services (MHC), linking the use of MHC to two outcomes for the infant; mortality and nutritional status. The paper therefore falls under the overall theme of the international health strand; eliminating disparities in health outcomes. The paper establishes disparities in health outcomes between <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> in both urban and rural areas. Previous literature has documented an urban-rural dichotomy in infant survival and utilisation of MHC in India but {{little is known about}} the variations among <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> within urban areas. Rates of infant mortality are much higher in poorer sectors of the urban areas, suggesting that some differential utilisation of MHC exist between <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> In this paper the Indian National Family Health Survey (1992 / 93) for Maharashtra is used to model use of antenatal and delivery care and associated influences on infant mortality and morbidity. A composite index is created to examine the influence of standard of living on use of MHC. Findings show that those living in poorer households in rural and urban areas have a lower utilisation of MHC services than those in the higher socio-economic strata. The low level of use of these services is associated with increased neonatal mortality. In addition, infants living in lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> in rural and urban areas have an increased risk of poor nutritional status and neonatal mortality. Learning Objectives: By the end of this session, the participant will be able to: 1. Create a standard of living index based upon socio-economic data collected in standard cross-sectional surveys such as the demographic and health surveys(DHS). 2. Compare maternal and child health outcomes across <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> within rural and urban settings in Maharashtra. 3. Recognise the barriers to health care utilisation by the poorest <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> in urban areas. 4. Understand how standard of living influences use of maternal health care and its associated influences with infant nutrition and mortality outcomes in Maharashtra...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether effective smoking prevention interventions in Europe are equally effective among adolescents of low- and high-socio-economic status (SES). As part of the European Union-funded TEENAGE project, three school-based smoking prevention intervention studies in Europe were selected for secondary analyses: (i) a Dutch class competition intervention, (ii) the European Smoking Prevention Framework (ESFA) study and (iii) the A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial (ASSIST) intervention. All three studies differed in effectiveness by SES. The Dutch class competition study only had a significant effect among higher SES adolescents. The results for the ESFA study and ASSIST study were mixed and depended on which SES indicator was used. The conclusion of the study is that stratified analyses provide important insights in differential intervention effects for higher and lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups.</b> Although findings from the different studies were mixed, interventions that use a social network approach in which youngsters are allowed to deliver the intervention themselves may be a successful strategy in targeting adolescents from lower <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|Health status varies across <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> {{and health}} status is {{generally}} assumed to predict health care needs. Therefore {{the need for}} health care varies across <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups,</b> and studies of equity {{in the distribution of}} health care between <b>socio-economic</b> <b>groups</b> must compare levels of utilisation with levels of need. Economic studies of equity in health care generally assume that health care needs can be derived from the current health-health care relationship. They therefore do not consider whether the current health-health care relationship is (vertically) equitable and the focus is restricted to horizontal inequity. This paper proposes a framework for incorporating the implications of vertical inequity for the socio-economic distribution of health care. An alternative to the current health-health care relationship is proposed using a restriction on the health-elasticity of health care. The health-elasticity of general practitioner contacts in Scotland is found to be generally negative, but positive at low levels of health status. Pro-rich estimates of horizontal inequity and vertical inequity are obtained but neither is statistically significant. Further analysis demonstrates that the magnitude of vertical inequity in health care may be larger than horizontal inequity. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
