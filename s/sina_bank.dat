5000|$|While in Springfield, Baird was {{recruited}} {{to become the}} president of Ingleside College in Palmyra, Missouri, where she began work in 1873. She hired an ex-slave, <b>Sina</b> <b>Banks</b> as her cook. Banks would remain with her for the next thirty years. The business manager of the college was Homer T. Baird, with whom Baird would marry on April 25, 1875. In addition to administering the school, Baird taught arithmetic and history, though the fees charged were inadequate {{to cover the costs}} of running the establishment, according to one of her former pupils, Robert Coontz, who would become a rear admiral in the United States Navy. She remained at Ingleside for six years and tendered her resignation when she was appointed president of Hardin College and Conservatory of Music. The couple moved to Mexico, Missouri to take up the post and continued with Homer as business manager and Baird serving as the school principal and teacher. During her tenure at Hardin, the school grew from a small number of enrollees to having several hundred students and both of her daughters taught at the school.|$|R
40|$|Background/aims: A {{relation}} between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with lichen planus (LP) {{has been reported}} in the literature but remains controversial. To find out the preva-lence of HVC infection among patients with LP. Methods: Forty-one cases of LP diagnosed at the Dermatology Clinic of our hospital between March 1995 and May 1996 were evaluated (22 men and 19 women; mean age 41. 6 years). They were scre-ened for the presence of HBsAg, anti HBs, and anti-HCV by ELISA and HCV-RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blood donors registered in Ankara University îbni <b>Sina</b> Hospital Blood <b>Bank</b> were used as a control group. Results: Of the 41 LP patients, 2 (4. 8 %) had anti-HCV positivity together with HCV-RNA positivity. Twelve patients (29. 2 %) had anti-HBs and 3 patients (7. 3 %) had HBsAg positivity. In blood do-nors, anti-HCV positivity prevalence was 2. 5 %. Conclusions: The {{results of this study suggest}} that no relationship exists bet-ween hepatitis C virus infection and lichen planus among Tur-kish patients...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{performs}} {{an investigation}} {{on the effects}} of seven variables including growth domestic product, financial deepening, inflation rate, dependency burden, the number of bank’s branches, inflation rates given/charged on bank deposit. The study has been performed on one of Iranian banks named <b>Sina</b> <b>Bank</b> over the period 2006 - 2011. The implementation of individual regression analysis has detected a positive and meaningful relationship between growth domestic product, financial deepening, inflation rate and the number of branches on one side and bank deposit on the other side. In addition, the study has confirmed a negative and meaningful relationship between two variables of dependency burden as well as interest charged on bank’s clients and bank deposit. However, the result of our survey does not indicate that there was any relationship between interest rate paid to customers and bank deposit...|$|E
40|$|Injuries are a {{major health}} problem in {{developing}} countries. Recently, the occurrence of injuries and those related to mortality have increased dramatically in Iran. We have conducted this study to report domestic research publications {{in the field of}} trauma from 2000 to 2006 in Iran. Methods: The contents of 128 biomedical journals were analyzed. <b>Sina</b> Trauma Data <b>Bank</b> (STDB) was selected as an indicator of trauma related articles that have been published in Iranian biomedical journals. Results: The number of trauma related articles in Iran increased during the seven year period (2000 - 2006), but the percentage of total publications was not significantly different. The mean number of authors per article was 2. 7 + 1. 3 (1 to 12) and all first authors were Iranian. Females constituted 15. 4 % (n= 156) of first authors. Original articles were the most frequently published articles (n= 871; 86. 2 %). Treatment of injuries and ensuing complications were the most common topics (42 %) followed by war injuries (14. 1 %). Traffic accidents, as the leading cause of trauma death in Iran, were investigated in 27 (2. 7 %) articles. Conclusion: According to our results, it seems that more attention from researchers and health-policy makers towards trauma is necessary in our country. In addition, publishing a journal with the main theme of injury and trauma could be an effective means for increasing the proportion of trauma related articles. 4 page(s...|$|R
