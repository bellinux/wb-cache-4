50|$|The species remains {{widely known}} as Gaura parviflora, this name being {{published}} in 1832 {{and for a}} long time considered the correct name for the species.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the floristic and taxonomic research and phytosociology, he devoted to the naming of cultivated plants and botany nomenclature, having submitted numerous proposals for amendments to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and intervening in the discussion and vote during the sessions of Nomenclature of the International Botanical Congress of Stockholm - where he represented the National Agricultural Station and the Botanical Institutes of Coimbra and Porto - and Paris, representing the National Agricultural Station.

50|$|He {{considered}} <b>Spermatophyta</b> {{as having}} a polyphyletic origin, being composed by three different phyla, of which he only treated Anthophyta (syn.: Angiosperms). In that he used the same names for the subclasses of both monocotyledons and dicotyledons, this is contrary to contemporary rules on plant nomenclature that require names to be unique. However Bessey actually used a qualifying hyphenation (Alternifoliae-Strobiloideae and Oppositifoliae-Strobiloideae), a distinction not always recognised in reference to this scheme. With some modifications, most modern classifications - for example, those of Cronquist (1981, 1983, 1988), Takhtajan (1969, 1980, 1983, 1991), Stebbins (1974), R. Dahlgren (1975, 1980, 1983; R.

5000|$|A {{cryptogam}} (scientific name Cryptogamae) is a plant (in {{the wide}} {{sense of the}} word) that reproduces by spores, without flowers or seeds. [...] "Cryptogamae" [...] (Greek [...] , [...] "hidden" [...] + , , [...] "to marry") means hidden reproduction, referring {{to the fact that}} no seed is produced, thus cryptogams represent the non-seed bearing plants. Other names, such as [...] "thallophytes", [...] "lower plants", and [...] "spore plants" [...] are also occasionally used. As a group, Cryptogamae are the opposite of the Phanerogamae (Greek , [...] = [...] "visible") or <b>Spermatophyta</b> (Greek , [...] = [...] "seed" [...] and , [...] = [...] "plant"), the seed plants.

While some characters seem to be unreliable for the separation of each species, other characters, like {{the width of the}} broadest leaves, the shape of the perigynium base, and the fertile culms, are reliable. Different analysis of the mixed populations have concluded that hybridization between the species does not occur. The Kingdom of Carex roseae is plantae.The rank of Carex rosea consists of the following, the subkingdom is tracheobionta, which means that {{it is part of the}} vascular plants. The superdivision of Carex rosea is <b>spermatophyta,</b> also known as seed plants. The division of this plant is magnoliophyta, which is flowering plants. This plant belongs to the class called liliopsida. The subclass of Carex rosea is commelinidae, and finally the order is Cyperales. Carex is a genus of grasslike herbs that are widely distributed and distinguished having the seedlike achenes enclosed in a sac in the axil of a bract. According to results from a complete ITS sequence based phylogeny, Carex rosea is sister to Carex radiata, Carex retroflexa, Carex texensis, and Carex socialis. This plant is primarily confused with Carex radiata. Typically Carex rosea occurs in drier sites and has slightly narrower leaves.|$|E

40|$|For {{the group}} of plants treated in the “Compendium” I have used the name <b>Spermatophyta.</b> WETTSTEIN in his “Handbuch” remarks that this name is {{incorrect}} because in botany the word “sperma” is used for spermatozoids, and from the name <b>Spermatophyta</b> it might be concluded that by it “plants with spermatozoids” were meant. WETTSTEIN’s objection {{is not to be}} taken seriously however. Nobody will ever think of translating the name Gymnospermae by “plants with naked spermatozoids”! I did not like to use the name Phanerogamae for the group since the corresponding name “Cryptogamae” has lost all meaning. “Anthophyta” cannot be used, because the Pteridospermae have no flowers and it would even be advisable to use the term “Flower” only with regard to Angiospermae. The classic division into Gymnospermae and Angiospermae has been given up. The Pteridospermae are fundamentally different from the Gymnospermae e. g. by the form of their leaves and by the absence of a strobilus. I consider them equal in rank to the subdivision Gymnospermae. The same may be said of the group which formerly under the name Gnetales or Gnetinae used to be considered as a subdivision of the Gymnospermae, but which, in my opinion, are even farther removed from the Gymnospermae than the Pteridospermae. They have obtained here the rank of a new subdivision under the name Chlamydospermae. I have distinguished therefore four subdivisions of the <b>Spermatophyta</b> namely Pteridospermae, Gymnospermae, Chlamydospermae and Angiospermae...|$|E
40|$|Haematococcus pluvialis (Chlorophyta) is {{a widely}} used {{microalga}} of great economic potential, yet its molecular genetics and evolution are largely unknown. We present new detailed molecular and phylogenetic analysis of two glutamine synthetase (GS) enzymes and genes (gln) under the Astaxanthin-inducing conditions of light- and nitrogen-stress. Structure analysis identified key residues and confirmed two decameric GS 2 holoenzymes, a cytoplasmic enzyme, termed GS 2 c, and a plastidic form, termed GS 2 p, due to chloroplast-transit peptides at its N-terminus. Gene expression analysis showed dissociation of mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity levels for both GS 2 under different growth conditions, indicating the strong post-transcriptional regulation. Data-mining identified novel and specified published gln genes from Prasinophyceae, Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae, Charophyceae, Bryophyta, Lycopodiophyta, <b>Spermatophyta,</b> and Rhodophyta. Phylogenetic analysis found homologues to the cytosolic GS 2 c of H. pluvialis in all other photo- and non-photosynthetic Eukaryota. The chloroplastic GS 2 p was restricted to Chlorophyta, Bryophyta, some Proteobacteria and Fungii; no homologues were identified in <b>Spermatophyta</b> or other Eukaryota. This indicates two independent prokaryotic donors for these two gln genes in H. pluvialis. Combined phylogenetic analysis of GS, chl-b synthase, elongation factor, and light harvesting complex homologues project a newly refined model of Viridiplantae evolution. Herein, a GS 1 evolved into the cytosolic GS 2 c and was passed on to all Eukaryota. Later, the chloroplastic GS 2 p entered the Archaeplastida lineage via a horizontal gene transfer at the divergence of Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta lineages. GS 2 p persisted in Chlorophyta and Bryophyta, but was lost during <b>Spermatophyta</b> evolution. These data suggest the revision of GS classification and nomenclature, and extend {{our understanding of the}} photosynthetic Eukaryota evolution. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic macrophytes are aquatic {{photosynthetic}} organisms, {{large enough}} to see with the naked eye, that actively grow permanently or periodically submerged below, floating on, or growing up through the water surface. Aquatic macrophytes are represented in seven plant divisions: Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, Xanthophyta, Bryophyta, Pteridophyta and <b>Spermatophyta.</b> Species composition and distribution of aquatic macrophytes in the more primitive divisions are less well known than for the vascular macrophytes (Pteridophyta and <b>Spermatophyta),</b> which are represented by 33 orders and 88 families with about 2, 614 species in c. 412 genera. These c. 2, 614 aquatic species of Pteridophyta and <b>Spermatophyta</b> evolved from land plants and represent {{only a small fraction}} (similar to 1 %) {{of the total number of}} vascular plants. Our analysis of the numbers and distribution of vascular macrophytes showed that whilst many species have broad ranges, species diversity is highest in the Neotropics, intermediate in the Oriental, Nearctic and Afrotropics, lower in the Palearctic and Australasia, lower again in the Pacific Oceanic Islands, and lowest in the Antarctic region. About 39 % of the c. 412 genera containing aquatic vascular macrophytes are endemic to a single biogeographic region, with 61 - 64 % of all aquatic vascular plant species found in the Afrotropics and Neotropics being endemic to those regions. Aquatic macrophytes play an important role in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems and certain macrophyte species (e. g., rice) are cultivated for human consumption, yet several of the worst invasive weeds in the world are aquatic plants. Many of the threats to fresh waters (e. g., climate change, eutrophication) will result in reduced macrophyte diversity and will, in turn, threaten the faunal diversity of aquatic ecosystems and favour the establishment of exotic species, at the expense of native specie...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a phylogenic tree for green plants by comparing 5 S rRNA sequences. The tree {{suggests that the}} emergence {{of most of the}} uni- and multicellular green algae such as Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra, Ulva, and Chlorella occurred in the early stage of green plant evolution. The branching point of Nitella is a little earlier than that of land plants and much later than that of the above green algae, supporting the view that Nitella-like green algae may be the direct precursor to land plants. The Bryophyta and the Pteridophyta separated from each other after emergence of the <b>Spermatophyta.</b> The result is consistent with the view that the Bryophyta evolved from ferns by degeneration. In the Pteridophyta, Psilotum (whisk fern) separated first, and a little later Lycopodium (club moss) separated from the ancestor common to Equisetum (horsetail) and Dryopteris (fern). This order is in accordance with the classical view. During the <b>Spermatophyta</b> evolution, the gymnosperms (Cycas, Ginkgo, and Metasequoia have been studied here) and the angiosperms (flowering plants) separated, and this was followed by the separation of Metasequoia and Cycas (cycad) /Ginkgo (maidenhair tree) on one branch and various flowering plants on the other...|$|E

As {{a result of his}} study it became evident that the list is no longer in harmony with current concepts of nomenclature and the rules for maintaining them. The desirability of a general revision of the list is obvious; such a revision was begun by Stafleu several years ago. It proved, however, an impossible task for one person to achieve in the intervals between ordinary duties. Consequently application was made by The International Association for Plant Taxonomy to the National Science Foundation (Washington) for a grant in furtherance of this project. The grant was awarded early in 1958, enabling the present authors to work together for some seven weeks in Holland and England, principally in the Institute of Systematic Botany of the University of Utrecht and the Botany Department of the British Museum (Natural History).
