5|$|Amanita ceciliae is {{considered}} an edible mushroom and used as food, although many field guides recommend to avoid eating it. Others recommend it as a good edible <b>species.</b> <b>A</b> study of 16 edible mushrooms was done to learn about their chemical compositions and antioxidant activities. Among these species, A.ceciliae and Pleurotus ostreatus were the two mushrooms that showed most powerful radical scavenging activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet <b>species,</b> <b>a</b> variety of colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two <b>species.</b> <b>A</b> 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet {{may still have}} been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the <b>species.</b> <b>A</b> series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E

5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same <b>species.</b> <b>A</b> 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few <b>species,</b> <b>a</b> nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{perching}} bird. Any bird of {{the order}} Passeriformes, which includes {{more than half of}} all bird <b>species.</b> <b>A</b> notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. The order has roughly twice as many species as Rodentia, the largest order of mammals. There are more than 110 families of passerine birds, the second-most of any tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile <b>species,</b> <b>a</b> few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct <b>species.</b> <b>A</b> 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which <b>species</b> <b>a</b> basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
50|$|A Regional Red List (RRL) is {{a report}} of the {{threatened}} status of <b>species</b> within <b>a</b> certain country or region.
