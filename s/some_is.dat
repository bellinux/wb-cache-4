5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion {{process in}} massive stars but <b>some</b> <b>is</b> made in the neon burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, massive stars.|$|E
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as <b>some</b> <b>is</b> present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where <b>some</b> <b>is</b> bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the Engineering and Water Supply Department chose an {{area at the}} top of the park, {{adjacent}} to Lower North East Road, to build a water treatment works. Based partly on seismic refraction traverses, a ridge underlain by dolomite and quartzite was deemed to be stable enough for construction. The site was also selected because of its hydraulic advantages; all other sites would have required the construction of a major pumping station. The exact placement of the site was made so that it could not be seen from the metropolitan area. It has a design flow of 313megalitres (ML) per day with a maximum capacity of 344ML. The plant was commissioned in 1980 and uses filtration and sedimentation techniques to clean water from the Mannum to Adelaide pipeline. It was the second plant in Adelaide, after the opening of the Hope Valley plant in 1977. Most of the water is piped directly from the River Murray, but <b>some</b> <b>is</b> sourced from Millbrook Reservoir.|$|E
