Quantitative standard of the steady-state load-bearing capacity to the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> and the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold with couplers is used in ANSYS. The effect of semi-rigid connection on the overall steady-state load-bearing capacity of the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold with couplers is great. The effect of pole in different flat on the overall steady-state load-bearing capacity of the <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold with couplers is smaller. It’s generally recognized that nodes of vertical bars and horizontal bars of <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> scaffold by fasteners is not rigid, but semi-rigid; {{is not in the}} same plane, but in a different surface.

One of the difficulties to develop the evaluation method is that the local deformation caused by the collision object degrades the overall strength of a <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> member which degrading rate may be changed by the contact tip shape of the object. In order to investigate the effects, we conducted a static nonlinear analysis of <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> members subjected to concentrated lateral loads by using the finite element analysis (FEM) program MSC Marc.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the numerical investigation of cold-formed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> T-joints, X-joints and X-joints with chord preload using finite element analysis. The stainless steel joints were fabricated from square hollow section (SHS) and rectangular hollow section (RHS) brace and chord members. The geometric and material nonlinearities of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> joints were carefully {{incorporated in the}} finite element models. The joint strengths, failure modes as well as load-deformation curves of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> joints {{were obtained from the}} numerical analysis. The nonlinear finite element models were calibrated against experimental results of cold-formed stainless steel SHS and RHS tubular T- and X-joints. Good agreement between the experimental and finite element analysis results was achieved. Therefore, an extensive parametric study of 172 T- and X-joints was then carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the effects of the strength and behaviour of cold-formed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> joints. The joint strengths obtained from the parametric study and tests were compared with the current design strengths calculated using the Australian/New Zealand Standard for stainless steel structures, CIDECT and Eurocode design rules for carbon <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> structures. Furthermore, design formulae of cold-formed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> T- and X-joints are proposed. A reliability analysis was performed to assess the reliability of the current and proposed design rules.

An experimental investigation of lean {{duplex stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> members subjected to web crippling {{is presented in}} this paper. The test specimens were strengthened with adhesive bonded carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). The web crippling tests were conducted under End-Two-Flange, Interior-Two-Flange, End-One-Flange and Interior-One-Flange loading conditions. A total of 38 web crippling tests was conducted. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} web slenderness of lean duplex stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> sections on CFRP strengthening against web crippling. The lean duplex stainless steel type EN 1. 4162 was used in the investigation. The tests were performed on five different sizes of square and rectangular hollow sections that covered a wide range of web slenderness ratio from 8. 1 to 57. 0. Three different failure modes were observed in the tests of the strengthened specimens, namely the adhesion, interlaminar failure of CFRP plate and combination of adhesion and interlaminar failure of CFRP plate. It is shown that the web crippling strength of lean duplex stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> members may increase up to 76 % due to the strengthening of CFRP...|$|R

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} investigations on cold-formed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> sections subjected to web crippling {{performed by the}} authors are summarized in this paper. The web crippling test results of cold-formed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> sections subjected to four loading conditions specified in the American and the Australian/New Zealand specifications are presented in this paper. Moreover, web crippling tests conducted under end and interior loading conditions to simulate a floor joist member seated on a solid foundation subjected to a concentrated load are also reported, and these loading conditions are not currently specified in the specifications. All of these test results are compared with the design strengths obtained using the American, the Australian/New Zealand and the European specifications fo cold-formed stainless steel members {{as well as the}} North American specification for oldformed carbon steel structural members. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are either unconservative or very conservative for high strength stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> sections. Hence, a unified web crippling equation with carefully calibrated coefficients for cold-formed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> sections is proposed. Furthermore, tests on combined bending and web crippling are also described in this paper. The test strengths are also compared with the design strengths obtained using the American and the Australian/New Zealand specifications. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative for tubular sections subjected to combined bending and web crippling.

Subsequently, combined loading analyses are conducted on high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> members, so that interaction diagrams are developed, showing the interaction between axial load and bending moment.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{availability}} of high strength steels and concrete {{leads to the}} use of thin steel plates in concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> beam-columns. However, the use of thin steel plates in composite beam-columns gives a rise to local buckling that would appreciably reduce the strength and ductility performance of the members. This paper studies the critical local and post-local buckling behavior of steel plates in concrete-filled thin-walled <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> beam-columns by using the finite element analysis method. Geometric and material nonlinear analyses are performed to investigate the critical local and post-local buckling strengths of steel plates under compression and in-plane bending. Initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses presented in steel plates, material yielding and strain hardening are taken into account in the nonlinear analysis. Based on the results obtained from the nonlinear finite element analyses, a set of design formulas are proposed for determining the critical local buckling and ultimate strengths of steel plates in concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> beam-columns. In addition, effective width formulas are developed for the ultimate strength design of clamped steel plates under non-uniform compression. The accuracy of the proposed design formulas is established by comparisons with available solutions. The proposed design formulas can be used directly in the design of composite beam-columns and adopted in the advanced analysis of concrete-filled thin-walled <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> beam-columns to account for local buckling effects...|$|R

The specimens were fabricated from square and rectangular hollow sections (SHS and RHS) with concrete-filled in the chord members. The geometric and material nonlinearities of stainless steel tubes {{as well as the}} concrete infill were carefully incorporated in the finite element models. The nominal compressive concrete strengths were ranged from 30 to 110 MPa. The numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental results for the concrete-filled stainless steel SHS and RHS tubular T- and X-joints. Therefore, an extensive parametric study was performed using the verified finite element models to investigate the strength and behaviour of concrete-filled stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tubular</b> connections.

The main objective of the trials {{was to investigate the}} effects of contact and near-field explosions on <b>steel</b> square <b>tubular</b> members and to demonstrate the effect of standoff variations on the mode of response and failure of steel square sections.
