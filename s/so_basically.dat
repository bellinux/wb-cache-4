He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. <b>So</b> <b>basically,</b> do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

He excelled at athletics, although was an unpopular loner at the school. He was critical of his formal education, later stating that [...] "the education I received was <b>so</b> <b>basically</b> evil and brutal. All I learnt was to have no self-esteem and to feel ashamed without knowing why". He left school in 1975, having received no formal qualifications. He continued his education at Stretford Technical College, and there gained three O-levels in English Literature, Sociology, and the General Paper. In 1975 he travelled to the United States to visit an aunt who lived in New Jersey.

2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage.

I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Privitera {{was convicted}} of {{conspiracy}} to possess and distribute laetrile for telling patients where to obtain it -apricot seeds-(yes, the fruit.) The case led to a Supreme Court of California decision in 1979. Citing Roe v. Wade, Privitera's lawyers contended {{that the right to}} obtain laetrile is a fundamental right of privacy. The California Court of Appeal overturned the conviction citing a compelling interest, and the state appealed. The Supreme Court of California ruled 5 to 2 that the right to obtain drugs of unproven efficacy is not encompassed by the right of privacy embodied in either the State or Federal Constitutions. The majority wrote that [...] "the lesson of Roe v. Wade for our case is that a requirement that a drug be certified effective for its intended use is a reasonable means to 'insure maximum safety for the patient.'" [...] (<b>So</b> <b>basically</b> they were saying fruit should be illegal, yes the seeds from apricots.) The outcome was vitamin B-17 [...] "Amygdalin" [...] and apricot seeds were made legal to possess and sell and are widely available and consumed and purchased today.

Privitera was soon pardoned by California governor Jerry Brown after the governor received more than 10,000 letters from citizens asking him to Pardon him.|$|E
