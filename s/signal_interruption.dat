Dimerization and transphosphorylation are crucial events in {{the process by which}} receptors with tyrosine kinase activity generate normal and transforming cellular <b>signals.</b> <b>Interruption</b> of this process by inactive receptor mutants offers the potential to inhibit ligand-induced cellular responses. Using recombinant retroviruses, we have examined the effects of signalling-incompetent EGF-R mutants on the growth-promoting and transforming potential of ligand-activated, overexpressed wild-type EGF-R and the v-erbB oncogene product. Expression of a soluble extracellular EGF-R domain had little if any effect on the growth and transformation of NIH 3 T 3 cells by either tyrosine kinase. However, both a kinase-negative EGF-R point mutant (HERK 721 A) and an EGF-R lacking 533 C-terminal amino acids efficiently inhibited wild-type EGF-R-mediated, de novo DNA synthesis and cell transformation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, coexpression with the v-erbBES 4 oncogene product in NIH 3 T 3 cells resulted in transphosphorylation of the HERK 721 A mutant receptor and reduced soft-agar colony growth but had no effect in a focus formation assay.

Such variations can significantly contribute to road users' travel time uncertainties and affect their route choices in congested urban areas. A reliability-based stochastic user equilibrium (RSUE) model is proposed {{to investigate the}} effects of turn delay uncertainties on the route choice problem. In the proposed model, link travel times and turn delays are considered as correlated random variables with covariance relationships. Differences in these variables are mainly due to uncertainties at signalized intersections and day-to-day fluctuations in demand.

In this contribution, we develop {{a model of}} real-time kinematic decimeter-level positioning with BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) triple-frequency signals over medium distances. The ambiguities of two extra-wide-lane (EWL) combinations are fixed first, and then a wide lane (WL) combination is reformed based on the two EWL combinations for positioning. Theoretical analysis and empirical analysis is given of the ambiguity fixing rate and the positioning accuracy of the presented method. The {{results indicate that the}} ambiguity fixing rate can be up to more than 98 % when using BDS medium baseline observations, which is much higher than that of dual-frequency Hatch-Melbourne-Wübbena (HMW) method.

40|$|Cyclophilin A (CypA) is overexpressed in {{a number}} of human cancer types, but the {{mechanisms}} by which the protein promotes oncogenic properties of cells are not understood. Here we demonstrate that CypA binds the CrkII adaptor protein and prevents it from switching to the inhibited state. CrkII influences cell motility and invasion by mediating signaling through its SH 2 and SH 3 domains. CrkII Tyr 221 phosphorylation by the Abl or EGFR kinases induces an inhibited state of CrkII by means of an intramolecular SH 2 -pTyr 221 interaction, causing <b>signaling</b> <b>interruption.</b> We show that the CrkII phosphorylation site constitutes a binding site for CypA. Recruitment of CypA sterically restricts the accessibility of Tyr 221 to kinases, thereby suppressing CrkII phosphorylation and promoting the active state.

Mechanism dissection found C 1 QBP could interact with YBX 1 to suppress the YBX 1 activation via altering the YBX 1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in RCC cells. The consequences of such suppression of YBX 1 might then result in suppressing the RCC cell migration and invasion that involved altering the AR-modulated MMP 9 <b>signals.</b> <b>Interruption</b> of this newly identified C 1 QBP → YBX 1  → AR → MMP 9 -suppressed RCC cell invasion pathway via targeting YBX 1 or AR partially reversed the RCC cell invasion.

We performed a prospective evaluation of vascular function during treatment with vandetanib, a vascular endothelial growth receptor 2 and 3 {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor, {{to determine the effects}} of vascular endothelial growth receptor <b>signal</b> <b>interruption</b> on endothelial function in humans. Seventeen patients with stage IV breast cancer received dose-escalated vandetanib in combination with low-dose oral chemotherapy. We measured blood pressure, systemic nitrate/nitrite levels, and brachial artery vascular function. In vitro analyses of cultured endothelial cells were performed to determine the effect of vandetanib on NO production, akt 473 phosphorylation, and endothelial NO synthase protein content and membrane localization. Vandetanib treatment for 6 weeks significantly increased blood pressure, decreased resting brachial artery diameter, and decreased plasma systemic nitrate/nitrite levels compared with baseline. Flow-mediated vasodilation was preserved, and no change was noted in nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation. In vitro, endothelial cell nitrite levels and akt 473 phosphorylation were reduced and vascular endothelial growth receptor 2 levels did not change, but endothelial NO synthase membrane concentration doubled. Vandetanib reduces constitutive NO production and increases blood pressure, yet flow-stimulated NO bioavailability was preserved.

30|$|In the literature, {{there are}} a few {{algorithms}} aiming at solving desynchronization attacks. For cropping (such as editing, <b>signal</b> <b>interruption</b> in wireless transmission, and data packet loss in IP network), researchers repeatedly embedded a template into different regions of the signal [9]-[13], such as synchronization code-based self synchronization methods [9]-[11] and the use of multiple redundant watermarks [14], [15]. Though the template based watermarking can combat cropping but cannot cope with TSM operations, even for the scaling amount of ± 1 %. In the audio watermarking community, there exist some TSM-resilient watermarking strategies, such as peak points based [16]-[18] and recently reported histogram based [19], [20]. In [16], a bit can be hidden by quantizing the length of each two adjacent peak points. In [17], the watermark was repeatedly embedded into the edges of an audio signal by viewing pitch-invariant TSM as a special form of random cropping, removing and adding some portions of the audio signal while preserving the pitch. In [18], the invariance of dyadic wavelet transform to linear scaling was exploited to design audio watermarking by modulating the wave shape. The three dominant peak point-based watermarking methods are resistant to TSM because the peaks can still be detected before and after a TSM operation. The histogram-based methods [19], [20] are robust to TSM operations because the shape of histogram of an audio signal is provably invariant to temporal linear scaling. In addition, the histogram is independent of a sample's position in the time domain.|$|E
40|$|The Delta/Notch signal {{transduction}} pathway {{is central to}} T cell differentiation from haemopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although T cell development is well characterized using expression of cell surface markers, the detailed mechanisms driving differentiation have not been established. This issue becomes central with observations that adult HSCs exhibit poor differentiation towards the T cell lineage relative to neonatal or embryonic precursors. This study investigates the contribution of Notch signalling and stromal support cells to differentiation of adult and Cord Blood (CB) human HSCs, using the Notch signalling OP 9 Delta co-culture system. Co-cultured cells were assayed at weekly intervals during development for phenotype markers using flow cytometry. Cells were also assayed for mRNA expression at critical developmental stages. Expression of the central thymocyte marker CD 4 was initiated independently of Notch signalling, while cells grown with Notch signalling had reduced expression of CD 4 mRNA and protein. Interruption of Notch signalling in partially differentiated cells increased CD 4 mRNA and protein expression, and promoted differentiation to CD 4 (+) CD 8 (+) T cells. We identified a set of genes related to T cell development that were initiated by Notch signalling, and also a set of genes subsequently altered by Notch <b>signal</b> <b>interruption.</b> These results demonstrate that while Notch signalling is essential for establishment of the T cell lineage, at later stages of differentiation, its removal late in differentiation promotes more efficient DP cell generation. Notch signalling adds to signals provided by stromal cells to allow HSCs to differentiate to T cells via initiation of transcription factors such as HES 1, GATA 3 and TCF 7. We also identify gene expression profile differences that may account for low generation of T cells from adult HSCs...|$|E

40|$|Male {{courtship}} {{behavior in}} Drosophila melanogaster {{can be modified}} by experience. Courtship conditioning is an aversive learning paradigm in which female pheromonal cues {{are associated with a}} negative courtship experience. Following a one hour pairing with a mated female, a male subject will display suppressed levels of courtship towards virgin female targets for 1 - 2 hours (Siegel & Hall, 1979). A previous study has shown that male subjects will exhibit long-term courtship suppression (up to 7 days) following either a continuous 5 hour pairing with a mated female (massed training) or three spaced 1 hour pairings (McBride et al., 1999), but other studies using similar training protocols have yielded inconsistent results (Nigrini, 1999; Sakai et al., 2004; Presente et al., 2004). Although previously mated females have traditionally been used as unreceptive conditioning targets for courtship conditioning studies, recent studies have found that the use of Tai 2 males as conditioning targets can also induce significant courtship suppression that lasts for at least one hour (Cross, 2004). Courtship conditioning Long-Term Memory (LTM) that lasts for at least 3 days is induced following a spaced, but not a massed, training protocol with a Tai 2 male. Although it is unclear whether this memory is dependent upon protein synthesis, treatment with a glucose solution immediately following spaced training is sufficient to prevent courtship conditioning LTM. Recent studies suggest that dopaminergic activity is necessary for proper acquisition, but not retrieval of olfactory memory. Although the inactivation of dopamine release does not seem {{to play a role in}} the mechanisms that mediate STM of courtship conditioning, this <b>signaling</b> <b>interruption</b> does seem to alter the behavior of naive males towards decapitated targets. These results indicate that courtship conditioning memory is not mediated by the same dopamine-dependent mechanism that underlies memory of aversive olfactory paradigms...|$|R
