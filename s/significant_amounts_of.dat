5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E

5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring {{can be explained by}} the hypothesis that it contains <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.|$|E
