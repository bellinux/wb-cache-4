5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E

5000|$|The sticks {{are cast}} to {{determine}} how far a token can advance. The score is determined by counting the sticks that are over, {{and those that are}} up. Each combination has a name. One stick over (flat side <b>up)</b> and three <b>sticks</b> <b>up</b> (round side up) is called [...] "do". Two <b>sticks</b> <b>up</b> and two <b>sticks</b> over is called [...] "gae" [...] (dog). One <b>stick</b> <b>up</b> and three <b>sticks</b> over is called [...] "geol". All sticks over is called [...] "yut", whereas all <b>sticks</b> <b>up</b> is called [...] "mo". A [...] "do" [...] is worth one space advancement, a [...] "gae" [...] is worth two space advancement, a [...] "geol" [...] is worth 3 space advancement, [...] "yut" [...] is worth 4 space advancement, and [...] "mo" [...] is worth 5 space advancement. When the sticks come to the result of either [...] "yut" [...] or [...] "mo", the player has another chance of throwing the <b>sticks</b> <b>up</b> again (optional- some people prefer not to play with this rule). If you get [...] "yut" [...] or [...] "mo" [...] consecutively, you play(throw) again.|$|R

25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
25|$|The Sarmatians had a near-religious {{fondness for}} their swords: tribal worship was {{directed}} at a sword <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> from the ground, similar to the sword in the stone. They carried standards {{in the form of}} dragons. Ossetian Nart sagas contain a number of interesting parallels to the Arthurian legends. First, the life of the Nart warrior (batraz) is tied to his sword, which must be thrown into the sea at his death. When one wounded Batraz asks his last surviving comrade to do the task for him, his companion tries to fool him twice before finally hurling the weapon into the sea; rather like Arthur's wondrous sword Excalibur which had to be returned to the Lady of the Lake at his death by his last surviving knight, Bedivere, who only did the deed on his third trip to the lake. The Nart heroes Soslan and Sosryko, collect the beards of vanquished enemies to trim their cloaks like Arthur's enemy Rience: the subjects of both stories have one last beard to obtain before the cloak is complete. Two other similar motifs are the Cup of the Narts (Nartyamonga), which appeared at feasts, delivered to each person what he liked best to eat, and which was kept by the bravest of the Narts ('Knights') - somewhat similar to the Holy Grail connected to the Arthurian cycle – and the magical woman, dressed in white, associated with water, who helps the hero acquire his sword – similar to the Lady of the Lake.|$|E

500|$|Prosaurolophus ( [...] ; meaning [...] "before Saurolophus", in {{comparison}} to the later dinosaur with a similar head crest) is a genus of hadrosaurid (or duck-billed) dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of North America.

Around , its fossils have been found in the late Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta, and the roughly contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation in Montana, dating to around 75.5-74.0million years ago. Its most recognizable feature is a small solid crest formed by the nasal bones, <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> in front of the eyes.|$|E

500|$|During {{the course}} of the tale's development, Warne {{proposed}} launching Mr. Tod as the first in a new series of tales in slightly larger formats with elaborate bindings to accommodate wider spines. Potter objected. She did not want to become involved in a new series; her eyesight was failing, and she had grown weary of writing. She complained of having difficulty in producing [...] "fresh short stories", and believed children preferred little change in the books. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod, and the next book, The Tale of Pigling Bland were published in a larger format with elaborate bindings as [...] "Series II, New Style". Potter disliked the new endpaper depicting Samuel Whiskers <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> a giant poster while watched by other animal characters, thinking it too like a railway advertisement.

Several writers for The A.V. Club included the track on their list of seventeen [...] "well-intended yet misguided feminist anthems" [...] in 2010; they agreed that the song itself was [...] "actually one of her better songs", although they felt that its accompanying music video overshadowed its lyrical [...] " [...] the double standard of female sexuality" [...] since Aguilera conducted herself in a provocative fashion that conflicted its intended meaning.

500|$|Rodgers {{composed}} the music once {{he received the}} lyrics from Hammerstein. [...] A number of stories are told of {{the speed with which}} he wrote the music for South Pacifics numbers. [...] "Happy Talk" [...] was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed [...] "Bali Ha'i" [...] in ten minutes over coffee in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical. [...] Hammerstein's lyrics for [...] "Bali Ha'i" [...] were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer Jo Mielziner had painted. [...] Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano.

500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the segment [...] "The Monkey's Paw", Hank Azaria faked some Arabic. Usually, the writers get inspiration for the Halloween specials from old horror stories, but recently, the writers tried to conceive of their own stories instead of creating more parodies. Also, when the Moroccan salesman tries to warn Homer Simpson, saying [...] "You'll be sorry", the animators forgot to move his lips. They only realized their error after the broadcast, so they decided not to change it. While writing the segment, Sam Simon, one of the writers, wanted the fingers to go down in such an order so they would eventually have the middle finger <b>sticking</b> <b>up.</b> Once the animation would have been complete, however, they could not have gone through; Fox would have refused to air the episode. They had considered the alternative of deliberately blurring the middle finger themselves, but decided that Fox would have also refused. For this episode, {{there were a lot of}} loop lines; for instance, the ending to [...] "The Monkey's Paw" [...] was added to the last second. As a result of the loop, they still retained Flanders's old house next to his newly created castle. In order to make the episode fill the time needed, the animators often extended the laughing time for Kang and Kodos.|$|E

However, despite Claudette's warnings, Babe continues to blackmail the Cokers.

Badland explained Babe's rivalry with Claudette: [...] "Claudette's <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> for Les and Pam. She's a fair match for Babe and it's interesting when they go head-to-head." [...] Badland hoped that the feud would last a long time, opining that it was [...] "fabulous", and that [...] "neither [...] will back down easily", and adding that she thought Babe would triumph over Claudette, though admitted she was biased and probably [...] "the only person on Babe's side". An Inside Soap reporter said Babe and Claudette's feud was [...] "exciting" [...] because Claudette is [...] "fearsome" [...] and Babe is [...] "equally terrifying", and suspected that [...] "Cunning Babe [...] be so easily intimidated". A reporter for All About Soap questioned if Babe had [...] "finally met her match" [...] in Claudette, and compared the two women. In terms of cunning, they said that Babe has it [...] "by the bucketload", while Claudette may be [...] "getting soft in her old age" [...] and may not be [...] "sharp enough to take on Babe". They also opined that Claudette had more [...] "fighting strenth" [...] as she continues to come back after a [...] "knock down" [...] and would not go down without a fight, while Babe's craftiness [...] "means she'd easily {{come up with a new}} way to destroy an enemy". They said that Claudette has a [...] "nasty and murderous" [...] history while Babe's past is [...] "chequered" [...] but she had never killed someone, concluding that Claudette would be the winner of the feud, but still saying that they [...] "wouldn't mess with Babe!".|$|E

[...] She has used networking sites such as Twitter and MySpace to discuss and highlight the human rights abuses and war crimes that Sri Lanka is accused of perpetrating against Tamils, citing news articles, human rights group reports, government reports, her own experiences as a child and on her return to the island in 2001 to support calls for a ceasefire. M.I.A. has also used a great deal of tiger print and imagery, a symbol for the Tamil Tigers in both album artwork and music videos, such as seen in [...] "Galang". Being the only Tamil widely known in Western media, M.I.A. has discussed how she feels a responsibility to represent the Tamil minority. M.I.A. has spoken of discussions with witnesses during and after the war as reinforcing the need for international intervention to protect and provide justice to Tamil people. As the 2009 Tamil diaspora protests gathered pace, she joined other activists in condemning the actions of the Sri Lankan government against the Tamil populace as a slow [...] "systematic" [...] genocide. Telling TIME that she didn't see anything wrong in <b>sticking</b> <b>up</b> for 300,000 trapped and dying people, M.I.A. stated that international governments were privy to Sri Lanka's use of widespread censorship and propaganda on the rebellion during the island's civil war to aid its impunity in numerous atrocities on civilians, but had no will to end it. Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary denied that his country perpetrated genocide, responding that he felt M.I.A. was [...] "misinformed" [...] and that [...] "it's best she stays with what she's good at, which is music, not politics."
