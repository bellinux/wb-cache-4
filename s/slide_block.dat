40|$|Abstract: In {{the process}} of {{die-casting}} die design, the die castings should be usually left in the moving die in order to design ejecting mechanism conveniently when open mould. For the special structure of die castings, when lateral side core-pulling mechanism and larger wrapping force on the fixed-die core than on the moving-die core are required, the time-lapse core-pulling mechanism with side <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> can be adopted, which can make die castings left in the moving-die after open mould, and assure die castings production to do successfully.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the movement of large rock masses or allochthons on low-angle surfaces, we have studied the 3400 -km 2 Heart Mountain <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> of northwestern Wyoming and southwestern Montana. The Heart Mountain <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> was initiated on a 2 gradient, with its toe thrust a minimum of 45 km across an early Eocene landscape. The <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> moved on a basal layer that ranges in thickness from a few tens of centimeters to several meters. This basal layer commonly has a concrete-like appearance of rounded, mixed-lithology grains in a fine-grained carbonate matrix, and in some locations it has features similar to sedimentary deposits, including both normal and inverse grading, flow banding, turbidite-like structures, and clastic dikes containing pieces of carbonized wood. Nowhere did we observe crosscutting relationships in the basal layer or overlying clastic dikes, as would be expected from incremental or noncatastrophic emplacement. Results from cathodoluminescence and d 18 O, d 13 C, and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic compositions from the basal layer support a single movement event followed by hydrothermal and meteoric fluids percolating through a permeable basal layer. These observations suggest that a catastrophic movement on the detachment resulted in frictional heating {{at the base of the}} slide. When the generated heat was at least 800 C, calcining of carbonates occurred, yielding calcium and magnesium oxide powders and carbon dioxide gas. The calcium oxide powder became mechanically fluidized by the pressurized carbon dioxide gas, leading to a reduced coefficient of friction at the base of the slide, which in turn permitted the long runout on such a low-angle surface. This mechanism might be applied to explain a wide range of catastrophic sliding events where carbonate rocks are involved...|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} positions {{between the}} four <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> {{vary with the}} movement of the table due to the geometric errors of the guide rail. Consequently, the additional load on the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> is increased. A new method of error measurement and identification by using a self-designed stress test plate was presented. BP neural network model was used to establish the mapping between the stress of key measurement points on the test plate and the displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks.</b> By measuring the stress, the relative displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were obtained, from which the geometric errors of the guide rails were converted. Firstly, the finite element model was built to find the key measurement points of the test plate. Then the BP neural network was trained by using the samples extracted from the finite element model. The stress at the key measurement points were taken as the input and the relative displacements of the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were taken as the output. Finally, the geometric errors of the two guide rails were obtained according to the measured stress.

40|$|Allochthonous Devonian {{limestone}} {{slide blocks}} {{are common in}} the Visléan to probably basal Namurian Retamares Member (lower Almogia Formation) of the Malaguides. The only <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> known from the coastal Palaeozoic between Fuengirola and Estepona is described from the Arroyo de la Cruz W of Mar-bella. This block is approximately 50 m in diameter and 11 m thick. Four stages of interna 1 deformation prove its allochthonous nature. Deformation features and tectonic setting indicate a S to SE derivation. The block is of late Frasnian to early Famennian age. In terms of conodont zonation, it represents the Up-per gigas Zone and the Middle Palmatolepis triangu-laris to Lower rhomboidea Zones, with the Uppermost gigas and Lower Pa. triangularis Zones missing. Pe-lagic mudstones predominate in rocks of the Upper gigas Zone, whereas fine-grained limestone turbidi-tes, derived from lower slope environments or from intrabasinal rises, piredominate above the hiatus. Car-bonate microfacies as well as conodont biofacies point to a deep-water deposition of all limestones. Concur-rence of microfacies and biostratigraphy between the <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> and limestones pebbles from conglomera-tes of the Retamarerj Member prove a common source area.

40|$|Monitoring and {{analysis}} of hydrological parameters are crucial to understand the underlying causes and mechanisms of a landslide. This paper analyses hydrological parameters of an existing creeping landslide site in western Japan known as Nuta-Yone Landslide. The landslide site has been active since the last several decades. Attempts to retard the rate of landslide have been partially successful but several very expensive underground horizontal drains proved to be less effective or ineffective due to poor locations. Groundwater flow and resulting fluctuation of pore water pressures at the slip layer of a <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> of the landslide site were simulated by constructing a MODFLOW based three-dimensional groundwater flow model. The distributions of different parameters in the calibrated model were used to explain the reasons of ineffective drains and categorize locations for the drains that have higher potential of being effective. Local variations in pore water pressure fluctuations were used to pin-point the areas that needed dewatering. The groundwater flow model results were integrated with a two-dimensional slope stability analysis method to find local distribution of two-dimensional factor of safety within the <b>sliding</b> <b>block.</b> Fluctuation in quasi-three-dimensional factor of safety of the entire <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> was simulated by using various methods.

40|$|Abstract. One new sliding-block {{balancing}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} single-cylinder diesel engine. In the new mechanism, the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> is installed against the engine piston. The reciprocation trajectory of <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> is collinear with the piston trajectory, while <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods. The new mechanism includes the crankshaft, connecting rod ring, the slider and the guide components. Through the bearing, connecting rod is installed in the eccentric journal of the crankshaft. The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the guide groove. Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the guide hole of the slide. The optimized parameters for the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of crank radius to connecting rod length. The appropriate results can balance both the centrifugal inertia force and the reciprocating inertia force generated by piston group.

40|$|Rooted {{detachment}} faults and detachments beneath rootless {{slide blocks}} exhibit many similar structural characteristics. However, while rooted detachments {{are thought to}} penetrate into the midcrust and to accommodate significant crustal extension, rootless detachments break to the surface downdip and are not directly involved in such extension. Distinguishing between these two mechanically different kinds of structure {{is central to the}} assessment of extension magnitude. Here we examine deformation along the Mormon Peak detachment, a feature that has been cited as an example of both a rooted and a rootless structure. Located in the Mormon Mountains of southeastern Nevada, this detachment has been interpreted as one of three low‐angle normal faults of regional scale that together are thought to have accommodated more than 50 km of Basin and Range extension. For the most part, however, the Mormon Peak detachment is expressed as a series of isolated exposures where Paleozoic rocks are in brittle fault contact with nonmylonitized underlying rocks. Individual blocks contain high‐angle normal faults that terminate downward at their respective detachment surfaces, yielding a geometry common to both modes of emplacement. In order to test between these competing interpretations, we studied deformational characteristics close to the detachment surface, reasoning that a seismogenic fault ought to differ fundamentally from a surficial <b>slide</b> <b>block,</b> particularly if the <b>slide</b> <b>block</b> was emplaced in a single event rather than by protracted or episodic creep. An examination of the contact mapped as the Mormon Peak detachment reveals that the character of deformation is indistinguishable from that of known gravity‐driven slide blocks and is fundamentally different from that associated with seismically cycled faults. Moreover, the orientation of kinematic indicators observed at detachment surfaces is consistently close to the downdip direction, which in many places diverges strongly from the expected direction of movement in the rooted detachment model. We conclude that outcrops of the inferred upper plate of the Mormon Peak detachment represent an assemblage of individual rootless gravity‐driven slide blocks and not the erosional remnants of a formerly contiguous extensional allochthon. If similar misidentifications have been made elsewhere in the Basin and Range Province, total Cenozoic extension may have been significantly overestimated. Implications for the interpretation of extensional geology in general are far‐reaching...|$|E
