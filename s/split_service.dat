50|$|During Australian rules {{football}} and rugby football season, the station offers a <b>split</b> <b>service,</b> with AFL games airing {{on the main}} transmitter and NRL and Super Rugby games airing on the FM repeaters. This decision was made because ABC Riverina's service territory is split by the Barassi Line, which separates the traditional centres for Australian rules {{football and}} rugby.|$|E
50|$|Jacaranda FM {{operates}} a regional transmitter <b>split</b> <b>service</b> from {{a studio in}} Nelspruit.

Split broadcasts occur each weekday from 12:00-16:00 and on Saturdays from 10:00-14:00. Morning and afternoon drive time newscasts are also fed to the regional audience.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the areas}} served by ILR {{continued}} to increase and 1986 the IBA sanctioned in principle the idea that different services could be broadcast on each station's FM and AM frequency. The first experimental part-time <b>split</b> <b>service</b> was provided by Radio Forth, who created Festival City Radio {{for the duration of}} the Edinburgh Festival in 1984. The first station to permanently split their frequencies was Guildford's County Sound who rebranded the FM output as Premier Radio and turned the AM output into a new golden oldies station, County Sound Gold in 1988. Other stations then followed suit.|$|E

URE broadcast in FM from 30 Sep-27 Oct 1997 (during which it also maintained a <b>split</b> <b>service</b> daytime 1404AM output, and had separate jingles for 999 kHz AM.

30|$|SBB Cargo has {{developed}} a new business model for the Swiss <b>Split</b> <b>service</b> that integrates {{all parts of the}} process chain into a single product. This means that the entire distribution process from the hinterland terminal to the end customer including the return of the empty container to a depot is optimized. In the new model terminal operations, container movements and container wagons are dispatched from a single source. This will improve efficiency by, for example, increasing the number of round trips per week for container wagons used in Swiss Split from one to two or three a week in future.|$|E

3000|$|One {{attempt to}} {{increase}} the competitiveness of the rail sectors in the important container market is the Swiss Split concept. Swiss Split is a rail service in Switzerland which distributes containers via conventional shunting yards directly from intermodal terminals to the final recipients’ sidings by rail. Currently Swiss <b>Split</b> <b>service</b> is quite successful, although it still has several weaknesses (e.g. {{in the areas of}} rolling stock, transhipment terminal structures and the service production schemes for single wagon load i.e. SWL) that reduce its competitiveness compared to container distribution by road [2]. With this in mind, the authors seek to answer two main research questions: [...]...|$|E
30|$|Shifting the {{transport}} of goods from road to rail and inland waterways is a major goal of European transport policy. Current research often focuses {{on the distribution of}} maritime containers by using combined transport or more specifically, on the usage of rail or inland waterways to serve hinterland terminals and the subsequent distribution of containers to recipients by truck. Very little research has considered using rail for the distribution of containers right up to the final recipients. In Switzerland, however, SBB Cargo still distributes a large number of containers directly to their final recipients by using the Swiss <b>Split</b> <b>service.</b> The research presented here aims at developing ideas that might help to improve the competitiveness of container distribution by rail. It presents a holistic approach that covers the entire transport chain. Many of these ideas will be implemented in an improved service called New Swiss Split as soon as the new Basel-Nord intermodal terminal will have been opened in 2019.|$|E
30|$|The overall {{feasibility}} of the improved Swiss <b>Split</b> <b>service</b> {{was tested using}} a cost model. The authors developed railway production data to model the proposed improvements in rolling stock, terminal structure, the Swiss Split business model and SWL production improvements. For example they developed a modal-split model for the container distribution in Switzerland and assigned container flows to specific terminals. The resulting container flows were integrated into the cost model by changing the transport distances between terminals and shunting yards and by revising the average train length {{to account for the}} improved bundling of container flows. The effects of the business model improvements proposed by SBB Cargo were integrated directly into the model (improved efficiency of the wagon usage by shorter round-trip times, decreasing transhipment costs in hinterland terminals). The improvements from rolling stock, production schemes were integrated by changing the input data for the railway production processes (e.g., number of wagons per train, transport distances, shunting times etc.). The model used a three step approach to estimate the costs for the transport of one container on its entire trip.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{pointed out}} that the {{language}} of the DMCA does not ever limit the activities to mere storage. Instead, the DMCA <b>splits</b> <b>service</b> provider into two definitions. The narrower definition is used by § 512(a) and expressly notes that the service provider may not modify the content it receives or transmits. [...] The broader definition, and the one that applies to Veoh, does not contain this narrowing characteristic. [...] The Court also noted that another court had also noted that [...] "gateway" [...] functions, like the one present in this case, should not act as a bar to the Safe Harbor. [...] Thus, the Court concluded that Veoh was not disqualified from § 512(c)'s Safe Harbor due to its automated process in response to user-submitted material.|$|R
