25|$|Hemp <b>shives</b> are {{the core}} of the stem, hemp hurds are broken parts of the core. In the EU, they are used for animal bedding (horses, for instance), or for horticultural mulch.

25|$|In 1993, Andrew <b>Shives</b> {{was forced}} to leave the band. Cazares {{recorded}} both the guitar and bass for the entire album. In November the same year, the band met Belgian Christian Olde Wolbers through Evan Seinfeld of Biohazard. Wolbers auditioned for Fear Factory's permanent bassist. Wolbers joined the band immediately since the band's tour was starting in two weeks.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} people, {{including}} Lewis Paullin, settled <b>Shive</b> in the 1870s. A man named Robert <b>Shive</b> was the namesake of the community. A post office opened inside a store operated by Robert and James W. <b>Shive</b> in 1884; Robert <b>Shive</b> was appointed as the postmaster. By 1908 {{the community of}} <b>Shive</b> had four stores. Around that period a cotton gin operated. In 1910 <b>Shive</b> had 50 residents. The post office closed in 1936. In 1940 <b>Shive</b> had 64 residents. In the period from 1980 to 2000 <b>Shive</b> had 61 residents.|$|R

25|$|Seventh seed Gonzaga took on tenth seeded North Carolina. Gonzaga's Tiffanie <b>Shives</b> was {{scoreless}} for 31 minutes, {{but then}} scored 14 {{in the next}} five minutes. Her first basket cut the Tarheels lead to two, and her next basket gave Gonzaga a lead they would not relinquish, although North Carolina cut the lead to one with under four minutes to go, only to fall short 82–76.|$|E
500|$|Opened in 2010, the Greenville Bridge carries US82/US278 {{over the}} Mississippi River between Refuge, Mississippi, and <b>Shives,</b> Arkansas. It is located [...] down river from the {{original}} bridge, built in 1940. Designed by HNTB, it is a four-lane cable-stayed bridge with more than [...] of bridge deck straddled by two concrete towers [...] feet high and anchored by concrete piers planted [...] below the riverbed. It has four fans of strand steel cable connected {{to the top of}} the towers which support the deck.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shiven</b> Bharadwaj:- The son of Asht and Adhyaksh’s classmate Vidur, <b>Shiven</b> is very honoured {{to be sent}} as Asht’s {{student and}} wants to {{dedicate}} his life to him.

40|$|Flax <b>shive</b> {{constitutes}} about 70 % of the {{flax stem}} and has limited use. Because <b>shive</b> is a lignocellulosic by-product, it can potentially be pyrolyzed and activated {{to produce an}} activated carbon. The objective {{of this study was}} to create an activated carbon from flax <b>shive</b> by chemical activation in order to achieve significant binding of selected divalent cations (cadmium, calcium, copper, magnesium, nickel, zinc). <b>Shive</b> carbons activated by exposure to phosphoric acid and com-pressed air showed greater binding of cadmium, copper, nickel or zinc than a sulfuric acid-activated flax <b>shive</b> carbon reported in the literature and a commercial, wood-based carbon. Uptake of calcium from a drinking water sample by the <b>shive</b> carbon was similar to commercial drinking water filters that contained cation exchange resins. Magnesium removal by the <b>shive</b> carbon was greater than a commercial drinking water filtration carbon but less than for filters containing cation exchange resins. The results indicate that chemically activated flax <b>shive</b> carbon shows considerable promise as a component in industrial and residential water filtration systems for removal of divalent cations...|$|R
50|$|For {{washing and}} filling, the old <b>shive</b> is removed using a chisel or a special tool, {{revealing}} a hole around 3 inches (7.5 cm) across. Once the cask has been filled and fined, a new <b>shive</b> is hammered into place. The {{hole in the}} centre of the <b>shive</b> will be sealed with a small wooden or plastic peg. The cask is then transported to the pub.|$|R
2500|$|Based on the Concrete recording, Max Cavalera {{recommended}} Fear Factory to the then-death-metal-focused Roadrunner Records label, {{which offered}} the band a recording contract. While the band signed the contract, {{it has since}} become controversial because of Roadrunner's treatment of the band during the events surrounding its 2002 breakup. This {{was reflected in the}} first album Archetype (2004), which was released following the band's re-formation. The opening song with lyrics by Burton C. Bell, [...] "Slave Labor", was direct about the band's feelings on the matter. After working with numerous bassists, Andrew <b>Shives</b> was hired as a live bassist prior to the release of Soul of a New Machine.|$|E

50|$|While nursing {{him back}} to health, Kaaya is {{attracted}} to <b>Shiven,</b> an exciting feeling she has never experienced before. <b>Shiven</b> too finds himself drawn to Kaya, a girl unlike any he has ever known. Kaya is caught in a dilemma for she has too long subdued her basic instincts and desires in her search for the 'ultimate truth'. A sexual attraction is one that her conditioned mind sees as a sin (paap), but one she cannot deny. <b>Shiven</b> sees this dilemma and tries to show Kaya {{that there is a}} life out there which she has a full right to live. In the meantime, Kaya's father finds out about what has been going on under his roof and is furious with <b>Shiven.</b> He sees <b>Shiven</b> as a polluting influence upon his peaceful life, a man who has brought defiling things like pistols into their home. At this juncture, Shiven's past catches up with them and Mehra's men are close on his heels.|$|R

50|$|A shive {{is a small}} {{bundle of}} incompletely cooked wood fibres in the {{chemical}} pulp used in papermaking. They are smaller than knots and {{are more difficult to}} separate from the pulp. Typically the content of <b>shives</b> in kraft pulp is 0.1 to 1.0%. An excess of <b>shives</b> is a sign of poor impregnation of the wood chips. <b>Shives</b> are separated from the pulp in the screening and can be added back after refining. Even though <b>shives</b> are darker than rest of the pulp, they may pass unnoticed to the paper machine because they are easily bleached. <b>Shives</b> in the paper machine can cause web breakage or other operational problems. They might also end as spots in the finished paper.|$|E

50|$|The Setralit {{techniques}} are applied either on crushed dry straw of bast fiber plants (mechanical fiber extraction) or on decorticated fibers (long fibers, flax tow). In {{the first case}} the fiber has to be separated mechanically, after the ultrasonic break-down, from its non-fibrous components (<b>shives).</b> As a benefit one gets clean <b>shives</b> as a byproduct which {{can serve as a}} raw material for high quality fiber powder. With the help of modified Setralit techniques the <b>shives</b> may also be upgraded separately.|$|E
