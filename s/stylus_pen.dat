40|$|<b>Stylus</b> <b>pens</b> {{are often}} used with mobile {{information}} devices. However, {{few studies have examined}} the stylus’ simple movements because the technical expertise to support documentation with <b>stylus</b> <b>pens</b> has not been developed. This study examined the usability of <b>stylus</b> <b>pens</b> in authentic documentation tasks, including three main tasks (sentence, table, and paragraph making) with two types of styluses (touchsmart stylus and mobile stylus) and a traditional pen. The statistical results showed that participants preferred the traditional pen in all criteria. Because of inconvenient hand movements, the mobile stylus was the least preferred on every task. Mobility does not provide any advantage in using the stylus. In addition, the study also found inconvenient hand support using a stylus and different feedback between a stylus and a traditional pen. This study was supported by the Dongguk University Research Fund of 2015. Support for the University Jaume-I (UJI) Robotic Intelligence Laboratory is provided in part by Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (DPI 2011 - 27846), by Generalitat Valenciana (PROMETEOII/ 2014 / 028) and by Universitat Jaume I (P 1 - 1 B 2014 - 52) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the role of {{materiality}} in tangible interaction design for young children. We specifically target children aged 4 to 6 years old because of societal trend of early exposure to touch screen devices for children. This study compares three types of material (felt, wood, and plastic) for tangibles along with touch-based interaction and how the differences implicate child art creation on an iPad application. Through mixed-methods analysis of twenty-six participants? experiences, we use data sources of video recordings, drawings, and interview. The main findings looked at the relationship in hardness between digital and physical tools as well as the differences of interactions when using finger-based and <b>stylus</b> <b>pens</b> for physical drawing tools. The findings from this study may be applied to design tangible user interfaces for young children...|$|R
