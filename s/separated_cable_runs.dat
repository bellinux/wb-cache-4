50|$|The high {{signaling}} {{level of}} 5 VDC {{is used to}} accommodate long <b>cable</b> <b>runs</b> from card readers to the associated access control panel, typically located in a secure closet. Most card reader manufacturers publish a maximum <b>cable</b> <b>run</b> of 500 feet (150m). An advantage of the Wiegand signaling format {{is that it allows}} very long <b>cable</b> <b>runs,</b> far longer than other interface standards of its day allowed.|$|R
2500|$|The fiber <b>cable</b> system <b>runs</b> from Harstad via Breivika on {{the island}} of Andøya to Hotellneset on Svalbard. The system {{consists}} of two <b>separate</b> <b>cables,</b> Segment 1 and Segment 2 between Breivika and Hotellneset, and Segment 1A and Segment 2A between Breivika and Harstad. The lengths for Segment 1 and 2 are , respectively, and for Segment 1A and 2A [...] Both cables have eight fiber pairs, of which only one is in use. Use of additional pairs requires new equipment to be installed in Harstad and Hotellneset. Segment 2 is redundant to Segment 1 and is only used if the former should fall out. Near shore the cables are armored.|$|R
50|$|Increasing cable {{capacitance}} {{over long}} <b>cable</b> <b>runs</b> decreases the signal {{level at which}} high frequencies are attenuated. If each wire carries half the signal voltage swing as in fully differential outputs then longer <b>cable</b> <b>runs</b> can be used without the loss of high frequencies.|$|R

The system {{consists}} of two <b>separate</b> <b>cables,</b> Segment 1 and Segment 2 between Breivika and Hotellneset, and Segment 1A and Segment 2A between Breivika and Harstad. The lengths for Segment 1 and 2 are 1375 and 1339 km, respectively, and for Segment 1A and 2A 61 and 74 km. Both cables have eight fiber pairs, of which only one is in use. Use of additional pairs requires new equipment to be installed in Harstad and Hotellneset. Segment 2 is redundant to Segment 1 and is only used if the former should fall out.

50|$|Venues that host {{television}} productions fairly often, such {{as sports}} arenas, will usually have triaxial <b>cables</b> <b>run</b> from {{the location of}} the TV truck to common camera locations throughout the building. This is convenient for visiting television crews, who can simply plug into existing <b>cable</b> <b>runs</b> instead of having to <b>run</b> their own <b>cables</b> and remove them after filming.|$|R

50|$|High-voltage cables may be any length, with {{relatively}} short cables used in apparatus, longer <b>cables</b> <b>run</b> within buildings or as buried cables {{in an industrial}} plant or for power distribution, and the longest <b>cables</b> often <b>run</b> as submarine <b>cables</b> under the ocean for power transmission.|$|R

25|$|The Swedish <b>cable</b> <b>ran</b> from Sweden, and the United States cable {{from the}} United States embassy in Denmark. However, neither <b>cable</b> <b>ran</b> {{directly}} to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at Porthcurno, near Land's End, the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, in particular to the codebreakers and analysts in Room 40 at the Admiralty.|$|R
