2500|$|Meanwhile, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, {{along with}} Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA), [...] {{had been working}} with John Ashcroft on a draft bill, called the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001. On September 19, 2001 this first draft is {{introduced}} to Congress. Many {{of the most controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act were first part of this draft and it was later to be introduced as the PATRIOT Act/USA Act [...] which in turn became the basis for the final USA PATRIOT Act. Among other things, the administration proposal discussed extending roving wiretaps from the sole domain of domestic agencies into the domain of foreign intelligence surveillance and proposed the expansion of the use of wiretaps from phonelines to Internet technology. It would have made it possible for more law enforcement agencies to disseminate wiretap information and would have expanded the scope of surveillance subpoenas to allow broader access to personal records [...] including [...] "books, records, papers, documents, and other items." [...] Both the bill introduced by Senator Graham and the proposed Anti-Terrorism Act draft were referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence. According to The Washington Post, EPIC's Jim Dempsey {{and a number of other}} representatives from other civil liberties groups were invited to discussions about the draft, but Dempsey's recollection was that [...] "They [...] were livid, [...] explicitly said, 'We don't think outsiders <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> and we won't talk unless they leave the room.'" [...] Though a deal was brokered, this began causing tensions between parties negotiating the bill and previously amicable discussions started breaking down between Leahy and Ashcroft.|$|E
2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E
