50|$|In the {{versions}} of PRIMOS ca. 1977 and later, the filesystem included a distinctive construct {{known as the}} <b>Segment</b> <b>Directory.</b> Unlike more traditional directories, the files anchored in a <b>segment</b> <b>directory</b> were located using an integer index, effectively reducing searches of the directory to a simple hash function. Segment Directories were used in their Keyed-Index/Direct Access (KI/DA) file access system and in later {{versions of}} the system loader.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{arrangement}} of directory bits called the <b>segment</b> <b>directory</b> to improve directory storage efficiency: a <b>segment</b> <b>directory</b> {{can point to}} several sharing processors with almost {{the same number of}} bits as the pointer which can point to only one. Many directory overflows can be eliminated by using the <b>segment</b> <b>directory</b> element in place of the pointer in the limited directory schemes. Also, the <b>segment</b> <b>directory</b> can be implemented without introducing additional hardware overhead and protocol complexity. The detailed execution-driven simulations show that the <b>segment</b> <b>directory</b> always does better than the pointer and eliminates many directory overflows by up to 85 %. The resulting improvement in bandwidth and execution time is analyzed in detail for limited directory schemes having different behaviors, with respect to the reduced directory overflows. 1...|$|E
50|$|The paper publishes annual {{business}} <b>segment</b> magazine <b>directories</b> including Health Source, {{a medical}} provider directory and Legal Source, a directory of legal service providers. The newspaper website along with local news, includes coverage of space, travel, health, entertainment, weather, sports and coverage of youth sports.|$|R

[...] Being twice as expensive as its nearest rival, critics dismissed it as too expensive, however the directory's higher quality prevailed and it sold well, especially after receiving publicity from Graham Kennedy on the popular In Melbourne Tonight television variety show's [...] "New Products" [...] <b>segment.</b> The <b>directory</b> was embraced by local residents - the word [...] "Melways" [...] quickly became a household name for [...] "street directory".|$|R

Forensic examiners are frequently confronted with content in languages {{that they do not}} understand, and they could benefit from machine translation into their native language. But automated translation of file paths is a difficult problem because of the minimal context for translation and the frequent mixing of multiple languages within a path. This work developed a prototype implementation of a file-path translator that first identifies the language for each <b>directory</b> <b>segment</b> of a path, and then translates to English those that are not already English nor artificial words. Brownâ€™s LA-Strings utility for language identification was tried, but its performance was found inadequate on short strings and it was supplemented with clues from dictionary lookup, Unicode character distributions for languages, country of origin, and language-related keywords. To provide better data for language inference, words used in each directory over a large corpus were aggregated for analysis. The resulting directory-language probabilities were combined with those for each path segment from dictionary lookup and character-type distributions to infer the segment's most likely language. Tests were done on a corpus of 50. 1 million file paths looking for 35 different languages. Tests showed 90. 4 % accuracy on identifying languages of directories and 93. 7 % accuracy on identifying languages of directory/file segments of file paths, even after excluding 44. 4 % of the paths as obviously English or untranslatable. Two of seven proposed language clues were shown to impair directory-language identification. Experiments also compared three translation methods: the Systran translation tool, Google Translate, and word-for-word substitution using dictionaries. Google Translate usually performed the best, but all still made errors with European languages and a significant number of errors with Arabic and Chinese...|$|R
