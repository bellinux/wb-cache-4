40|$|BACKGROUND: Leaf <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare) {{is caused}} by the seed-transmitted hemi-biotrophic fungus Pyrenophora graminea. Race-specific {{resistance}} to leaf stripe is controlled by two known Rdg (Resistance to Drechslera graminea) genes: the H. spontaneum-derived Rdg 1 a and Rdg 2 a, identified in H. vulgare. The aim of the present work was to isolate the Rdg 2 a leaf stripe resistance gene, to characterize the Rdg 2 a locus organization and evolution and to elucidate the histological bases of Rdg 2 a-based leaf stripe resistance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe here the positional cloning and functional characterization of the leaf stripe resistance gene Rdg 2 a. At the Rdg 2 a locus, three sequence-related coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, and leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) encoding genes were identified. Sequence comparisons suggested that paralogs of this resistance locus evolved through recent gene duplication, and were subjected to frequent sequence exchange. Transformation of the leaf stripe susceptible cv. Golden Promise with two Rdg 2 a-candidates under the control of their native 5 ' regulatory sequences identified a member of the CC-NB-LRR gene family that conferred resistance against the Dg 2 leaf stripe isolate, against which the Rdg 2 a-gene is effective. Histological analysis demonstrated that Rdg 2 a-mediated leaf stripe resistance involves autofluorescing cells and prevents pathogen colonization in the embryos without any detectable hypersensitive cell death response, supporting a cell wall reinforcement-based resistance mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This work reports about the cloning of a resistance gene effective against a seed borne disease. We observed that Rdg 2 a was subjected to diversifying selection which is consistent with a model in which the R gene co-evolves with a pathogen effector(s) gene. We propose that inducible responses giving rise to physical and chemical barriers to infection in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of the barley embryo tissues represent mechanisms by which the CC-NB-LRR-encoding Rdg 2 a gene mediates resistance to leaf stripe in the absence of hypersensitive cell death...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} the host range of Septoria species, 27 species/varieties of cereals and certain wild grasses were examined with inoculation experiments under controlled conditions. Most Septoria species were each pathogenic only on a particular host plant, and wild grasses played only a minor role as alternative hosts for these fungi. Septoria tritici isolates from Triticum aestivum infected T. aestivum, T. durum, T. dicoccum and T. compactum, species that may provide a primary inoculum source for S. tritici. Septoria isolates from Aegilops tauschii, Lolium loliaceum, Lophochloa phleoides, Phalaris paradoxa and Hordeum glaucum were pathogenic only on their original hosts. S. passerinii isolates from Hordeum vulgare and H. distichon were pathogenic on all Hordeum species/cultivars tested except H. glaucum.

40|$|Background: Plant hormones {{are well}} known {{regulators}} which balance plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. We investigated the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in resistance of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) against the plant pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Results: Exogenous application of ABA prior to inoculation with M. oryzae led to more <b>disease</b> symptoms <b>on</b> <b>barley</b> leaves. This result contrasted the finding that ABA application enhances resistance of barley against the powdery mildew fungus. Microscopic analysis identified diminished penetration resistance as cause for enhanced susceptibility. Consistently, the barley mutant Az 34, impaired in ABA biosynthesis, was less susceptible to infection by M. oryzae and displayed elevated penetration resistance {{as compared to the}} isogenic wild type cultivar Steptoe. Chemical complementation of Az 34 mutant plants by exogenous application of ABA re-established disease severity to the wild type level. The role of ABA in susceptibility of barley against M. oryzae was corroborated by showing that ABA application led to increased disease severity in all barley cultivars under investigation except for the most susceptible cultivar Pallas. Interestingly, endogenous ABA concentrations did not significantly change after infection of barley with M. oryzae. Conclusion: Our results revealed that elevated ABA levels led to a higher <b>disease</b> severity <b>on</b> <b>barley</b> leaves to M. oryzae. This supports earlier reports on the role of ABA in enhancing susceptibility of rice to the same pathogen and thereby demonstrates a host plant-independent function of this phytohormone in pathogenicity of monocotyledonous plants against M. oryzae...|$|R

Verticillium stem <b>striping</b> <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> oilseed rape was mainly observed in continental Europe, but has recently {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom. The disease {{is caused by the}} hybrid fungal species Verticillium longisporum that originates from at least three separate hybridization events, yet hybrids between Verticillium progenitor species A 1 and D 1 are mainly responsible for Verticillium stem striping. We reveal a hitherto un-described dichotomy within V. longisporum lineage A 1 /D 1 that correlates with the geographic distribution of the isolates with an 'A 1 /D 1 West' and an 'A 1 /D 1 East' cluster. Genome comparison between representatives of the A 1 /D 1 West and East clusters excluded population distinctiveness through separate hybridization events. Remarkably, the A 1 /D 1 West population that is genetically more diverse than the entire A 1 /D 1 East cluster caused the sudden emergence of Verticillium stem striping in the UK, whereas in continental Europe Verticillium stem striping is predominantly caused by the more genetically uniform A 1 /D 1 East population. The observed genetic diversity of the A 1 /D 1 West population argues against a recent introduction of the pathogen into the UK, but rather suggests that the pathogen previously established in the UK and remained latent or unnoticed as oilseed rape pathogen until recently. </p...|$|R
40|$|Barley {{yellow mosaic}} virus (BaYMV) is the causal agent of a soil-borne {{systemic}} mosaic <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> <b>barley.</b> It {{has been reported}} in Belgium since the 1980 s. The control of this disease is managed almost exclusively through the use of resistant varieties. The resistance of most commercial barley cultivars grown in Europe is conferred mainly by a single recessive gene, rym 4. This monogenic resistance provides immunity against BaYMV pathotype 1 and has been mapped <b>on</b> <b>barley</b> chromosome 3 HL and shown to be caused by mutations in the translation initiation factor eIF 4 E. Another pathotype, BaYMV pathotype 2, which appeared in the late 1980 s (in Belgium, in the early 1990 s), is able to overcome the rym 4 -controlled resistance. Until recently, this pathotype remained confined to specific locations. During a systematic survey in 2003, mosaic symptoms were observed only <b>on</b> susceptible <b>barley</b> cultivars collected in Belgian fields. BaYMV was detected by ELISA and RT-PCR on the susceptible cultivars and only by RT-PCR on the resistant cultivars. In 2004, mosaic symptoms were observed on susceptible and resistant cultivars. BaYMV was detected by ELISA and RT-PCR on both cultivars. In addition to developing RT-PCR methods for detecting and identifying BaYMV and Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV), an RT-PCR targeting the VPg/NIa viral protein part of the genome, known to discriminate the two BaYMV pathotypes, was set up to accurately identify the pathotype(s) now present in Belgium. The sequences from the generated amplicons revealed the single nucleotide substitution resulting in an amino acid change from lysine to asparagine specific to BaYMV pathotype 2. The possible reasons for the change in the BaYMV pathotype situation in Belgium, such as climatic change or a progressive build-up of soil inoculum potential, will be discussed, as well as the use of eIF 4 E-based resistance...|$|R

However, there are multiple lines of evidence {{for the possibility of}} a clandestine sexual cycle occurrence in this species including extensive genotypic diversity, equal distribution of mating type alleles across the world and expression of mating type genes. In the current study, the potential for the occurrence of a sexual cycle amongst the Iranian population of R. commune was assessed by analyzing distribution and frequency of the mating type alleles at both micro and macro-spatial scales. A total of 95 single-conidial R. commune isolates were obtained from different barley fields in Kurdistan province. Previously designed primers were applied in a multiplex PCR assay to study distribution and frequency of the mating type alleles within and between populations. Totally, 67 isolates were determined as MAT 1 - 1 and the remaining 28 isolates as MAT 1 - 2 throughout the sampling counties. The results obtained at a macro-spatial scale revealed that unlike Kamyaran county (both MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 at an equal ratio), an unequal distribution of mating type genes was dominant among R. commune isolates in both Mariwan and Dehgolan counties. Our findings support a predominantly asexual reproduction for Mariwan and Dehgolan counties and the possibility of sexual stage occurrence in Kamyarna county...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} crop {{rotation}} and management practices on Rhizoctonia solani root disease and inoculum survival over two summers was examined in a 2 -year paddock trial. In {{the first year}} (2011), there were treatments of barley, wheat, canola and chemical fallow, {{and in the second}} year (2012), barley plots of untreated, seed dressing (Dividend), in-furrow application of an unregistered fungicide or tilling to a depth of 10 cm below the seeding depth. Inoculum survival in five paddocks (two canola, two wheat and one barley) was monitored over summer (February-June) 2013. In the 2 -year trial, inoculum levels increased for cereals in the 2011 growing season, while for canola and fallow, they declined. Rhizoctonia root <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> <b>barley</b> roots in 2012 were highest following barley. Inoculum levels in cereals were significantly higher over summer 2012 compared with those for the canola and fallow plots. Inoculum in the latter two plots had declined to below detection levels at sowing in June 2012, while barley plots were still significantly higher compared to the other plots. For the five paddocks, inoculum levels over summer are postulated to be affected by the previous crop and significant summer rainfall events. A break crop of canola or a chemical fallow in paddocks with severe Rhizoctonia bare-patch, may reduce inoculum levels and reduce disease in the following cereal crop. Barley exacerbates disease substantially compared to the other crops, so in paddocks with high levels of R. solani inoculum it is recommended that another crop is sown...|$|R

Differences within Australian B. sorokiniana populations were revealed by cluster analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms in genomic DNA of 48 B. sorokiniana isolates collected from the northern grain-growing region of Australia. Isolates collected from SB infections clustered apart from isolates collected from CRR infections. A subset of 31 B. sorokiniana isolates was assessed for their abilities to cause SB infections <b>on</b> <b>barley</b> leaves using a differential set of 15 barley genotypes and three other cereal species.

40|$|Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei is an obligate biotrophic fungus {{which causes}} the powdery mildew <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> <b>barley.</b> It is {{generally}} accepted that the specialized feeding structure called the haustorium secretes effector proteins that suppress and modulate the host defense responses. I used {{transmission electron microscopy}} to successfully obtain electron micrographs of the ultrastructure of the B. graminis f. sp. hordei infection, including the haustoria, in barley leaves. Effector proteins typically show signatures of positive diversifying selection {{as a result of}} the coevolutionary struggle between hosts and pathogens. In this thesis, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in Blumeria Effector Candidate (BEC) genes among 54 isolates was calculated to detect BECs under positive diversifying selection. Polymorphisms were found in the BEC genes but the small sample size tested was too small to detect statistically significant positive diversifying selection. In parallel to research carried out in this thesis, a panel of fifty Blumeria candidate effector (BEC) proteins was screened using host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). Of these fifty candidates, eight reduced the haustoria development and are considered as virulence effectors: BEC 1005, BEC 1011, BEC 1016, BEC 1018, BEC 1019, BEC 1038, BEC 1040 and BEC 1054. I measured relative abundance of RNA in nine BECs including the eight BECs confirmed to be virulence effectors by qRT-PCR at six time points of infection. The transcript profiling presented here reveals that some BECs are important during the early stages of the infection when the compatibility of the host-pathogen interaction is being established and other BECs play a role during the later stages of the infection that involve biotrophy maintenance. It has been proposed that the roles of BEC 1011 and BEC 1054 in infection are related to host RNA binding or another function that evolved from a ribonuclease ancestor. I used the differential scanning fluorimetry method to test whether BEC 1054 binds RNA. The findings in this thesis reveal that there is binding between BEC 1054 and RNA and RNA has a destabilizing effect on BEC 1054. To further investigate their role in virulence, BEC 1011 and BEC 1054 transgenic wheat lines were created at NIAB. I commenced the genotyping of these transgenic lines and preliminary pathogenicity tests with some homozygous BEC 1011 - and BEC 1054 -wobble lines and homozygous null lines.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} emitted by plants {{are known to}} intervene with various biotic environmental factors. Up to now, {{most of the studies}} have been focused on aerial volatiles and root liquid exudates. Very few researches have been completed concerning belowground volatiles released into the rhizosphere despite their potential capacity to carry information between organisms. The Rhizovol project, started in autumn 2010, involves 5 different units of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech collectively studying the production of belowground volatiles by barley roots underlying various biotic interactions in the rhizosphere. Some preliminary results of each partner of the project will be presented. To achieve this goal, analytical methods allowing the sampling, separation, identification and quantification of belowground volatile compounds have to be developed, taking into account their potential modifications in the rhizosphere once released by the roots. They enable the subsequent characterization and study of the interactions between barley and its rhizospheric partners chosen for this study. These interactions imply three types of organisms: beneficial organisms, pathogenic agents and plant and insect pests. Beneficial organisms can promote the growth of barley by the emission of volatiles; on the other hand barley can support their growth and metabolism. These phenomenons will be assessed by the study of 19 strains of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPR). Three pathogenic agents - two fungi (Fusarium culmorum and Cochliobolus sativus) and one virus (Barley yellow dwarf virus) - were chosen as they are known to cause various <b>diseases</b> <b>on</b> <b>barley,</b> especially <b>on</b> roots. The attractive or repellent effects of <b>barley</b> root volatiles <b>on</b> the pathogenic agents or their vectors, as well as the effect of volatiles <b>on</b> the <b>diseases</b> evolution will be evaluated. The project also includes several types of pests such as plants and insects. Plants can compete with barley for space and nutrients through volatile interactions. This will be assessed by the study of autotoxicity by barley itself and allelopathy with 8 weeds and a hemiparasitic plant (Rhinanthus minor). The effects of barley volatiles can also impact the severity of the attacks by insects. This part will be conducted with wireworms as they represent worldwide known pests, and aphids, through their viral vector role. Eventually, as soil characteristics can strongly influence the diffusion of volatile compounds, the diffusion behaviour of the identified volatile biomolecules through the soil will be modelled. Tritrophic interactions (e. g. insect-plant-pathogenic fungi) will be studied based on each bitrophic interaction results. Over-all, the Rhizovol project aims at improving the knowledge of interactions mediated by volatile compounds in the rhizosphere and at establishing new biocontrol methods that could contribute to integrated disease and pest management systems...|$|R
50|$|Gibberella zeae, {{also known}} {{by the name of}} its anamorph Fusarium graminearum, is a plant {{pathogen}} which causes fusarium head blight, a devastating <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> wheat and <b>barley.</b> The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{generalized}} use of cultivars carrying the rym 4 resistance gene, {{the impact of}} viral mosaic <b>diseases</b> <b>on</b> winter <b>barleys</b> increased {{in recent years in}} France. This change could reflect i) an increased prevalence of the rym 4 resistance-breaking pathotype of Barley yellow mosaic virus Y (BaYMV- 2), ii) the emergence of rym 4 resistance-breaking pathotypes of Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV) or iii) the emergence of other viruses. A study was undertaken to determine the distribution and diversity of viruses causing yellow mosaic disease. A collection of 241 symptomatic leaf samples from susceptible, rym 4 and rym 5 varieties was gathered from 117 sites. The viruses present in all samples were identified by specific RT-PCR assays and, for selected samples, by double-stranded RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results show that BaYMV- 2 is responsible for the symptoms observed in varieties carrying the resistance gene rym 4. In susceptible varieties, both BaYMV- 1 and BaYMV- 2 were detected, together with BaMMV. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the rym 4 resistance-breaking ability independently evolved in multiple genetic backgrounds. Parallel analyses revealed a similar scenario of multiple independent emergence events in BaMMV for rym 5 resistance-breaking, likely involving multiple amino acid positions in the viral-linked genome protein.

Relatively {{little is known about}} the infection strategy and development of Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) <b>disease</b> <b>on</b> <b>barley.</b> Therefore the overall aim of this project was to increase the understanding of fundamental biology and life cycle of the causal agent, R. collo-cygni. Chapter 2 describes the horizontal transmission of the fungus <b>on</b> <b>barley.</b> Both field and transgenic R. collo-cygni isolates expressing GFP and dsRed fluorescent reporter markers were utilised to visualise the infection progression in living host tissues by various light and confocal microscopy. The existence of a previously unknown structure called stomatopodium (infection peg), involved in the penetration of stomata, was demonstrated. The fungus initially exhibited symptomless epiphytic growth, extending above epidermis and connecting the hyphal aggregates inside substomatal cavities and subsequent initial sporulation. However, during the transition into symptomatic phase, the organised intercellular growth of hyphae into the mesophyll was observed. This hyphal network was involved in the production of asexual spores demonstrating that the raprture of epidermal layer was responsible for local necrosis observed for RLS. In addition to barley, several other speculated R. collo-cygni hosts have been used to verify their compatibility to the pathogen. In chapter 3, a whole plant inoculation assay was developed to investigate the mode of the fungal seed-borne transmission by using GFP expressing strain of the fungus. It is shown here for the first time that the vertical transmission is systemic, involving symptomless colonisation of embryo and closely resembled the mode of dissemination observed for Neotyphodium species, mutualistic fungal endosymbionts on grasses. The impact of fungal infection on seed germination ability was also examined that revealed no significant difference between clean, moderate and high levels of R. collo-cygni DNA. Chapter 4 represents an attempt to discover and analyse the sexual development in R. collo-cygni. As a first step to understand the sexual reproduction cycle in this apparently asexual species, the genetic structure of the mating system was characterised by using PCR-based techniques which demonstrated the heterothallic nature of the fungus. The defined population of R. collo-cygni field isolates was then screened for the presence of the discovered mating type idiomorphs (mat) to determine the frequencies of the mating types in the defined R. collo-cygni populations. The segregation ratio of mat 1 and mat 2 close to 1 : 1 indicated a frequent sexual reproduction. In order to verify the existence of functional sexual stage in R. collo-cygni, potential sexual development was induced using the potentially compatible isolates and a comprehensive analysis was undertaken by correlative use of light-, confocal- and low temperature scanning electron microscopy. Two types of multicellular bodies were observed and described. First was the speculated Asteromella stage (male donor) that carries spore-like spermatia. The second structure initially resembled sclerotia that in only a few instances developed into perythecium/ pseudothecium that appeared to carry the sexual spores, ascospores enveloped in asci. Chapter 5 demonstrates the role of rubellin toxin in symptom development by using autofluorescence phenomenon. The structure of putative molecular machinery involved in rubellin biosynthesis was addressed by using bioinformatics approaches and the complete R. collo-cygni genome sequence. A gene cluster encompassing several components of other known secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, such as that of dothistromin and aflatoxin, was found and putative protein function of the genes is hypothesised...|$|R

Results A 21 [*]kb DNA region of the H. rubrisubalbicans genome contains a cluster of 26 hrp/hrc genes encoding for the type three secretion system (T 3 SS) proteins. To investigate the contribution of T 3 SS to the plant-bacterial interaction process we generated mutant strains of H. rubrisubalbicans M 1 carrying a Tn 5 insertion in both the hrcN and hrpE genes. H. rubrisulbalbicans hrpE and hrcN mutant strains of the T 3 SS system failed to cause the mottled <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> in the sugarcane susceptible variety B- 4362. These mutant strains also did not produce lesions on Vigna unguiculata leaves.

Conclusions Our results indicate that the T 3 SS of H. rubrisubalbicans is necessary {{for the development of the}} mottled <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> and endophytic colonization of rice. </p...|$|R

40|$|A high-yielding {{japonica rice}} variety, Wuyunjing 7, bred in Jiangsu Province, China {{as a female}} parent was crossed with a Japanese rice variety Kantou 194, which carries a rice <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> {{resistance}} gene Stv-bi and a translucent endosperm mutant gene Wx-mq. From F 2 generations, a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker tightly linked with Stv-bi and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker for Wx-mq were used for marker-assisted selection. Finally, a new japonica rice line, Ning 9108, with excellent agronomic traits was obtained by multi-generational selection <b>on</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> resistance and endosperm appearance. The utilization of the markers from genes related to rice quality and disease resistance was helpful not only for establishing a marker-assisted selection system of high-quality and disease resistance for rice but also for providing important intermediate materials and rapid selection method for good quality, disease resistance and high yield in rice breeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{inheritance}} of <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> resistance in a rice restorer line C 224 was analyzed using the mixed effect model of major gene plus polygene for quantitative traits. In addition, the resistance {{was investigated in}} seven crosses of C 224 with maintainer lines. The {{results showed that the}} stripe resistance of C 224 was controlled by two major genes with additive-dominance-epistasis effects plus polygenes with additive-dominance effects (E- 1 model). These two genes had additive effects of − 12. 47 % and − 24. 75 %, respectively, showing negative dominance effects. There were significant epistasis and interaction effects between the two major genes. The heritability of the two major genes was 92. 12 %, while that of polygenes was 2. 74 %, indicating that the stripe resistance had dominant major gene effect. Of the seven crosses, five displayed high or medium resistance to the <b>stripe</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
