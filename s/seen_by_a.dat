5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these {{symptoms}} are not often recognized {{as signs of}} HIV infection. Even cases that do get <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.|$|E
5|$|Its lengthy {{period of}} {{visibility}} and extensive {{coverage in the}} media meant that Hale–Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of Halley's Comet in 1986, and certainly <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances. For instance, 69% of Americans had seen Hale–Bopp by April 9, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and {{convinced him to}} surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E

The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E

5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is}} a {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs its head and raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E

50|$|For Poisson {{processes}} {{the property}} {{is often referred to}} as the PASTA property (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) and states that the probability of the state as <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> outside random observer is the same as the probability of the state <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> arriving customer. The property also holds for the case of a doubly stochastic Poisson process where the rate parameter is allowed to vary depending on the state.|$|R
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> synthetic camera.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who had {{a horrible}} appearance, was missing a finger, or had {{appendages}} {{similar to those of}} an animal was believed to be a vampire. A person who died alone and unseen would become a vampire, likewise if a corpse swelled or turned black before burial. Dogs, cats, plants or even agricultural tools could become vampires; pumpkins or melons kept in the house too long would start to move, make noises or show blood. According to the late Serbian ethnologist Tatomir Vukanović, Roma people in Kosovo believed that vampires were invisible to most people, but could be <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> twin brother and sister born on a Saturday who wore their clothes inside out. Likewise, a settlement could be protected by finding twins who could also see the vampire outdoors at night, who would have to flee immediately after they spotted it.|$|E

5|$|During {{a school}} {{trip to a}} camp, a nude video of Anju is taken {{on a cell phone}} camera hidden in the bathroom. The culprit is {{revealed}} as Varun, the son of the Inspector-general of police, Geetha. When Varun meets Anju later to blackmail her, she breaks his cell phone and inadvertently kills him. With her mother's help, she hides his body in a compost pit that was originally made for manure. Unbeknownst to them, this is witnessed by Anu. Jyothi tells Rambabu about the incident and he devises a plan to save his family from imprisonment. He gets rid of the broken cell phone. However, as he is disposing of Varun's car, Rambabu is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> corrupt police constable named Veerabhadram, who holds a grudge against him. Rambabu then takes his family out on a trip to Vizianagaram, where they attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and dine at a restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The French column surrenderd on {{the promise}} that the {{officers}} would not be stripped, but they all remained as prisoners of war and surrendered their weapons and money to the Catalans. Juigné, with 136 other wounded soldiers and a German captain, remained in Olot to receive medical treatment, but he died shortly after. French losses amounted to 251 or 260 men killed–32 of them officers– and 826 prisoners, as opposed to 7 men killed and 5 wounded on the miquelets side. The figures are well known, as the French intendant of Girona, René Desgrigny, {{wrote a letter to}} Olot's aldermen asking for the number and rank of the prisoners to exchange them when possible. In this letter, Desgrigny noted that Monsieur Juigné was lucky to be dead, as the defeat would probably have cost him dearly. The 690 unscathed French prisoners were brought first to Vic and later to Barcelona, where they arrived on 15 March. Their entrance was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large crowd and the Spanish Viceroy, the Marquis of Gastañaga.|$|E
5|$|Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet {{back with}} Bond and instead flees, passing off the {{diamonds}} {{to the next}} smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> technician. He manages to evade the security guards by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make {{their way back to}} Las Vegas; they are seen there by the Las Vegas police, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade all the cars.|$|E

5|$|Within Singapore, the {{national}} flag {{takes precedence over}} all other flags, subject to international practice. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (as <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E
