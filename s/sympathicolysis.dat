50|$|<b>Sympathicolysis</b> is a {{procedure}} for temporary or long-term elimination of sympathetic innervation. It {{is used to}} improve blood circulation in the legs or arms. The sympathetic nervous system causes {{the balance of the}} autonomic system to lean towards narrowing of blood vessels, with elimination of its function resulting in vasodilatation. Completely blocked arteries are not opened again, but the collaterals are better supplied with blood.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Essential hyperhidrosis is characterised by an overactivity of the {{sympathetic}} fibres {{passing through the}} upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia D 2 -D 3. Anatomical interruption at the D 2 -D 3 level is a highly effective treatment for essential hyperhidrosis but also causes (partial) cardiac denervation and, after surgical <b>sympathicolysis,</b> important impairment of cardiopulmonary exercise function has been observed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing between patients with essential hyperhidrosis and a normal control population, and to examine the effects of thoracoscopic D 2 -D 3 <b>sympathicolysis</b> on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in patients with essential hyperhidrosis. METHODS [...] maximal, symptom limited incremental exercise tests were performed in 26 patients with severe essential hyperhidrosis one week before and one month after D 2 -D 3 thoracoscopic <b>sympathicolysis,</b> and in 14 age and sex matched healthy volunteers. D 2 -D 3 thoracoscopic <b>sympathicolysis</b> was performed using a simplified one stage bilateral procedure. RESULTS [...] Palmar hyperhidrosis was relieved in every patient, confirming the D 2 -D 3 denervation. A higher peak heart rate (7 %) was seen in the patient group than in the normal subjects, but ll other cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory parameters were similar. After D 2 -D 3 thoracoscopic <b>sympathicolysis,</b> heart rate at rest (13 %) and at peak exercise (7 %) were reduced, together with an increase in oxygen pulse. All other parameters remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS [...] Sympathetic overactivity relevant to cardiovascular function in essential hyperhidrosis is evident only during sympathetic stimulation. D 2 -D 3 thoracoscopic <b>sympathicolysis</b> causes a small and asymptomatic reduction in maximal and resting heart rate and is not associated with a decrease in exercise capacity, in contrast with the detrimental effects on exercise capacity of open surgical sympathectomy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Investigation of the {{influence}} of lumbar <b>sympathicolysis</b> on somatic regional oxygen saturation, temperature and the arterial flow velocity in the lower extremities Methods: 70 patients with stage IIb to IV PAOD according to Fontaine were treated with CT-guided lumbar <b>sympathicolysis</b> after interventional or surgical therapy. 23 patients (32, 9 %) were in stage IIb, 10 patients (14, 3 %) in stage III and 37 patients (52, 9 %) in stage IV. Somatic regional oxygen saturation in the distal lower extremities was recorded peri-interventionally with a near infrared spectroscopy system. Before and after intervention, the temperature of the feet was measured using an infrared thermometer and the peak flow and end-diastolic flow velocity in the arteria dorsalis pedis was determined by means of colour-coded duplex sonography. Results: Regional oxygen saturation rose from 62, 92 % to 71, 29 % (p< 0, 001), temperature from 32, 25 °C to 33, 72 °C (p< 0, 001), peak flow from 49, 56 cm/s to 62, 33 cm/s (p< 0, 001) and end-diastolic flow 7, 03 cm/s to 18, 80 cm/s (p< 0, 001). There {{were no significant differences between}} the PAOD stages, or between patients with and without diabetes. Conclusion: In patients with PAOD, CT-guided lumbar <b>sympathicolysis</b> carried out in addition to interventional or surgical therapy leads to a measurable improvement in arterial blood flow...|$|E

30|$|Epidural {{anesthesia}} {{is effectively}} applied {{in different types}} of surgery to improve perioperative outcome (Block et al. 2003). In cardiac surgery, high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) offers several advantages including thoracic <b>sympathicolysis,</b> attenuated stress response and myocardial blood flow redistribution (Chaney 2006). In previous studies, these effects were coupled with improved analgesia (Liu et al. 2004), earlier extubation time (Liu et al. 2004), less respiratory complications (Liu et al. 2004; Ballantyne et al. 1998), decreased incidence of arrhythmias (Svircevic et al. 2011) and postoperative myocardial infarction (Beattie et al. 2001). However, as recent meta-analyses show, no mortality benefit has been proven so far (Svircevic et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Background: Clonidine {{effectively}} decreases perioperative mortality {{by reducing}} sympathetic tone. However, application of clonidine might also restrict anaemia tolerance due to impairment of compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, {{the influence of}} clonidine induced, short-term <b>sympathicolysis</b> on anaemia tolerance was assessed in anaesthetized pigs. We measured the effect of clonidine on anaemia tolerance and {{of the potential for}} macrohemodynamic alterations to constrain the acute anaemia compensatory mechanisms. Methods: After governmental approval, 14 anaesthetized pigs of either gender (Deutsche Landrasse, weight (mean[*]±[*]SD) 24. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 4 kg) were randomly assigned to intravenous saline or clonidine treatment (bolus: 20 μg[*]·[*]kg− 1, continuous infusion: 15 μg[*]·[*]kg− 1 [*]·[*]h− 1).

40|$|Essential hyperhidrosis (EH) {{is caused}} by a poorly {{understood}} overactivity of the sympathetic fibres passing through the upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia D 2 and D 3. These ganglia are also in the pathway of the sympathetic innervation of the heart and lungs. Therefore, although the predominant sympathetic neurotransmitter at the eccrine sweat glands is acetylcholine, the plasma concentration of noradrenaline (NA) (which is the main sympathetic neurotransmitter at the end organs including the heart and the lungs) may be elevated. Furthermore, as there are some indications for generalized sympathetic overactivity in EH, the plasma concentration of adrenaline (A) may also be elevated. Plasma levels of NA and A were therefore determined in 13 EH patients before and after thoracoscopic D 2 -D 3 <b>sympathicolysis</b> (TS). Preoperative NA and A plasma levels were all within the normal limits used in our laboratory. After TS, mean NA plasma levels are significantly decreased. whereas mean A are unchanged. We conclude that sympathetic overactivity in EH is limited to the upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia and that some of the cardiovascular and pulmonary effects that are observed after TS may be associated with the decrease in NA.

30|$|A few {{limitations}} {{of our study}} merit discussion. Firstly, it remains possible that the modulation of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) induced by RDN lies below the detection level of 123 I–mIBG. However, {{it may well be}} that <b>sympathicolysis</b> is achieved by RDN but that this does not influence BP nor activity of the renin-angiotensin system and 123 I–mIBG parameters. Radiotracer dilution NE spill-over for organ specific assessment of sympathetic nerve activity is an alternative to 123 I–mIBG scintigraphy. Although this technique is considered the gold standard, its application is limited by its invasive nature. Moreover a widespread use of the technique is restricted by the poor availability of the required compounds. Furthermore, 123 I–mIBG is primarily cleared via the kidneys and therefore kidney function may have influenced our data. However, we have shown that both cardiac and renal 123 I–mIBG parameters are not influenced by kidney function [7, 11]. Finally, we were aware of the potential influence of antihypertensive medication (calcium blocking agents, beta blocking agents) that may alter sympathetic drive and thereby uptake of 123 I–mIBG. In two patients, BP lowering medication had to be tapered because of hypotension post RDN. In the remaining patients, however, BP lowering medication and sodium excretion were unchanged during the study period. We therefore feel that changes in antihypertensive medication do not explain the lack of change in the 123 I–mIBG parameters.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} and usability of an electromagnetic navigation {{system designed to}} assist Computed Tomography (CT) guided interventions. 120 patients requiring a percutaneous CT intervention (drainage, biopsy, tumor ablation, infiltration, <b>sympathicolysis)</b> were included in this prospective randomized trial. Nineteen radiologists participated. Conventional procedures (CT group) were compared with procedures assisted by a navigation system prototype using an electromagnetic localizer to track the position and orientation of a needle holder (NAV group). The navigation system displays the needle path in real-time on 2 D reconstructed CT images extracted from the 3 D CT volume. The regional ethics committee approved this study and all patients gave written informed consent. The main outcome was {{the distance between the}} planned trajectory and the achieved needle trajectory calculated from the initial needle placement. 120 patients were analyzable in intention-to-treat (NAV: 60; CT: 60). Accuracy improved when the navigation system was used: distance error (in millimeters: median[P 25 %; P 75 %]) with NAV = 4. 1 [2. 7; 9. 1], vs. with CT = 8. 9 [4. 9; 15. 1] (p< 0. 001). After the initial needle placement and first control CT, fewer subsequent CT acquisitions were necessary to reach the target using the navigation system: NAV = 2 [2; 3]; CT = 3 [2; 4] (p = 0. 01). The tested system was usable in a standard clinical setting and provided significant improvement in accuracy; furthermore, with the help of navigation, targets could be reached with fewer CT control acquisitions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Quantitative sweat {{production}} and -ionic composition in Essential Hyperhidrosis (EH), {{and the effects}} of T 2 -T 3 thoracoscopic <b>sympathicolysis</b> (TS) hereon, are unknown. Standardised pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat tests were performed before and after TS in order to study these issues. Design and Methods: Pilocarpine iontophoretic sweat tests measuring maximal sweat production (rag) and sweat Na+, K+ and CIconcentrations (mMol/L) were performed on both forearms of 10 EH patients, before and six weeks after TS, and in normal volunteers. Results: As compared to normals, preoperative maximal sweat production was 30 % higher (199. 4 ± 68. 8 (SD) vs. 150. 6 ± 45. 6 Mg) in EH patients; due to type II error, however, statistical significance was not reached. Na+ and Cl- concentrations were similar, and K+ concentration was slightly lower in EH patients. After TS, sweat production had decreased to equal levels as in normals (149. 1 ± 52. 1 mg), whereas the Na+ (from 33. 6 ± 6. 9 to 51. 0 ± 6. 4 mMol/L), Cl- (from 21. 5 ± 6. 6 to 37. 2 ± 7. 1 mMol/L) and K+ (from 7. 5 ± 1. 3 to 8. 6 ± 2. 2 mMol/L) concentrations had increased. Conclusions: EH patients present 30 % higher maximal sweat production at their forearms. This increase may be due to an increased activity of the adrenergic component of sweat gland innervation. The post-TS increase in Na+, Cl- and K+ concentrations suggests that the adrenergic component of sweat gland innervation in itself decreases sweat ion concentrations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidural {{analgesia}} (EDA) is {{a common}} analgesia regimen in liver resection, and is accompanied by <b>sympathicolysis,</b> peripheral vasodilatation and hypotension {{in the context of}} deliberate intraoperative low central venous pressure. This associated fall in mean arterial pressure may compromise renal blood pressure autoregulation and lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). This study investigated whether EDA is a risk factor for postoperative AKI after liver surgery. METHODS: The incidence of AKI was investigated retrospectively in patients who underwent liver resection with or without EDA between 2002 and 2012. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed including recognized preoperative and intraoperative predictors of posthepatectomy renal failure. RESULTS: A series of 1153 patients was investigated. AKI occurred in 8 · 2 per cent of patients and was associated with increased morbidity (71 versus 47 · 3 per cent; P[*]=[*] 0 · 003) and mortality (21 versus 0 · 3 per cent; P[*]<[*] 0 · 001) rates. The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in the EDA group (10 · 1 versus 3 · 7 per cent; P[*]=[*] 0 · 003). Although {{there was no significant difference}} in the incidence of AKI between patients undergoing minor hepatectomy with or without EDA (5 · 2 versus 2 · 7 per cent; P[*]=[*] 0 · 421), a substantial difference in AKI rates occurred in patients undergoing major hepatectomy (13 · 8 versus 5 · 0 per cent; P[*]=[*] 0 · 025). In multivariable analysis, EDA remained an independent risk factor for AKI after hepatectomy (P[*]=[*] 0 · 040). CONCLUSION: EDA may be a risk factor for postoperative AKI after major hepatectom...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{patients}} with essential hyperhidrosis (EH), a pathological condition characterized by increased {{activity of the}} upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia D 2 –D 3, anatomical interruption at the D 2 –D 3 level by thoracoscopic <b>sympathicolysis</b> (TS) is a safe and effective treatment. The D 2 and D 3 ganglia, however, {{are also in the}} pathway of sympathetic lung innervation, which may influence the pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (expressed as transfer factor for and as transfer coefficient for CO:KCO). We therefore studied the effect of TS on TlCO and KCO in 50 EH patients: compared with pre-operative values, both TlCO (− 6 · 7 %, P< 0 · 001) and KCO (- 4 · 2 %, P= 0 · 002) were significantly decreased at 6 weeks after bilateral TS, an effect which was independent of the smoking status of the patients. In order to explain this phenomenon, the following pharmacological interventions were studied: (1) oral β 1 + 2 -adrenoreceptor blockade with propranolol caused a comparable decrease of TlCO (− 6 · 3 %) and KCO (− 7 · 5 %) in matched normal subjects, but had no effect on TlCO and KCO in EH patients prior to TS; and (2) subsequent inhalation of the β 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist salbutamol in a dosage suspected to cause alveolar β-receptor stimulation had no effect on TlCO and KCO, neither in the normal subjects, nor in EH patients (before and after TS). Although the exact mechanism of the TS-induced decrease in TlCO and KCO remains speculative, these findings suggest that they may be related to a β 1 -adrenoreceptor-mediated change in pulmonary capillary membrane permeability, although TS-induced changes in pulmonary blood flow or an interplay of both mechanisms cannot be excluded...|$|E

There are burdens of literature about IONV/PONV and several in parturient and cesarean. However, it needs more attention. The underlying mechanisms of IONV and PONV in the obstetrical setting mainly include hypotension due to <b>sympathicolysis</b> during neuraxial anesthesia, bradycardia owing to an increased vagal tone, the visceral stimulation via the surgical procedure and intravenously administered opioids. Methods: Given the high and even increasing rate of cesarean sections and the sparse information on the etiology, incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting {{and the impact of}} prophylactic measures on the incidence of PONV/IONV, this article aims to review the available information and provide pragmatic suggestions on how to prevent nausea and vomiting in this patient cohort. Current literature and guidelines were identified by electronic database searching (MEDLINE via PubMed and Cochrane database of systematic reviews) up to present, searching through reference lists of included literature and personal contact with experts. Discussion and conclusion: Taking into account the current guidelines and literature as well as everyday clinical experience, the first step for decreasing the incidence of IONV and PONV is a comprehensive management of circulatory parameters. This management includes liberal perioperative fluid administration and the application of vasopressors as the circumstances require. By using low-dose local anesthetics, an additional application of intrathecal or spinal opioids or hyperbaric solutions for a sufficient controllability of neuraxial distribution, maternal hypotension might be reduced. Performing a combined spinal–epidural anesthesia or epidural anesthesia may be considered as an alternative to spinal anesthesia. Antiemetic drugs may be administered restrainedly due to off-label use in pregnant women for IONV or PONV prophylaxis and may be reserved for treatment.

40|$|Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the most}} common medical {{conditions}} amongst people in developed countries, and it can have fatal consequences for the cardiovascular system. Most patients suffer from resistant hypertension and cannot be treated by common antihypertensive drugs. Recent findings have shown that overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the development of hypertension. This has lead scientists to explore and develop new minimal invasive treatment methods to degenerate renal sympathetic nerve fibres located around the renal arteries, thereby preventing this overactivity. One established method is catheter-based radiofrequency ablation. An endovascular catheter is inserted in the femoral artery in the inguinal region and pushed forward to the renal artery. Radiofrequency energy is then applied to the adventitia of the renal artery. However, this approach is unavailable to patients who have certain anatomic characteristics. This has therefore led us to search for new, non-invasive treatment methods for renal denervation. Magnetic resonance-guided, high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRg HIFUS) is a non-invasive, ablative method that is currently used primarily for the treatment of uterine fibroids. We therefore undertook this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound for renal sympathetic denervation in a porcine model. A total of ten pigs were used in this study, one of which was a sham pig and was not treated. During the MRg HIFUS intervention all pigs were placed under general anaesthesia using propofol. They were then treated with MRg HIFUS along the right renal artery. Two of the pigs were sacrificed straight after the MRg HIFUS treatment, the other eight pigs were sacrificed 28 days later. Both kidneys were removed and homogenized using formic acid. Samples of the kidneys were then examined for their concentration of norepinephrine using high pressure liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. Renal arteries and urethras were preserved in formalin, histologically processed, and stained with HE and EvG staining. Degenerative sympathetic nerve fibres could be easily detected after this staining. In three of the nine pigs perivascular oedema indicating thermal tissue damage was diagnosed on the T 2 w FSE sequences taken after the HIFUS treatment. Furthermore, the norepinephrine concentrations in the treated kidneys of the pigs did not drop significantly, something that would also have indicated the treatment was successful. During the histological examination, perineural fibrosis, indicating degenerated sympathetic nerve fibres, was visible in one of the pigs. All pigs tolerated the treatment very well and there were no serious complications. Three of the nine pigs treated displayed superficial skin burns following the MRg HIFUS treatment. The results showed that pigs are not suitable subjects for MRg HIFUS treatment as a result of long lumbar transverse processes and a dominant fascia thoracolumbalis. Nine pigs treated with MRg HIFUS showed changes caused by thermal damage, concentrated around the transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae. The long transverse processes of the pigs’ lumbar vertebrae complicated the use of a straight ultrasound beam, limited the acoustic window of the HIFUS and caused energy absorption and reflection. The fat tissue in close proximity to the renal arteries also made the use of magnetic resonance thermometry, and therefore temperature mapping in this area, impossible. This study provided evidence that MRg HIFUS could not be used successfully as a treatment method to produce renal denervation in pigs. In one pig we assume a potential success of renal <b>sympathicolysis.</b> However, the high potential of this non-invasive therapy technique could still be clearly observed. The minimal and infrequent complications, the safety of the technique, and the visualisation on account of the combination with the MRI are strong arguments for further studies to be conducted that explore the possibility of using MRg HIFUS to induce renal denervation. In such studies, however, pigs should not be used as subjects...|$|E
