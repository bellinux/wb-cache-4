40|$|International audienceGlobally, {{programming}} {{education for}} children is receiving widespread attention {{as a part}} of twenty-first century skills. Learning programming is not just about learning to code, but it also helps children learn how to learn. However, unlike traditional classes where students mostly learn from teachers’ teaching, learning through programing (in a broad sense, “making”) needs to be approached differently. To make programming education more successful in elementary school classrooms, students must be <b>self-learners,</b> and moreover, teachers need to encourage students to be <b>self-learners</b> by acting as facilitators, mentors, or peers (and occasionally as teachers). Classrooms have many physical limitations, and school curricula, especially elementary school curricula, have even more limitations, such as time and subjects. How can we introduce programming and making to twenty-first century classrooms?Upon its publication, “Twenty things to do with a computer” (Papert & Solomon 1971) impacted both teachers and researchers.

ICED conferences continue to disseminate methodologies to help make designers and design teams more effective and efficient. At ICED 95 we introduced our PAKTS model (Figure 1.) which identified the total educational needs of young engineering designers [Robotham 1995]. The five key elements of the model are Processes, Attitudes, Knowledge, Tools and Skills. Of these elements, the least developed in terms of methodologies is that of “Attitude”.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the traditional use of (computer numerically controlled) CNC machining {{and the role}} of a designer to control the manipulation of (computer aided manufacturing) CAM software, CNC data and materials. The engaged designer has the capability to add qualities of digital tectonics onto a specified form through the process of working intimately with a CNC lathe. They experiment using abstract forms to find unique qualities that come from the cutting action of the tooling in a lathe. The designer takes {{on the role of the}} <b>self-learner</b> to become competent in the software, technology to apply complex textures and expressions. The designer can capitalise on unforeseen events, adds the action of craft to this industrial production method, creates beauty and provokes an emotional connection. Understanding the potential in the design possibility is to accept the serendipitous influences that can be controlled and the inevitable moments that cannot. The core of this research is to show how a designer claims authorship of their design at the making stage. They can define the margin of control and randomness, whether something has become too serendipitous, compromising the crafted form, or remained banal, repeating the precision machining, and releasing any character from the object. By finding the best design solution and replicating the same understanding a craftsperson has of their traditional tools. The designer observes, analyses, succeeds and fails, recognising the potential of their experimentation. Using Cross’s model of exploration, generation, evaluation and communication there is the strategy to see the unexpected, realise the potential and make it desirable. Learning the ability to manipulate digital surfaces and identify serendipitous qualities produced by the physical fingerprint of the machining process. Opposing the machines’ engineering, expressing the marks of the tool on an object, the imprints behaving as fingerprints left on a surface, is a unique characteristic. Something that makes the end user want to experience, feel, move and use it every day. These surprising results may influence the future of how design is conducted with digital technologies and adding digital complexities inspired by traditional craft to design more interesting artefacts...|$|E
