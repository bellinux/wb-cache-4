25|$|The term VSTM refers in a theory-neutral {{manner to}} the non-permanent storage of visual {{information}} {{over an extended}} period of time. The visuospatial sketchpad is a VSTM <b>subcomponent</b> within the theoretical model of working memory proposed by Alan Baddeley. Whereas iconic memories are fragile, decay rapidly, and are unable to be actively maintained, visual short-term memories are robust to subsequent stimuli and last over many seconds. VSTM is distinguished from long-term memory, on the other hand, primarily by its very limited capacity.|$|E
40|$|Standard Cooperative Co-evolution uses a {{round-robin}} {{method to}} select <b>subcomponents</b> to undergo optimization. In a non-separable (epistatic) optimization problem, dividing the computational budget equally between {{all of the}} <b>subcomponents</b> {{is not necessarily the}} best strategy. When dealing with non-separable problems, there is usually an imbalance between the contribution of various <b>subcomponents</b> to the global fitness of the individuals. Using a round-robin fashion treats all of the <b>subcomponents</b> equally and wastes the computational budget. In this paper, we propose a Contribution Based Cooperative Co-evolution (CBCC) that selects the <b>subcomponents</b> based on their contributions to the global fitness. This alleviates the imbalance issue and allows the computational resources to be used more efficiently. Experiments on several benchmark functions with the &# 039;imbalance issue&# 039; show that this new scheme is promising, especially when it is combined with a grouping algorithm that captures interacting variables in common <b>subcomponents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Reasoned action {{approach}} (RAA) includes <b>subcomponents</b> {{of attitude}} (experiential/instrumental), perceived norm (injunctive/descriptive), and perceived behavioral control (capacity/autonomy) to predict intention and behavior. Purpose: To provide a meta-analysis of the RAA for health behaviors focusing on comparing the pairs of RAA <b>subcomponents</b> {{and differences between}} health protection and health-risk behaviors. Methods: The present research reports a meta-analysis of correlational tests of RAA <b>subcomponents,</b> examination of moderators, and combined effects of <b>subcomponents</b> on intention and behavior. Regressions were used to predict intention and behavior {{based on data from}} studies measuring all variables. Results: Capacity and experiential attitude had large, and other constructs had small-medium-sized correlations with intention; all constructs except autonomy were significant independent predictors of intention in regressions. Intention, capacity, and experiential attitude had medium-large, and other constructs had small-medium-sized correlations with behavior; intention, capacity, experiential attitude, and descriptive norm were significant independent predictors of behavior in regressions. Conclusions: The RAA <b>subcomponents</b> have utility in predicting and understanding health behaviors. 21 page(s...|$|R
25|$|A new way {{of looking}} at {{carcinogenesis}} comes from integrating the ideas of developmental biology into oncology. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that the different kinds of cells in a heterogeneous tumor arise from a single cell, termed Cancer Stem Cell. Cancer stem cells may arise from transformation of adult stem cells or differentiated cells within a body. These cells persist as a <b>subcomponent</b> of the tumor and retain key stem cell properties. They give rise to a variety of cells, are capable of self-renewal and homeostatic control. Furthermore, the relapse of cancer and the emergence of metastasis are also attributed to these cells. The cancer stem cell hypothesis does not contradict earlier concepts of carcinogenesis. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has been a proposed mechanism that contributes to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E

40|$|To {{successfully}} apply evolutionary algorithms to {{the solution}} of increasingly complex problems, we must develop effective techniques for evolving solutions {{in the form of}} interacting coadapted <b>subcomponents.</b> One of the major difficulties comes in finding computational extensions to our current evolutionary paradigms that will enable such <b>subcomponents</b> to "emerge" rather than being hand designed. In this paper we describe an architecture for evolving such <b>subcomponents</b> as a collection of cooperating species. Given a simple string-matching task, we show that evolutionary pressure to increase the overall fitness of the ecosystem can provide the needed stimulus for the emergence of an appropriate number of interdependent <b>subcomponents</b> that cover multiple niches, evolve to an appropriate level of generality, and adapt as the number and roles of their fellow <b>subcomponents</b> change over time. We then explore these issues {{within the context of a}} more complicated domain through a case study involving the evolution of artificial neural networks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to apply a diathesis-stress model to the study of Latino self-efficacy and college adjustment. Specifically, it was of {{interest}} to determine whether self-efficacy or its <b>subcomponents</b> would buffer Latino students from the effects of stress in college adjustment or its <b>subcomponents.</b> The sample consisted of 144 Latino undergraduate students. Results suggest that although self-efficacy and its <b>subcomponents</b> had a large effect on adjustment and its <b>subcomponents,</b> they were not found to buffer stress. Hence a diathesis-stress model was not supported. Academic self-efficacy did buffer the effects of stress in predicting academic success, and was supportive of a partial diathesis-stress model. Implications of these findings include promoting the importance of having high self-efficacy and attempting to instill it in Latino youth through the educational system...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{coevolution}} decomposes a large problem {{into its}} <b>subcomponents</b> and uses evolutionary algorithms for solving {{them in order}} to gradually solve the large problem. This paper uses cooperative coevolution framework for training recurrent neural networks for grammatical inference problems. In the past, different encoding schemes were used to build <b>subcomponents</b> from the neural network for the cooperative coevolution framework. This work proposes a new encoding scheme for building <b>subcomponents</b> which is based on the functional properties of a neuron and compares it with the best encoding scheme from literature. All <b>subcomponents</b> in their respective cooperative coevolution framework employ the G 3 -PCX evolutionary algorithm. The results show the the proposed encoding scheme for building <b>subcomponents</b> achieves better performance, although, it has a lower level of modularity when compared to the CC framework used from literature. The level of modularity of the proposed encoding scheme further enables it to have smaller number of function evaluations in the initialisation stage when compared to their previous counterparts. The approach is further used for long-term dependency problems and demonstrates to learn from strings lengths of up to 500 time lags...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary problem {{decomposition}} techniques divide a complex problem into simpler subproblems, evolve individ-uals to produce <b>subcomponents</b> that solve the subproblems, and then assemble the <b>subcomponents</b> {{to produce an}} over-all solution. Ideally, these techniques would automatically decompose the problem and dynamically assemble the sub-components to form the solution. However, although sig-nificant progress in automated {{problem decomposition}} has been made, most techniques explicitly assemble the com-plete solution {{as part of the}} fitness function. In this pa-per, we propose a digital-evolution technique that lays the groundwork for enabling individuals within the population to dynamically decompose a problem and assemble a so-lution. Specifically, our approach evolves specialists that produce some <b>subcomponents</b> of a problem, cooperate with others to receive different <b>subcomponents,</b> and then assem-ble the <b>subcomponents</b> to produce an overall solution. We first establish that this technique is able to evolve specialists that cooperate. We then demonstrate that it is more effec-tive to use a generalist strategy, wherein organisms solve the entire problem themselves, on simple problems, but that a specialist strategy is better on complex problems. Finally, we show that our technique automatically selects a gener-alist or specialist strategy based on the complexity of the problem...|$|R

Association of C' 1 <b>subcomponents</b> was prevented and dissociation of macromolecular C' 1 was effected by Na 3 HEDTA and Na 2 MgEDTA but not by Na 2 CaEDTA.
