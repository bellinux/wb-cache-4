5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E

Boris and Minka follow traditional Jewish practices and speak in heavy Yiddish accents. Tommy and the Pickles family therefore partake in several Jewish activities throughout the series, particularly through holidays.|$|E

5|$|The English {{proper name}} Sun {{developed}} from Old English sunne {{and may be}} related to south. Cognates to English sun appear in other Germanic languages, including Old Frisian sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{version of}} the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization; the last three <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The four theses <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the synod of 1637, and herein Wheelwright portrays {{himself as}} an {{orthodox}} minister {{following the lead of}} such early reformers as Calvin, Zanchi, the Synod of Dort, Beza, Perkins and others. As his theses become repetitious of his propositions, they become abbreviated, and he returns to the accusations made in Short Story. He ends his work claiming that he was right all along, and that he was not an Antinomian.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies' phenotypic diversity.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} {{curriculum of}} aikido {{was derived from}} the teachings of Takeda Sōkaku; the basic techniques of aikido <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> his Daitō-ryū system. In the earlier years of his teaching, from the 1920s to the mid-1930s, Ueshiba taught the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu system; his early students' documents bear the term Daitō-ryū. Indeed, Ueshiba trained one of the future highest grade earners in Daitō-ryū, Takuma Hisa, in the art before Takeda took charge of Hisa's training.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members {{to behave as}} monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E

5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the <b>stem.</b> <b>From</b> a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E

5|$|In {{the prose}} section {{at the end}} of Lokasenna, the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son Nari, while they turn his son Narfi into a wolf. Skaði places a venomous snake above Loki's face. Venom drips from the snake and Loki's wife Sigyn sits and holds a basin beneath the serpent, {{catching}} the venom. When the basin is full, Sigyn must empty it, and during that time the snake venom falls onto Loki's face, causing him to writhe in a tremendous fury, so much so that all earthquakes <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> Loki's writhings.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that in}} early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the club <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a variety of groups that came {{together}} in 1876. After {{a number of years}} including banjo and mandolin players in the club, it reverted to simply a vocal group by the mid-1920s. It received a substantial rise in profile under the directory of Philip Duey in the 1950s, who organised national, then international tours, and numerous television appearances. Since then, the club has continued to tour internationally at high-profile venues.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E
