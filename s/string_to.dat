5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using <b>string</b> <b>to</b> shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous <b>string</b> <b>to</b> disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reference}} {{count of}} a string is checked before mutating a string. This allows reference count 1 <b>strings</b> <b>to</b> be mutated directly whilst higher reference count strings are copied before mutation.

25|$|Guitar tunings assign pitches to {{the open}} strings of guitars, {{including}} acoustic guitars, electric guitars and classical guitars, among others. Tunings can be described by the particular pitches that are denoted by notes in Western music. By convention, the notes are ordered from lowest-pitched string (i.e., the deepest bass note) to the highest-pitched (thickest <b>string</b> <b>to</b> the thinnest).|$|E

25|$|UTF-8 is self-synchronizing: {{character}} {{boundaries are}} easily identified by scanning for well-defined bit patterns in either direction. If bytes are lost due to error or corruption, one can always locate the next valid character and resume processing. If {{there is a}} need to shorten a <b>string</b> <b>to</b> fit a specified field, the previous valid character can easily be found. Many multi-byte encodings are much harder to resynchronize.|$|E

25|$|Any kind of chordal tuning can be achieved, {{simply by}} using the notes in the chord and tuning the <b>strings</b> <b>to</b> those notes. For example, Asus4 has the notes A, D, E. By tuning the <b>strings</b> <b>to</b> only those notes, it creates a chordal Asus4 tuning. Since power chords only use two notes, fifth chord tuning use repeats of those two notes.|$|R

25|$|For clarity {{the table}} is shown above as being built of strings of {{increasing}} length. That scheme can function but the table consumes an unpredictable amount of memory. Memory can be saved in practice by noting that each new <b>string</b> <b>to</b> be stored consists of a previously stored string augmented by one character. It is economical to store at each address only two words: an existing address and one character.|$|E
25|$|The generic URL (Uniform Resource Locator) syntax {{allows for}} a query <b>string</b> <b>to</b> be {{appended}} to a file name in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the question mark, or query mark, ?, is used to indicate {{the start of a}} query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different name–value pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, &. For example, http://www.example.com/login.php?username=test=blank.|$|E
25|$|This is not, {{however, the}} typical case. For the example, {{we have a}} {{canonical}} form available that reduces any <b>string</b> <b>to</b> one of length at most three, by decreasing the length monotonically. In general, {{it is not true}} that one can get a canonical form for the elements, by stepwise cancellation. One may have to use relations to expand a string many-fold, in order eventually to find a cancellation that brings the length right down.|$|E

25|$|Byte {{encodings}} and UTF-8 {{are represented}} by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing {{needs to be done}} to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. UTF-16 is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing ASCII-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires every API and data structure that takes a <b>string</b> <b>to</b> be duplicated, one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.|$|E
25|$|In some Baroque music neither split-chord nor triple-stop is {{appropriate}} and violinists will arpeggiate all chords (and even {{what appear to}} be regular double stops), playing all notes individually {{as if they had been}} written as a slurred figure. In some musical styles, a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent <b>string,</b> <b>to</b> provide a basic accompaniment. This is more often seen in folk traditions than in classical music.|$|E
