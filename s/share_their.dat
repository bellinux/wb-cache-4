5|$|Since 1986, Bath City {{had drawn}} a {{significant}} amount of income from allowing Football League club Bristol Rovers to <b>share</b> <b>their</b> Twerton Park ground; Rovers' return to Bristol {{at the end of the}} 1995–96 season meant that savings needed to be made, including cuts in the playing budget. Together with teammate Rob Cousins, Gill joined local rivals Yeovil Town for the 1996–97 season for a fee of £9,500.|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby.

5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} group of American {{military}} men {{who believed that}} long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not <b>share</b> <b>their</b> belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from their fathers, {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas.

5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train <b>share</b> <b>their</b> trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} the arid and sparsely {{populated}} Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to the}} closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to <b>share</b> <b>their</b> knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E
5|$|Halo.Bungie.Org is {{the most}} widely read Halo fansite. In 2007, it {{received}} about 600,000 page views a day. The site covers game news and rumors, strategy, fan-made machinima, stories and art, contests and forums. In the site's early years, it received {{only a small amount}} of fan-submitted material, which has ballooned since and made constant site maintenance a challenge. Errera attributes the site's longevity {{to the fact that it}} provided fans with not just Halo news but a place to <b>share</b> <b>their</b> love of the franchise. At a time when there was no easy video sharing via YouTube, Halo.bungie.org posted and categorized Halo films that fans submitted.|$|E

5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as {{a victory for the}} proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not <b>share</b> <b>their</b> views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In June 1995, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong asked PA {{to study}} {{the idea of having}} {{community}} centres <b>share</b> <b>their</b> premises with other civil users such as libraries, government offices and commercial developments. Goh, who is also a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency, suggested combining the Marine Parade Community Club, which was slated for upgrading, with the National Library branch in Marine Parade, in a six-storey building with three floors for the community club and three for the library. In June 1996, Wong Kan Seng, PA's deputy chairman, announced that due to the scarcity of land in Singapore, eight of the redeveloped community centres, including Marine Parade Community Club, would be located with other civil users.|$|E
