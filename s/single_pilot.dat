25|$|The Djinn {{featured}} a two-seat cockpit as standard, upon which a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> and passenger could be accommodated. A range of specialised equipment could be outfitted to suit mission roles, such as stretcher carriers, spray bars, radio sets, electrical systems, additional fuel tanks, and a load-bearing hook. Akin to the later Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopter, the Djinn made considerable use of pneumatic systems. According to aerospace publication Flight International, considerable weight savings {{had been on}} the rotorcraft via the use of bleed air to operate various cockpit indicators and functions, including the blind-flying instruments, fuel gauges, cabin heaters, windshield demisters, trimmers, air/sea rescue hoists and crop-spraying equipment.|$|E
25|$|Avionics {{include a}} triple-redundant digital {{fly-by-wire}} flight control system, a head-up display system, and Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC). The cockpit {{has been designed}} so that the AW609 can be flown by a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> in instrument flight rules conditions. Several of the aircraft's controls, such as blade pitch, are designed to resemble and function like their counterparts on conventional rotorcraft, enabling helicopter pilots to transition to the type more easily. Elements of the aircraft's controls feature touchscreen interfaces. Shortly following AgustaWestland's full acquisition of the program, a substantial modernisation of the AW609's design was initiated in 2012; these changes included new engines and the redesigning of the cockpit. As part of the design refresh, new flight management systems, Northrop Grumman inertial and GPS navigation systems, and various other avionics from Rockwell Collins were adopted.|$|E
25|$|The French Army {{ordered a}} total of 100 helicopters. The Djinn was {{operated}} by the French Army in variety of mission roles, such as liaison, observation, training purposes; when flown with a <b>single</b> <b>pilot,</b> it could be outfitted with two external litters for the casualty evacuation mission. In addition to the French military, a further ten countries placed orders for the type; such as a batch of six rotorcraft which were procured by the German Army. Production of the Djinn {{came to an end}} during the mid-1960s, by which point {{a total of}} 178 Djinns had been constructed; the type had effectively been replaced by the more conventional and highly successful Aérospatiale Alouette II. Some Djinns had been sold onto civil operators; in this capacity, it was often equipped for agricultural purposes, being fitted with chemical tanks and spray bars in this role.|$|E

25|$|There are {{currently}} {{a total of}} four principal configurations designed by Airbus Helicopters for the EC225. The passenger transport version has a crash-worthy seating arrangement for up to 19 passengers with a high-density seating arrangement accommodating up to 28 passengers available to be fitted. The VIP transport version has a large lounge with seating for up to 12 passengers and a cabin attendant. The emergency medical services (EMS) configuration has medical units for six stretchers and four seats for medical workers. The search and rescue (SAR) configuration allows space for search and rescue equipment with an operator seat, hoistman seat and up to eight rescue seats and three stretchers. While a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> is capable of controlling the aircraft under visual meteorical conditions, two pilots are used in a typical crew compliment and, dependent on role, a cabin attendant or flight engineer may also be present.|$|E
25|$|The EC135 can be {{equipped}} with either a conventional flight deck or the Avionique Novelle glass cockpit – the latter allows for <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> instrument flight rules operation. The glass cockpit is equipped with several liquid-crystal displays, including two Sextant SMD45 displays and a central panel display. The main avionics suite is supplied by Thales Group; the EC135 can be outfitted with various avionics suites from manufacturers such as Russian firm Transas Aviation and British firm Britannia 2000. The newer H135 model can {{be equipped}} with a four-axis autopilot, which is included {{as part of the}} Helionix avionics suite; this suite provides the H135 a greater level of commonality with several other Airbus Helicopters-produced rotorcraft including the H145, H160 and H175. Earlier versions of the EC135 were equipped with a three-axis autopilot with integrated stability augmentation; featuring a First Limit Indicator (FLI), simplifying engine and torque monitoring. Cockpit touch screens can be optionally installed.|$|E
25|$|From 1899 the {{competitive}} pilot system was abolished {{and a new}} piloting law was introduced, establishing the Naval Pilot Authority. By 1910 {{there was only one}} pilot left at Fedje. This was dramatically changed during the First World War, when series of British convoys traveled up and down the coast. Soon there were four pilots stationed at Fedje, and when needed experienced fishermen were also used. After {{the end of the war}} in 1918 things settled down and from 1920 there was only a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> working out of Fedje. This was further increased to two in 1927. During the 1930s each of them had an average thirty missions per year. Pilots were required to have a house with a good view of the open sea towards the direction of the sea lane. Of this reason placing houses at Hesthaugen was popular amongst the pilots. There was a new boom in pilot demand during the Second World War, with an average 69 missions per year.|$|E

Whilst it is of some concern that the majority of the pilots exhibited perceived invulnerability, no evidence was found to suggest that the level of perceived invulnerability is affected by a group polarisation effect, although further replication of this study is recommended...|$|R
25|$|The M.52's <b>single</b> <b>pilot,</b> who, for the {{intended}} first flight, {{would have been}} test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the shock cone at {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a curved windscreen that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped nose. In the event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based explosive bolts. Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.|$|E
25|$|Missed {{opportunity}} with Lindbergh In late 1926, an enterprising Charles Lindbergh {{had convinced}} Earl Thompson, and Major Albert Bond Lambert to back him on {{an attempt to}} win the $25,000 Orteig Prize for a non-stop transatlantic flight. He specifically wanted a <b>single</b> <b>pilot,</b> and a single engine to reduce weight and chances of failure. The ideal plane was the Wright-Bellanca WB-2. Lindbergh set out by train to New York in a new suit to look professional for a face-to-face meeting with Columbia Aircraft to buy the only WB-2. In the meeting, Levine said the aircraft was worth $25,000, but would discount it to $15,000 due to the free publicity that would be made from the flight, well above the approximate $10,000 price that had been anticipated by Lindbergh and his backers. Lindbergh returned to St. Louis, and had a check signed to him personally for $15,000 and a request to name the WB-2 The Spirit of St. Louis. Lindbergh {{said he would have}} the plane back in St. Louis in a week.|$|E

50|$|In air navigation, the 1 in 60 rule is a rule {{of thumb}} which states that if a pilot has {{travelled}} sixty miles then an error in track of one mile is approximately a 1° error in heading, and proportionately more for larger errors. The rule is used by <b>single</b> <b>pilots</b> with many other tasks to perform, often in a basic aircraft without the aid of an autopilot, who need a simple process that can be performed in their heads. This rule is also used by air traffic controllers to quickly determine how much to turn an aircraft for separation purposes.|$|R

500|$|Leaving his fiancée in Rome, Marseille {{returned}} to combat duties on 23 August. 1 September 1942 was Marseille's most successful day, destroying 17 Allied aircraft (nos. 105–121), and September {{would see him}} claim 54 victories, his most productive month. The 17 aircraft shot down included eight in 10 minutes; {{as a result of}} this feat, he was presented with a Volkswagen Kübelwagen by a Regia Aeronautica squadron, on which his Italian comrades had painted [...] "Otto" [...] (Italian language: Otto = eight). This was the most aircraft from Western Allied air forces shot down by a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> in one day.

500|$|While the Su-27M design had the {{avionics}} to {{give the}} aircraft the nominal designation as a multi-role fighter, flight tests with the Russian Air Force revealed difficulties in efficiently deploying the aircraft's armament. According to Aviation Week & Space Technology, air force pilots described weapons trials with the aircraft in Akhtubinsk and Lipetsk as a [...] "negative experience", with a particular emphasis on {{the layout of the}} cockpit and its adverse impact on the workload of the <b>single</b> <b>pilot.</b> Designers, test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign the cockpit and its attendant systems and improve the human-machine interface. The information management system of aircraft's avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from the flight- and weapons-control systems. The information is then displayed on two [...] multi-function liquid crystal displays, which replaced the smaller multi-function cathode-ray tube displays found on the Su-27M.

500|$|The [...] was sunk {{after taking}} {{a great deal of}} {{punishment}} from Intrepids air group. However, Center Force was able to limp back through San Bernardino Strait with [...] {{and a number of other}} ships intact. Intrepid was called north to go after a reported Japanese carrier group, Northern Force, which it encountered on October 25. Anti-aircraft fire was once again extremely intense, but this time Air Group 18 made it through the day without the loss of a <b>single</b> <b>pilot.</b> The group's strikes were reported likely to have sunk a light carrier and to have damaged both a carrier and a second light carrier. Northern Force was a diversion, however: Center Force had turned around and reentered San Bernardino Strait, heading for the American beachheads at Leyte. After reports filtered in alerting Admiral William Halsey Jr. to the danger posed by the remainder of Center Force, he ordered TG 38.2 to head south at full speed to reengage. The task group arrived hours too late to catch the Japanese battleships, which had once more fled in the face of the U.S. fleet. Though Admiral [...] Kurita devastated the escort carrier unit [...] "Taffy 3" [...] (taskforce) on the 25th, through fierce combat the much smaller, thinly armored Taffys had managed to hold off and even force the withdrawal of his warships. The mission of Air Group 18 on the 26th was to locate and destroy the remainder of Center Force as they were escaping back towards the Japanese home islands. Obscuring cloud cover, intense anti-aircraft fire and sheer flight distance contributed to mixed results for the air group. The initial search and subsequent strike located parts of Center Force in the Cuyo East Pass off the western coast of Panay. The bombers of VB-18 seriously damaged a [...] and torpedoed a [...] in addition to doing slight damage to a number of other vessels. A third sortie failed to locate Kurita's forces and returned to Intrepid empty-handed. This was something of a letdown for the pilots of Air Group 18, but they were still proud of their results at Leyte: five strikes against two separate Japanese forces causing serious damage to both, including the sinking of carriers and one of the largest battleships ever constructed.|$|E
