Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
60|$|The three <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Sickened shock {{settled over}} them slowly.|$|E
60|$|Ashurst rose, {{took his}} wife's sketch, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in silence.|$|E
60|$|The barber shop, {{you will}} remember, stands {{across the street}} from Smith's Hotel, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> face to face.|$|R
60|$|Yes--that is {{the famous}} Suspension Bridge--and a {{beautiful}} work of art <b>it</b> is. Ay, <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and wonder <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> little man, of course.|$|R
6000|$|... [She {{stretches}} out {{her left hand}} so that DAISY should see there is no ring on the fourth finger. DAISY <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for a moment.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{drew back}} and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in {{speechless}} awe and consternation.|$|E
60|$|Sir Charles <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> fixedly. The Seer {{was really}} {{beginning}} {{to produce an}} impression.|$|E
60|$|He routed out his map again, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{with eyes}} {{that did not}} see.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the traffic}} lights is turned on (the order {{of the traffic}} lights type I and II was at random) {{indicating}} the observer to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for 15  seconds.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Smith {{would take}} the carte between his finger and thumb and <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It was all covered with such devices as Potage la Mariposa--Filet Mignon a la proprietaire--Cotellete a la Smith, and so on.|$|R
50|$|Rick {{goes home}} and discovers {{his parents are}} not there. He then pulls out a box from a drawer, opens it, and finds his father's hand gun. He takes off his glasses, shakes, and intently <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as it receded. Then {{he seemed}} to be staring at distant things.|$|E
60|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Was it his? It {{was like}} it, certainly. Yet that k? and those s's? I almost wondered.|$|E
6000|$|He {{found himself}} {{presently}} beside the less damaged Asiatic aeroplane again. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and the kitten smelt it. [...] "Broke!" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|As certainly, boy, I believe, as that Waterloo {{is where}} the Duke fought Napoleon. Yes: you may well <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with all your eyes, the noble down. It {{is one of the}} most sacred spots on English soil.|$|R
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Looking <b>at</b> the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Guppy {{has been}} biting his thumb-nail during this dialogue, {{generally}} changing the thumb {{when he has}} changed the cross leg. As {{he is going to}} do so again, he happens to look <b>at</b> his coat-sleeve. <b>It</b> takes his attention. He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> aghast.|$|R
60|$|The {{inspector}} drew {{a little}} pamphlet {{from his pocket}} and passed it across. Wingate took it into his hands, opened it and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in surprise.|$|E
60|$|Carley <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Her heart gave a great leap. Her hand shook. She {{sat down}} {{suddenly}} {{as if the}} strength of her legs was inadequate to uphold her.|$|E
6000|$|The {{contract}} {{had been}} laid face upwards upon the table. Frank Crosse's face grew whiter and his eyes larger as he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It ran in this way - ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me. <b>It</b> {{was like being}} at an aquarium.|$|R
60|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her. <b>It</b> was {{the most}} amazing moment in any life....|$|R
60|$|Arnold <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>It</b> seemed {{impossible}} {{that there was}} any one ignorant of the tragedy.|$|R
60|$|He {{had laid}} one {{page of the}} paper before them, with his {{forefinger}} upon an item in the left-hand top corner. Then he discreetly withdrew. Frank <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in horror.|$|E
60|$|When one of {{the candles}} was lighted, and stuck into an empty ink-bottle that served as candlestick, Paul {{was able to see}} the interior, and he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon--are you feeling faint? Would you care--?" [...] And, {{unscrewing}} the top, I {{held out the}} flask. She <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> a moment blankly, then taking it, said: ...|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{version of}} the game ends with Greedy, and two underlings, Iounus and Uranium, {{stranded}} on a deserted planet, {{with a picture of}} Ristar appearing in the space, while Greedy simply <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> The ending scene shown in the English shows Ristar being re-united with his father once again.|$|R
60|$|I {{could do}} no more than <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>It</b> seemed as if my mind were {{stricken}} numb.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} that the Westley-Richards was drawn from its case and loaded, only one buck remained, for, having caught sight of the waggon, <b>it</b> turned to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> suspiciously. Mr. Clifford aimed and fired. Down went the buck, then {{springing}} to its feet again, vanished behind the ridge. Mr. Clifford shook his head sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense--not {{lightning}} of this sort--I shouldn't have <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{if there}} had been danger. It is only sheet-lightning now. Now, will you have another piece? Something from an oratorio this time?' ...|$|E
60|$|Simply {{absurd to}} wait. She poured her own cup of tea. She sat and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> What was it {{she was going}} to do now? Oh yes; how idiotic; take a lump of sugar.|$|E
60|$|And as he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> {{it began}} slowly to dawn upon Fenn {{that he had}} not shown up to {{advantage}} in the recent interview. In a word, he had made a fool of himself.|$|E
60|$|It {{compelled}} {{attention for}} a space. For all my earthly concentration of mind, I could but <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{for a moment}} with a vague anticipation that, after all, in some way so strange and glorious an object must have significance, could not possibly be a matter of absolute indifference to the scheme and values of my life.|$|R
50|$|They {{emerge in}} the evenings to hunt in open areas for crickets, {{cockroaches}} and huntsman spiders. They eat once every 3-4 days. When they see prey they will <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and wag their tails, then pounce. When alarmed, the thick-tailed gecko will make a barking sound or hiss. They will also raise their backs. One main predator is snakes.|$|R
5000|$|He clapped that chimney on {{the roof}} when he was sixteen, I've {{had to live with}} it ever since. It's awful. I came home one day from work and there it was, {{sticking}} up in the sky. The photographer came from the Evening News. People drove here on Sunday afternoons to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Everyone said our Fred was a lunatic. Betsy Dibnah ...|$|R
