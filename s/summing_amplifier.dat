40|$|The <b>summing</b> <b>amplifier</b> and the {{quantizer}} form two of {{the most}} critical blocks in a continuous time delta sigma (CT ??) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Most of the conventional CT ?? ADC designs incorporate a voltage <b>summing</b> <b>amplifier</b> and a voltage-mode quantizer. The high gain-bandwidth (GBW) requirement of the voltage <b>summing</b> <b>amplifier</b> increases the overall power consumption of the CT ?? ADC. In this work, a novel method of performing the operations of summing and quantization is proposed. A current-mode summing stage is proposed in the place of a voltage <b>summing</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The summed signal, which is available in current domain, is then quantized with a 3 -bit current mode flash ADC. This current mode summing approach offers considerable power reduction of about 80 % compared to conventional solutions [2]. The total static power consumption of the summing stage and the quantizer is 5. 3 mW. The circuits were designed in IBM 90 nm process. The static and dynamic characteristics of the quantizer are analyzed.
