5000|$|On {{the table}} or desk area {{in front of}} the {{operator}} are columns of keys, lamps and cords. Each column consists of a front key and a rear key, a front lamp and a rear lamp, followed by a front cord and a rear cord, making up together a cord circuit. The front key is the [...] "talk" [...] key allowing the operator to speak with that particular cord pair. The rear key on older [...] "manual" [...] boards and PBXs is used to ring a telephone physically. On newer boards, the back key is used to collect (retrieve) money from coin telephones. Each of the keys has three positions: back, normal and forward. When a key is in the normal position an electrical talk path connects the front and rear cords. A key in the forward position (front key) connects the operator to the cord pair, and a key in the back position sends a ring signal out on the cord (on older manual exchanges). Each cord has a three-wire TRS phone connector: tip and ring for testing, ringing and voice; and a <b>sleeve</b> <b>wire</b> for busy signals.|$|E

This method should be avoided because while sleeves can work well on repairs {{in the middle of}} the fence where there is not enough wire for hand knotting, they tend to slip when under tension.|$|R

50|$|In the {{electric}} power distribution industry, a hot stick is an insulated pole, usually made of fiberglass, used by electric utility workers when engaged on live-line working on energized high-voltage electric power lines, {{to protect them}} from electric shock. Depending on the tool attached {{to the end of the}} hot stick, it is possible to test for voltage, tighten nuts and bolts, apply tie wires (twisted lengths of ductile wire which fasten the running cable to its supporting insulators), open and close switches, replace fuses, lay insulating <b>sleeves</b> on <b>wires,</b> and perform various other tasks while not exposing the crew to a large risk of electric shock.|$|R
40|$|A tool makes a cut {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical axis of a core hole at a predetermined depth to free the core at that depth. The tool does not damage the surrounding material from which the core was cut, and it operates within the core-hole kerf. Coring usually begins with use of a hole saw or a hollow cylindrical abrasive cutting tool to make an annular hole that leaves the core (sometimes called the plug) in place. In this approach to coring as practiced heretofore, the core is removed forcibly in a manner chosen to shear the core, preferably {{at or near the}} greatest depth of the core hole. Unfortunately, such forcible removal often damages both the core and the surrounding material (see Figure 1). In an alternative prior approach, especially applicable to toxic or fragile material, a core is formed and freed by means of milling operations that generate much material waste. In contrast, the present tool eliminates the damage associated with the hole-saw approach and reduces the extent of milling operations (and, hence, reduces the waste) associated with the milling approach. The present tool (see Figure 2) includes an inner sleeve and an outer sleeve and resembles the hollow cylindrical tool used to cut the core hole. The sleeves are thin enough that this tool fits within the kerf of the core hole. The inner sleeve is attached to a shaft that, in turn, can be attached to a drill motor or handle for turning the tool. This tool also includes a cutting wire attached to the distal ends of both <b>sleeves.</b> The cutting <b>wire</b> is long enough that with sufficient relative rotation of the inner and outer <b>sleeves,</b> the <b>wire</b> can cut {{all the way to the}} center of the core. The tool is inserted in the kerf until its distal end is seated at the full depth. The inner sleeve is then turned. During turning, frictional drag on the outer core pulls the cutting wire into contact with the core. The cutting force of the wire against the core increases with the tension in the wire and, hence, with the frictional drag acting on the outer <b>sleeve.</b> As the <b>wire</b> cuts toward the center of the core, the inner sleeve rotates farther with respect to the outer <b>sleeve.</b> Once the <b>wire</b> has cut to the center of the core, the tool and the core can be removed from the hole. The proper choice of cutting wire depends on the properties of the core material. For a sufficiently soft core material, a nonmetallic monofilament can be used. For a rubber-like core material, a metal wire can be used. For a harder core material, it is necessary to use an abrasive wire, and the efficiency of the tool can be increased greatly by vacuuming away the particles generated during cutting. For a core material that can readily be melted or otherwise cut by use of heat, it could be preferable to use an electrically heated cutting wire. In such a case, electric current can be supplied to the cutting wire, from an electrically isolated source, via rotating contact rings mounted on the sleeves...|$|R
50|$|The cathode {{is usually}} {{in the form of}} a long narrow sheet metal {{cylinder}} at the center of the tube. The heater consists of a fine wire or ribbon, made of a high resistance metal alloy like nichrome, similar to the heating element in a toaster but finer. It runs through the center of the cathode, often being coiled on tiny insulating supports or bent into hairpin-like shapes to give enough surface area to produce the required heat. Typical heaters have a ceramic coating on the wire. When it's bent sharply at the ends of the cathode <b>sleeve,</b> the <b>wire</b> is exposed.The ends of the wire are electrically connected to two of the several pins protruding from the end of the tube. When current passes through the wire it becomes red hot, and the radiated heat strikes the inside surface of the cathode, heating it. The red or orange glow seen coming from operating vacuum tubes is produced by the heater.|$|R
50|$|At its core, the October 2013 {{edition of}} the M8 comes with a custom BMW {{designed}} chassis, a slim line optical drive, an ASRock Z87-M8 motherboard, and a 450W Silverstone SFX power supply. Tom's Hardware reviewed this {{edition of the}} M8, citing that they had run into issues with thermal throttling on the system. These issues were resolved by turning the bottom fans into intake fans, while the top fans were flipped into exhaust fans. They also cut up any <b>wire</b> <b>sleeves</b> within the system. In the end, there was a reported a decrease in CPU temperature by 20 Â°C.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{installing}} fragile, {{high temperature insulation}} batting in an elongated cavity or in a resilient <b>wire</b> <b>sleeve</b> to form a resilient seal. The batting is preformed to rough dimensions and wrapped in a plastic film, the film being of a material which is fugitive at a high temperature. The film is heat sealed and trimmed to form a snugly fit skin which overlaps at least at one end to permit attachment of a pull cord. The film absorbs the tensile force of pulling the film enclosed batting through the cavity or <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sleeve</b> and is subsequently driven off by high temperature baking, leaving only the insulation in the cavity or <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sleeve...</b>|$|R
40|$|By {{controlling}} {{a robotic}} arm, autistic children can learn the movements associated with social interactions. The goals of my invention are that autistic children would safely {{interact with the}} robotic arm and mimic the robotic arm to replicate movements associated with social interactions. The results from my Peter J. Eloranta Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship suggest that all autistic children successfully learned social movements by mimicking a robotic arm. A more effective robotic arm would better replicate human motion than currently available commercial products. Additionally, a protective <b>sleeve</b> that conceals <b>wiring</b> and joints would make this product safer for young children, the main client of the invention. by Devanie DuFour. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|As the {{component}} to be wound {{has to be}} presented only in the winding position and otherwise {{does not need to}} perform any movement during the winding process, also very bulky and massive products can be manufactured. One example is the rotors of electric motors (rotor winding technology, special form of the successive winding method): The wire is held by a clip fixed to the machine during {{the component}} change. Since the rotors often consist of heavy, punch-packed metal sheets, the flyer winding technology is of particular advantage in this regard. Since the flyer cannot be directly guided in case of the rotor winding technology, the wire is guided across polished guiding blocks into the corresponding groove or slot. Special <b>wiring</b> <b>sleeves</b> ensure the correct wire position at the terminals of the Commutators.|$|R
50|$|The MR:100 was a 5GB MP3 player. It had {{a bright}} red on deep blood red 1.25 x 1 inch display which was 160 pixels wide and 128 pixels high. It also had a touch pad for the {{controls}} that glowed red where the sensitivity pads are. The entire front was covered in {{a single piece of}} plastic, and when the m:robe was turned off or idling, the front turned all black. It had a metal back painted in Pearl White, although in Japan limited numbers were also available with a Pearl Pink or Lagoon Blue back. The MR-100 used the same PortalPlayer PP5020 CPU as the iPod mini, and used a very similar interface. The player was compatible with MP3 and WMA files. It included an AC adapter, a USB cable, a dock, a pair of earbuds, a headphone extension wire, a CD-ROM with the player's software, and documentation. Additional accessories included a red or black rubber <b>sleeve</b> and a <b>wired</b> remote that plugs into the MR:100.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of the Magnetorheological (MR) fluid is very board, especially in the mechanical, chemical and optical industry. In contrast to the traditional viscoplastic fluid, the flow characteristic of the MR Fluid could be changed when applying an external magnetic field. The hydrodynamic mechanism altered when {{the strength of the}} applying field decreased or increased. The semi-active control is an important concept for studying vibration reduction in recent years. It is a highly dependable mobilizing device and control system that integrates the stability of passive control system and mobility of active control system to reach the goals of low energy consumption, high performance, and easy maintenance. Because of its excellent stability and low energy consumption that only takes minimum energy to reach effective vibration reduction, this latest technology was studied intensively in both academic and industrial fields. This research use the Magnetorheological Damper device (MR Damper) and utilized MTS 810 material control system {{to examine the effects of}} different levels of voltage, amplitude and frequency on energy reduction. A combination of the number of circles of wire, damping tubes, enameled <b>wire</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and liquid of IVIR damper was used as control to increase the damping force. ç£æ§æµè®æ¶²é«ï¼Magnetorheological Fluidï¼ç°¡ç¨±MRï¼å¨å·¥æ¥­çæç¨ç¸ç¶å»£æ³ï¼å°¤å¶æ¯å¨æ©æ¢°ãåå·¥ååé»å·¥æ¥­ä¸ãå¶åå³çµ±å¡æµæ¶²é«ä¹ä¸»è¦ååï¼å¨æ¼å¤å ä¸åç£å ´æï¼å¶æµé«çæµè®ç¹æ§æé¨èå¤å ç£å ´å¼·åº¦å¤§å°åé »çèæé¡¯èåå¿«éçè®åã åä¸»åæ¦å¿µ?è¿å¹´ä¾æ¸æ¯ç ç©¶çéè¦èª²é¡ãåä¸»åæ§å¶æ¯ä¸éæ°æè¡ï¼å¶ç¶åäºè¢«åæ§å¶ç³»çµ±çç©©å®æ§èä¸»åæ§å¶ç³»çµ±çæ©åæ§ï¼éå°ä½èè½ãé«åºåãææ¼ç¶­è­·ãå¯é æ§é«ä¹è´åå¨èæ§å¶ç³»çµ±ãå å¶ç©©å®æ§é«ãèè½ä½ï¼åéæ¥µå°ä¹æ§å¶è½éå³éå°ç¸ç¶ä¸é¯ä¹æ¸æ¯ææï¼ä»¥è´å­¸è¡çåå·¥æ¥­çå°å¶æ±ä»¥åæï¼ç´ç´æå¥ç ç©¶ã æ¬ç ç©¶ä½¿ç¨ãç£æµè®é»å°¼å¨ã(MR Damper) ï¼éç¨MTS 810 æææ§å¶ç³»çµ±ï¼ç ç©¶æ¼åç·ç·åçºç¹åæ¸ãé»å°¼å¨å¥ç­ãç¹æ¼åç·å¥ç®¡ãé»å°¼å¨å¡«åæ¶²ä¹å¥çµï¼å¨ä¸åçé»å£ï¼æ¯å¹åé »çä¸æéæä¹æ¶è½æ...|$|R
