25|$|In early 1941, American, Canadian and British war {{planners}} {{convened in}} Washington D.C. {{for a series}} of secret planning sessions called American–British Conference, or ABC-1, to determine a course of action <b>should</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States become a belligerent in the war. An overarching strategy of Europe first was agreed to, where American energies would primarily be directed against Germany, Italy and their European conquests, during which a secondary defensive posture was to be held against Japan. Royal Air Force Air Vice-Marshal John Slessor and other airmen present at the conference agreed on the general concept of using strategic bombing by both British and American air units based in the United Kingdom to reduce Axis military power in Europe. Incorporating this work in April 1941, the joint U.S. Army-Navy Board developed Rainbow 5, the final version of general military guidelines the U.S. would follow in case of war.|$|E

On 26 January 1966, {{two months after the}} UDI, Van der Byl was willing to be quoted as saying that Rhodesian Army troops would follow a [...] "scorched earth" [...] policy <b>should</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom send in troops, comparing their position to that of the Red Army when Nazi forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. He was highly critical of Harold Wilson, describing him as a [...] "highly dangerous, uninformed and conceited little man." ...|$|E
500|$|The Vietcong commanders {{had planned}} the venture with two aims in mind. Firstly, by attacking an American {{institution}} {{in the heart of}} the heavily guarded capital, the bombing would demonstrate the Vietcong's ability to strike against the Americans in Vietnam, <b>should</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam. Secondly, the attack would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese public that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection. Xuan added that [...] "all the crimes committed by the Americans were directed from this nerve center". He recalled that the number of American officers at the Brinks Hotel had swelled on Christmas Eve because they were using the building to coordinate their celebrations, and that the attack would therefore cause more casualties than on a normal day.|$|E

Issued in denominations of $1, $5, $10, and $20, only the $1 was a silver certificate, the others were Federal Reserve Notes. Stamped “HAWAII” (in small solid letters on the obverse and large letters on the reverse), with the Treasury seal and serial numbers in brown {{instead of the usual}} blue, these notes could be demonetized {{in the event of a}} Japanese invasion.

2500|$|In 1905, Jones's {{remains were}} {{identified}} by U.S. Ambassador to France Gen. Horace Porter, who had searched for six years {{to track down the}} body using faulty copies of Jones's burial record. Thanks to the kind donation of a French admirer, Pierrot Francois Simmoneau, who had donated over 460 francs, Jones's body was preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin [...] "in the event that <b>should</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified." [...] Porter knew what to look for in his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter's team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was later identified by a meticulous post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault as being that of Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} devoted to the study of {{causality}} and ambiguity within Charles Brockden Brown’s Wieland, or the Transformation. While there is textual and cultural evidence providing explanations for Clara’s behavior, little has been said about the ramifications of Clara’s actions. This essay seeks to add to the discussion of Wieland by exploring Clara’s transformation from theistic rationalist to someone who is inclined to believe in supernatural explanation concerning seemingly inexplicable events. In more than one instance, Clara’s supernaturally-charged beliefs endanger her. Brown uses Clara’s increasing reliance on supernatural explanation to suggest that, <b>should</b> <b>the</b> early <b>United</b> States similarly abandon rational thinking, it will likewise expose itself to harm and self-destruction. To Brown, Clara’s narrative represents <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States’ potential trajectory should it fail to return to rational thought. <b>The</b> early <b>United</b> States struggled to find clarity amid the conflicting roles that religious belief and rationality played. The Second Great Awakening created a surge in national religiosity; this was a surge that Brown was wary of. By using Clara as a metaphor, Brown argues that, not only <b>should</b> <b>the</b> early <b>United</b> States return to rational thought, women were central to reinstating a national equilibrium between rationality and religiosity...|$|R
