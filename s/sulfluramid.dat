40|$|Commercial termite baiting {{systems were}} {{utilized}} and evaluated under real-world conditions {{in order to}} provide a comparison of efficacy in the management of subterranean termites. Three commercial termite baiting systems available for comparison included: FirstLine? (FMC Corp.), Sentricon? (Dow AgroSciences), and Terminate? (United Industries, Inc). The time required for foraging termites to locate and begin feeding on both the Sentricon? and the Terminate? bait stations was approximately one-half the time required to locate and begin feeding on the FirstLine? system, for both R. flavipes and C. formosanus. The time required for C. formosanus to locate and begin feeding on all termite baiting systems was approximately one-half the time required for R. flavipes. There {{were no significant differences in}} efficacy between the three baiting treatment systems against R. flavipes, with a mean of 84 % efficacy for all systems. The Sentricon? system was able to achieve efficacy (88 %) results with few additional residual liquid termiticide treatments. FirstLine? efficacy (80 %) and Terminate? efficacy (84 %) results required initial and subsequent multiple spot treatments with residual termiticide for comparable results. The Sentricon? baiting system yielded positive results in the management of C. formosanus, if utilized in an aggressive, active management program, involving multiple supplementary in-ground and above-ground bait stations at both points of active infestation and at areas with conditions conducive to infestation. Optimum results were achieved when monitoring of the bait stations occurred twice each month, rather than the standard monthly monitoring regime. The two termite baiting systems with <b>Sulfluramid</b> as the active ingredient required spot treatments with termiticides in order to protect the structures. Grids of bait stations were installed and termite activity and foraging strategies were monitored for a five-year period. Treatment with <b>sulfluramid</b> required 472 active ingredient tubes, over a 37 -month period, in order to reduce subterranean termite populations.

If attractive, what is the behavior exhibited by the workers? Do they ingest the baits in the spot or take them into the nest? Is there any devolution? Under conditions of multiple food choice, does this attractiveness remain or does it happen only in the lack of the conventional food? What is the outcome of direct or indirect contact between the ants and the baits? Is there significant mortality? Which of the active ingredients is the most harmful? Are the products selective? The results obtained from the tests in laboratory showed that, under conditions of normal exposure, the workers of E. brunneum were not repelled by the insecticide baits. Nevertheless, there was not enough attractiveness as to lead to transporting or ingesting. When the material was moistened, the attractiveness increased significantly, allowing portions of bait to be ingested at the very foraging arena or to be taken into the nest and distributed to the other individuals. Total or partial devolution of the portions carried was not observed in any of the treatments.

40|$|Summary: Introduced common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) are widespread, {{abundant}} pests in New Zealand. They {{compete for}} food with native birds and feed on native invertebrates. We poisoned wasps annually over 4 years {{to see if}} it was possible to reduce their abundance in two 30 -ha beech forest sites. Two different poisons (sodium monofluoroacetate and <b>sulfluramid)</b> were used, mixed with sardine catfood. There was no evidence that one poison was more effective than the other. Between 82 and 100 % of the colonies were killed in the poisoned sites, but reinvasion by foraging workers meant that cumulative wasp biomass (measured using Malaise traps) was reduced by only 55 - 70 %. Individual wasps were about 16 % heavier in the poisoned sites at the peak of the wasp season (March) than in the non-poisoned sites, although this had a minimal effect on cumulative biomass over the entire season. Conservation gains need to be quantified in order to assess whether the expense of such poisoning operations is warranted. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

The toxicity of these compounds and other precursors has led to concern about human exposure. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the presence of perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) in UK indoor and outdoor microenvironments and the impact this may have on human exposure. Both PFOS and PFOA were chosen for analysis (via LC-ESI-MS/MS) because of their highly persistent behaviour. Additionally, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), was chosen along with precursors to PFOS and PFOA; perfluorooctane sulfonamides (PFOSAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols (PFOSEs). An international comparison of house dust was conducted and concentrations of PFCs in the UK (except for ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (EtFOSA)) were found to be similar to those from France, Germany, USA, Canada and Australia and much greater than from homes in Kazakhstan and Thailand. Concentrations of EtFOSA were significantly higher in house dust samples from Australia compared to the UK, and were raised in all other countries. The reason for this is uncertain, but is speculated to derive from the use of EtFOSA as an active ingredient in <b>Sulfluramid,</b> which is an insecticide used for control of ants, cockroaches and termites.

Despite the termites ' slight preference for treated decayed wood rather than treated sound wood, mortality ensued quickly after exposure to either substrate. This lack of dramatic difference in wood consumption and mortality suggests that the timeconsuming and labor-intensive process of decaying blocks is not justified for either bait toxicant at 100 ppm in wood. Despite low termite survival in the treatments, significant differences in block weight loss occurred over time. Wood degradation may have resulted from mould fungi emanating from the large numbers of dead and decaying tennites associated with the treatments. This study also demonstrates the importance of correcting for wood weight loss attributable to experimental conditions, particularly when using decayed wood...|$|E

Therefore, an assay was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of baits, formulated homeopathically, in nests of the leaf-cutting ant Atta bisphaerica, in the field. Thirty (30) colonies were chosen and divided into 10 repetitions for each of the following treatments: control (without baits), standard (8 g/m 2 of loose soil of baits based on <b>sulfluramid</b> 0. 3 %) and homeopathic (60 g/m 2 of loose soil of homeopathic baits parceled into 20 g/m 2 doses applied on 3 consecutive days). At 24 hours after bait application on active foraging trails of colonies, evaluation of parameters was initiated: loading and return of the baits, foraging and mortality. The completed assay demonstrated that the transport of baits was greater in the standard (80 %) than the homeopathic treatment (50 %), and, to the contrary, the return of baits was significantly higher in the homeopathic treatment (15 %) versus the conventional, where return/rejection did not occur. Colony mortality was 20 % under the homeopathic treatment, differing statistically from the 80 % value produced by the standard treatment. Thus, the homeopathic treatment is not demonstrated to be efficient at controlling leaf-cutting ants, suggesting new studies with different methodologies. </p...|$|E

The evaluations {{were conducted in}} two areas of Texas with high-density populations of Formosan termites (Galveston/La Porte area and Beaumont area), utilizing five structures {{for each of the}} termite baiting systems in each area, for a total of thirty structures. All structures qualified for the study with active infestations of Formosan subterranean termites. Results of the evaluation reveal mean numbers of days for first feeding on monitors, in monitored systems, or active-ingredient bait tubes in non-monitored systems, with an extremely wide range. Two of the three baiting systems also had study sites without any termite activity in the bait stations {{for an extended period of}} time. There was no discernible pattern of control with either of the sulfluramid-baiting systems; termite management relied on spot treatments with liquid termiticides. Efficacy results utilizing hexaflumuron were significantly different between the two test sites. In the La Porte area, 100 % control was achieved with the baiting system, without a termiticide spot treat-ment, and has continued to exhibit control for an extended period of time. An aggressively active manage-ment program involving the utilization of multiple supplementary in-ground bait stations, above-ground bait stations, and biweekly monitoring contrasts sharply with the management program and reduced effi-cacy results in the Beaumont area.

40|$|Objective: To {{reveal the}} {{environmental}} risk of pesticide prescribed in a border region between the Amazon and Platinum Basins, {{at the turn}} of the 21 st century. Methods: The study used data of agronomic prescriptions for pesticides issued in the biennium of 1999 - 2000 in 24 cities located in a border region between the Amazon and Platinum Basins, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Results: The most widely used pesticides in the study region are class II (very dangerous) and III (dangerous) in number of prescriptions (N = 2, 828, 86. 8 %) andquantity prescribed (N = 344, 765, 90. 4 %). Among class III pesticides, a strong inversion was observed in the number of prescriptions (N = 1, 274; 39. 1 %) and quantity prescribed (N = 237, 319; 62. 2 %), indicating a lower number of prescriptions, but with higher amountprescribed. The proportion of prescriptions for products amid the various classes of Potential of Environmental Dangers (PPA ranking model, apllied in Brazil) changed over the two years (c 2 = 20, 814; DF= 3; p < 0, 01). The 10 most prescribed products (11 activecompounds) were: glyphosate, 2, 4 -D, <b>sulfluramid,</b> chlorimuron ethyl, fipronil, diuron, paraquat, methamidophos, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos and lambda-cyhalothrin, and seven of them were ranked as PPA class I or II.

However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts {{for the vast majority of}} national emission. About 80 – 90 % of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including <b>sulfluramid.</b> For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage was estimated to contribute about 50 % of PFOS and 40 % of PFOA while the remainder was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions...|$|E

Para tanto, foram instalados experimentos na Fazenda Dois Irmaos, de propriedade da empresa Florestal Rio Marombas Ltda, em areas de plantios de Pinus taeda L., localizados no municipio de Sao Cristovao do Sul - SC. Foram encontrados 17 formigueiros de Acromyrmex crassispinus (Forel, 1909) dentro da area de estudo (18 ha) com area aparente menor que 1 m 2 cada, a media geral foi de 0, 94 formigueiros por hectare. O maior consumo de iscas granuladas distribuidas a granel e na forma de micro-portaiscas foi constatada na primavera.

Abstract: Control {{programs}} for leaf-cutting ants {{of the genus}} Acromyrmex in southern Brazil are poorly reasoned, and your information grounded {{in control of the}} genus Atta and damage in Eucalyptus spp. This lack of information about the controls leaf-cutting ants takes some forest companies of Santa Catarina, the repetition of patterns that are not appropriate to the species and infestations of leaf-cutting ants that occur in this state. The results of these changes are: use of excessive doses of granulated baits and lures maldistribution of the four seasons. Among the consequences of these actions, the deterioration of the baits due to constant rainfall occurring in the region. Given this context, the experiments of this study aimed to: identify species and determine the density of nests of leaf-cutting ants in the experimental areas; analyze the consumption of ant bait with <b>sulfluramid</b> (0. 3 %), distributed in bulk or bait holder; analyze the influence of rainfall on the degradation of granulated baits with <b>sulfluramid</b> (0. 3 %), distributed in the field and in the bulk form of bait holder. Therefore, experiments were conducted in Dois Irmaos Farm, owned by Florestal Rio Marombas company in areas of Pinus taeda L., located in the municipality of Sao Cristovao do Sul - SC. We found 17 nests of Acromyrmex crassispinus (Forel, 1909) within the study area (18 ha) with apparent area less than 1 m 2 each, the overall average was 0. 94 nests per hectare. The higher consumption of granulated baits distributed in bulk and in the form of bait holder was found in the spring. The granulated baits were distributed in bulk consumed an average of three days after the distribution of treatments in spring and summer. The bait holder found and loaded by the ants three days after delivery in the spring and about seven days after the distribution in summer and remained within 30 days stored in the field. It was concluded that moisture in the plateau region south of Santa Catarina directly affected granulated baits distributed in bulk, deteriorating rapidly this form of distribution of baits and the bait holder showed greater resistance to moisture than the baits distributed in bulk.
