The inverted <b>siphon</b> is thin-walled concrete structure, and cracks will appear according to temperature loads.

Static analysis of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure is the foundation of design and construction, includes the calculation and analysis of stress and strain of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure. The stress and strain of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure not only are the index of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure rigidity, but also are the basis of identifying whether the inverted <b>siphon</b> structural damage occur.

The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E

50|$|A <b>siphon</b> {{spillway}} in a dam {{is usually}} not technically a <b>siphon</b> as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels. However, a <b>siphon</b> spillway operates as an actual <b>siphon</b> if it raises the flow higher than {{the surface of the}} source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation. In operation, a <b>siphon</b> spillway is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'. A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a <b>siphon</b> flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet.

5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents.

It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, <b>siphons,</b> and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the <b>siphons</b> are located.

40|$|AbstractAscidians have {{powerful}} capacities for regeneration but {{the underlying}} mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examine oral <b>siphon</b> regeneration in the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Following amputation, the oral <b>siphon</b> rapidly reforms oral pigment organs (OPO) at its distal margin prior to slower regeneration of proximal <b>siphon</b> parts. The early stages of oral <b>siphon</b> reformation include cell proliferation and re-growth of the <b>siphon</b> nerves, although the neural complex (adult brain and associated organs) is not required for regeneration. Young animals reform OPO more rapidly after amputation than old animals indicating that regeneration is age dependent. UV irradiation, microcautery, and cultured <b>siphon</b> explant experiments indicate that OPOs are replaced as independent units based on local differentiation of progenitor cells within the <b>siphon,</b> rather than by cell migration from a distant source in the body. The typical pattern of eight OPOs and <b>siphon</b> lobes is restored with fidelity after distal amputation of the oral <b>siphon,</b> but as many as 16 OPOs and lobes can be reformed following proximal amputation near the <b>siphon</b> base. Thus, the pattern of OPO regeneration is determined by cues positioned along the proximal distal axis of the oral <b>siphon.</b> A model is presented in which columns of <b>siphon</b> tissue along the proximal–distal axis below pre-existing OPO are responsible for reproducing the normal OPO pattern during regeneration. This study reveals previously unknown principles of oral <b>siphon</b> and OPO regeneration that will be important for developing Ciona as a regeneration model in urochordates, {{which may be the}} closest living relatives of vertebrates...|$|R

5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long <b>siphons</b> may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable <b>siphons</b> reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam <b>siphons,</b> which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the central}} goals of {{neuroscience}} research is to determine how networks of neurons control and modify behavior. One {{of the most influential}} model systems for this kind of analysis is the <b>siphon</b> and gill withdrawal reflex of the marine mollusc A. californica. In response to tactile stimulation, the <b>siphon</b> displays 3 different responses: (1) a posterior pointing and leveling (flaring) of the <b>siphon</b> in response to tail stimulation (the <b>siphon</b> T response), (2) constriction and anterior pointing to head stimulation (the <b>siphon</b> H response) and (3) constriction and withdrawal between the animal 2 ̆ 7 s parapodia (the <b>siphon</b> S response). The <b>siphon</b> S response is pseudoconditioned by a noxious tail stimulus to resemble the <b>siphon</b> T response. Behavioral and combined behavioral/intracellular studies were conducted to determine the motor neuronal control of these behaviors and to search for mechanisms of <b>siphon</b> response transformation following pseudoconditioning. The present studies have found that the flaring component of pseudoconditioned <b>siphon</b> S responses occurs during mantle pumping (MP) triggered by noxious tail stimulation. <b>Siphon</b> stimulation also triggers MP, as recorded in neurons of the Interneuron II pattern generator which commands MP. The 4 LFSB <b>siphon</b> motor neurons (SMNs) were found necessary and sufficient for the <b>siphon</b> T response, while SMNs RD S and LDS 1 were found necessary and sufficient for the <b>siphon</b> H response. Following pseudoconditioning, there is {{an increase in the number}} of evoked spikes to the test stimulus for the LFSB cells and a decreased number for RD S. <b>Siphon</b> flaring occurring during the pseudoconditioned response correlates with increased LFSB activity during triggered MP cycles. This suggests that psuedoconditioning is in part due to reconfiguration of the motor outputs of the Interneuron II network. These results suggest that these defensive responses are controlled and patterned by a well-defined, finite set of motor neurons and interneurons (Interneuron II) that are dedicated to specific behavioral functions, but also have parallel distributed properties. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the <b>siphons,</b> but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their <b>siphons</b> to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

5|$|The French {{pharmacologist}} Raphaël Dubois {{carried out}} work on bioluminescence {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He studied click beetles (Pyrophorus) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas dactylus. He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus, and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme. He sent Harvey <b>siphons</b> from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act on it is to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next thirty years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura {{to be the first to}} obtain crystalline luciferin. He used the sea firefly Vargula hilgendorfii, but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical's structure and was able to publish his 1957 paper Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin. More recently, Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y.

5|$|The {{capital city}} was {{completely}} {{dependent on the}} water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians {{a picture of the}} prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and <b>siphons</b> to transport water through pipelines. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.|$|E
5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary <b>siphons</b> could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E
