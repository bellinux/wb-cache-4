To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{graduated}} from the Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead.

The Navy <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941.

In summer 1732, Zieten was given four weeks of arrest for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign.

5|$|Crawford enjoyed foreign travel. In 1928 the OS <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East {{to collect}} aerial {{photographs}} {{that had been}} produced during the First World War and which were stored at Baghdad, Amman, and Heliopolis. In mid-1931 he visited Germany and Austria, furthering his interest in photography through {{the purchase of a}} Voigtländer. He later visited Italy with the intent of examining the possibility of producing OS maps pinpointing the country's archaeological sites; in November 1932 he met with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, who was interested in Crawford's ideas about creating an OS map of archaeological sites in Rome. This was part of a wider project to produce a series of maps covering the entirety of the Roman Empire, for which Crawford visited various parts of Europe during the late 1920s and 1930s. Holiday destinations included Germany, Austria, Romania, Corsica, Malta, Algeria, and Tunisia, and in 1936 he purchased a plot of land in Cyprus on which he had a house built. During these vacations, he visited archaeological sites and met with local archaeologists, encouraging them to contribute articles to Antiquity.|$|E
