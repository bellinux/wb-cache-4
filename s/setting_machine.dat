In 1978 the paper's publisher Wilfred Edmunds Ltd became the first English acquisition of Falkirk-based publishers F. Johnston & Co, which later became Johnston Press.|$|E

50|$|The {{union was}} founded in late 1872 as a New Model Union and was {{initially}} based in Manchester. Other branches were formed in Cleckheaton, Halifax, Haughton Dale and Rochdale, and they initially had {{a high level of}} autonomy; those in Lancashire covered the cotton industry, while those in Yorkshire were primarily in the woolen industry. At this point, the union was also known as the Wire Card <b>Setting</b> <b>Machine</b> Tenters' Society.|$|E
50|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of a dishwasher is calculated {{according to the}} number of place settings. For the most common size of appliance, the 12 place <b>setting</b> <b>machine</b> the following classes apply up to 2010. After 2010, a new system is used, based on an {{energy efficiency}} index (EEI), which is based on the annual power usage, based on stand-by power consumption and 280 cleaning cycles, relative to the standard power usage for that type of dishwasher. For a 12-place-setting dishwasher, an EEI of 100 corresponds to 462 kWh per year.|$|E

50|$|The {{unprocessed}} yarn {{is provided}} on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At {{a speed of}} up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a “figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).The heat setting process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After heat setting, the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a heat <b>setting</b> <b>machine</b> consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{range control}} was {{connected}} to a potentiometer and measured range electronically. The elevation and azimuth was measured via the physical position of the antenna. Turning the handwheels at these positions drove the rotor assembly through selsyn motors, and the current position was fed back to the operator display using magslips, better known today as synchros. The output of the magslips was also amplified and sent to external connectors, {{where they could be}} used to create additional displays at remote locations. These were placed in front of the operators of the gunnery analog computers, known as predictors, who would feed these numbers into the computer. The output of the computer was similarly fed to another set of magslip indicators placed in front of the gunners. The gunners then rotated the gun until their indicators lined up with those from the predictor, a technique known as laying needle on needle. The range was used for fuse timing, which was set automatically in a fuse <b>setting</b> <b>machine</b> driven directly off another magslip. In some cases the output of the radar drove the inputs of the predictors directly, and in others the outputs drove the gun laying directly, making the process highly automated.|$|E
5000|$|No {{original}} copies exist from 1904 to 1911 {{except for}} the ‘brown paper’ issue, dated May 6, 1905. That week the supply of newsprint did not arrive on the boat which came up the Proserpine River from Mackay. The Guardian went out just the same but printed on brown paper, the rolls of which probably came from a local (Jupp’s) store. Proserpine museum holds two copies of this paper, {{as well as a}} framed copy which is on display at the museum. Proserpine Museum also has photocopies of 1911 and 1912 editions of the Guardian and one issue from December, 1913. There are none from the war years, 1914 to 1918. The next copies are from 1919 and follow on until 1926. There are also copies from 1928, but none from 1927 or 1929. [...] In the early days of printing, sheets of newspaper were fed by hand and the press was driven by a petrol engine. Robert Scott, previously editor of Ravenswood Mining Journal, bought out the Proserpine Guardian in 1910, taking over in 1911 when he moved his Wharfdale Printing Press and his premises to Proserpine in Duncan Buchanan’s bullock-drawn wagon, setting up in Proserpine’s Main Street. Robert Scott died in 1915 and his widow, Angelina, along with their sons, took over the business. Son Alan installed the first linotype <b>setting</b> <b>machine</b> in 1928. A new concrete premise opened on the same site in 1937. In July of 1945, Major Alan Spence, an experienced printer, with his wife [...] "Dorothy, purchased the business. Major Spence was the holder of a Distinguished Service Order for his part in ‘Sparrow Force’ in Timor, defending the airfield against the Japanese. In the 1950’s a new automatic printer, a Thompson Platen, was purchased. In 1960 Spences sold to Mary and Bernie Lewis and Stan and Maureen Busuttin. [...] Not long after this change of owners a new Model 14 linotype machine was delivered. It was replaced in 1976 by computers and, in the 1990’s, the Model 14 was donated to Proserpine Museum where it remains a central exhibit. Bernie and Mary Lewis’s son Peter and his wife, Cynthia, took full control of the business in 1972 and in 1974 moved the printery to a much larger premises at 16 Chapman Street in Proserpine. [...] The Guardian was the first country newspaper north of Brisbane to introduce the cold-type method of typesetting and printing. In later years the master copy was taken to Bowen, a distance of some sixty-five kilometres, rolled off the press at the Bowen Independent, and delivered back to Proserpine late at night before the day of the paper’s sale. The Lewis family, however, continued to print brochures and flyers on a three unit wet off-set printing press, purchased in 1989. Ultimately the paper’s title was changed to Whitsunday Coast Guardian. [...] Mary Lewis died in July of 2010 and Bernie Lewis followed on April 6, 2011, aged 93 years, two days after compiling his last editorial. In September of 2014 the Whitsunday Coast Guardian, after being privately owned for 110 years and being {{one of the few remaining}} like businesses, was sold by Cynthia and Peter Lewis to ADHOC, APN Australian [...] "Regional News. This company still widely covers the local Proserpine and district news. The new premises are back in Main Street, in Proserpine Canegrower’s Executive building.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Content sharing is {{a popular}} use of {{peer-to-peer}} systems because of their inherent scalability and low cost of maintenance. In this paper, we leverage this nature of peer-topeer systems to tackle a new problem: automatic misconfiguration troubleshooting. In this <b>setting,</b> <b>machine</b> configurations from peers are shared to diagnose misconfigurations on a sick machine. The key challenges are preserving privacy of individual configuration data and ensuring the integrity of peer contributions. To this end, we construct the Friends Troubleshooting Network (FTN), a peer-to-peer overlay network, where the links between peer machines reflect the friendship of their owners.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} zonal saw {{deformation}} on its elastic plastic properties is presented. Experiments were carried out using a special vibrating stand. A hand-operated saw-tooth <b>setting</b> <b>machine</b> was used to form the saw path by selecting the following three values for bending teeth ζ: 0. 4 mm (0. 2 mm to one side), 0. 6 mm (0. 3 mm to one side) and 0. 8 mm (0. 4 mm to one side). For the research five circular crosscut saws with a diameter of 400 mm each were selected. During the tests saw tightening moment was 150 Nm and measurements were performed {{within the range of}} 20 Hz – 2000 Hz. The results include established coefficient of damping and dynamic Young`s modulus for all zones of the saws. It was determined that zonal deformation has {{a significant impact on the}} distribution of elastic-plastic properties within the saw plane. It was found that by bending saw teeth from 0 mm up to 0. 4 mm in one of the saw plane zones, the average coefficient of damping increases by 5. 57 times with the distance changing from flanges to the teeth zone, meanwhile the dynamic Young’s modulus decreases by approximately 25 % in each case. By forming the saw path and obtaining a higher value of the coefficient of damping, the circular saw can operate in a more stable manner...|$|E
