40|$|The {{procedure}} is as follows: (1) Firmly bar clamp the box together in all directions. When all directions have been secured, tack weld each outside seam {{of the box}} in 4 or 5 places along it's length. Remove clamps and proceed to weld all outside seams. Care should be taken that the maximum weld cross section does not exceed 1 / 16 -inch x 1 / 16 -inch. (2) To help stabilize the metal as it cools, we will install all slot plugs, (MC- 223665), and one side cover plate, (MD- 223637). Inside welds for this side plate will be made thru the opposite <b>side</b> <b>flange.</b> Weld cross sections should be held to a 1 / 16 -inch maximum depth and width. (3) Weld {{the inside of the}} end plates, (MD- 224535), using the weld relief as filler material. After the box has cooled, weld the top plate (ME- 2244533) to the <b>side</b> <b>flange,</b> (ME- 224536) and then to the bottom plate (ME- 223534). (4) Repeat this procedure for the opposite side. (5) Helium leak check the welds, inside and out, by plugging the slot pumpout holes and pumping on the pumpout line. Remember that the clearances are very tight in the space that is to be pumpted. Allow plenty of time for a good pumpdown and leak check. Leak detection should be on the most sensitive scale on a helium leak detector with a minimum sensitivity of 10 - 9 ATM CC/SEC.

This fixed the problem of the original bottom plates and became standard for all M1917 and M1919 series machine guns. While the US Arsenal at Rock Island was the leader in converting the existing stocks of M1917 series guns over to 1917A1 configuration, other arsenals took part. In addition, the rear sights were updated for the new ammunition and the new sights did away with the World War I multiple aperture disk on the rear sight. The top covers also had a stronger feed pawl pivot arm installed, so the gun could handle the stress of pulling an ammunition belt the distance from the ground. Rock Island Arsenal also {{developed a}}n all-steel water jacket that went into production around 1943; this was stronger than the earlier brass capped jackets. These steel components were interchangeable with the earlier brass ones to allow for repair of worn or damaged water jacket components.|$|R

40|$|A droplet {{detection}} method {{has been developed}} to measure the distribution of droplet sizes on a flat plate under dropwise condensation. Dropwise condensation heat transfer may be modeled by combining an expression for the single droplet heat transfer rate with the droplet size distribution. The ability to measure this distribution is integral to the validation of such models. An example study is undertaken in which heat flux is obtained for a given surface treatment by implementing such a model and measuring the droplet size distribution. These results are compared with the heat flux measured by internal coolant temperature monitoring for external condensation on a tube featuring the same surface treatment. The plate condensing heat exchanger is a modular design for condensate visualization. The core of the design is a four way pipe cross with open flanges on each end. Flange caps are designed to accomplish the goal of condensate visualization, and are easily exchangeable depending on design intent. The sample <b>side</b> <b>flange</b> features a conductive contact between an external cold plate and internally mounted sample. A viewing flange opposite the sample <b>side</b> <b>flange</b> allows for lighting and capture of video data of the condensation process. A third flange features an internal, concentric boiler for steam generation. A vacuum pump valve and ambient temperature and pressure sensors are fitted to the fourth flange cap. Dropwise condensation models are explored in this setup by detection of droplets in the captured video data. Droplet detection is performed by a Circle Hough Transform that has been modified to handle the order of magnitude differences in droplet radii within the same image. The Circle Hough Transform is applied to detect a radius range corresponding to the largest droplets, then the next largest droplets, and so on until the smallest detectable droplets have been marked. Detections in any given stage of the modified Circle Hough Transform are used to mask the detection region for the next stage. This reduces detection noise emanating from larger droplets that would otherwise overwhelm detections of smaller droplets. Another technique used in reducing detection noise involves illumination leveling, morphological erosion, and morphological reconstruction of the video data. The combination of these methods yield measurements of the droplet size distribution suitable for heat transfer analysis. The droplet size distribution is dependent upon a balance between droplet growth and sweeping of condensate, which is observable by analyzing the distribution in each frame of the video data. While the distribution is constant for very large condensing surfaces, the local droplet size distribution varies as droplets nucleate, grow, coalesce, and are swept away by departing droplets. This apparatus and {{detection method}} {{make it possible to}} observe time dependent growth and sweeping mechanisms as well as the droplet size distribution that emerges from these mechanisms. This study demonstrates the utility of the apparatus and detection method for the validation of dropwise condensation heat transfer models...|$|E

Background: Tooth erosion {{is a problem for}} professional wine tasters (exogenous erosion from frequent exposure to wine acids) and for people with gastro oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and bulimia who experience frequent reflux of gastric contents into the mouth (endogenous erosion from mainly HCl). The objective in {{this study was to determine}} whether plaque/pellicle could provide teeth with any protection from two common erosive acids, using an in vivo-in vitro technique. Methods: Tiles of human tooth enamel and root surfaces were prepared from six extracted, unerupted third molar teeth and sterilized. Mandibular stents were prepared for six volunteer subjects and the tiles bonded to the buccal flanges of these stents. They were worn initially for three days to permit a layer of pellicle and plaque to form over the tile surfaces, and for a further 10 days of experimentation. Following cleaning of the plaque/ pellicle layer from the tiles on the right <b>side</b> <b>flange,</b> all the tiles were submerged in either 0. 06 M HCl or white wine for an accumulated time of 600 and 1500 minutes, respectively. Depths of erosion were determined using light microscopy of sections of the enamel and root tiles. SEM of the lesion surfaces was carried out to investigate the nature of erosive damage and of plaque/pellicle remnants. Results: Retained plaque was found to significantly inhibit dental erosion on enamel, from contact with both HCl and wine, compared with that resulting following its removal. However, it was found to provide no significant protection on root surfaces. SEM analysis of the tile surfaces revealed marked etching of enamel on the cleaned surfaces, and considerable alteration to the appearance of remaining plaque and pellicle on most surfaces. Conclusion: Within the limitations of numbers of specimens, dental plaque/pellicle provided a significant level of protection to tooth enamel against dental erosion from simulated gastric acids and from white wine, using an in vivo-in vitro model. It was unable to provide any significant protection to root surfaces from these erosive agents. Possible reasons for this difference are explored. A Cheung, Z Zid, D Hunt and J McIntyr...|$|E

50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast <b>side</b> <b>flanges</b> of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies.

A resilient hub is carried centrally of the base engaging and biasing a back <b>side</b> of the <b>flanges</b> maintaining tightly clamped and facilitating use on vertical as well as horizontal members. The base turns about the hub to receive the flanges within the clamping members. Equipment may be secured to the base by any suitable means such as bolts in openings. Slidable gate latches secure the hinged locks in an upright locking position. The resilient hub includes a recess opening formed in the base and a rubber-like pad carried in this opening being depressably and rotatably carried therein...|$|R
40|$|SpaceClaim/TD Direct {{has been}} used {{extensively}} {{in the development of}} the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) thermal model. This paper outlines the workflow for that aspect of the task and includes proposed best practices and lessons learned. The ASRG thermal model was developed to predict component temperatures and power output and to provide insight into the prime contractors thermal modeling efforts. The insulation blocks, heat collectors, and cold <b>side</b> adapter <b>flanges</b> (CSAFs) were modeled with this approach. The model was constructed using mostly TD finite difference (FD) surfaces solids. However, some complex geometry could not be reproduced with TD primitives while maintaining the desired degree of geometric fidelity. Using SpaceClaim permitted the import of original CAD files and enabled the defeaturing repair of those geometries. TD Direct (a SpaceClaim add-on from CRTech) adds features that allowed the mark-up of that geometry. These so-called mark-ups control how finite element (FE) meshes were generated and allowed the tagging of features (e. g. edges, solids, surfaces). These tags represent parameters that include: submodels, material properties, material orienters, optical properties, and radiation analysis groups. TD aliases were used for most tags to allow analysis to be performed with a variety of parameter values. Domain-tags were also attached to individual and groups of surfaces and solids to allow them to be used later within TD to populate objects like, for example, heaters and contactors. These tools allow the user to make changes to the geometry in SpaceClaim and then easily synchronize the mesh in TD without having to redefine these objects each time as one would if using TD Mesher. The use of SpaceClaim/TD Direct has helped simplify the process for importing existing geometries and in the creation of high fidelity FE meshes to represent complex parts. It has also saved time and effort in the subsequent analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During forming of non-rotationally {{symmetric}} {{sheet metal}} parts at high pressures non-uniform deformation conditions arise in the flange area. These deformations vary in height and consequently lead to heterogeneous sheet thickness distributions. When using semi-rigid tools, high clamping forces are {{necessary in order to}} compensate for the developing sheet thickness variations in the flange area and to avoid leakages of the system or wrinkling. Moreover, the heterogeneous distribution of the clamping force is strengthened by press inaccuracies. This results in a higher surface pressure distribution on one <b>side</b> of the <b>flange</b> and finally in a non-uniform material flow out of the flange area. The development of a segmented active-elastic blank holder enables an active material flow control of the flange movement during sheet metal forming at high pressures. The local elasticity of the active-elastic blank holder is based on an optimized layout of the local tool rigidity. For this purpose, different grooves were integrated below the blank holder surface. This paper provides an overview of the developed technology, advantages with regard to the part’s quality, and recent results comparing the production of non-rotationally symmetric parts with segmented active-elastic tools vs. semi-rigid tools...|$|R
