50|$|Coastal sage scrub, {{also known}} as coastal scrub, CSS, or <b>soft</b> <b>chaparral,</b> is a low {{scrubland}} plant community of the California coastal sage and chaparral subecoregion, found in coastal California and northwestern coastal Baja California. It is within the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.|$|E
50|$|San Bernardino {{kangaroo}} rats inhabit {{places with}} sandy loam substrates, characteristic of alluvial fans and flood plains, {{where they are}} able to dig small, simple burrows. Plant life in such areas is typically dominated by chaparral and coastal sage scrub (<b>soft</b> <b>chaparral).</b> These alluvial scrub habitats can be classified as pioneer, intermediate, and mature, in order of decreased frequency of flooding and increased density of plants. Of these subsections of this particular habitat, D. m. parvus is most populous in intermediate alluvial scrub.|$|E
50|$|Shrubland: Shrublands are dense {{thickets}} of evergreen sclerophyll {{shrubs and}} small trees. They are most common near the seacoast, {{and are often}} adapted to wind and salt air from the ocean. They are called chaparral (California and southern Portugal), matorral in Chile and southern Spain, garrigue or maquis in France, macchia or gariga in Italy, phrygana in Greece, tomillares in Spain, fynbos and strandveld in South Africa, kwongan in Southwest Australia and batha in Israel. Northern coastal scrub and coastal sage scrub, also known as <b>soft</b> <b>chaparral,</b> occur near the California coast. In some places shrublands are of the mature vegetation type, and in other places {{are the result of}} degradation of former forest or woodland by logging or overgrazing, or disturbance by major fires.|$|E
40|$|Hyperspectral image {{processing}} is a promising {{tool for the}} analysis of vegetation in remote sensing imagery, particularly in areas with low vegetation cover. The detection of photosynthetically active vegetation dynamics is essential for many environmental studies. Nonetheless, remote sensing of vegetation dynamics in the absence of land cover change is much more challenging than standard land cover analysis. A variety of multispectral vegetation indices have been adapted to hyperspectral images in order to detect these changes. However none of these indices make full use of the continuous spectra acquired from hyperspectral sensors and are limited in the detection of low vegetation cover because of varying background signals. The derivative-based green vegetation index (DGVI) proposed by Chen and Elvidge (1998), the Water Band Index (WBI) and the NDVI were used to highlight changes in green vegetation cover in bitemporal Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) Images from the Santa Monica Mountains (California) and compared with one another. The DGVI makes use of the sharp transition from the Chlorophyll absorption in the red to the high reflectance in the near-infrared. It minimizes the background effects and is insensitive to illumination changes. The WBI proposed by PenÌƒulas et al. (1997) was used as an alternate indicator of green vegetation. The results were compared with the NDVI. Ground truth data were also obtained from low altitude aerial photos in order to test the accuracy of these methods and to calculate percent green vegetation cover. Distinct seasonal vegetation dynamics were found in the chaparral communities of the Santa Monica Mountains. The difference images show high changes in urban areas, the <b>soft</b> <b>chaparral</b> and the burned site. In multitemporal comparison the DGVI und WI performs much better than the NDVI. The highest overall accuracy was obtained by the DGVI. But unexpectedly DGVI fails in shadow-affected areas...|$|E
