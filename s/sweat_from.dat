25|$|A {{study from}} 2013 {{provided}} brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> donors extracted it, pooled it and {{presented it to}} 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since {{no significant differences were}} found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.|$|E

25|$|Before 1898, {{devotion to}} the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem {{encountered}} Jesus along the Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When she paused to wipe the <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> Jesus's face with her veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.|$|E
500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith <b>Sweat</b> <b>from</b> the 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|A German {{study from}} 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> {{a dozen people}} was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily {{distinguish}} exercise-induced <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> room air, three could also distinguish exercise-induced <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> anxiety induced sweat. The acoustic startle reflex response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by electromyograph analysis of the orbital muscle, {{which is responsible for}} the eyeblink component. This showed {{for the first time that}} fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient's [...] "defensive behavior" [...] prior to the subjects' conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.|$|E

In play these were found to slip, and Willis removed his. Eventually Lever also removed his and lay the gauze on the ground near the stumps where it was noticed by the umpires and Indian team, but not before he had used <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> his forehead to shine the ball.|$|E

2500|$|A {{fingerprint}} in {{its narrow}} sense is an impression {{left by the}} friction ridges of a human finger. The recovery of fingerprints from a crime scene is an important method of forensic science. Fingerprints are easily deposited on suitable surfaces (such as glass or metal or polished stone) by the natural secretions of <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> the eccrine glands that are present in epidermal ridges. These are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Chanced Impressions".|$|E
2500|$|FBI latent-print {{examiner}} Elizabeth Fontaine {{testified that}} adhesive {{in the shape}} of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains during ultraviolet testing. Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, [...] "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination." [...] During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, [...] "It was no longer visible." [...] She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions vary as to French's {{military}} abilities. Edward Spears, then a subaltern liaising between French and Lanrezac, {{later wrote}} of the former: [...] "You only {{had to look at}} him to see that he was a brave, determined man ... I learnt to love and to admire the man who never lost his head, and on whom danger had the effect it has on the wild boar: he would become morose, furious for a time, harsh, but he would face up and never shirk. He knew only one way of dealing with a difficulty, and that was to tackle it ... If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist." [...] Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet with <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> riding hard to reach the meeting, was [...] "one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ". This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.|$|E

50|$|The term 'compensatory' {{is largely}} misleading, as it {{indicates}} {{that there is a}} compensatory mechanism that takes effect after sympathectomy, in which the body 'redirects' the <b>sweating</b> <b>from</b> the palms or face to other areas of the body.

Reflex sweating will not happen if hand sweating can be stopped without interrupting sympathetic tone to the human brain.|$|R
