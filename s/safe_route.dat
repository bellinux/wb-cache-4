S. has tripled from approximately five to 16 percent of the population. Simultaneously, fewer and fewer children have been walking and cycling to school. Children—especially those aged 10 to 15 years—have {{some of the highest}} per capita traffic-related bicycle fatality and injury rates. While bicycle organizations, states and communities across the country have developed a variety of education programs independently and cooperatively with the National <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School program, {{there is a lack of}} evaluation of the impact on bicycle safety, of different programs in different contexts, and of whether educational interventions reduce the risk of crashes and injuries. This study evaluated the effectiveness of <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School programs with in-school bicycle education at reducing the crash rate and improving the safety of children and youth cyclists. The causal-comparative research design utilized bicycle mode share data collected from the National Center for <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School for five existing programs—Boulder Valley School District <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School, Eugene-Springfield <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School, <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> Philly, Portland <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School, and Marin County <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School—and crash data before and after program implementation for those respective communities. The crash assessment revealed a decreasing trend in crashes involving children and youth cyclists around treatment schools in the Eugene, OR and Philadelphia, PA program study areas, and at the aggregate level across program areas; but, this trend was not statistically significant when compared to the change in crashes around control schools in a quasi-experimental analysis. Nevertheless, the increase in students cycling to and from school reported by all but one of the programs, and the increase in exposure to crash risk as a result, indicated that the <b>Safe</b> <b>Routes</b> to School programs did not cause a decrease in the safety of student cyclists. Additional rigorous evaluations are needed utilizing randomized controlled design to maximize the reliability of reported findings and to aid decisions about where to invest resources in community-based approaches to injury prevention for cyclists...|$|R

25|$|The Columbia River {{was reached}} on 22 March 1811, but its {{dangerous}} bar posed a major problem. Thorn sent five {{men in a}} boat to attempt to locate the channel, but the rough surf capsized the vessel and its crew was lost. Two days later another attempt by an additional small boat also sank. Of the five crew members, which included two Hawaiian Kanakas, only an American and a Hawaiian survived. In total eight men died attempting to find a <b>safe</b> <b>route</b> past the Columbia Bar. Finally, on March 24, the Tonquin crossed into the Columbia’s estuary and laid anchor in Baker’s Bay. The personnel then proceeded fifteen miles up the river to present-day Astoria, Oregon, where they spent two months laboring to establish Fort Astoria. Some trade goods and other materials that composed the cargo were transferred to the new trading post. During this work, small transactions with curious Chinookan Clatsop people occurred.|$|E

2500|$|In 321 BC the consuls Titus Veturius Calvinus and Spurius Postumius Albinus were encamped in Calatia (a Campanian town 10km {{southeast}} of Capua). Gaius Pontius, {{the commander of}} the Samnites, placed his army at the Caudine Forks and sent some soldiers disguised as shepherds grazing their flock towards Calatia. Their mission was to spread the misinformation that the Samnites were about to attack the city of Luceria in Apulia, which was an ally of Rome. The consuls decided to march to the aid of this city and to take the quicker (but less <b>safe)</b> <b>route</b> through the Caudine Forks. These were two narrow and wooded defiles on the Apennine Mountains with a plain between them. The passage from the first to the second defile was a narrow and difficult ravine. The Samnites blocked this with felled trees and boulders. When the Romans passed through, they also barraged the rear entry to the defile. The Romans were stuck and surrounded by the enemy and set up a fortified camp. Gaius Pontius sent a messenger to his father Herennius, a retired statesman, to ask for advice. His council was to free the Romans immediately. Gaius rejected this and Herenius’ second message was to kill them all. With these contradictory responses Gaius thought that his father had gone senile, but summoned him to the Forks. Herennius said that the first option would lead to peace and friendship with Rome and that with the second one, the loss of two armies would neutralise the Romans for a long time. When asked about a middle course of letting them go and imposing terms on Rome, he said that this [...] "neither wins men friends nor rids them of their enemies." [...] Shaming the Romans would lead them to seek revenge. Gaius decided to demand the Romans to surrender, [...] "evacuate the Samnite territory and withdraw their colonies." [...] The consuls {{had no choice but to}} surrender. The Roman soldiers came out of their camp unarmed, underwent the humiliation of passing under the yoke and suffered the mockery of the enemy. The yoke was a symbol of subjugation in which the defeated soldiers had to bow and pass under a yoke used for oxen in disgrace. According to Appian, Pontius used spears as a yoke: [...] "Pontius opened a passage from the defile, and having fixed two spears in the ground and laid another across the top, caused the Romans to go under it as they passed out, one by one." ...|$|E
