5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} <b>sloth</b> lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other <b>sloth</b> lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller <b>sloth</b> lemurs and the suspensory large <b>sloth</b> lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct <b>sloth</b> lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the <b>sloth</b> lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The <b>sloth</b> lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of <b>sloth</b> lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and <b>sloth</b> lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} <b>sloth</b> lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger <b>sloth</b> lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and <b>sloth</b> lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other <b>sloth</b> lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed <b>sloth,</b> which have just six, and the three-toed <b>sloth</b> which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|Mesopropithecus is a genus {{within the}} <b>sloth</b> lemur family (Palaeopropithecidae), which {{includes}} three other genera: Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Babakotia. This family in turn {{belongs to the}} infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.|$|E

25|$|However, their adaptations {{contradict}} the actual {{relationship of the}} two families, which are more distant from each other than their outward similarity suggests. The common ancestor of the two families lived around 35 Mya, making the living forms exceptional examples of convergent or parallel evolution. The modern two-toed <b>sloths</b> are far {{more closely related to}} the Megalonychidae ground <b>sloths</b> than to the living three-toed <b>sloths.</b> Whether the ground-dwelling Megalonychidae descended from tree-climbing ancestors or whether the two-toed <b>sloths</b> are really miniature ground <b>sloths</b> that have converted or reverted to arboreal life cannot be properly determined yet. The latter possibility seems slightly more likely, because the small ground <b>sloths</b> Acratocnus and Neocnus, which were also able to climb, are among the closer relatives of the two-toed <b>sloths,</b> and these together were related to the huge ground <b>sloths</b> Megalonyx and Megalocnus.|$|R

5|$|Babakotia radofilai is {{the sole}} member of the genus Babakotia and belongs to the family Palaeopropithecidae, which {{includes}} three other genera of <b>sloth</b> lemurs: Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus. This family in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Based on its size, the {{morphology}} of its molars, and microwear {{analysis on}} its teeth, Babakotia radofilai was likely a folivore, while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard seeds. In all <b>sloth</b> lemurs, including Babakotia radofilai, the permanent teeth erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles {{during the first}} dry season following weaning.|$|E
25|$|Those that {{argue in}} favor of the claim that humans are the direct cause of the ground sloths’ {{extinction}} point out that the few <b>sloths</b> that remain are small <b>sloths</b> that {{spend most of their time}} in trees, making it difficult for them to be spotted by humans. Although these <b>sloths</b> were sufficiently hidden, they still would have been affected by the climate changes that supposedly wiped out the ground <b>sloths.</b> Additionally, after the continental ground <b>sloths</b> disappeared, insular <b>sloths</b> of the Caribbean remained for approximately 6,000 years longer (these islands were not colonized by humans until about 5500 yr BP).|$|R
50|$|Diabolotherium is an extinct genus of <b>sloths,</b> {{known from}} the Late Pleistocene of Peru. Unlike most other extinct {{mainland}} <b>sloths,</b> {{it seems to have}} been a climber, similar to extinct <b>sloths</b> from the Caribbean.|$|R
25|$|The ground <b>sloths</b> do not {{constitute}} a monophyletic group. Rather, they make up a number of lineages, {{and as far as}} is known, until the Holocene, most <b>sloths</b> were in fact ground-dwellers. The famous Megatherium, for example, belonged to a lineage of ground <b>sloths</b> that was not very close to the living <b>sloths</b> and their ground-living relatives, like the small Neocnus or the massive Megalonyx. Meanwhile, Mylodon, among the last ground <b>sloths</b> to disappear, was only very distantly related to either of these.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed <b>sloth</b> and the extinct ground <b>sloth</b> Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that <b>sloth,</b> mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E
50|$|Extinct <b>sloths</b> {{are known}} from the three Greater Antilles of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico and several smaller Antillean islands, but they are missing from the fourth of the Greater Antilles, Jamaica. These {{are part of the}} family Megalonychidae, which also {{includes}} some of the extinct giant ground <b>sloths,</b> such as Megalonyx, and the living two-toed <b>sloths</b> (Choloepus) of the American mainland. All Greater Antillean <b>sloths</b> are now extinct; their extinction by ~4400 BP (uncalibrated radiocarbon date) apparently postdated the extinction of the mainland ground <b>sloths</b> by about six thousand years, and coincided (to within a thousand years) with the arrival of humans on the islands. The extinct Caribbean <b>sloths</b> apparently had a wide range of locomotor habits corresponding to varying degrees of arboreality, but were generally more terrestrial than extant tree <b>sloths.</b> They had been present on the Antilles since the early Oligocene, 32 million years ago. The subdivision of Antillean <b>sloths</b> into several subfamilies implies at least a diphyletic origin for them, requiring two or more separate colonization events.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sloths</b> have short, flat heads, big eyes, short snouts, stout bodies, long limbs, {{and tiny}} ears. Three-toed <b>sloths</b> also have stubby tails about 5-6 cm long. <b>Sloths</b> {{are about the}} size of small dogs, with the head and body having a {{combined}} length of 50 to 70cm. Almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, including those with very short necks, such as elephants and cetaceans, and those with very long necks, such as giraffes and camels. The few exceptions include manatees and two-toed <b>sloths,</b> which have only six cervical vertebrae, and three-toed <b>sloths</b> with nine cervical vertebrae.|$|R
50|$|Three-toed <b>sloths</b> are {{predominantly}} diurnal, although {{they can be}} active at any hour of the day, while two-toed <b>sloths</b> are nocturnal.|$|R
5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, <b>sloth</b> bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|Leopards {{are found}} in hilly areas but may also venture into the low land jungles. Small cats in the park include the jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. Other mammals include barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, <b>sloth</b> and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongoose, otters, yellow-throated martens, Himalayan goral, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus macaques. Owls and nightjars can be heard during the night.|$|E
5|$|Only the aye-aye, the extinct giant aye-aye, and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant <b>sloth</b> lemurs lack a {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|E
50|$|The {{mammalian}} order Pilosa, {{which includes}} the <b>sloths</b> and anteaters, includes various species from the Caribbean region. Many species of <b>sloths</b> are known from the Greater Antilles, all of which became extinct over the last millennia, but some <b>sloths</b> and anteaters survive on islands closer to the mainland.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{arthropods}} are associated with <b>sloths.</b> These include biting and blood-sucking flies such as mosquitoes and sandflies, triatomine bugs, lice, ticks and mites. The <b>sloth’s</b> fur forms a micro-ecozone inhabited by green algae and hundreds of insects. <b>Sloths</b> have a highly specific community of commensal beetles, mites and moths.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all of the}} Antillean <b>sloths,</b> Acratocnus is {{a member}} of the family Megalonychidae, whose sole {{surviving}} genus is Choloepus, representing the two-toed tree <b>sloths.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 2009 {{wildlife}} {{survey conducted}} by Government of Tamil Nadu enumerated 10 Bengal tigers, 866 Indian elephants, 672 gaurs, and 27 leopards. The survey party observed four additional species of horned antelope including 2,348 spotted deer, 1,068 blackbucks, 304 sambar deer, 77 barking deer and four-horned antelopes, 843 wild boars, 43 <b>sloth</b> bears and 15 striped hyenas. Herds of the famous feral buffaloes can also be spotted in places near the Moyar river.|$|E
5|$|The giant ground <b>sloth</b> Megatherium is {{from the}} Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America, where Charles Darwin had {{excavated}} some fossils in 1835. The model was built hugging a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model's arm. The arm was replaced and later the tree died. This model {{used to be in}} the children's zoo which has now been demolished.|$|E
5|$|With smaller prey, such as {{monkeys and}} hares, the tiger bites the nape, often {{breaking}} the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery. Though rarely observed, some tigers {{have been recorded}} to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of <b>sloth</b> bears.|$|E
50|$|Research in {{the area}} of Manaus, Brazil, on <b>sloths</b> and their {{associated}} arthropod fauna of <b>sloths,</b> reveals a diverse and dynamic community, with nine species of the coprophagous guild. Population strength for some species shows large fluctuations while for others, populations show stability. The diversity of coprophagous arthropods associated with <b>sloths</b> suggests intense competition among their larval, dung-feeding stages.|$|R
50|$|Glyptodon {{is part of}} the {{superorder}} of placental mammals {{known as}} Xenarthra. This clade of mammals also includes anteaters, tree <b>sloths,</b> armadillos, and extinct ground <b>sloths</b> and pampatheres.|$|R
