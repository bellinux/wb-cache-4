A study in 1997 (bund the species in 3 of the 5 historic streams, but one stream yielded only a single individual. This study sought to reassess the status of the 5 historically known populations and sample additional spring-run habitats in the Arkansas River basin in these 2 counties. Spring branch habitats were identified using USGS topographic maps and available GIS coverages. Surveys targeting E. cragini were conducted at 75 <b>sites</b> providing <b>abroad</b> coverage of the basin and including intense searches in the vicinity of historic sites.

40|$|Abstract. Small {{and medium}} size {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{play a critical}} role today in Asian regional production. However, their long-term viability depends on innovation drawing on local as well as global knowledge flows. In this paper, I ask whether firms moving to new production <b>sites</b> <b>abroad</b> have penetrated new spaces of information and knowledge. Japanese and Korean SMEs manufacturing abroad retain a static com-parative advantage in sub-contracting for larger home country firms where accumulated knowledge is sufficient today for cost efficient pro-duction. They remain tied largely to knowledge hierarchies at home dominated by larger firms. Weak ties to the local business context abroad, however, deprive them of new learning advantages critical for flexible specialization. Lacking entrée to the learning environment of their offshore production sites, Asian SMEs often remain offshore factories rather than international firms participating in global learning environments. They find themselves in new geographical places but old cognitive spaces, confined to static rather than dynamic comparative advantage. Key words. Asian small and medium size enterprises; flex-ible specialization; globalization; information; knowledge flows; place; regional productions systems; space Even smaller firms today must compete at the nexus of a space of flows and a space of place to effectively bridge the global and the local.

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} nature and {{regulation}} of the international practices of large commercial law firms. The overseas work of City solicitors, German commercial lawyers and US corporate lawyers is examined; almost seventy interviews were undertaken with lawyers and regulators based within the jurisdictions of England and Wales and Germany. A wide variety of literature, ranging from the fields of globalisation and regulation to the sociology of the professions, contextualises the empirical research. It is argued that the processes of globalisation have intensified within {{the last quarter of}} this century. The heightened internationalisation of business has impacted upon the worlds of many professionals, including those of lawyers in large law firms. Many of the largest law firms are moving to more commercialised forms of practice, where entrepreneurship is highly valued. Indeed, {{one of the reasons why}} foreign offices are opened is to take advantage of "green-field" <b>sites</b> <b>abroad.</b> However, law firms' strategies do vary; the thesis aims to tease out some of the differences in the international practices of the law firms investigated. In so doing, it cautions against over-generalising when discussing the overseas strategies and experience of "mega-law firms". Nevertheless, international developments do test the limits of current regulation. Large law firms often operate beyond the regulatory concerns of professional associations yet several features of their practice are worrying. For instance, the tendency of commercial lawyers not to consider anything other than their clients' immediate interests (to act as "hired guns") calls into question the legitimacy of regulatory systems. The thesis proposes a programme of reform to address such concerns...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper assesses {{possible}} {{scenarios for}} Northern Europe for transportation of CO 2 in 2050 {{as part of}} a CCS infrastructure, giving focus on off-shore transportation. In addition, the possibility and costs for utilizing the solid Scandinavian bedrock for intermediate storage of CO 2 is preliminarily assessed. The preliminary results indicate that an underground storage unit of 50 000 m 3 or larger would have a significantly smaller investment cost than a similarly-sized steel tank storage complex. The cost for transporting CO 2 from Finland to final geological CO 2 storage <b>sites</b> <b>abroad</b> is higher compared to that from the coastal regions in countries around the North Sea. However, by joint transport infrastructure projects the industry and power production around the presented regions can reach significant cost reductions for CO 2 transport. The ship transport infrastructure benefits from a model where nearby capture plants are connected by pipelines to exporting terminal hubs. Trunklines towards geological storage sites are especially cost efficient in the CO 2 emission intensive regions close to the North Sea. The on-shore storage potential in western Latvia would also provide a promising opportunity for CO 2 trunklines from other Baltics and from Finland. In the heavily CO 2 emitting regions of northern Germany, the local on-shore storage accessed by trunklines from the surrounding areas would provide very competitive CO 2 transport infrastructure for the local industry and power production. The results indicate that shared CO 2 transportation infrastructure by ships would often be the best transport option from the Baltic Sea region to final storage sites at the North Sea. Especially the heavily industrialized regions on the shore of the Gulf of Finland can benefit from a shared transport infrastructur...|$|E

Through a qualitative research approach, a digital storytelling project was administered as an assessment tool over four summers in one study abroad program, and then expanded to three additional study abroad programs differing in locations and disciplines. The research questions explored ways in which digital storytelling not only influence the learning outcomes and experiences of students, but also touch on the building of students' personal identity. The study revealed digital storytelling to be a method conducive to demonstrating and assessing personal and academic learning outcomes through a dynamic, introspective, reflective and organic process that concluded with a digital artifact. Digital storytelling as a tool and process allowed students to become more engaged and to take ownership in their own learning while participating in a study abroad program. This study contributes much needed research related to digital storytelling as an assessment practice for measuring not only identity building, but particularly, as a method for assessing academic learning outcomes in summer faculty-led study-abroad programs...|$|R

NYU Abu Dhabi is led by Vice Chancellor Al Bloom, who took on the post in 2009 after 18 years as president of Swarthmore College. [...] NYU Abu Dhabi recruited an outstandingly strong first freshman class, which was notable for its selectivity (189 students were accepted out of 9,048 applicants worldwide (an acceptance rate of 2.1 percent), with a 79.4 percent yield), its geographic diversity (the class of 150 students will include students from 39 countries on six continents), and the academic qualifications of its students (at the classes’ 75th percentile, the SAT critical reading score was 770 (ranking it fifth among US universities) and the math score was 780 (ranking it sixth); the median SAT score (on the 1600 scale) was 1470). The recruitment of the class was reported on in an article in The New York Times on June 21, 2010. Newsweek magazine carried a Q+A with Sexton about the Abu Dhabi campus in August 2008. [...] In August 2009, Sexton discussed the emergence of NYU as a Global Network University in an interview on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition - Sunday with David Greene, as well as in two articles in Abu Dhabi’s English-language newspaper, The National (Abu Dhabi). [...] During Sexton’s presidency, the percentage of NYU students studying abroad has increased to over 40 percent, and the Institute of International Education recognized NYU as sending more students abroad than any other US university.
