50|$|The {{principles}} of British-style railway signalling have changed little since the Victorian era and early 20th century. Modern technology has generally reduced the labour required per train movement.

5000|$|The {{most common}} form of safety {{mechanism}} is a <b>switch,</b> <b>button</b> or lever that, when set to the [...] "safe" [...] position, prevents the firing of a firearm. Manual safeties are as varied as the designs of firearms themselves, but the two most common mechanisms are a block or latch that prevents the trigger and/or firing mechanism from moving, and a device that disconnects the trigger from the firing mechanism of the firearm. Other designs may block the hammer or striker from forward movement or act as a block to prevent them from contacting the firing pin. These are the oldest forms of [...] "active" [...] safety mechanism and are widely used; however, many [...] "double-action" [...] firearms such as revolvers do not have manual safeties as the longer, harder trigger pull to cock and fire double-action provides adequate trigger safety, while keeping the firearm in a more ready state.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is broken}} into stages; each stage {{is a single}} boss battle, {{resulting}} in {{a constant stream of}} bosses. To progress to the next stage, the boss must be completely destroyed within the time limit. The game starts with a default time limit of 180 seconds, with 30 seconds rewarded for every boss defeated and 20 seconds lost for each time the player is destroyed. The player flies a relatively small green ship. There are no power-ups - the player's only weapon is a very rapid-fire revolving cannon which is fired by holding down the shoot button (Z key by default). By default, it fires straight ahead with a small spread. Alternatively, after the <b>switch</b> <b>button</b> (D key by default) is pressed, a green arc is displayed originating from the ship and widening as distance increases. This arc represents the spread of the weapon fire and does not change while the weapon is firing. It can, however, be modified based on the ship's motion while not firing. The arc will rotate slowly to face the direction opposite the ship's motion. Also, the arc will widen as the player moves toward the enemy and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Language {{minority}} (LMi) {{students are}} usually {{brought up in}} another language than the language of instruction used at school. This {{has been identified as}} one of the main factors for the achievement gap between those students and language majority (LMa) students. Computer-based learning environments (CBLEs) can be a promising means to support these students in their acquisition of challenging knowledge and skills through integrating authentic support in their home language. This study aimed to identify student- and classroom characteristics related to fourth-grade students’ use of bilingual support in the CBLE E-Validiv (n= 250). This CBLE is aimed at supporting students’ knowledge acquisition in the domain of science education through offering content in the language of instruction and one of six other languages. For LMi students, the other language is set to their home language if it is available in E-Validiv. Throughout the CBLE, students can switch between the two languages via a language <b>switch</b> <b>button.</b> Multilevel hierarchical regression analyses show that especially LMi students who assess themselves as highly proficient in their home language spend more time in the other language and use the language <b>switch</b> <b>button</b> more often to go the other language than LMa students. However, even LMi students tend to focus mainly on the content offered in the language of instruction. This may indicate that they especially apply the content in their home language to support their learning process in the language of instruction. The presence of linguistic diversity in the classroom nor the positive use of linguistic diversity by the teacher seem to matter {{for the use of the}} bilingual support...|$|E

Writing with pen on paper requires us to look at the paper, which can reduce concentration on the ongoing discussion. Laptops are costly, power consuming and heavy for such a trivial task. Voice to text programs dont have the freedom of choosing the text to be included, and noise in the room can affect performance of such a program. Smart phones have a small keypad, which demands more user concentration. We have created a glove that one can wear and touch-type on any flat surface with minimal costs and power consumption.

The mouse, display, and speech software work together by speaking phrases when the mouse is clicked over the icon linked to that phrase.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{competitive}} market place, product designers need to elaborate their design {{with respect to}} not only the form and function but also the tactile properties, which make the product safe and comfortable to use. Several examples of these tactile properties are stiffness, surface finish, and trigger actuation force. Because of the expensive redesign processes, requirements on these tactile properties {{should be considered as}} constraints and should be brought into the product development cycle as early as possible. However, current visual feedback-based computer-aided design (CAD) systems focus mainly on product geometrical properties, such as dimension and appearance. Tactile properties are difficult or even impossible to be perceived in current CAD systems. In this paper, haptic rendering techniques are introduced as an approach to the perception of tactile properties and hand tool design case studies are demonstrated. With the aid of a force feedback device, Phantom(R), designers can perceive the surface roughness of a handle, the stiffness of a toothbrush, and examine the actuation force of a <b>switch</b> <b>button.</b> With these tools, designers can not only design the form of a product but also evaluate some physical properties of a product design in real time before the product is made, thus shortening the product development cycle...|$|E

The high cost associated with commercial interactive whiteboard may hinder its application in primary or secondary school, especially in developing countries. Thus, this study describes the methods {{used to create a}} low cost interactive and viable electronic whiteboard by using the capabilities of the Nintendo Wiimotes. It also looks at the possibility of whether this much cheaper technology can be fully utilized to create better tools for in-class learning. Approach: Several technical aspects of the Wii Remote are examined, how this technology can be used on a low cost interactive whiteboard and how the system can be connected to your computer and LCD projector/screen. Result: This system has a stand-alone architecture, consists of a PC. The input client was responsible for getting the input data and connecting the Wii Remotes using a Bluetooth connection. The PC handles the software engine and display module. The user sends the IR source light to Wiimote by pressing the IR Pen’s <b>switch</b> <b>button</b> and then the Wiimote sends data to the PC via a Bluetooth connection.
