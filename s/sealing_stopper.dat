40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of flap {{parameters}} on fluid rectification in a microfluidic diode. We use Navier–Stokes equations and arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation to obtain dynamics of fluid flow and motion of the flap. The flap opens during forward flow and <b>seals</b> against a <b>stopper</b> during reverse flow. This allows flow in the forward direction and prevents it in the reverse direction. The rectifier is fluidic analog to a semiconductor diode in function because it rectifies fluid flow. Velocity-pressure (V-P) curves analog to the current-voltage (I-V) curves of the electronic diode has been obtained. The effect of the flap parameters, such as length, thickness, and Young’s modulus has been found out. The transient response of the flap and fluid flow under oscillating pressure driven flow has also been obtained...|$|R

40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{volatile}} composition and sensory properties of red wines after packaging under different configurations: bag-in-box (BIB) and glass bottles sealed with natural cork stoppers. The experiments {{were carried out}} {{over a period of}} 12 months and analysis were performed at initial time (just before packaging) and after 3, 6 and 12 months of storage. Volatile compounds composition was determined by two different analytical techniques which combined headspace solid-phase micro- extraction (HS-SPME) with gas chromatography-ion trap/mass spectrometry (GC-IT/MS). Sensory analysis and other enological parameters, such as free and total SO 2 and color intensity, were also monitored. Results showed that, after one year of storage, BIB wines were characterized by higher levels of several carbonyl compounds when compared to bottled wines. Moreover, bottled wines <b>sealed</b> with cork <b>stoppers</b> retained much more free and total SO 2 than wines in BIB. In addition, the premature wine development under BIB was confirmed by sensory analyses. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
30|$|The {{fermentation}} {{medium for}} the screening of process variables was prepared by mixing 30 g/l pure glycerol with 1.0 x tryptic soy broth without dextrose (TSB) base nutrient. However, the medium for fermentation at optimum process variables contained 50 g/l glycerol. Into 125 ml serum bottles was dispensed 47.5 ml of the fermentation broth, and the bottles capped with <b>sealed</b> butyl rubber <b>stopper.</b> The headspaces were purged with nitrogen gas for about 2 min to create anaerobiosis, and the medium-containing bottles autoclaved at 121 °C for 18 min. They were inoculated with the seed culture by using hypodermic syringe. The syringe needle was not removed {{but had a}} 0.45 μm gas-outlet filter fitted to its base. This prevented air from entering, but allowed gaseous products to escape, preventing pressure build-up that could interfere with the bacterial growth and function.

Samples were collected and prepared for HPLC analysis by filtering them through a 0.2 μm membrane filters.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that products shipped in bulk containers were dispensed for sale in these smaller vessels. Perfumed oils, ointments, , jasmine, kohl, honey, mastic, incense, scent powders and cosmetic preparations are among the contents proposed by scholars or evidenced by archaeology. With their long slender necks, the vessels were most suited for dispensing liquids, oils, and powders. Roman examples of bulbous unguentaria have been found with traces of olive oil. A sharp distinction should not be made between cosmetics and medicaments, as ingredients for these preparations often overlap. Chemical analysis of red and pink substances in two glass unguentaria from the Ebro valley in Spain showed that they were likely cosmetics, but similar ingredients are found in therapeutic recipes. The name [...] "unguentarium" [...] may be misleading, as solid unguents, or ointments, would be difficult to remove through the narrow neck.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the expansion of fire <b>seals</b> and fire <b>stoppers</b> will be dependent on the heat exposure. Standardized methods for classification includes exposure to a rapid heat exposure of the product that is tested, but this might not always be the worst case scenario for the product. In this paper a series of tests are presented in order to study how a graphite based intumescing system, intended for cavities, reacts when subjected to fire conditions different form that in the standardised method EN 1366 - 4. Two different experimental setups, a cone calorimeter at Lund University and a small-scale furnace at SP Fire Technology, were used in the tests. The start of expansion reaction in the tested fire stopper was around 180 °C. The start of reaction temperature is rather independent of the incident heat flux, while expansion rate is clearly dependent on the incident heat flux. Furthermore, the studied fire stopper performed well in the small-scale furnace because the graphite expanded enough to give the same protection, although it is preheated or wet, as when subjected to a heat exposure similar to ISO 834. These results are good but they are only considered valid for the studied system and for the given situation. Future research is needed in order to study how other types of intumescing fire protection systems work when subjected to realistic fire environments...|$|R
30|$|The {{degradation}} {{experiments were}} carried out in ultrasonic cleaner bath (Honda electronics PS- 60, Capacity 15  L). The bath operates at 360  W and 40  kHz. Erlenmeyer flask was used as reaction vessel. The volume of the solution was 100  mL. The bath temperatures were maintained by proper recirculation of water. Solution temperature was also monitored regularly. The efficiency of a reaction vessel placed in an ultrasonic bath depends strongly on {{the distance of the}} bottom of the reaction vessel to the bottom of water bath. The distance was carefully measured through preliminary experiments, so that ultrasonic intensity reached maximum {{at the bottom of the}} flask. For ultrasonic frequency 40  kHz this distance value was 1  cm. The reactor was <b>sealed</b> with silicone <b>stopper</b> wrapped with an aluminium foil to ensure the minimum loss due to evaporation of the volatile compounds. The syringe needle was pierced through the septum of the stopper for sampling. In the present study, ultrasonic device provides indirect sonication, which will inevitably cause energy loss. A limited quantity of energy is transmitted into the reaction vessel. So, it should be kept in mind that the power used is not the real power of ultrasonic energy transmitting into the reaction mixture. All sonochemical experiments were conducted twice in parallel. The averages of the parallel experimental data were calculated and taken into account in analyses of sonochemical kinetics. The error of all parallel experiments was under 5  %.|$|R
50|$|Sanger-Black {{apparatus}} is a {{piece of}} chemical laboratory ware used for quantitative and semi-quantitative determination of arsenic element in the solution. It is constituted by glass bottle of volume ca. 30 mL, <b>sealed</b> with rubber <b>stopper</b> with one or two holes. Through one hole a thistle tube is inserted, almost reaching the bottom, for filling the bottle (what can be done also when the stopper is taken out - for semi-quantitative determination). The second, S-shaped tube is for outflow of the gases and joined by another rubber stopper to a bulg tube, with bulb containing pre-dried cotton as adsorbent, presumably intended for homogenizing the gas flow. A thin reagent paper, impregnated with mercury(II) chloride (nowadays replaced by mercury(II) bromide) or silver(I) nitrate, is placed in the open end of the bulb tube. If the semi-quantitative variant is to be performed, the paper is put in the (only) thistle tube - i. e., vertically, not horizontally. During the test ca. 3 g of Zn granules are placed into the bottle, just below the end of thistle tube, and then acid solution is added (ca. 15 mL; authors recommend that HCl is preferable to H2SO4). About 10 minutes are required to let H2 flow along the reagent paper, while this flow and moisture content inside it is stabilizing. Then the sample is introduced, and in case of sample solution containing arsenic the paper becomes more or less stained.|$|R
30|$|The aerobic {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} following the methodology previously described by da Cruz et al. (2008). The aerobic biodegradation process was stimulated by adsorbing oil on sterilized sand and by using 2 g wet cells/ 30 mg P 1 oil/ 40 mL aqueous Zinder medium (Zinder et al. 1984). The cells were centrifuged from the enrichment experiment as previously described (da Cruz et al. 2008). Aerobic consortia {{was set up in}} Erlenmeyer flasks incubated in a shaker with temperature and agitation control (30 °C and 150 rpm) during 60 days. Laboratory anaerobic and mixed (aerobic/anaerobic) consortium experiments were set up in 50 mL glass serum bottles <b>sealed</b> with butyl <b>stoppers</b> and aluminium crimps containins resazurin as redox potential control. The bottles were incubated at 30 °C during 30 days (with agitation control) and then at 55 °C for up to 180 days (without stiring). A gas system fitted with an oxygen sensor and with a regulated atmosphere of nitrogen (80 %) and carbon dioxide (20 %) was used in the preparation and incubation of the anaerobic and mixed microorganism consortium. Each consortium biodegradation {{experiment was}} composed of 40 mL of Zinder nutrient medium (Zinder et al. 1984) containing sources of organic substrates, nitrogen, phophorus, vitamins and trace minerals, made up in Milli-Q water and 30 mg of non-biodegraded oil (P 1 from Pampo Sul Field, Campos Basin, Brazil). For the control experiments the same components were used without crude oil to evaluate the consortia in the absence of oil. Perchlorate was added as an oxygen supply for the mixed consortia and the biodegradation processes were stimulated by adsorbing oil on sterilized sand. The experiments were carried out in duplicate and controls of consortia and Zinder medium were included. Samples were processed following a strict protocol and the anaerobic experiments were run in sealed vials and compared to the control experiments. Volatile losses were taken into account by comparing both experiments. The microbial consortia was slightly dependent on the oil storage period, causing oscillations. A reference aerobic bacterial consortium was discussed by Sette et al (2007).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This {{study focused}} on a serious quality-related problem in the global wine industry, {{including}} the South African Wine Industry, namely cork taint in wine. Annually, large financial losses are incurred by cork suppliers and wine producers, {{as a result of}} cork-tainted wine. Although contaminated new unused corks are frequently implicated as the origin of this taint, contaminated cellar equipment and water can also be the source of the problem. An explorative investigation into the incidence of cork taint in South African wines showed that 3. 8 % of the 133 wines tested, contained 2, 4, 6 -trichloroanisole (TCA) concentrations of 3. 5 ng/L and higher, as determined by gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). TCA concentrations higher than 1 ng/L were found in 18 % of the wines tested. All affected wines were sealed with solid or agglomerate cork stoppers. These wines were sourced from various wineries in the Western Cape region, South Africa and were of different cultivars. None of the wines sealed with synthetic closures had any detectable TCA, 2, 4, 6 -tribromoanisole (TBA) or pentachloroanisole (PCA) levels and only very low 2, 3, 4, 6 - tetrachloroanisole (TeCA) levels (1 ng/L or less). Another group of 28 wines that were rejected by the official South African wine regulatory body {{on the basis of the}} presence of mouldy taint during wine certification, was also included in this study. GC-ECD analysis showed that 30 % of the wines in this group contained TCA at concentrations of 3. 5 ng/L and higher. These results pointed to a relative high incidence of TCA in the wines investigated, especially those <b>sealed</b> with cork <b>stoppers.</b> Although no general conclusions should be made on the incidence of cork taint in the wider wine industry based on the results found within this explorative investigation, these findings confirmed the presence of cork taint in South African wines. Detection threshold values were determined for TCA, TeCA, TBA and PCA in three wine cultivars using the standard ASTM method. Results indicate that factors relating to the wine cultivar seemed to affect threshold values considerably. Our research proposes a detection range rather than an average detection threshold. Detection ranges established for TCA, TeCA, TBA and PCA in Chenin blanc, Pinotage and Shiraz coincide with reported values in literature. This result can be regarded as a valuable expansion of the existing knowledge of detection threshold values. Descriptive sensory analysis indicated significant (P 0. 05) changes in the aroma profile of Chenin blanc, Pinotage and Shiraz after TCA, TeCA, TBA or PCA was added to the respective base wines that contained no detectable levels of the haloanisoles. The mouldy taint induced by these haloanisoles were described as mouldy, mouldy-chemical, mouldychlorine, as well as mouldy-acidic. In Chenin blanc, additions of TCA, in the concentration range 1 to 17 ng/L, resulted in a marked increase in the mouldy aroma and was accompanied by an immediate decrease in fruitiness. This change was already evident at added TCA concentrations of 1 ng/L. Similar trends were observed in Pinotage, while the addition of low levels of TCA to Shiraz (2 ng/L) resulted in a significant (P 0. 05) decrease in the herbaceous character of the wine. The aroma changes observed were prominent enough to render the wine totally unacceptable in comparison to its original character. Consumers’ degree of liking did not seem to be affected by very low concentration levels of TCA in Chenin blanc, Pinotage or Shiraz, but rejection increased as the concentration increased beyond detection threshold level. A slight gender effect was also noticed. Female consumers appeared to be more sensitive to increasing levels of TCA, whereas male consumers did not respond as negatively to higher concentration levels of TCA. This study makes an important contribution towards understanding the sensory impact of especially TCA contamination in wine, through the establishment of concentration ranges at which these compounds exert a noticeable detrimental effect on the aroma profile of wine. Additional insight into cork taint in wine is provided by the consumer preference studies, where the effects of the taint on the product acceptance by consumers are demonstrated. The development of a modus operandi to ensure that sensory panels provide reliable data, can be regarded as an important contribution to wine-related research. This study is one of the first where advanced sensometric techniques were applied in sensory studies on cork tainted wines...|$|R
