40|$|For a given {{species in}} a {{particular}} environment, the success and the harmlessness of transmitter attachment appear to be highly specific. As no information was available for the tagging of the <b>strepie,</b> Sarpa salpa, a suitability study of attachment techniques was needed. Two types of transmitter attachments were investigated: (1) externally, placed {{on the back of}} the fish below the dorsal fin by means of two threads sutured through the dorsal musculature, and (2) internally, in the peritoneal cavity. Twenty-five fish were monitored over a 14 -d period for survival, surgical healing, injury occurrence and post-tagging behaviour. Even though we observed a 100 % survival rate for both groups, with no noticeable buoyancy or swimming alteration, findings from this study indicate that both groups of tagged fish were affected by the presence of the transmitter in different ways. Fish with an external transmitter were chronically affected, incurring physical impact, whereas the surgically-implanted fish exhibited short-term tagging effects (less than 36 h), attributable to surgery effects, and were not subject to fouling on transmitter or wound chafing. Moreover, they appeared to recover quickly with no indication of long-term effects. Based on the findings of this study. the use of the surgical implantation method for Sarpa salpa is recommended...|$|E
40|$|A fishery-dependant {{monitoring}} method of the recreational shore-based fishery was {{undertaken in the}} Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the south coast of South Africa {{for a period of}} 17 months. The method used was a roving creel survey (RCS), with dates, times and starting locations chosen by stratified random sampling. The MPA was divided into two sections, Buffalo Bay and Groenvlei, and all anglers encountered were interviewed. Catch and effort data were collected and catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated from this. The spatial distribution of anglers was also mapped. A generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted to the effort data {{to determine the effects of}} month and day type on the variability of effort in each section. Fitted values showed that effort was significantly higher on weekends than on week days, in both sections. A total average of 3662 anglers fishing 21 428 hours annually is estimated within the reserve with a mean trip length of 5. 85 hours. Angler numbers were higher per unit coastline length in Buffalo Bay than Groenvlei, but fishing effort (angler hours) was higher in Groenvlei. Density distributions showed that anglers were clumped in easily accessible areas and that they favored rocky areas and mixed shores over sandy shores. Catch documented between October 2008 and December 2009 included a total of 361 fish, of 27 species from 12 families. Sparidae had the highest contribution (12 species). A Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed that diversity was higher in Buffalo Bay (0. 81) than Groenvlei (0. 57). Catch composition of retained fish (336 individuals) showed that the six numerically most important species were blacktail (Diplodus sargus capensis) (66 percent of catch), followed by galjoen (Dichistius capensis) at 11 percent, Cape stumpnose (Rhabdosargus holubi), belman (Umbrina robinsonii) and <b>strepie</b> at 3 percent, and elf (Pomatomus saltatrix) at 2 percent. Catch composition of an earlier study in Goukamma (Pradervand and Hiseman 2006) was compared with the present study, as well as data from the De Hoop MPA, which is closed to fishing. A multi-dimensional scaling plot of catch composition showed tight clustering of the De Hoop samples, and high variability among the Goukamma samples. A bray-curtis similarity index and dendrogram of similarity between study sites and study periods showed that there was an 83 percent similarity among De Hoop samples and a 75 percent similarity among Goukamma samples (ignoring the two outliers). The two sites are different with respect to species composition, but this is expected because they are different areas. Differences between time periods in Goukamma (i. e. the previous study versus the present study) were not significant. The most significant result from the catch composition analyses is the high variability among the Goukamma samples. This can be explained by the variable fishing methods used by anglers in Goukamma, compared with the standardized fishing methods used by researchers in De Hoop, and the fact that fish are more abundant and populations are more stable in De Hoop – giving higher sample sizes which reduce the variability in the statistics. Species-specific CPUE was calculated for the six numerically most important species. In both sections, CPUE was highest for blacktail, with an average of 0. 133 fish per hour for Groenvlei, and 0. 060 fish per hour for Buffalo Bay, over the 12 months. The second highest CPUE values per section were 0. 030 for galjoen in Groenvlei and 0. 039 for <b>strepie</b> in Buffalo Bay. Remaining CPUE values ranged from 0. 014 (belman in Groenvlei) to the lowest value of 0. 001 (<b>strepie</b> in Groenvlei). Total estimated CPUE for these six species in the MPA using the estimated effort and catch results amounted to 0. 018 fish per hour. An annual estimated 3897 fish were landed in the reserve during 2009. Most fish (n= 2481, 64 percent) were caught in the Groenvlei section. Numbers of blacktail were the highest of all species, within both sections (2353 fish). <b>Strepie</b> was the next most common (561 fish), but was caught almost entirely within the Buffalo Bay section (97 percent of individuals), followed by galjoen (548 fish) caught mostly within the Groenvlei section (92 percent of individuals). Size comparisons of the six species between the Goukamma and De Hoop MPAs showed that ranges in size are similar, but there are substantial differences in mean sizes between the two MPAs. Sample sizes of all species from the Goukamma MPA were too small to draw conclusions about stock status, except for blacktail. The Goukamma MPA is a popular fishing destination and angler effort is high. It can be considered a node of exploitation for surf zone fish, for which it provides no protection. Even though the MPA allows shore angling, sustainable fishing practices should be incorporated in management plans if the MPA is expected to protect and conserve its stocks. Of noteworthy concern is the occurrence of illegal night fishing (the public may not enter the reserve between sunrise and sunset) which leads to underestimates of catch and effort (night surveys were not conducted because of safety concerns). It is recommended that more communication should take place between the angling community and the reserve management. Sign boards giving information on species which are under pressure, and why they are under pressure, with a short explanation on their life cycles, is advised. The roving creel survey method was suitable for the study area and delivered statistically rigorous results. I thus recommend that it is continued in the future by management. I make some recommendations for reducing costs of future surveys, as well as for altering the survey design if funds are very limite...|$|E
40|$|The {{recruitment}} of juvenile marine fishes into the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries was monitored over 30 months using seine, scoop and cast nets. The relative abundance, seasonality {{and growth of}} the dominant species are presented, and includes the Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi, white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus, blacktail Diplodus sargus, <b>strepie</b> Sarpa salpa, Cape moony Monodactylus falciformis, southern mullet Liza richardsonii, groovy mullet Liza dumerilii, striped mullet Liza tricuspidens, flathead mullet Mugil cephalus, freshwater mullet Myxus capensis and leervis Lichia amia. Information on a further 12 species is also provided. Recruitment of most fish species into the Swartvlei and Knysna estuaries reaches a peak during summer, which coincides with maximum food resource availability and corresponds {{to the time when}} systems along this section of the coast are often open to the sea. Artificial winter breaching of the Swartvlei mouth has occurred in the past, and has generally led to the premature closure of the system and loss of the ‘head’ of water needed for the summer opening. This type of mouth manipulation leads to reduced availability of estuarine nursery areas for marine fishes along the southern Cape coast. Comparisons between the {{recruitment of}} juvenile fishes into the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries indicate that higher densities of most species were recorded in the former system. This is attributed mainly {{to the fact that the}} Knysna mouth is deep, permanently open, and has a strong marine influence when compared to the shallow, narrow and seasonally closed Swartvlei mouth. However, in a regional context both Knysna and Swartvlei are large, unpolluted systems, which serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish. On this basis alone, these contrasting estuarine systems should be allocated the highest possible conservation status. Rhodes University Libraries (Digitisation) ABBYY FineReader 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a detailed investigation into size, density and community structure of temperate marine reef {{fish in the}} medium-sized Goukamma Marine Protected Area (Goukamma MPA) and adjacent fishing grounds on the south coast of South Africa. The oceanographic conditions, the spatial distribution of the benthic community and the prevailing fishing effort are also described. Life history traits and per-recruit (PR) models for the principle target species, roman (Crysoblephus laticeps) are compared between the protected and exploited area. From the study results, various strategies are proposed {{for the use of}} MPAs in the conservation and management of linefish species along South Africa’s south coast. The distribution and topography of reefs in the protected and exploited sections of the study area were found to be comparable. Atmospheric pressure ranged from 992 to 1, 032 mb, being significantly lower in summer. Wind speeds ranged from 0. 7 to 71. 3 km/h. Water temperatures ranged between 9. 0 and 22. 2 ºC and turbidity between 0. 3 and 45. 8 NTU. Water temperature and clarity were uniformly low in winter. In summer the water was generally warm, clear and stratified, with a thermocline at around 20 m, although intermittent upwelling events caused water temperature to decrease and clarity to deteriorate. Current speeds ranged between 0. 11 and 2. 59 km/h and were significantly higher in spring and autumn. Easterly currents prevailed in spring, summer and autumn and westerly and southerly currents in winter. Hake (Merluccius capensis), various resident reef fish and kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) were most frequently targeted by the local linefishery. A significant amount of illegal fishing was found to occur in the protected area. Fishing effort was found to be highest around the border of the MPA (2. 7 boats/km²) and lowest in the core of the MPA (0. 2 boats/km²). If law enforcement remains poor {{it may be necessary to}} adapt the management strategy to extend the reserve, thereby mitigating against illegal fishing and ensuring a core area of no exploitation. Various other alternatives were investigated and it was demonstrated that the amount of fish caught of legal size could be increased by about 23 % and post-release mortality of undersized fish reduced by 50 % through the introduction of a suit of restrictive measures. Randomly stratified underwater visual census (UVC) and controlled fishing were used to investigate the ichthyofauna and benthic community at protected and exploited sites in the study area. Resulting density and size data from 273 fishing sites and 177 point counts were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLMs). Fish communities were found to vary significantly, depending on the level of exploitation. Roman, the principle reef fish species targeted by the fishery had significantly higher densities within the protected parts of the study area (CPUE: 4. 3 fish/anglerhour; UVC: 2. 2 fish/point-count) as compared to the exploited part (CPUE: 3. 4 fish/anglerhour; UVC: 1. 8 fish/point-count), correlating strongly with the observed fishing effort. Also mean sizes were significantly higher in the protected area (299 mm from fishing survey and 233 mm from diving estimates) as compared to the exploited section (283 mm from fishing survey and 198 mm from diving estimates). Although other fish species also had significantly higher mean sizes at protected sites in most cases their densities were significantly lower. This suggests a top-down control of the fish community by the dominant predator (roman). The results of the UVC showed the diversity of the ichthyofauna to be significantly higher inside the protected area. Interestingly this did not apply to the results of the controlled fishing experiment where the diversity of fish in the catch was lower in the protected area - a result that may be explained by the selectivity of fishing for the most aggressive species – and a reminder of the limitations of controlled fishing experiments. Possibly the most important finding of the study revolved around the benthic community. These were significantly different at exploited and protected sites, with algae and crinoids more abundant at exploited sites. Crinoids are the principle food of roman and were low in abundance where roman abundances were high, suggesting that the dominant top predator reduced crinoids. Furthermore, it substantiates the correlation of roman abundance with fishing effort, since habitat preferences can be ruled out by the observed causal predator-prey distribution pattern. Low algae abundances at protected sites correlated with high <b>strepie</b> (Sarpa salpa) frequencies within the fish communities encountered there. <b>Strepie,</b> a shoaling and abundant benthic grazer, does not compete for food with roman, suggesting a high potential for coexistence of the two species. As expected, and found by other studies, life history traits of roman differed between protected and exploited sample-sites. With a significantly lower age-at-maturity and age-atsex- change, the exploited population showed a typical response to fishing effort. The sex ratio of this protogynous hermaphrodite was found to be sustained at healthy levels by phenotypic plasticity. However, one important additional factor was highlighted by the study; the average condition factor of the protected population was significantly lower (0. 0283 g/cm³) compared to the exploited population (0. 0295 g/cm³). This was probably due to the higher intra-specific competition for lower food abundance in the protected area. Interestingly the diving and fishing survey methods yielded similar mortality results for roman. Total mortality rate estimates derived from length frequency analysis from the diving and fishing survey were not different (0. 32 and 0. 29 y⁻¹, respectively) as were natural mortality rate estimates (0. 24 and 0. 19 y⁻¹, respectively). Natural mortality rate (M) estimates indicated by Pauly’s and Hoenig’s relationship were similar (0. 25 and 0. 23 y⁻¹, respectively). Detailed yield-per-recruit (Y/R) and spawner biomass-per-recruit (SB/R) analyses were presented for different levels of M, varying age-at-recruitment (tR) and fishing mortality (F). Current tR (7. 60 y) and F (0. 16 and 0. 25 y⁻¹, from the diving and fishing dataset, respectively) suggests an optimal exploitation of the population in the exploited part of the study area. However, a separate SB/R analysis of the male part of the population showed their vulnerability to over-exploitation, even at reduced age-at-sex-change from fishing. There therefore remains a high risk of recruitment failure for the roman population. Of course MPAs can be used to measure stock status directly if the influence of factors such as cachability, habitat and sampling method on CPUE assessments can be limited or reduced. The experimental design in this study allowed for contemporary CPUE comparisons across the border of the Goukamma MPA. Results were similar to those obtained by the SB/R analyses. CPUE extrapolations therefore, using small MPAs, can provide reliable and consistent estimates, and offer a practical alternative to conventional assessment strategies. This study has highlighted the importance of ensuring a well structured and comprehensive survey design when undertaking a comparison of protected and exploited marine areas. The results provide a comprehensive framework for future management of the Goukamma MPA and other protected areas along the temperate coastline of South Africa...|$|E
40|$|The long-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus capensis (Gray 1828), {{is one of}} {{the most}} enigmatic predators feeding in the annual sardine run (Sardinops sagax) off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. In recent years, {{unpredictable}} inter-annual variations in the timing, spatial extent and intensity of the sardine run have been documented, possibly resulting in changes in the suite of prey available to the common dolphin during winter. Although the diets of a number of predators during the sardine run have been studied in detail (e. g. sharks and flying seabirds), little is known about the diet of long-beaked common dolphins during this period. Each year, a low number of common dolphins are incidentally caught in the anti-shark nets in the waters of KwaZulu-Natal. These captures provide a valuable source of data on selected aspects of the ecology of the long-beaked common dolphins along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline. The objective of this study was to provide new dietary data for the common dolphins feeding in the waters of KwaZulu-Natal during winter over the period 2000 to 2009, as well as to determine if any dietary changes had taken place since the common dolphin diet was last assessed, over 15 years ago. Stomach contents from 95 common dolphins (55 females, 40 males) caught between 2000 and 2009 were analysed and compared to historical data from dolphins caught between 1974 and 1992. Mesopelagic fish and squid dominated the diet, with 23 fish and 5 squid species represented in adult dolphins. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) indicated that there was no resource partitioning between adult male and female dolphins. Numerical analyses indicated that there was a shift in the principal prey species consumed by the dolphins over the past decade, particularly during the winter. Prior to 1992, sardine comprised up to 49 % of the total stomach contents, while chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) was the dominant prey item (66 % by mass) recorded in the stomach contents over the period 2000 to 2009. The shift in the relative contributions of sardine and mackerel in the diets of the dolphin appeared to correspond to fluctuations in the availability of the two principal prey species. Between 2000 and 2009, the diversity of the dolphins' diets was highest during the sardine run, reflecting the presence of a wide suite of predatory teleosts in the waters of KwaZulu-Natal during the annual sardine run. Conversely, prior to 2000, the diet was dominated by sardine during the peak of the sardine run, whilst diet diversity increased after this period. Apart from sardine and chub mackerel, elf (Pomatomus saltatrix), maasbanker (Trachurus delagoa), <b>strepie</b> (Sarpa salpa) and flying fish (Exocoetid sp.) also formed important components of the diet both prior to 1992, and over the last decade. Blubber thickness was assessed as an indicator of animal condition. No significant change in blubber total weight (R² = 0. 0016, N = 185), nor dorsal, lateral or ventral blubber thickness (R² = 0. 3146, R² = 0. 0003, and R² = 0. 0003 respectively, N = 78) was seen over the last 30 years (1970 to 2009). Results of stable isotope analyses conducted on tissue derived from the teeth of D. capensis indicated that there has been no significant shift in the trophic position (δ¹⁵N) and potential prey consumed (δ¹³C) over the corresponding period. These data would suggest that the long-beaked common dolphins along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline can be considered as opportunistic predators generally consuming the most abundant prey species available locally. As common dolphins feed opportunistically, this dietary shift appears to indicate changes in the shoaling characteristics of the most abundant fish prey in KwaZulu-Natal during winter. Given the “Data Deficient” status of the long-beaked common dolphin on the IUCN Red Data List, and the strong climatic forcing of the sardine run, such dietary data have important implications for their conservation in the light of expanding fisheries and climate change...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} thesis, as {{required}} by the funders, was to provide research that would contribute towards the development of a bay management plan, specifically information on the local fisheries. The thesis therefore includes an assessment of the local shore-based linefishery in terms of catch and effort and socio-economics, and the development of indicators from this information with which to assess the sustainability of the fishery. Finally an implementation strategy for an integrated coastal management approach for local resource governance is proposed The shore-based linefishery of Plettenberg Bay was assessed through a combination of roving creel and access point surveys which included questions aimed at the quantification of total effort, total catch and cpue, as well as the spatial trends in catch and effort. Angler demographics as well as opinions and knowledge of current fisheries regulations were obtained and the efficiency of the fishery inspectorate was assessed. The survey period extended from August 2003 to September 2004 during which 1189 angler interviews were conducted. Catch data obtained during this study was compared to catch data gathered during a research tagging program conducted in an area closed to fishing (Tsitsikamma National Park) and a semi-open area (Rebelsrus – Cape St. Francis), thereby highlighting differences in species composition, abundance and size distribution of certain species between areas of differing fishing pressures. The fishery surveys revealed that the shore-based fishery is primarily recreational (99 %) and dominated by white males. Most anglers agreed with the current fisheries regulations (60 %) and admitted to abiding by them, however when tested on the regulations of their target species, their knowledge was poor. Effort in the fishery was highly seasonal with peaks coinciding with major school holidays. Total annual effort was estimated at 102 566 angler-hours, with distinct spatial patterns in effort. Total annual catch for the Plettenberg Bay shore-based linefishery was estimated at 31 217 fish. year⁻¹ with a total mass of 13. 6 tons. Thirty-six fish species (26 teleost species and 10 elasmobranchs species) were identified during the survey period with Blacktail Diplodus capensis, <b>Strepie</b> Sarpa salpa, Red tjor-tjor Pagellus natalensis, Shad Pomatomus saltatrix and Sand steenbras Lithognathus mormyrus being the five most commonly caught species. Only 32 % of interviewed anglers were successful in catching a fish with just 22 % catching their primary target species. In addition, {{a large proportion of the}} anglers (69 %) reported a decline in catch rate, with most blaming the commercial sector as a reason for the decline. The overall catch rate was (cpue) 0. 374 fish. angler. hour⁻¹ or 170 grams. angler. hour⁻¹, considerably lower than that obtained from the fishery exempt area (TNP = 1. 02 fish. angler. hour⁻¹) and the partially exploited area (Rebelsrus = 0. 91 fish. angler. hour⁻¹). In terms of species composition the most obvious difference between the three areas was the low proportion of non-migratory reef-associated species like red roman, poenskop, John brown, santer and bronze bream in Plettenberg Bay. Size comparisons revealed that the majority of species (particularly reef-associated species) were larger in the TNP than both the semi-exploited (Rebelsrus) and exploited area (Plettenberg Bay). Collectively theses findings suggest that certain species have been locally depleted, that recreational fishing has impacted heavily on the fish stocks and that even partial closure or limited access to an area can offer protection. From the results key issues were identified and sustainability indicators proposed according to the three sustainability domains (ecological, institutional and social) proposed by Pajak (2000). Within the ecological domain the most pertinent issue was the low catch rate, particularly for reef-associated species. Indicators to track these issues included: percentage of successful trips (where fish were caught), percentage of anglers that reached their daily bag limits and the proportion of the overall catch that comprised larger, more desirable species. Institutionally the most pertinent issue was the apparent inability of management institutions to manage effectively marine resources within Plettenberg Bay. Indicators within this domain included the proportion of anglers who were inspected, the existence of a localised management plan and an associated monitoring programme. Socially the fishery proved to be fairly sustainable. Indicators included in this domain were the proportion of subsistence anglers in the local fishing community, the percentage of correct answers pertaining to current fishery regulations, the level of noncompliance and the percentage of undersize fish retained. Aggregation of all the indicators within a sustainability matrix revealed that the Plettenberg Bay shore-based linefishery was unsustainable and thus requires increased local management effort. Since there is no local management strategy in place, an integrated coastal management approach for the governance of the coastal resources in Plettenberg Bay has been proposed. The development of a Coastal Management Plan and a subsidiary Bay Management Plan provide the frameworks within which management strategies can be put into operation...|$|E
