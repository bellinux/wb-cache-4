5|$|Activated B cells {{differentiate}} {{into either}} antibody-producing cells called plasma cells that secrete soluble antibody or memory cells that <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body for years afterward {{in order to}} allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} in neutral and weakly basic soils, but not acidic soils. They {{are also found}} in the Arctic and Antarctic soils, despite the cold climate, short growing season, and relatively low pH values of these soils. In dry soils, Azotobacter can <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of cysts for up to 24 years.|$|E

5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that an acid {{is a compound that}} contains oxygen (remnants of this <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E
5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is {{the only}} species of Hemilepistus to have {{developed}} parental care of its offspring, {{and it is only}} because of this development that the species can <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert. It is monogamous, and, unusually, both parents tend the young.|$|E
5|$|James Townsend was {{a leading}} citizen of the day. He served as a magistrate, was Member of Parliament for West Looe, and in 1772 became Lord Mayor of London, while Henrietta was a {{prominent}} artist, many of whose engravings of 18th-century Tottenham <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bruce Castle Museum.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} is of architectural interest because it still retains architectural elements from many previous centuries, including a 14th-century sacristy wall and 16th-century tower {{connected with the}} King's Council of the North. It {{is also one of}} only two intact 17th-century brick buildings that <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, the other being Alderman Fenwick's House.|$|E
5|$|The castle is {{protected}} as a Scheduled Monument under UK {{law and the}} remaining earthworks generally well preserved, but between 2010 and 2014 English Heritage expressed concerns about its condition {{and the impact of}} drainage, and the consequent drying out of the land, on the castle's earthworks. Only a handful of buildings <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle's planned town of Skipsea Brough.|$|E

5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs <b>survive.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> US, firearms {{are the most common}} cause of fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species from {{becoming}} extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is to <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is {{native to}} the Northern Hemisphere, and {{distributed}} across Eurasia, North America and the British Isles, where there is open bog, heath, wetland and moorland, with standing water and calcareous peat or acidic soil. It can <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Subarctic and Arctic, and is found in Alaska, Finland and Greenland {{as far north as}} 83°N. The British botanist William Turner Thiselton-Dyer recorded E.angustifolium in the South African Republic in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Few of the {{original}} windows <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower, but those that remain are larger than {{in some of the}} other older peles, suggesting it may have been built with defence less in mind than in some earlier pele towers. The originals have mainly been replaced by 17th- and 18th-century versions. The original roof would have resembled that at nearby Yanwath Hall, but was replaced at a later date with the current hipped-roof design, probably during the late 16th or 17th centuries. The current roof was further restored in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Grove lists {{more than}} thirty works by Vaughan Williams for {{orchestra}} or band {{over and above the}} symphonies. They include two of his most popular works—the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (1910, revised 1919), and The Lark Ascending, originally for violin and piano (1914); orchestrated 1920. Other works that <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> repertoire in Britain are the Norfolk Rhapsody No 1 (1905–06), The Wasps, Aristophanic suite—particularly the overture (1909), the English Folk Song Suite (1923) and the Fantasia on Greensleeves (1934).|$|E
