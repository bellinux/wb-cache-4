500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
60|$|But {{if he did}} not see the woman's movements, mademoiselle saw them, and {{the sight}} set her eyes dilating with a new fear. <b>She</b> <b>guessed</b> the Dowager's treacherous purpose. And no sooner had <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> it than, with a choking sob, she told herself that what madame could do that could she also.|$|E
60|$|The man hesitated, and <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that he was}} {{thinking}} of his dusty jean.|$|E
5000|$|Pif-Paf-Poltrie asks Fair Katrinelje's {{father for}} leave to marry her. He is told he needs that of [...] "her mother Milk-Cow, her brother High-Pride, her sister Cheese-Love," [...] {{as well as}} her own. Going through the list, he obtains it, on the {{condition}} of all the others consenting. Fair Katrinelje is last; then she lists her dowry: some pennies, a debt, roots, pretzels, and dried pears—a fine dowry. <b>She</b> <b>guesses</b> at his occupation, and he declares it is finer than what <b>she</b> <b>guesses</b> until <b>she</b> <b>guesses</b> broommaker.|$|R
60|$|Lady Selina couldn't think, and {{declined}} guessing; for, as <b>she</b> remarked, <b>guessing</b> was {{a loss of}} time, and <b>she</b> never <b>guessed</b> right.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can a woman help knowing such a thing? <b>She</b> <b>guesses</b> it--she discovers it by instinct; {{especially}} if she be a proud woman." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>guessed</b> his intention, and forestalled his {{demand by}} {{dropping}} {{a handful of}} sugar-plums down upon him.|$|E
60|$|And then, as if <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> {{intuitively}} what {{it might}} portend, she considered her husband with pale-faced contempt.|$|E
60|$|Laverick half {{turned in}} his chair. <b>She</b> <b>guessed</b> {{what he was about}} to say, and went on rapidly.|$|E
60|$|Poor Honora! Little did <b>she</b> <b>guess</b> {{that the}} letter written in such love, such sympathy, such longing hope, would only excite fierce rebellion.|$|R
6000|$|Laverick drank {{his wine}} slowly. The woman knew! Impossible! Her eyes were {{watching}} his face, {{but he held}} himself bravely. What could she know? How could <b>she</b> <b>guess?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet I wonder, [...] Will it sunder [...] Her from me? [...] Will <b>she</b> <b>guess</b> that [...] I said [...] "Yes,"--that [...] His I'd be, Ere I {{thought she}} might not see him as I see! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>guessed</b> his thought--from the {{beginning}} Stella had this curious power of discovering his mind--and {{said with a}} smile: ...|$|E
60|$|He shouted some {{direction}} in German {{as he ran}} past her. By an inspiration <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> he wanted the nurse.|$|E
60|$|As {{yet there}} was a great {{patience}} in her steady eyes. Then it became evident that <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> what he was thinking.|$|E
50|$|Kiwi, {{still holding}} the bag of money she found in Orange's locker, which <b>she</b> <b>guesses</b> is the school fund, hides in the school's garbage {{disposal}} room, where she tips all the money into a nearby garbage bin.|$|R
6000|$|The smile {{upon the}} young man's face died. An {{expression}} of pain, and hopelessness, and sorrow swept across his features. The girl saw the change, and wondered, {{but how could}} <b>she</b> <b>guess</b> the grievous wound her words had inflicted? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>guessing</b> at {{what was}} in his mind, and trying, woman-like, to play {{purposely}} at cross purposes, and to defend her husband at all risks; [...] "he has an extraordinary poetic faculty; all the world agrees to that, Major Campbell." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Merrill took it, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> {{very well}} what it was, glanced {{at it with}} a shudder, and handed it back.|$|E
60|$|Corny said <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> she'd {{have to get}} {{a little}} book to put these things down, so that we could {{consider}} them in order.|$|E
60|$|Flora laughed, rather drearily, though <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> {{with some}} uneasiness {{the cause of}} her father's outbreak. It {{appeared}} injudicious to offer him any encouragement.|$|E
60|$|CURTIS--[Growing more calm--in {{a tone of}} obsession.] <b>She's</b> <b>guessed</b> it {{ever since}} that day when we quarreled--her birthday. Oh, you can {{have no idea of}} the misery there has been in our lives since then. You haven't seen or guessed the reason. No one has. It has been--the thought of IT.|$|R
60|$|He {{had loved}} her before, now he worshipped her. He {{knew that he}} might never possess her now, {{but at least he}} might see her. From a {{distance}} he might look upon her. Perhaps he might serve her; but never must <b>she</b> <b>guess</b> that he had found her or that he lived.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated as he {{answered}} her. <b>She</b> instantly <b>guessed</b> the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I never!" [...] she exclaimed, {{trying not}} to show that <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> his errand. [...] "Fancy you here at this time o' morning!" ...|$|E
60|$|Every Sunday {{afternoon}} {{during the}} winter Lemuel went to see Statira, and sometimes in the evening {{he took her to}} church. But she could not understand why he always wanted to go to a different church; she did not see why he should not pick out one church and stick to it: the ministers seemed to be all alike, and <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> one was pretty near as good as another. 'Manda Grier said <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> they were all Lemuel to her; and Statira said well, <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> that was pretty much so. She no longer pretended that he was not the whole world to her, either with him or with 'Manda Grier; she was so happy from morning till night, day in and day out, that 'Manda Grier said if she were in her place she should be afraid something would happen.|$|E
60|$|To which Mary fully assented. Little <b>she</b> <b>guessed,</b> {{and little}} did her father, {{that it was}} for Grace's sake that Tom had refused her hand.|$|E
5000|$|This can be {{likened to}} the funfair game [...] "guess your weight," [...] where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, {{and where the}} guesser [...] "wins" [...] if he or <b>she</b> <b>guesses</b> near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being {{completely}} correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function).|$|R
60|$|Meriem's trained ears {{heard his}} every move. She {{made no attempt}} to seek closer {{knowledge}} of his identity. Already <b>she</b> had <b>guessed</b> that he was a messenger from the Hon. Morison. She stooped and picked up the envelope. Tearing it open she easily read the contents by the moon's brilliant light. It was, as <b>she</b> had <b>guessed,</b> from Baynes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I found Miss Westenra in {{seemingly}} gay spirits. Her {{mother was}} present, {{and in a}} few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt <b>she</b> <b>guesses,</b> if <b>she</b> does not know, what need of caution there is.|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} opened softly. Julia came in. Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>guessed</b> from his {{attitude}} something of his trouble, for she moved {{at once to}} his side.|$|E

60|$|Lady Rosalind came {{sweeping}} down, with a {{smile on}} her kind face. <b>She</b> <b>guessed</b> what it was, though the prince had said nothing about it at dinner.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the voice}} was so {{imperious}} with the wayward vehemence of illness that Mrs. Curtis durst not gainsay it. She {{did not know how}} Alick Keith was already silencing those who asked if he had heard of the great event at the Dean's party. Still less did <b>she</b> <b>guess</b> at the letter at that moment in writing:-- ...|$|R
50|$|David Salsburg {{reports that}} a {{colleague}} of Fisher, H. Fairfield Smith, revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct.

60|$|Lord St. Erme and Lady Lucy {{had come}} to an early dinner at Lassonthwayte, thus causing great jealousy on the part of Mrs. Albert Moss, and despair on Matilda's, lest Olivia should do {{something}} extremely amiss without her supervision.
