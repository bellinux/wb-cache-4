40|$|The partial {{concentration}} index (PCI) {{is commonly used}} {{as a measure of}} income related inequality in health after removing the effects of <b>standardising</b> variables such as age and gender which affect health, are correlated with income, but not amenable to policy. Both direct and indirect standardisation have been used to remove the effects of <b>standardising</b> variables. The paper shows that with individual level data direct standardisation is possible using the coefficients from a linear regression of health on income and the <b>standardising</b> variables and yields a consistent estimate of the PCI. Indirect standardisation estimates the effects of the <b>standardising</b> variables on health from a health regression which excludes income. The coefficients on the <b>standardising</b> variables include some of the effects of income on health if income is correlated with the <b>standardising</b> variables. Using these coefficients to remove the effects of the <b>standardising</b> variables also removes some of the effect of income on health and leads to an inconsistent estimate of the PCI. Indirect standardisation underestimates the PCI irrespective of the signs of the correlations of <b>standardising</b> variables and income {{with each other and with}} health. An adaptation of the PCI when the marginal effect of income on health depends on the <b>standardising</b> variables is also proposed. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|The partial {{concentration}} index measures income related inequality in health (or health care) after removing {{the effects of}} <b>standardising</b> variables which affect health (or health care), are correlated with income but not amenable to policy. When the marginal effects of income are independent of the <b>standardising</b> variables, direct standardisation yields consistent estimates of the {{partial concentration}} index. Indirect standardisation underestimates the partial concentration index whenever the <b>standardising</b> variables are correlated with income, irrespective of {{the signs of the}} correlation of <b>standardising</b> variables and income {{with each other and with}} health. A generalised version of the partial concentration index is proposed for cases where the marginal effect of income depends on the <b>standardising</b> variables. Direct standardisation again yields a consistent estimate but indirect standardisation does not. It is also shown that the direct standardisation procedure can be applied to individual or grouped data and that the conclusions about the merits of direct and indirect standardisation hold for grouped data.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the legions {{underwent}} these transformations, the auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the auxilia had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into <b>standardised</b> units known as turmae (for cavalry alae) and centuriae (for infantry cohortes). Although never becoming as <b>standardised</b> in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was <b>standardised</b> to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ala quingenaria of 512 horsemen, or an ala millaria of 1,000 horsemen. Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.|$|E

New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E

5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably <b>standardised</b> {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E

5|$|Howard Staunton (1810– 22 June 1874) was an English chess master who is {{generally}} regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, {{largely as a result}} of his 1843 victory over Saint-Amant. He promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of <b>standardised</b> shape—the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cook—that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851, which made England the world's leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world's strongest player.|$|E
