5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered {{from a lack of}} available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built a few blocks away from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of Citizen Kane, where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E

5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke, {{named after}} the {{nickname}} for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was the first ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. The ship was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 23 August 1868, launched on 1 March 1870 and was completed on 1 January 1871, at a cost of £208,763. She was initially assigned as a First Reserve Guardship at Plymouth, but was assigned as the flagship of the China Station in September. En route to the Far East, she became the first ironclad to use the Suez canal; virtually all of her coal had to be unloaded to reduce her draught and she was towed by three tugboats through the canal in three days. Relieved by her sister ship, , Iron Duke returned to the UK in 1875. To <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the return ship, no tugboats were hired and the ship ran aground four times and frequently scraped the sides of the canal during her four-day transit. Upon her arrival, she was paid off in May.|$|E

25|$|When {{the city}} of Berlin planned the new Nord-Süd-Bahn, it ordered two cars in the Großprofil with a much greater width of 2.65 meters from the Linke-Hoffmann factory in Breslau. They were {{delivered}} in 1914 and put through trials by the Siemens company. The new cars with their bigger passenger capacity of 111 seats were intended to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the construction of platforms, because fewer cars were required to carry the passengers. This created a problem with platform access, which could only be solved in the 1950s and 1990s through enlargement of the platforms.|$|E

Councillor Smith led a faction that opposed building on the Island entirely. Other factions wanted to hold off approval until the Government of Canada agreed to pay a bigger share, or do further study, or build the island airport only. On July 9, 1937, {{after two days of}} debate, City Council voted 14–7 to approve the construction of both airports.|$|E

25|$|At {{their annual}} meeting in September 1861, Robert Skey stated that the canals brought some £60,000 in trade to the LNWR each year. However, the {{relationship}} with the LNWR was not always smooth, who were castigated at the 1862 meeting for failing to use powers which the Shropshire Union already had, to gain control of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire through the construction of new railways. At that time, the Shropshire Union were busy converting and extending a tramway which ran from Pontcysyllte to Afon-eitha to allow locomotives to run on it. The work was finished in 1867, and ran for a time with a borrowed locomotive, until they bought their own from Crewe works in 1870. To <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the maintenance of Trench Inclined Plane on the Shrewsbury Canal, the company leased Lubstree Wharf on the Humber Arm of the Newport Branch from 1870, and built a railway to Lilleshall Works, which provided most of the traffic on the Shrewsbury Canal.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 599 Comentiolus reopened the Gate of Trajan pass, near modern-day Ihtiman. This {{mountain}} pass had {{not been}} used by the Romans for decades. In 601 Peter advanced to the Tisza and kept the Avars away from the Danube cataracts, the latter being vital for the Roman Danube fleet in order to maintain access to the cities of Sirmium and Singidunum. In 602 Peter inflicted another severe defeat on the Slavs in Wallachia, whereas the Avar Khaganate was opposed by the Antes and was on the brink of collapse due to the mutiny of several Avar tribes. One of these rebellious tribes even defected to the Roman side. For the time, the Romans had successfully reestablished the Danube line, and forward defense in the hostile territories of Wallachia and Pannonia was waged with success. But when Maurice ordered the army to spend the winter of 602/603 on the northern bank of the Danube, as to further his success and to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> quarters, his troops mutinied as they had done in 593. While Priscus back then had used his own judgment and initiative, Peter did not dare disobey the emperor's orders. He therefore soon lost control of his army, which marched straight to Constantinople. This led to the well-known overthrow and death of Maurice, the first successful coup d'état in Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Webster's Yorkshire Bitter was {{launched}} {{in the summer of}} 1982. Largely a cask product, by 1984 Grand Metropolitan had transformed Yorkshire Bitter into a [...] "massive" [...] national brand, available in the company's 5,000 tied houses and 15,000 free houses. It was marketed as their response to the growing popularity of Yorkshire bitter in the south of England, particularly John Smith's. Yorkshire Bitter was the highest selling off trade bitter by 1985 with 18 per cent of the market. It had become the fifth best selling bitter nationally by 1989, helped by a competitive pricing policy, and was the highest selling bitter in London. The beer was not without its critics, with the 1990 Good Beer Guide describing it as [...] "weak flavour, reminiscent of a poor quality home brew – worty, bland, cloying, with a dirty finish on the tongue". In 1993, Yorkshire Bitter was reduced from 3.8 per cent [...] to 3.5 per cent ABV in order to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> duty.|$|E

[...] Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. [...] Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act. [...] A week later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. [...] She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52. [...] More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12October 1922. [...] Lloyd was penniless {{at the time of her}} death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{attempted}} {{to change the}} look of Star Trek to match the nautical atmosphere he envisioned and stay within budget. The Enterprise, for example, was given a ship's bell, boatswain's call, and more blinking lights and signage. To <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> set design, production designer Joseph Jennings used existing elements from The Motion Picture {{that had been left}} standing after filming was completed. Sixty-five percent of the film was shot on the same set; the bridge of the Reliant and the [...] "bridge simulator" [...] from the opening scene were redresses of the Enterprises bridge. The Klingon bridge from The Motion Picture was redressed as the transporter and torpedo rooms. The filmmakers stretched The Wrath of Khans budget by reusing models and footage from the first Star Trek film, including footage of the Enterprise in spacedock. The original ship miniatures were used where possible, or modified to stand in as new constructions. The orbital office complex from The Motion Picture was inverted and retouched to become the Regula I space station. Elements of the cancelled [...] television show, such as bulkheads, railings, and sets, were cannibalized and reused. A major concern for the designers was that the Reliant should be easily distinguishable from the Enterprise. The ship's design was flipped after Bennett accidentally opened and approved the preliminary Reliant designs upside-down.|$|E
500|$|Snowball V, later renamed Snowball II, is the Simpson family's fifth cat and {{is almost}} {{identical}} in appearance to Snowball II. In [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot", the Crazy Cat Lady gives Lisa {{one of her}} cats while she is mourning {{the death of her}} other four cats that are killed in the episode. Lisa then tells the cat to leave, as any cat that she owns is unlucky and is certain to be killed. As the cat starts to cross Evergreen Terrace, a car driven by Gil Gunderson drives past. As Gil swerves to avoid hitting the cat, his car hits a tree and bursts into flames, thereby giving him insurance compensation for his meals. Since the cat is intact and whole, Lisa takes it as a sign of good luck and adopts her. Lisa renames Snowball V [...] "Snowball II" [...] {{at the end of the}} episode, in her words [...] "to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> a new dish", also promising to act as if the whole thing did not actually happen. Snowball V also is the focus of a subplot in the sixteenth season episode [...] "The Seven-Beer Snitch", in which she becomes overweight after abandoning the Simpsons for brief periods to visit a different family but she then goes back to live with the Simpson family. Snowball V dies after being accidentally stabbed by Rachel's knife after Rachel tried to kill Marge in [...] "BFF RIP", but this is non-canon since this was a Treehouse of Horror segment.|$|E
