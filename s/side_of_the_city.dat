5|$|The {{irregular}} parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik {{consists of}} four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Minčeta Tower, and to the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, freestanding, St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as Lovrijenac), protects the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> from possible land and sea assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress {{is located on the}} southeast <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, the Scots {{were able}} to breach the wall using mines and artillery. By the mid-18th century the wall had become {{obsolete}} and, as the town was redeveloped, large sections were demolished leaving only parts standing. The most substantial remains are the West Walls, on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Fortress {{is placed}} {{at the top of}} the {{mountain}} Srđ, just above the city of Dubrovnik. It was built in 1806 by Marshal Marmont, called the Imperial, in honor of emperor Napoleon. The fortress was strategically important to defend the northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E
5|$|The east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{dates back}} to 1850 and has always {{contained}} higher end housing. The proximity and commanding view of the river kept these neighborhoods a fashionable address long after the original families departed. Lindsay Park, in The Village of East Davenport, was used as parade grounds for Civil War soldiers from Camp McClellan.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{takes on}} a more suburban residential character as the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area. There are separate interchanges for US12 (Michigan Avenue) and I-94 on the southeast <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Between I-94 and Washtenaw Avenue, US23 carries the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) moniker as well. That secondary designation leaves the freeway and runs west on Washtenaw Avenue into downtown Ann Arbor and {{the campus of the}} University of Michigan. At the same interchange, a Business US 23 (Bus. US23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US23 crosses the Huron River near the campus of the local community college and continues north to a junction with the M-14 freeway. The two merge and run westward along the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> before US23 turns north and M-14 curves south.|$|E

The tornado touched down southwest <b>of</b> Amarillo, near <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Hereford, then tracked it's way Northward, {{on a collision course with}} Amarillo. The tornado tore through {{the south and east}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> shortly after 8 pm. It ripped through Amarillo's most densely populated areas, demolishing almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> causing catastrophic damage, and loss of life.|$|R
50|$|I-635 was {{originally}} designated by <b>the</b> Texas Department <b>of</b> Transportation in 1959 as a loop around <b>the</b> eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Dallas, connecting with I-35E {{to the northwest}} and southwest <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
5|$|The three Universities {{are grouped}} around Oxford Road on the {{southern}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.|$|E
5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} the eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease {{to other parts of the}} country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and the other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary city busses 924 and 925 {{operate to}} <b>the</b> {{neighborhood}} <b>of</b> Ilha do Governador, and 915 to Bonsucesso. From both neighborhoods there are {{connections to the}} North and South <b>Sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ancien Pont is {{a bridge}} in Cotonou, Benin. The bridge crosses the Lagune de Cotonou which {{separates}} <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> It {{was built in}} 1928 and renovated in 1981.|$|R
50|$|Private ferries operate between Üsküdar and Beşiktaş or Kabataş in <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> few {{well-known}} geographic hazards are {{multiplied by}} ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> particularly for <b>the</b> largest ships.|$|R
5|$|From 1940 to 1944, Monson {{attended}} West High School in Salt Lake City. In {{the fall}} of 1944, he enrolled at the University of Utah. Around this time he met his future wife, Frances, whose family came from a higher social class on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Her father, Franz Johnson, saw an immediate connection because Monson's great uncle, Elias Monson, had baptized him into the LDS Church in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In 1066 William the Conqueror {{defeated}} the English army {{at the battle}} of Hastings and Norman forces advanced west into Worcestershire. To reinforce their occupation, the Normans built a motte and bailey castle on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> taking advantage of the shape of the existing burh walls. The remaining burh walls continued to be used into the Norman period, but the city had already spread beyond them, reducing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Grand Forks {{was chosen}} as the site for an Air Force base. Grand Forks Air Force Base brought {{thousands}} of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota became integral to the city's economy. With construction of federal highways, during the postwar years residential and business development became suburbanized, spreading to new areas as land was available. Interstate 29 was built on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> and two enclosed shopping malls – South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall – were built on the south side.|$|E
50|$|It is the {{one main}} road in Perth that has an eastern ending at a church - the Roman Catholic St Mary's Cathedral; the other major churches in the CBD are on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> streets.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>city</b> {{remained}} a quiet farming community for many years, but has seen {{growth in the}} past 35 years. Along with <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> Alan Shepard Elementary School, many new homes have been built on all four <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
25|$|Union {{forces had}} been {{constructing}} defensive works around Nashville since <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was occupied in February 1862. By 1864, a 7-mile-long semicircular Union defensive {{line on the}} south and west <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> protected Nashville from attacks from those directions. The line was studded with forts, the largest being Fort Negley. The trench line was extended to the west after December 1. The Cumberland River formed a natural defensive barrier on the north and east <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Smith's troops had arrived by river on November 30, and their transports had been escorted by a powerful fleet of tinclad and ironclad gunboats. Thus, the river barrier was well-defended.|$|R
5|$|In Washtenaw County, US12 {{passes through}} Benton {{in a rural}} {{southern}} section of the county. At Saline, the highway enters the suburban edge of the Ann Arbor–Ypsilanti metro area. US12 follows Michigan Avenue northeasterly through Saline and across an interchange with US23 before intersecting I-94 in Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships. US12 leaves Michigan Avenue to follow I-94 at that freeway's exit181; Michigan Avenue continues into downtown Ypsilanti as a city street. I-94/US12 skirts around the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and intersects {{the western end of}} Business US12 (Bus. US12) at Huron Street south of downtown. The freeway continues around the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and rounds the north end of Ford Lake. It is bounded by residential neighborhoods, and it crosses the Huron River on the eastern side of Ypsilanti. Near the Willow Run industrial complex and airport, US12 separates from I-94 and turns northeasterly along an expressway {{on the north side of}} the airport. There are three interchanges, including one for the eastern end of M-17 before US12 crosses into Wayne County and intersects the eastern end of Bus. US12.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Isidore H. Heller and his family, but what is known has been {{compiled}} through personal interviews as well as census and county records. Heller was born in Austria in 1847, and his wife, Ida, was born in Wisconsin in 1857. In America, Heller worked at Wolf, Sayer, and Heller: Packers and Butcher’s Supplies, which was located on Fulton Street, Chicago, on the northwest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Heller and Ida were later married and had three children, including Walter Heller, a Chicago investment banker.|$|E
5|$|Muni began {{service on}} December 28, 1912, when the A Geary-Park line was inaugurated, running between the Financial District and the Richmond District {{on the western}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Expansion {{of the system and}} {{consolidation}} with other transit companies eventually made Muni the city's sole public transit operator in 1952, when it acquired the bankrupt California Street Cable Railroad. Subsequent changes and adjustments to the system gave rise to the lines in use today.|$|E
50|$|Lyubutsk (Lyubutsk, Lyubutesk, Любутск) was a Russian fortress, {{located about}} 4 km below the {{confluence}} the Oka River with Dugna in the present-day Kaluga Oblast. Its name derives from a rivulet flowing on northern and eastern <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>city</b> is {{situated}} at <b>the</b> confluence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Little Kanawha and Ohio rivers.

5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Mackinac Bridge, {{travelers}} wishing to venture from St. Ignace to Mackinaw City had to do so via ferry. M-122 began at US2 (now Business Loop Interstate 75) near Straits State Park and traveled through town along Ferry Road where it ran southeasterly from the main highway. East of Hornbach Street M-122 curved around to the east near Paro Street. The highway ended at the State Ferry Docks on the southeast <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> next to the Coast Guard station.|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{has some}} remains of Prehistorical {{architecture}} {{which can be}} seen on the Tumba Madžari Neolithic site. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> lie the remains of the ancient Scupi, with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, located between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. It seems to have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was already out of use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonné masonry.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in sympathy for the rebel cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.|$|E
