40|$|Abstract: An {{optically}} thin resonator suspended over a substrate and illuminated with a laser {{forms an}} interference field that couples deflection of the resonator to absorption within it. For high enough laser powers, such resonators {{have been shown}} to be interferometrically transduced to <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> due to the feedback between heating and deflection. The coupling between thermal stresses, deflection, and absorption is the driving mechanism of such oscillations. In this work we study the deflection of doubly supported micro-beams under steady state heating, and illustrate the role of thermal strains and deformation of the beam supports on deflection and ultimately on the laser power level needed to induce <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations.</b> 1.

50|$|The {{conditions}} for feedback follow the Barkhausen stability criterion, namely that, with sufficiently high gain, a <b>stable</b> <b>oscillation</b> can (and usually will) {{occur in a}} feedback loop whose frequency is such that the phase delay is an integer multiple of 360 degrees and the gain at that frequency is equal to 1. If the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified. Sound will be produced without anyone actually playing. The sound level will increase until the output starts clipping, reducing the loop gain to exactly unity. This is the principle upon which electronic oscillators are based; although in that case the feedback loop is purely electronic, the principle is the same. If the gain is large, but slightly less than 1, then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created, but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system, such as through a microphone.|$|E

The coexistence of two <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> depends on the driving force and tip-surface separation. Increasing the driving force inhibits the low-amplitude oscillation state.

40|$|Haplodiploid sex {{determination}} allows unmated females to produce sons. Consequently, {{a scarcity of}} males {{may lead to a}} significant proportion of females remaining unmated, which may in turn give rise to a surfeit of males in the following generation. <b>Stable</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the sex ratio has been predicted by classic models, and it remains a puzzle as to why this is not observed in natural populations. Here, I investigate the dynamics of sex allocation over ecological and evolutionary timescales to assess the potential for sustained oscillation. I find that, whilst <b>stable</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the sex ratio is possible, the scope for such dynamical behavior is reduced if sex allocation strategies are evolutionary labile, especially if mated females may facultatively adjust their sex allocation according to the present availability of mating partners. My model, taken together with empirical estimates of female unmatedness in haplodiploid taxa, suggests that sustained oscillation of the sex ratio is implausible in natural populations. However, this phenomenon may be relevant to artificially introduced biological control agents. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the amplitudes of optical solitons in nonlinear multisequence optical waveguide coupler systems with weak linear and cubic gain-loss exhibit large <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> along ultra-long distances. The large <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> are caused by supercritical Hopf bifurcations of the equilibrium states of the Lotka-Volterra (LV) models for dynamics of soliton amplitudes. The predictions of the LV models are confirmed by numerical simulations with the coupled cubic nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) propagation models with 2 < N < 4 pulse sequences. Thus, we provide the first demonstration of intermediate nonlinear amplitude dynamics in multisequence soliton systems, described by the cubic NLS equation. Our findings are also an important step towards realization of spatio-temporal chaos with multiple periodic sequences of colliding NLS solitons.

40|$|International audienceA {{method for}} the {{generation}} of attractive and neutrally stable limit cycles for nonlinear systems is presented. It consists in designing an output that, when regulated through a suitable feedback, forces {{the existence of a}} limit cycle or neutral oscillations in the zero dynamics. Conditions are then given to ensure that those characteristics of the zero-dynamics translate to the whole system. A particular focus is made on the gen- eration of neutrally <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> through that method, because it is not always easy to build an output that results in the existence of a limit-cycle in the zero-dynamics. A special case where such a difficulty arises is given in the analysis of oscillations generation around the up- per vertical for the pendubot.

40|$|The <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> of {{pulsating}} stars {{can serve}} as accurate timepieces, which may be monitored for the influence of exoplanets. An external companion gravitationally tugs the host star, causing periodic changes in pulsation arrival times.

However, it is applicable to any pulsating star with sufficiently <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Care {{must be taken to}} ensure that the changes in pulsation arrival times are not caused by intrinsic stellar variability; an external, light-travel-time effect from an exoplanet identically affects all pulsation modes.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the chaotic atomic population oscillations between two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with time-dependent asymmetric trap potential. In the perturbative regime, the population oscillations can be described by the Duffing equation, and the chaotic oscillations near the separatrix solution are analyzed. The sufficient-necessary conditions for <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> depend on the physical parameters and initial conditions sensitively. The first-order necessary condition indicates that the Melnikov function is equal to zero, so the <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> are Melnikov chaotic. For the ordinary parameters and initial conditions, the chaotic dynamics is simulated with numerical calculation. If the damping is absent, with the increasing of the trap asymmetry, the regular oscillations become chaotic gradually, the corresponding stroboscopic Poincare sections (SPS) vary from a single island to more islands, and then the chaotic sea. For the completely chaotic oscillations, the long-term localization disappears and the short-term localization can be changed {{from one of the}} BECs to the other through the route of Rabi oscillation. When there exists damping, the stationary chaos disappears, the transient chaos is a common phenomenon before regular <b>stable</b> frequency locked <b>oscillations.</b> And proper damping can keep localization long-lived.

Moreover, the existence of <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> prior to extinction found for propane air mixture is controlled by hydrogen substitution: the presence of hydrogen in the mixture leads to a narrower region of existence of <b>stable</b> <b>oscillations</b> and shifts them to values of the operating parameters far away from the typical operating conditions of lean premixed combustion.
