5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by <b>some</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
25|$|The law {{has been}} {{compared}} to Wisconsin's Equal Pay Enforcement Act which was repealed by Governor Scott Walker. The Wisconsin law was criticized by <b>some</b> <b>conservatives</b> for allegedly making sex discrimination lawsuits financially attractive to female employees.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, all Orthodox and <b>some</b> <b>Conservative</b> {{authorities}} forbid {{the consumption}} of processed grape products made by non-Jews, due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals. <b>Some</b> <b>Conservative</b> authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.|$|R

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>conservatives</b> {{argue that}} forcing {{people to buy}} private {{insurance}} is unconstitutional; legislators in 38 states have introduced bills opposing the new law, and 18 states have filed suit in federal court challenging the unfunded mandates on individuals and states.|$|E
25|$|That {{there was}} no written record to {{demonstrate}} that she was either a strict constructionist or originalist in her approach to constitutional interpretation. <b>Some</b> <b>conservatives</b> feared that she would support abortion rights, affirmative action and gay rights if ever confirmed to {{a seat on the}} Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Reception to the Green Bible {{has also}} been {{differed}} among political leaders. Larry Schweiger, President of the National Wildlife Federation praised the Green Bible for giving “solid context” for environmentalism. In contrast, <b>some</b> <b>conservatives,</b> like talk show host Pat Gray, accused the Green Bible of merely being a marketing gimmick and money-making scheme for HarperCollins.|$|E

25|$|Critics, {{including}} <b>some</b> <b>conservatives,</b> {{complained that}} Romney was using these fees increases {{as a tax}} increase in disguise after having promised he would not raise taxes. Romney said that the fees were distinct from taxes because fees were charged for particular services provided whereas taxes were assessed more broadly, without expectation of any specific services — although critics noted that this explanation applied to {{only some of the}} fees Romney proposed.|$|E
25|$|On foreign policy, <b>some</b> <b>conservatives,</b> {{especially}} neoconservatives {{and those}} in the National Review circle, supported Obama's policy of a surge in Afghanistan, air raids to support the insurgents in Libya, and the war on terror, especially after he ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May 2011. At issue in 2012 was the efficacy of diplomacy and sanctions in stopping Iran from building nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|For Super Bowl XLVIII, The Coca-Cola Company aired a {{multilingual}} {{version of}} the song, sung in several different languages. The commercial received some criticism on social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, and from <b>some</b> <b>conservatives,</b> such as Glenn Beck. Despite the controversies, Coca-Cola later reused the Super Bowl ad during Super Bowl LI, the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2016 Summer Olympics and in patriotic holidays.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox liturgies include prayers {{lamenting the}} {{inability}} to perform the Temple service and petitioning for its restoration, which Conservative synagogues generally omit. In <b>some</b> <b>Conservative</b> synagogues, only the Hazzan (cantor) engages in full prostration. <b>Some</b> <b>Conservative</b> synagogues abridge the recitation of the Avodah service to varying degrees, and some omit it entirely. Many Reform and Reconstructionist services omit the entire service as inconsistent with modern sensibilities.|$|R

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>conservatives</b> have {{intensely}} criticized Doonesbury. Several {{examples are}} {{cited in the}} Milestones section of the strip's website. The strip has also met criticism from its readers almost since it began syndicated publication. For example, when Lacey Davenport's husband Dick, in the last moments before his death, calls on God, several conservative pundits called the strip blasphemous. The sequence of Dick Davenport's final bird-watching and fatal heart attack was run in November 1986.|$|E
25|$|Brown remains {{controversial}} among traditionalist Catholics {{because of}} their claim that he denied the inerrancy of the whole of scripture and {{cast doubt on the}} historical accuracy of numerous articles of the Catholic faith. <b>Some</b> <b>conservatives</b> were angered at his questioning of whether the virginal conception of Jesus could be proven historically. He was regarded as occupying the center ground in the field of biblical studies, opposing the literalism found among many fundamentalist Christians while not carrying his conclusions as far as many other scholars.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Conservatives campaigned {{with the}} {{conviction}} {{to cut the}} perceived bureaucracy of the modern police force and pledged greater legal protection to people convicted of defending themselves against intruders. They also supported {{the creation of a}} UK Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act 1998, but this was vetoed by their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats. <b>Some</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> particularly within the socially conservative Cornerstone Group, support the re-introduction of the death penalty; although the majority of party members oppose it.|$|E

25|$|Prussia's {{dominance}} {{had made}} the following forty years peaceful in the Baltic region, and by the outbreak of World War I, neutrality seemed a natural state to many Swedes. Although feelings of cultural and scientific kinship with the German Empire were strong in Sweden, mercantile and personal ties with Britain and France were strong as well. Opinion was split between Conservatives, with sympathies for Germany, and Liberals, with more mixed sympathies. Organized but politically less influential were the Social Democrats, antimilitarists and opposed to the war. The neutralist stance was reinforced when Denmark and Norway remained neutral. Voices for neutrality dominated the public debate, but Queen Victoria and <b>some</b> <b>conservatives</b> were strong advocates for entrance {{in the war on}} the German side, and the government's policy had a clear pro-German bias.|$|E
25|$|The Army was {{the site}} of a {{cultural}} clash of new, democratic French traditions and old Polish customs, with clashes on the role of nobility in the military – with <b>some</b> <b>conservatives</b> attempting to restrict the officer rank to the nobles. The French revolutionary and civic traditions, passed through veteran legionnaires, resulted in more motivation of the peasant recruits, compared to the army of the old Commonwealth. The educational role of the army is seen as one of its major if unintended successes. The army was also improved due to the modernization and adoption of modern French military rules and tactics. Overall, the era of the Duchy of Warsaw marked a period of modernization of the Polish Army, with a new military doctrine and science that was codified by Polish military scholar of that era, Ignacy Prądzyński.|$|E
25|$|Edgerton L. Henry, {{known as}} Bubba Henry (born February 10, 1936), is a Baton Rouge attorney, lobbyist, and {{partner of the}} high-powered firm Adams and Reese {{who served as a}} Democrat in the House of Representatives from 1968 to 1980. He was Speaker from 1972 to 1980. Henry was Governor Edwin Washington Edwards's choice for Speaker. Though he was {{considered}} reform-minded, <b>some</b> <b>conservatives</b> still questioned Henry's commitment to reform. In 1979, Henry finished in a weak fifth place in the nonpartisan blanket primary in his bid to succeed Edwards as governor. Thereafter, he was commissioner of administration for the new governor, Republican David C. Treen, then of Jefferson Parish. After Treen left office, Henry retired from elective and appointive office to concentrate on his law practice and lobbying activities. He joined Adams and Reese in 1987. One of his major clients is State Farm Insurance, and he lobbies on behalf of the payday lending industry in Louisiana {{as a representative of the}} Community Financial Services Association of America.|$|E

25|$|Gray Davis critics often {{charge that}} he did not respond {{properly}} to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis' energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. <b>Some</b> <b>conservatives</b> argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis {{is considered one of the}} major factors that led to Davis' recall.|$|E
500|$|One month later, on October 4, Mike Duffy, who {{was later}} {{appointed}} as a Conservative senator by Harper, said [...] "It {{is possible that}} you could change prime minister without having an election", and that <b>some</b> <b>Conservatives</b> wanted Harper to temporarily become prime minister without holding an election. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.|$|E
500|$|The LCL had {{routinely}} ignored such protests before, but Hall's course {{differed from}} what was expected. He appointed Millhouse his Attorney-General, and continued a raft of social reform that had begun under the previous Labor government. This was opposed by <b>some</b> <b>conservatives</b> within the party; lines began to be drawn, and factions began to appear. Hall commented in the party's newsletter that [...] "too many people see the LCL as a party tied to conservative traditions. We must show voters that we can move with the times, that we are 'with it'." ...|$|E
