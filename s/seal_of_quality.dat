Each SIE unit has its own evaluation process; SIEE, for example, approved Billy the Wizard for its consumers but SIEA did not. The company sometimes imposes additional restrictions, such as when it prohibited PS and PS2 games from being ported to the PSP without 30% of content being new to the Sony console.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, many American {{retailers}} considered {{video games}} a passing fad, and greatly reduced sales of such products, or stopped them entirely. To avoid {{the stigma of}} video game consoles, Nintendo marketed the AVS as a full home computer, with an included keyboard, cassette data recorder, and a BASIC interpreter software cartridge. The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the Family BASIC package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the Famicom Data Recorder. The AVS also included a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a musical keyboard, and the Zapper light gun. The AVS Zapper is hinged, allowing it to straighten out into a wand form, or bend into a gun form. The AVS uses a wireless infrared interface for all its components, including keyboard, cassette deck, and controllers. Most of the peripherals for the Advanced Video System are {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic grey monochrome design, with the top and bottom portions in different shades, a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The AVS also features a boxier design than the Famicom: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight. Its software carries the Nintendo <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quality</b> to communicate the company's approval.|$|E

A survey of 34 ODR providers is presented with information on service models, communication types, functionalities, ADR services and other off-ADR services such as <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> or formation activities. The survey shows that in most ODR services, IT is not fully employed and web 2. 0 /web 3. 0 tools are barely used at all. Consequently, ODR systems do not yet benefit from the opportunities these technologies could provide. Our survey also shows that there are less active ODR services providers today than only a few years ago...|$|R

The research shows {{the state of the}} art of ODR today. It presents the technologies, processes and products currently existing in the global market. According to this, a table of 34 ODR providers is developed which covers information on service models, communication types, functionalities, ADR services and other off-ADR services such as <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> or formation activities. The outcome shows that IT is not fully employed within the current ODR systems and web 2. 0 /web 3. 0 tools are not used at all. Consequently, ODR systems do not benefit from the opportunities these technologies could provide. According to our research, today there are less ODR services providers than only a few years ago and this seems a trend for the near future...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades we have {{witnessed}} an increasing interest of scholars and especially operators in service quality in the lodging business. Firstly, it is important to observe that the diverseness of the hospitality industry also affects the classification <b>of</b> hotel <b>quality.</b> We can actually find many programmes, classifications and <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> promoted by public authorities and private companies that create confusion in the consumer perceptions <b>of</b> hotel <b>quality.</b> Moreover, new electronic distribution channels and their ratings are becoming a new way to gather information about a hotel and its quality. Secondly, a point that can cause complications is that different countries and regions can choose differing approaches depending on the features of the classification (number of levels, symbols used, etc.) {{and the nature of the}} programme (public, private). Considering these assumptions and the recent changes in the Italian hotel classification system, this paper aims to analyse the situation in Italy, underlining both its positive and negative aspects and comparing it with other European and North American cases. Based on a review of literature and tourism laws as well as personal interviews with public authorities and exponents of the private sectors, we were able to identify critical issues and trends in hotel classification systems. The comparison of case studies shows a heterogeneous situation. Points in common are the scale and the symbol used but, if we analyse the requirements of each category, we discover very different circumstances, also sometimes in the same country. A future European classification system could be possible only after a standardization of minimum requirements and criteria at a national level. In this situation brands and online consumers’ feedbacks become even more considered by the customers in the hospitality industry...|$|R

50|$|In {{the spring}} {{campaign}} of 2006, the first domestic structures were found inside the casemate wall. Unlike their Iron Age counterparts, these houses have sizable ground plans. The width of their walls {{suggests that they}} possessed a number of floors. To date, three courtyard houses and parts of another two very monumental elaborate buildings {{north and south of}} the area have been excavated. On the floor of the monumental building in the north of area I, in an area of one and a half meters by one and a half meters, twenty-three cylinder <b>seals</b> <b>of</b> varying <b>quality</b> and image type were found (in the surroundings five others). It would seem that the seals, together with a silver pendant decorated with a standing figure (5.8 x 3.4 centimeters), a large scarab amulet (3.7 x 2.4 x 1.4 centimeters) and dozens of beads, fell to the ground from a higher surface (a table, cupboard or shelf) during the destruction of the house and were left scattered over the floor.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePlanar patch-clamp is a {{two-dimensional}} variation of traditional patch-clamp. By contrast to classical glass micropipette, the <b>seal</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> silicon patch-clamp chips (i. e. seal resistance and seal success rate) have remained poor {{due to the}} planar geometry {{and the nature of}} the substrate and thus partially obliterate the advantages related to planar patch-clamp. The characterization of physical parameters involved in seal formation is thus of major interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that the physical characterization of surfaces by a set of techniques (Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), surface energy (polar and dispersive contributions), drop angles, impedance spectroscopy, combined with a statistical design of experiments (DOE)) allowed us discriminating chips that provide relevant performances for planar patch-clamp analysis. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> <b>quality</b> demonstrate that dispersive interactions and micropore size are the most crucial physical parameters of chip surfaces, by contrast to surface roughness and dielectric membrane thickness. This multi-scale study combined with electrophysiological validation of chips on a diverse set of cell-types expressing various ion channels (IRK 1, hERG and hNa(v) 1. 5 channels) unveiled a suitable patch-clamp chip candidate. This original approach may inspire novel strategies for selecting appropriate surface parameters dedicated to biochips...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a micromachined resonator to verify the vacuum pressure and <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> cavities in micromechanical components. We use an electrostatic driven and capacitively sensed bulk silicon resonator fabricated by Bonding and Deep Reactive Ion Etching (BDRIE) technology. The resonator operates at the first fundamental frequency. The damping is used as a degree of the pressure. Transversal comb structures act as squeeze film damping sources. Post-processing gap reduction substructures are used to increase the damping in the vacuum pressure range. This method makes it possible to observe the pressure over the time of smallest gas volumes by monitoring the damping of integrated micro mechanical resonant structures. Therewith it is possible to estimate the hermetic <b>sealing</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the closed sensor package. A transfer curve with a logarithmic characteristic is measured...|$|R
