40|$|Purpose: To {{synthesize}} and {{characterize the}} dextran conjugates of <b>suprofen</b> and flurbiprofen, and also evaluate their biological activities. Methods: <b>Suprofen</b> and flurbiprofen were individually reacted with carbonyldiimidazole to form acylimidazole, which, in turn, was reacted with the dextran of varying molecular weight (40 000, 60 000, and 110 000) to form drug-dextran conjugates. The {{structures of the}} synthesized dextran conjugates were confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopy. In vitro hydrolysis of the conjugates were studied in buffer solutions (pH 7. 4 and 9. 0) and 80 % human plasma (pH 7. 4). The analgesic and antipyretic activities, {{as well as the}} ulcerogenic index of the conjugates were also evaluated in albino rats. Results: The mean degree of substitution of flurbiprofen and <b>suprofen</b> was between 8. 0 to 9. 5 % and 7. 5 to 9. 0 %, respectively. In vitro hydrolysis studies on the conjugates indicate faster hydrolysis at pH 9. 0 than in pH 7. 4 buffer solution and 80 % human plasma (pH 7. 4) with the process following First order kinetics. The analgesic activity of flurbiprofen-dextran conjugate (FD- 110) suprofen-dextran conjugate (SD- 110) was 64. 23 and 41. 50 % which compare well with those of their parent drugs- flurbiprofen (72. 60 %) and <b>suprofen</b> (44. 30 %). Similar findings were made in respect of the antipyretic activity.

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} of <b>suprofen</b> (SPF) {{was investigated}} by femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA), resonance Raman (RR) and nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman (ns-TR 3) spectroscopic methods to gain additional information {{so as to}} better elucidate the possible photochemical reaction mechanism of <b>suprofen</b> in several different solvents. In neat acetonitrile (MeCN), the fs-TA and ns-TR 3 experimental data indicated that the lowest lying excited singlet state S 1 (nπ*) underwent an efficient intersystem crossing process (ISC) to the excited triplet state T 3 (ππ*), followed by an internal conversion (IC) process to T 1 (ππ*). In the aqueous solution, a triplet biradical species (3 ETK- 1) was obtained {{as the product of}} a decarboxylation process from triplet <b>suprofen</b> anion (3 SPF−) and the reaction rate of the decarboxylation process was determined by the concentration of H 2 O. A protonation process for 3 ETK- 1 leads to formation of a neutral species (3 ETK- 3) that was directly observed by ns-TR 3 spectra, then this 3 ETK- 3 species decayed via ISC process to generate final product. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Photobinding {{of drugs}} to biomolecules {{constitutes}} an important early {{event in the}} onset of photoallergy. In the present work, UV irradiation of human serum albumin {{in the presence of}} either <b>suprofen</b> (SUP) or its major photoproduct, decarboxylated <b>suprofen</b> (DSUP), has been studied as a model system for drug-photosensitised protein binding. Both dark binding and binding in the presence of light were investigated since this will affect the mode, site and mechanism of drug interaction with the protein. In order to determine the binding features of SUP to albumin, competitive binding experiments were carried out using fluorescent probes specific for site I and II. <b>Suprofen</b> was found to selectively dark bind to site II on HSA. Photobinding of DSUP to HSA was more efficient than SUP. Parallel to this, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of HSA decreased when the protein was previously irradiated {{in the presence of the}} photoactive compounds, again being DSUP more efficient compared with SUP. As fluorescence quenching involves electron transfer from the excited Trp to the ground state DSUP, it follows that the photoactive compound binding to HSA must be on (or in close proximity to) site I Trp(214) residue. It appears that photobinding of SUP is largely preceded by its photodecomposition to DSUP which, in turn, associates and photobinds to HSA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The enantiomeric {{separation}} {{of a series}} of acidic pharmaceuticals (mostly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) has been investigated in NACE systems using single-isomer amino beta-CD derivatives. The first part of this study consisted of the selection of the basic experimental conditions to separate efficiently the enantiomers of acidic drugs. Several parameters, such as the nature of the ionic BGE components, were studied and a methanolic solution of ammonium acetate containing the cationic CD was selected as BGE. A D-optimal design with 20 experimental points was then applied and the nature and concentration of the CD were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the enantiomeric resolution for all studied compounds. Resolution (R(s)) values were always higher with 6 -monodeoxy- 6 -mono(3 -hydroxy) propylamino-beta-CD (PA-beta-CD) compared to those obtained with 6 -monodeoxy- 6 -mono(2 -hydroxy) propylamino-beta-CD (IPA-beta-CD). However, the latter led to shorter migration times.

The {{effect of the}} type of stationary phase, the chiral column Chirobiotic V or the achiral stationary phases Nucleosil 100 C 8 HD and Nucleosil 100 C 18 HD, and the concentration of vancomycin in the mobile phase on separation of the drug enantiomers were evaluated. All the drugs, except flobufen, were successfully enantioseparated on Nucleosil 100 C 8 HD with 4 mM vancomycin present in the mobile phase (composed of methanol and buffer) in the reversed phase mode. On the vancomycin-bonded chiral stationary phase, it was difficult to get enantioseparations of the profen NSAIDs. However, flobufen gave better enantioseparation on the vancomycin CSP. The better enantioresolution of the majority of profen derivatives on the achiral columns with vancomycin added to the mobile phase can be attributed in particular to the higher separation efficiency of this capillary chromatographic system. In addition, vancomycin dimers, formed in the mobile phase, seem to offer a better steric arrangement for stereoselective interaction to these analytes than the vancomycin bonded on the CSP.

40|$|The role of {{hydrogen}} bonding in the solubilization and stabilization effects of structurally-related drugs on polyethylene glycol in amorphous dispersions Purpose. Indomethacin has recently showed {{to be able}} to solubilize semicrystalline polyethylene glycol (PEG) and stabilize the amorphous polymer in their dispersions [1]. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the role {{of hydrogen}} bonding in the solubilization and stabilization effects of the drug on the semicrystalline polymer. Methods. Dispersions made up of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) were prepared by heating the mixture of the two components to above the melting temperatures of both components, followed by solidification of the melt. Thermal properties of dispersions were analyzed using modulated differential scanning calorimetry. Fourier transform infrared spectra were measured on a spectrometer equipped with a platinum attenuated total reflection accessory. For X-ray diffraction analysis, samples were mounted on a (thermostated) sample holder and diffractograms were recorded using an automated diffractometer. Results. The solubilization and stabilization effects of drug on semicrystalline polymer were observed for dispersions of PEG and indomethacin (IMC) as well as a series of IMC structurally-related drugs such as ketoprofen, <b>suprofen,</b> tiaprofenic acid and flurbiprofen, which points to structure-properties relationship. These effects are independent on the molecular weight of the polymer. Hydrogen bonds formed between PEG and APIs in the liquid dispersions were reflected by shifts in API acid carbonyl and PEG hydroxyl stretching vibrations; however, hydrogen bonding was disappearing in the solid state upon solidification of PEG that resulted in the segregation of APIs from the crystalline polymer. Conclusions. This work demonstrates the role of hydrogen bonding in the solubilization and stabilization effects of structurally-related drugs on PEG in their liquid dispersions, and the disruption of the bonds upon crystallization of the polymer.

40|$|Cholesterol (Ch) is an {{important}} lipidic building block and a target for oxidative degradation, which can be induced via free radicals or singlet oxygen (1 O 2). <b>Suprofen</b> (SP) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that contains the 2 -benzoylthiophene (BZT) chromophore and has a π,π* lowest triplet excited state. In the present work, dyads (S) - and (R) -SP-α-Ch (1 and 2), as well as (S) -SP-β-Ch (3) have been prepared from β- or α-Ch and SP to investigate the possible competition between photogeneration of biradicals and 1 O 2, the key mechanistic steps in Ch photooxidation. Steady-state irradiation of 1 and 2 was performed in dichloromethane, under nitrogen, through Pyrex, using a 400 W medium pressure mercury lamp. The spectral analysis of the separated fractions revealed formation of two photoproducts 4 and 5, respectively. By contrast, under the same conditions, 3 did not give rise to any isolable Ch-derived product. These results point to an intramolecular hydrogen abstraction in 1 and 2 from the C 7 position of Ch and subsequent C–C coupling of the generated biradicals. Interestingly, 2 was significantly more photoreactive than 1 indicating a clear stereodifferentiation in the photochemical behavior. Transient absorption spectra obtained for 1 – 3 were very similar and matched that described for the SP triplet excited state (typical bands with maxima at ca. 350 nm and 600 nm). Direct kinetic analysis of the decay traces at 620 nm led to determination of triplet lifetimes that were ca. 4. 1 μs for 1 and 2 and 5. 8 μs for 3. From these data, the intramolecular quenching rate constants in 1 and 2 were determined as 0. 78 × 10 5 s − 1. The capability of dyads 1 – 3 to photosensitize the production of singlet oxygen was assessed by time-resolved near infrared emission studies in dichloromethane using perinaphthenone as standard. The quantum yields (Φ Δ) were 0. 52 for 1 and 2 and 0. 56 for 3. In conclusion, SP-α-Ch dyads are unique {{in the sense that}} they can be used to photogenerate both biradicals and singlet oxygen, thus being able to initiate Ch oxidation from their triplet excited states following either of the two competing mechanistic pathways...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} CYP enzymes in the human liver. CYP 2 C 9 metabolizes more than 100 therapeutic drugs, including tolbutamide, glyburide, diclofenac, celecoxib, torasemide, phenytoin losartan, and S-warfarin. Some natural and herbal compounds are also metabolized by CYP 2 C 9, probably leading to the formation of toxic metabolites. CYP 2 C 9 also plays a role in the metabolism of several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and arachidonic acid. Many CYP 2 C 9 substrates are weak acids, but CYP 2 C 9 also has the capacity to metabolise neutral, highly lipophilic compounds. A number of ligand-based and homology models of CYP 2 C 9 have been reported and this has provided insights into the binding of ligands to the active site of CYP 2 C 9. Data from the site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that a number of residues (e. g. Arg 97, Phe 110, Val 113, Phe 114, Arg 144, Ser 286, Asn 289, Asp 293 and Phe 476) play an important role in ligand binding and determination of substrate specificity. The resolved crystal structures of CYP 2 C 9 have confirmed the importance of these residues in substrate recognition and ligand orientation. CYP 2 C 9 is activated by dapsone and its analogues and R-lansoprazole in a stereo-specific and substrate-dependent manner, probably through binding to the active site and inducing positive cooperativity. CYP 2 C 9 is subject to induction by rifampin, phenobarbital, and dexamethasone, indicating the involvement of pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the regulation of CYP 2 C 9. A number of compounds have been found to inhibit CYP 2 C 9 and this may provide an explanation for some clinically important drug interactions. Tienilic acid, <b>suprofen</b> and silybin are mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP 2 C 9. Given the critical role of CYP 2 C 9 in drug metabolism and the presence of polymorphisms, it is important to identify drug candidates as potential substrates, inducer or inhibitors of CYP 2 C 9 in drug development and drug discovery scientists should develop drugs with minimal interactions with this enzyme. Further studies are warranted to explore the molecular determinants for ligand-CYP 2 C 9 binding and the structure-activity relationships...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS Dispersions made up of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) were prepared by heating the mixture of the two components to above the melting temperatures of both components, followed by solidification of the melt. Thermal properties of dispersions were analyzed using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (m-DSC). The samples were kept isothermal at 165 °C during 3 minutes before cooling to - 75 °C at the cooling rate of 2 °C/min and subsequently reheating to 165 °C at 5 °C/min with a modulating amplitude of 0. 636 °C and a period of 40 seconds. For X-ray diffraction analysis, samples were mounted on a (thermostated) sample holder and scanned over a range of 4 °≤ 2 θ≤ 40 ° using a step size of 0. 0167 ° and counting time of 200 seconds. Diffractograms were recorded using an automated diffractometer. The crystallinity of PEG was used as an indicator to monitor the crystallization process of the polymer. The crystallinity data were fitted to the Avrami equation by nonlinear curve fitting. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Increasing the drug loading results in higher stability and slows down the crystallization rate of the amorphous polymer which is contradiction to the behavior normally observed with solid dispersions. Drug loading seems to influence the growth geometries of PEG crystals as well as microstructure of dispersions, possibly by changing the interplay between the crystallization rate of the polymer and the diffusion rate of API molecules. At 52 % indomethacin (IMC), PEG was completely transformed to the amorphous state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed investigation of the solubilization effect of a low molecular weight drug on a semi-crystalline polymer in their dispersions. In mixtures containing 35 % to 55 % IMC, the dispersions exhibited distinct glass transition events resulting from amorphous-amorphous phase separation that generates polymer-rich and drug-rich domains upon the solidification of supercooled PEG. In contrast, samples containing below 30 % or above 60 % IMC showed a single amorphous phase during the period in which crystallization normally occurs. The same phenomena were also observed for dispersions of PEG and a series of IMC structurally-related drugs such as ketoprofen, <b>suprofen,</b> tiaprofenic acid and flurbiprofen, which points to structure-properties relationship. CONCLUSIONS For the first time it has been elaborately shown that a small drug molecule can completely transform a semi-crystalline polymer into the amorphous state. Increasing the weight fraction of drug results in higher stability and slows down the crystallization rate of the amorphous polymer. Drug loading seems to influence the microstructure of dispersions by changing the polymer crystallization rate. Depending on the variation between the crystallization rate of PEG and the diffusion rate of API, the crystallization of the polymer may produce a single amorphous phase or generate amorphous-amorphous phase separation, forming polymer-rich domain and drug-rich domain which exhibits distinct glass transition temperatures. The current study clearly demonstrates large variation in the crystallization behavior of API/PEG dispersions as a function of drug loading. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE WORK Microstructure of API/PEG dispersions should be clarified by using polarized light microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. The Influence of API structure and API-PEG interaction on crystallization behavior of dispersions is also of importance. In addition, the crystallization rate of PEG and the diffusion rate of API molecules will be measured to verify the hypothesis of the crystallization kinetics of pharmaceutical semicrystalline dispersions based on the competition between these two factors. status: publishe...|$|E
