40|$|A {{new concept}} of the exoskeleton-type masterarm, {{composed}} of <b>serial</b> <b>links,</b> is introduced in this paper. To provide maximum range of human motion, several redundant joints {{are added to the}} <b>serial</b> <b>links.</b> In order {{to reduce the number of}} joints to be measured, kinematics of <b>serial</b> <b>links</b> was taken into consideration in design. Three measurable, controllable joints and three redundant free joints are used for the upper arm (shoulder), similarly to the forearm (wrist) while one measurable, controllable joint is used for the elbow. In particular, a torque sensor beam is designed for fine force reflection using the strain gauge. It detects the torque as well as its direction applied by the human operator, which allows the electric brake to be used as an actuator for force reflection. The electric brake constrains the joint movement so that the operator can feel the force. This electric brake outperforms the motor in terms of torque/weight ratio and makes the device light and compact. This masterarm measures the movement of the operator’s arm precisely, and it can be used for teleoperation with a slave robot, or as a motion planner for an industrial robot. ...|$|R

40|$|A 32 x 32 {{synchronous}} crossbar chip {{was designed}} in a 0. 27 pm CMOS technology {{for use in}} a high-speed network switch [I]. The crossbar chip uses 32 Asymmetric <b>Serial</b> <b>Links</b> [2][3] to achieve high speed at the interfaces and to reduce both power and area. The crossbar switch core is implemented with static CMOS multi-stage multiplexors with multicast capability. The chip operates successfully with links running at 1. 6 Gb/s. The measured bit-error-rate is < when all channels and the switch core are operating. The crossbar chip consumes 5 W and provides a total bandwidth above 50 Gb/s. Architecture Crossbar switches are increasingly used for high capacity network switches [I]. Using high-speed <b>serial</b> <b>links</b> for the YO interface of a crossbar switch chip can reduce the number of VO pins required to provide a given bandwidth. A crossbar chip, which has many links converging on it, tends to be large and power-hungry because of the F silicon area and power consumed by the timing circuits (usually PLLs) and transceivers. To reduce both power and area, we used Asymmetric <b>Serial</b> <b>Links,</b> which adjust the transmitter and receiver clocks on the port chips (the Smart End of the link) while leaving the clocks on the crossbar chip (the Dumb End) fixed. Each crossbar chip interfaces with as many as 32 network port chips in our design. AS...|$|R
