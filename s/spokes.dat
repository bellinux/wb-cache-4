5|$|Local {{streets in}} Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets {{radiating}} outward (like <b>spokes</b> on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major {{roads in the}} city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 2015 cyclists {{were allowed}} to board the trams with their bikes, during a trial period which was {{supported}} by cycle campaign groups <b>Spokes</b> and Pedal on Parliament. Following this, Edinburgh trams became the first light rail network in the UK to permit the carriage of bikes on a permanent basis, with up to two bicycles being allowed per tram outwith peak hours (7.30am to 9.30am, and 4pm to 6.30pm) and excluding the festival period (7−31 August) and other large events.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the <b>spokes</b> of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden <b>spokes,</b> much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|Wheelhouses are stone {{buildings}} {{from the}} later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which {{a circle of}} stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the <b>spokes</b> of a wheel) {{form the basis for}} lintel arches supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub. Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists {{since the}} 1960s have {{distinguished}} brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest {{evidence of the}} occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they {{would continue to be}} used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the <b>spokes</b> of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{streets in}} {{downtown}} Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though {{this pattern is}} less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like <b>spokes</b> on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US23), which primarily runs along {{the eastern edge of}} Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US12 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. The city also has a system of bike routes and paths and includes the nearly complete Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve <b>spokes</b> and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E

5|$|Phan's {{men were}} well-trained and disciplined, and the {{military}} inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from Cao Thang, a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier. They operated in the provinces of Thanh Hóa in the north, Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An in the centre and Quảng Bình in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces. In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of base camps, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north {{in the hope of}} coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them. Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured. For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the tempering of the springs, which were improvised with umbrella <b>spokes,</b> and the lack of rifling in the barrels, which curtailed range and accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} {{whether he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve <b>spokes</b> was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
25|$|The <b>spokes</b> {{were not}} {{observed}} again until some twenty-five years later, {{this time by}} the Cassini space probe. The <b>spokes</b> were not visible when Cassini arrived at Saturn in early 2004. Some scientists speculated that the <b>spokes</b> would not be visible again until 2007, based on models attempting to describe their formation. Nevertheless, the Cassini imaging team kept looking for <b>spokes</b> in images of the rings, and they were next seen in images taken on 5 September 2005.|$|E

In total, 22.43% of the {{population}} <b>spoke</b> a main language other than English.|$|R
25|$|The <b>spokes</b> {{appear to}} be a {{seasonal}} phenomenon, disappearing in the Saturnian midwinter and midsummer and reappearing as Saturn comes closer to equinox. Suggestions that the <b>spokes</b> may be a seasonal effect, varying with Saturn's 29.7-year orbit, were supported by their gradual reappearance in the later years of the Cassini mission.|$|E
25|$|A fire hoop {{consists}} of a hoop with one to six <b>spokes</b> radiating outward. The <b>spokes</b> typically extend 6-8inches from the connection points on the hoop, and are capped with a roll of cotton and Kevlar wicking, which can then be lit. This design keeps the fire a fair distance from the hooper's body. Any skill where fire is a component risks {{injury to the person}} doing it.|$|E
25|$|Throughout these changes, the Preparatory school {{retained}} {{black and}} gold. Until 1940 the black cap had radiating <b>spokes</b> of gold {{on the top}} only, with a black on gold badge of the coat of arms of Jersey. From 1945 to 1952 the gold <b>spokes</b> were replaced by a circle of the respective house colour. In 1952 the previous colour scheme returned. Later, the cap badge represented the respective house colour.|$|E
