40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} increasing experience of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) on clinical efficacy and surgical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 180 consecutive operations in 173 patients who underwent VATS for SP by a single surgeon during a 7 year period. RESULTS: 118 patients, mean age 32. 1 years (range 13 - 63 years), were treated for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) while 55 patients, mean age 65. 9 years (range 28 - 92 years), were treated for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). All patients had VAT parietal pleurectomy combined in 162 (90 %) patients with stapled bullectomy. At a current median experience of 2. 0 years (range 0. 4 - 6. 8 years), 12 (6. 6 %) patients required reoperation for treatment failures within 12 months of surgery [...] 9 patients within 30 days of VATS and 3 for late recurrent pneumothorax. Two patients (both with SSP) died within 30 days of surgery. When compared with PSP, VATS in SSP is characterized by an elderly, male predominance, a longer postoperative stay, a higher mortality rate and a lower rate of late recurrence. With increasing experience of the technique, there has been a significant decrease in treatment failures. In the treatment of PSP, both operating time and postoperative stay have decreased significantly with experience whilst the use of <b>staple</b> <b>cartridges</b> per patient has increased significantly with experience in both PSP and SSP. CONCLUSION: There is a demonstrable 'learning curve' effect on the clinical efficacy and surgical practice of video assisted thoracoscopic surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} if the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduced the prevalence of benign anastomotic strictures after uncomplicated esophagectomies with gastric tube reconstruction and circular stapled anastomoses. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: Benign anastomotic strictures are associated with anastomotic leaks or conduit ischemia. Also patients without those complications develop benign anastomotic strictures. We hypothesize that patients without postoperative anastomotic complications may develop benign anastomotic strictures due to exposure of acid gastric tube contents to the anastomotic area, and that the formation of such strictures may be reduced by prophylactic use of PPIs. METHODS:: Eighty patients without preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy, without clinical or radiological signs of anastomotic leaks were included in this clinical trial. The patients were randomized to b. i. d. PPIs or no treatment for 1 year. Benign anastomotic strictures were defined as anastomotic narrowing not allowing a standard diagnostic endoscope to pass without dilatation. The study was registered in the EudraCT database (2009 - 009997 - 28) for clinical trials. RESULTS:: Seventy-nine patients were evaluated. Benign anastomotic strictures developed in 5 / 39 (13 %) patients in the PPI group and in 18 / 40 (45 %) in the control group (RR 5. 6, 95 % CI: 2. 0 - 15. 9, P = 0. 001). The use of a narrower 25 mm cartridge as compared to a wider 28 or 31 mm cartridge significantly increased stricture formations (RR 2. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 7. 6, P = 0. 025). CONCLUSIONS:: Prophylactic PPI treatment reduced the prevalence of benign anastomotic strictures following esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and circular stapled anastomoses. Larger sized circular <b>staple</b> <b>cartridges</b> additionally reduced the stricture prevalence...|$|E
