But data on variability of and trends in water consumption, pollution and scarcity in the YRB are lacking. We estimate, for the first time, the inter- and intra-annual water footprint (WF) of crop production in the YRB for the period 1961 – 2009 and the variation of monthly <b>scarcity</b> of blue <b>water</b> (ground and surface water) for 1978 – 2009, by comparing the blue WF of agriculture, industry and households in the basin to the maximum sustainable level. Results show that the average overall green (from rainfall) and blue (from irrigation) WFs of crops in the period 2001 – 2009 were 14 % and 37 % larger, respectively, than in the period 1961 – 1970. The annual nitrogen- and phosphorus-related grey WFs (water required to assimilate pollutants) of crop production grew by factors of 24 and 36, respectively. The green–blue WF per ton of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields, while the grey WF increased because of the growing application of fertilizers. The ratio of blue to green WF increased {{during the study period}} resulting from the expansion of irrigated agriculture. In the period 1978 – 2009, the annual total blue WFs related to agriculture, industry and households varied between 19 % and 52 % of the basin's natural runoff. The blue WF in the YRB generally peaks around May–July, two months earlier than natural peak runoff. On average, the YRB faced moderate to <b>severe</b> blue <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> during seven months (January–July) per year.

Understanding dynamics of water supply and demand is the key for sustainable planning and management of watersheds. Here we analyzed the uncertainties in water supply of Alberta by building an agro-hydrological model, which accounts for major hydrological features, geo-spatial heterogeneity, and conflicts over water-food-energy resources. We examined the cumulative effects of natural features (e. g., potholes, glaciers, climate, soil, vegetation), anthropogenic factors (e. g., dams, irrigation, industrial development), environmental flow requirements (EFR), and calibration schemes on <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in the dynamics of blue and green water resources, and groundwater recharge.

30|$|This study {{identifies}} {{and reveals}} people’s perception on safe drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> {{with regard to}} salinity, arsenic, and drought {{as well as the}} adaptation measures they currently employ to cope with the above-mentioned hazards that are directly or indirectly responsible for drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> It also discusses communities’ expected support from various organizations. The results of this study reveal that salinity along with arsenic contamination play key roles in making the study area vulnerable to safe drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> which is aggravated by and becomes acute during dry periods. A number of socioeconomic factors along with geographical location enhance the vulnerability of individuals and communities in the study area and relentlessly undermine the struggle of people to minimize or cope with their vulnerabilities by undertaking adaptive measures. This study highlights how communities need to improve their critical situation in both the severe and moderate drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> areas. The results reveal that rainwater harvesting is the prime demand in the <b>severe</b> drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> area, whereas piped water supply is the preferred expectation for moderate drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> areas. Undertaking actions at the community level requires government as well as other organizational initiatives and activities to implement these actions. Rather than disaggregated efforts, integration is needed to resolve the potable water supply problem and to facilitate a community’s adaptation. Although a number of government and nongovernment organizations are working at both the local and the national levels, the main problem is a lack of coordination among them. Because there is no integrated approach between adaptation measures of the community, government, and other development organizations, it is difficult to overcome drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> The National <b>Water</b> Policy of the Bangladesh government should incorporate methods of coordination and partnership among the development efforts of government, NGOs, and communities in order to insure proper implementation at the grassroots level. This would promote pragmatic actions that facilitate integration by knowing and applying community perception, adaptation measures, and expectations to cope with and solve the safe drinking <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> problem.|$|R

50|$|Attempts {{to build}} a new {{assembly}} complex dates back to 1983 when M. G. Ramachandran was the chief minister.

The idea was later revived again in 2002 when J. Jayalalitha was the chief minister. She announced in the Assembly that the government was considering a 2,000-acre administrative city near Maamallapuram. Later it was stated that the proposed city would come up in Thiruvidanthai and Thaiyur villages, about 40 km south of Chennai. In January 2003, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) signed an agreement with the Construction Industry Development Board of Malaysia for a feasibility study of the administrative city project. Subsequently, Jayalalithaa informed the Assembly that as the proposed administrative city would take 15 to 25 years to build, the Secretariat would be shifted to a vacant space opposite the Marina Beach in two years. Originally, the Lady Willingdon College campus was chosen. But, since the area (about 15 acres) of the campus was found inadequate, she came up with the proposal of building a new Integrated Assembly building in the 30-acre Queen Mary's College, Chennai campus, which she announced in April 2003. But this was dropped due to opposition from the political parties and the students of the concerned college.|$|E
40|$|Water is {{becoming}} increasingly scarce all over the world. All indicators of water availability show that per capita supplies will continue to decline in the years ahead. A conservative recent estimate projects that 1. 8 billion people will live in regions or countries with “absolute water scarcity” by 2025 : that is, they will not have enough water to maintain their current level of per capita food production and also meet burgeoning urban demands, even at high levels of irrigation efficiency (Seckler, Molden, and Barker 1999). An additional 350 million will live in regions with “severe water scarcity,” “where the potential water resources are sufficient to meet reasonable water needs by 2025, but (only if the country) embarks on massive water development projects, at enormous cost and possibly severe environmental damage, to achieve this objective” (ibid., 1). There will also be additional, sometimes <b>severe,</b> localized <b>water</b> <b>scarcities,</b> even within countries that, in aggregate, have abundant water (for example, Sri Lanka: see Amarasinghe, Mutuwatta, and Sakthivadal 1999). <b>Water</b> <b>scarcity</b> will not go away.

This resulted in overexploitation of groundwater resources due to excessive issuance of permits for deep wells and caused many Qanats to dry up. As such, the community distribution of water rights that has been provided and protected by Qanats over many centuries is now being replaced by demands, from individual farmers, for deep well permits.

Three problematic District Metered Areas (DMAs) were chosen. The DSS provided a list of prioritized NRW reduction measures targeting at various NRW causes for each DMA. Nicosia’s water utility officials decided to apply some of the short-listed measures in those DMAs, resulting in significant NRW reduction and additional benefits. The annual water savings came up to 1 million m 3, equal to 4. 8 % of the water entering the network. Economic benefits of more than 700, 000 € are noted.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{water consumption}} {{as a result}} of population growth and economic development, especially in fast growing developing countries, puts an increasing strain on the sustainable use of the globe’s finite freshwater resources and poses a key challenge for the future. The objective of the thesis is to evaluate past, current and future water footprints (WFs), <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> and virtual <b>water</b> (VW) flows at both river basin and national level in China, focusing on the agricultural sector, high spatial resolution modelling, uncertainties, inter- and intra-annual variation and benchmarks. A case study for the Yellow River Basin (YRB) for 1996 - 2005 show that uncertainties in key input variables together generate an uncertainty of ± 30 % (at 95 % confidence interval) in the estimated WFs of crops. The inter- and intra- annual variation of WF of crops and blue <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in the Yellow River Basin over 1961 - 2009, as well as the inter-annual variability of crop-related green and blue WFs and inter-regional virtual water (VW) trade in China over 1978 - 2008 were simulated. The green-blue WF per tonne of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields over past five decades, while the grey WF increased dramatically because of the growing application of fertilizers. On average, the YRB faced moderate to <b>severe</b> blue <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> during seven months (January-July) per year. Historically, the net VW flow within China was from the water-rich South to the water-scarce North, but intensifying North-to-South crop trade reversed the net VW flow since 2000. On average, 35 % of the crop-related WF of a Chinese consumer was outside its own province. The thesis further investigated the green and blue WFs and VW trade in China under alternative scenarios for 2050 focusing on the agricultural sector. The results show that Changing to a less-meat diet can generate a reduction in the WF of food consumption of 44 % by 2050 as compared to 2005.
