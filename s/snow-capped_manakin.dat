Migratory birds include purple martin (Progne subis), barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), white-throated kingbird (Tyrannus albogularis), fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), and tropical kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus).|$|E
50|$|The varied {{relief and}} flora support a very diverse bird {{population}} and favour endemism.The white-banded mockingbird (Mimus triurus) {{passes through the}} reserve from June to August.409 species are known {{to occur in the}} reserve including the threatened hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana). There are 22 regionally endemic species including red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), <b>snow-capped</b> <b>manakin</b> (Lepidothrix nattereri) and masked tanager (Tangara nigrocincta).Rare species include the Tapajós hermit (Phaethornis aethopygus), bald parrot (Pyrilia aurantiocephala) and the chorozinho-do-cachimbo, a recently discovered species of Herpsilochmus.|$|E
50|$|The golden-crowned manakin (Lepidothrix vilasboasi) {{is a small}} {{species of}} {{perching}} bird in the manakin family (Pipridae). It is endemic to the south-central Amazon Rainforest in Brazil, and it is threatened by habitat loss. Helmut Sick described this species in 1959 based {{on a series of}} specimens collected a few years before near a small tributary of the upper Rio Cururu-ri in the east Brazilian Amazon. The species was only rediscovered (in part due to confusion over the original type locality) in 2002. Except for the yellow crown of the male, it closely resembles a hybrid of the opal-crowned manakin and <b>snow-capped</b> <b>manakin.</b> Observations and molecular work has demonstrated that the species distributions do not overlap.|$|E
