"At 3 precise, the portly old gentleman (towards sixty now, huge of stature, with a shrieky voice, {{and speaks}} uncommonly fast) bowed himself in; and a Colloquy ensued, on Literature and so forth, {{of the kind}} we may conceive. Colloquy which had great fame in the world; Gottsched himself having--such the {{inaccuracy}} of rumor and Dutch Newspapers, on the matter--published authentic Report of it; [Next Year, in a principal Leipzig Magazine, with name signed: given in Helden-Geschichte, iv. 728-739 (with multifarious commentaries and flourishings, denoting an attentive world). Nicolai, Anekdoten, iii. 286-290.] {{now one of the}} dullest bits of reading, and worth no man's bit of time. Colloquy which lasted three hours, with the greatest vivacity on both sides; King impugning, for one principal thing, the roughness of German speech; Gottsched, in swift torrents (far too copious in such company), ready to defend. 'Those consonants of ours,' said the King, 'they afflict one's ear: what Names we have; all in mere K's and P's: KNAP-, KNIP-, KLOP-, KROTZ-, KROK--;--your own Name, for example!'"--Yes, his own Name, unmusical GottSCHED, and signifying God's-Damage (God's-SKAITH) withal. [...] "Husht, don't take a Holy Name in vain; call the man <b>SCHED</b> ('Damage' by itself), can't we!" [...] said a wit once. [Nicolai, Anekdoten, iii. 287.]--"'Five consonants together, TTSCH, TTSCH, what a tone!' continued the King. 'Hear, in contrast, the music of this Stanza of Rousseau's [Repeats a stanza]. Who could express that in German with such melody?' And so on; branching through a great many provinces; King's knowledge of all Literature, new and ancient, 'perfectly astonishing to me;' and I myself, the swift-speaking Gottsched, rather copious than otherwise. Catastrophe, and summary of the whole, was: Gottsched undertook to translate the Rousseau Stanza into German of moderate softness; and by the aid of water did so, that very night; [Copied duly in Helden-Geschichte, iv. 726.] sent it next day, and had 'within an hour' a gracious Royal Answer in verse; calling one, incidentally, 'Saxon Swan, CYGNE SAXON,' though one is such a Goose! 'Majesty to march at 7 to-morrow morning,' said a Postscript,--no Interviewing more, at present.|$|E

Pre-incubation with <b>Sch</b> A or <b>Sch</b> B produced an anti-inflammatory action in LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells, {{as evidenced by}} the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory c-Jun N-terminal kinases/p 38 kinase/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway as well as the suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and effectors, with the extent of inhibition by <b>Sch</b> A being more pronounced. The greater activity of <b>Sch</b> A in anti-inflammatory response was associated with a greater decrease in cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level and a greater increase in glutathione S-transferase activity than corresponding changes produced by <b>Sch</b> B. However, upon incubation, only <b>Sch</b> B resulted in the activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like factor 2 and the induction of {{a significant increase in the}} expression of thioredoxin (TRX) in RAW 264. 7 cells.

Studies in a mouse model of inflammation (carrageenan-induced paw edema) indicated that while long-term treatment with either <b>Sch</b> A or <b>Sch</b> B suppressed the extent of paw edema, only acute treatment with <b>Sch</b> A produced a significant degree of inhibition on the inflammatory response. Although only <b>Sch</b> A decreased the cellular GSH level and suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell proliferation in ConA-simulated splenocytes in vitro, both <b>Sch</b> A and <b>Sch</b> B treatments, while not altering cellular GSH levels, suppressed ConA-stimulated splenocyte proliferation ex vivo.
