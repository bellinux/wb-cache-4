Eighteen shallow snow–firn cores were drilled, and surface snow samples were collected every 5 km along the traverse. Firn temperatures were measured in boreholes down to 30 m. The cores were analyzed for beta radioactivity to obtain snow accumulation-rate data. The surface snow samples were analyzed for d 18 O to correlate isotopic values with borehole temperatures. Multiple regression analysis shows a global near-dry-adiabatic lapse rate and a latitudinal lapse rate of 1. 05 ˚C (˚ lat. S) – 1, in the Dome C drainage area. Analysis of firn temperatures reveals a <b>super-adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> along the ice divide between Talos Dome and the Southern Ocean coast, and in some sectors along the ice divide between the Astrolabe Basin and D 59.

This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors, such as proximity to oceans, can drastically modify the climate.
