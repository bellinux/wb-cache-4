5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to <b>schedule</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
500|$|Although Knowles had {{previously}} {{worked with a}} wide range of high-profile producers and songwriters on earlier projects, she struggled to convince her wishlisted musicians to contribute to Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, production-wise. This was due to no producer signing on to the project before hearing any material for the album. [...] "I don't think it was offensive," [...] Knowles admitted. [...] "I understand that these are people that want to take on credible passionate projects. So before I would work with them I would <b>schedule</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> and play them the record. And then they were more convinced and willing to get on board." [...] Cee-Lo Green and Mark Ronson were not consulted until late into the production of the album, both having been persuaded by Knowles at the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony: [...] "I had to party with Cee-Lo too to get him to work on the record [...] but once he did [...] he signed on immediately." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 13, Saldívar went to {{her lawyer}} and wrote her resignation, which Quintanilla, Jr. {{believed}} was her alibi. The same day, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel. Selena was in Miami, Florida, at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. believed {{this would have been}} the first attempt to kill Selena. When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to <b>schedule</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting.</b> Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot twenty-five miles (40 km) away from Corpus Christi. Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge of her business affairs in Mexico. According to Quintanilla, Jr. Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar until she could find a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought; Selena told her to [...] "get rid of it" [...] and said she would protect Saldívar from her father, according to Saldívar and Pérez. This, Quintanilla, Jr. believed, had calmed Saldívar and was the reason she did not kill Selena in the parking lot. The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop saying her father had given her a [...]22-caliber pistol. On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|During Fairless' {{tenure as}} {{president}} of Carnegie-Illinois Steel, his company was unionized. [...] The National Labor Relations Act {{was signed into law}} by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 5, 1935. The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed as a caucus within the American Federation of Labor on November 8, 1935. The CIO was intent on organizing all workers in a plant (a philosophy known as industrial unionism), while the AFL supported organizing only highly skilled workers along job lines (known as craft unionism). [...] In order to avoid antagonizing the AFL but eager to begin an organizing drive in steel along industrial union lines, the CIO resolved to work through the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers ("the AA"), a nearly defunct steel union organized along craft lines. Subsequently, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was formed in Pittsburgh on June 7, 1936. AFL president William Green was outraged. He denounced what he saw as the takeover of the AA on June 5, and declared that the CIO steelworker organizing drive would fail. More importantly, however, Green interpreted the move as proof that the CIO was engaging in dual unionism. After charges were drawn up and a trial conducted, on September 10, 1936, the AFL suspended the 10 unions which belonged to the CIO—including the AA (which was now operating as part of SWOC) among them. SWOC initially began a heavy organizing drive among steel workers nationwide, employing more than 400 union organizers. But the steel industry responded by almost universally creating [...] "employee representation plans" [...] (ERPs). These ERPs were thinly disguised company unions, and by mid-1935 nearly 90 percent of all workers in the U.S. steel industry belonged to an ERP. U.S. Steel, in particular, saw the ERPs as a legitimate way of learning about employee concerns, and the ERPs in that company began to become more independent. SWOC found little traction in the steel industry, so SWOC focused on gaining control of the ERPs in 1935 and 1936. Fairless was caught in this strategy. [...] In July 1936, he publicly warned his employees against joining [...] "outside unions". So long as the ERPs had not challenged management prerogatives or demanded pay increases, U.S. Steel was content to let them operate, even independently. But in August 1936, the ERP at Carnegie-Illinois demanded a 10 cent an hour pay increase, which Fairless personally denied on September 12. Philip Murray, director of SWOC, said Fairless' actions were not discouraging and predicted that his union would soon have enough power in the ERPs to force management to accept a collective bargaining agreement. Murray proved correct: By early November 1936, Fairless had been forced to <b>schedule</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> for ERP representatives in the Pittsburgh area to discuss a 10 cent an hour wage increase. By November 10, Fairless had agreed to a cost of living adjustment for 53,000 of Carnegie-Illinois' 100,000 workers. With SWOC continuing to gain strength in Carnegie-Illinois' ERPs, in early January 1937 Fairless established a grievance committee composed of four pro-union ERP representatives with power to hear and adjudicate employee grievances, including the power to chastise managers and recommend punishment. [...] But this failed to blunt the union drive. [...] On February 11, ERP representatives throughout Carnegie-Illinois Steel demanded a $5 per day minimum wage, an 80 cent a day wage increase, and a 40-hour work week.|$|E
