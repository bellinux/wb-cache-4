5000|$|In most states, it {{is illegal}} for health {{insurers}} to engage in individual re-underwriting: re-evaluating the individual subscriber's health risk after the <b>subscriber</b> <b>files</b> a claim under the policy and adjusting the subscriber's premium accordingly; compare also rescission. The process described so far {{can best be described}} as [...] "group re-underwriting": evaluating the group's medical costs and adjusting the group's premium accordingly. It accomplishes the same effect: purging companies' risk pool of higher risk individuals or allowing the insurer to eliminate any high-risk pool altogether or excluding individuals' health conditions even though the health conditions were acquired during the terms of the policies with the company and while the premiums were faithfully paid. That has the advantage to insurers to decrease their liability without violating the terms of the policy or being accused of (individual) re-underwriting. It also allows the insurer to claim that the policy offers protection against rises in premiums because of the policyholder acquiring health conditions even though that protection is limited.|$|E

50|$|On August 8, a {{group of}} Time Warner Cable <b>subscribers</b> <b>filed</b> a class action lawsuit against the {{provider}} in a Wisconsin District Court under grounds of breach of contract. Journal Broadcast Group claimed on its website that TWC was distracted due to its dispute with CBS Corporation (which resulted in the removals of CBS Television Stations outlets in select markets and the Showtime Networks premium channel suite nationwide, until it signed a new agreement on September 2, 2013). Journal also asked state authorities {{to intervene in the}} dispute.|$|R

50|$|Herbert envisioned his <b>subscribers</b> {{building}} cumulative <b>files</b> {{covering all}} the years from 1895 to the present. Although unable to make his service financially self-sustaining, by the 1903 he had sent some 13,000,000 cards to over 600 subscribers. Through his information efforts, Herbert became known to scientific and political leaders throughout Europe and America.|$|R

50|$|Subscribers may {{register}} for specific messages at build time, initialization time or runtime. In GUI systems, subscribers can be coded to handle user commands (e.g., {{click of a}} button), which corresponds to build time registration. Some frameworks and software products use XML configuration <b>files</b> to register <b>subscribers.</b> These configuration <b>files</b> are read at initialization time. The most sophisticated alternative is when subscribers can be added or removed at runtime. This latter approach is used, for example, in database triggers, mailing lists, and RSS.|$|R
50|$|Comcast Corp. {{actively}} {{interferes with}} attempts {{by some of}} its high-speed Internet <b>subscribers</b> to share <b>files</b> online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally. The interference, which The Associated Press confirmed through nationwide tests, is the most drastic example yet of data discrimination by a U.S. Internet service provider. It involves company computers masquerading as those of its users. Comcast's interference {{appears to be an}} aggressive way of managing its network to keep file-sharing traffic from swallowing too much bandwidth and affecting the Internet speeds of other subscribers.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association, a {{non-profit}} charitable association, implemented its own software design to enable all attorney's, whether members of TCCDLA or not, {{to access the}} ECFS system. The software only works on PCs and will not work on Apple's Mac platform. The process enables an attorney to access his or her case files from any computer on the World Wide Web, and is secure and reliable. TCCDLA has continuously revised its software process to enable access 24-7, with little down time. TCCDLA also installed computers in the Tarrant County Justice Center that allow <b>subscribers</b> to access <b>files</b> while in the courthouse. Storm's Edge Technologies is the computer software company that exclusively provides support and design of the TCCDLA ECFS access system.|$|R
50|$|Until 2009 Clearwire {{operated}} a somewhat countrywide WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network with about 10,000 customers. After {{the bankruptcy of}} Clearewire's Danish subsidiary its customers were {{taken over by the}} WiMAX ISP Skyline which already had its own customer base of around 10.000 - mostly situated in Jutland and Funen. From 2009-2012 Skyline's customer base grew to about 40,000 <b>subscribers,</b> however Skyline <b>filed</b> for bankruptcy on the 10'th of May 2012 saying that the development of 4G services along with falling market prices had made it unsustainable for the company to continue its enterprise. As of 2014 the small 10-man company AirNet {{operated a}} scattered but growing WiMAX network focusing on rural areas with poor or no broadband access and offering speeds of up to 20/2 Mbit/s down- and upstream, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In Lubin v. Agora, Inc., 882 A.2d 833 (2005), {{pursuant}} to {{an investigation into}} potential violations of Maryland securities laws, the Maryland Securities Commissioner served two subpoenas duces tecum on Agora. Following Agora’s refusal to produce its subscriber lists, marketing lists, and other documents containing information identifying any of its <b>subscribers,</b> the Commissioner <b>filed</b> a motion to compel enforcement. The trial court {{ruled in favor of}} Agora and denied the motion, concluding that the Commissioner had failed to demonstrate a compelling need for the subscriber lists as required by the First Amendment, and that the demand for subscriber lists was overbroad. The Maryland Securities Commissioner appealed this decision, but the appeals court ruled in favor of Agora. In its opinion, the state of Maryland unanimously ruled the First Amendment prevents the Commissioner from compelling the discovery of the identities of Agora’s subscribers.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2007, TorrentFreak {{reported}} that Comcast had been preventing BitTorrent users from seeding files. In October 2007, the Associated Press {{reported that}} Comcast [...] "actively interferes with attempts {{by some of}} its high-speed Internet <b>subscribers</b> to share <b>files</b> online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally." [...] In November 2007, Comcast's limiting of torrent applications was confirmed by {{a study conducted by}} the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in which public domain literature is distributed over peer-to-peer networks. Analysis of the EFF study found [...] "strong evidence that Comcast is using packet-forging to disrupt peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing on their network". The studies showed that Comcast prevents distribution of files over peer-to-peer networks by sending a RST packet under the guise of the end user, and denying the connection, which effectively blocks the user from seeding over BitTorrent. Legal controversy arises because instead of simple filtering, Comcast is sending RST packets to Comcast customers, pretending to be the host user {{at the other end of}} the BitTorrent connection. Comcast's BitTorrent throttling is a partnership with Sandvine.|$|R
5000|$|The Associated Press {{confirmed}} a {{story by}} TorrentFreak that indicates that Comcast [...] "actively interferes with attempts by some of its high-speed Internet <b>subscribers</b> to share <b>files</b> online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally." [...] Legal controversy ensued when Comcast terminated BitTorrent connections by sending forged RST packets represented as coming from the end users rather than from Comcast. This was through a partnership with Sandvine. This effectively blocks the user from {{making full use of}} BitTorrent. The controversy arises because Comcast is impersonating end users in terminating connections. Recently, a few Comcast users claimed to find temporary solutions for both Microsoft Windows and Linux systems by using a firewall to filter RST packets. This however was later revealed to be futile as {{it would have to be}} implemented on both ends—if the other end did not ignore the spoofed RST packet, the connection would be severed on the remote end.Now there is also evidence of Comcast using RST packets on groupware applications that have nothing to do with file sharing. Kevin Kanarski, who works as a Lotus Notes messaging engineer, noticed some strange behavior with Lotus Notes dropping emails when hooked up to a Comcast connection and has managed to verify that Comcast's reset packets are the culprit. [...] A lawsuit, Hart v. Comcast, has been filed accusing Comcast of false advertising and other unfair trade practices.|$|R
40|$|It s time to {{say goodbye}} and 'Thanks!' to a key person {{in the life of}} a Spore reader. After eleven and a half years heading the Publications Distribution Service, Nico Roskam has a new challenge: to open an {{information}} shop in Cameroon. He should do well there: he was an extension worker in the 1980 s after his masters in erosion control, has close family ties, and his direct Dutch way of doing business will foil the smoothest local trader. He knows about keeping customers satisfied: the walls of PDS offices are lined with photos of PDS and Spore <b>subscribers,</b> and the <b>files</b> bulge with 150, 000 answered letters. His greatest achievement? Bringing some order into the flow of publication requests reaching CTA. Since 1997, a subscription system has empowered the customer with information on what to select, and how much. That makes sure there is (almost) enough for everybody, each to her or his need. Will PDS outlive Nico? Of course, his hard-working colleagues will see to that. Nico himself foresees more decentralisation to national and regional publishers and distributors, including a controlled form of (subsidised) sales. He is right there; such investment will strengthen the information trade in ACP regions. What will he miss most? Probably the eloquence, guile, charm, and poetry of some subscribers asking in the most fantastic ways for more than their fair share that always won his smile, if not his big heart.
