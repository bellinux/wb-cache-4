5|$|In 1869 Lord Adare {{revealed}} in his diaries {{under the title}} Experiences in Spiritualism with D. D. Home that he had <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> the same bed with Home. Many of the diary entries contain erotic homosexual overtones between Adare and Home.|$|E

5|$|The French {{army was}} forced to march through rain and black {{coal-dust}} mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> the open. Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> {{a bedroom}} {{next to the}} front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|Accommodation was not {{provided}} in the agreement with Marlborough College and so Turner wrote to the Mayor of Marlborough to request accommodation in town. Many of the accommodation billets were occupied by soldiers and women working for the Ministry of Health {{at the time and}} so for the first night, the boys <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> the gymnasium of the school, before moving into the town's billets the following night.|$|E

5|$|According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film's {{portrayal}} of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela did not struggle performing on The Red Skelton Show.|$|E
5|$|As the Cultural Revolution {{erupted in}} 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong {{called for the}} {{destruction}} of the Four Olds, and teenage Red Guards rampaged through people's homes to destroy relics of pre-Communist China. Desperate Shanghai collectors sought protection of their antiques at the Shanghai Museum, and Ma <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> his office to take phone calls and to dispatch museum employees around the clock.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles {{was kept}} at the Jackson family's Encino home until 1988 {{when he was}} moved to Jackson's newly {{acquired}} Neverland Ranch.

5|$|The attic {{floor above}} the second floor, {{which is not}} open to the public, {{contains}} some garret rooms that would always have been secondary bedchambers. It is likely that in the 16th and 17th centuries {{they would have been}} occupied by the senior servants; the lower servants would have <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> any vacant corner or space on the ground or basement floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed {{in the rear of}} the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E

5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} some {{skepticism}} on the Atlanta Journal Magazine staff when Peggy came {{to work as a}} reporter. Debutantes <b>slept</b> late <b>in</b> those days and didn't go in for jobs.|$|R
5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, the Diocese of Chichester {{selected}} {{an area of}} open land on {{the west}} side of Ditchling Road as the site of their Training College for Anglican Schoolmistresses, which had outgrown its premises in Black Lion Street in the old town. Viaduct Road was built in front of the Gothic Revival building's south façade around the same time, and was built up with terraced houses by the early 1860s. In the early 20th century, the Diocese bought three of the four villas nearby and converted them into accommodation for trainee schoolteachers. Before that, the trainee teachers <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> large rooms in the Training College.|$|E
5|$|In May 1997, {{two groups}} of six female sailors were posted to Collins and Farncomb to test the {{feasibility}} of mixed-sex submarine companies. Following the trial's success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced submarine training in 1998. Officers and senior enlisted submariners <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could only be deployed in groups of six: one of the enlisted cabins was set aside, and all six bunks in the cabin had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, {{in order to increase}} posting opportunities and help make up shortfalls in submarine complements.|$|E
