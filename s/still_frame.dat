25|$|The Predator air {{vehicle and}} sensors are {{controlled}} {{from the ground}} station via a C-band line-of-sight data link or a Ku-band satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 Multi-spectral Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture thermographic camera (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced <b>still</b> <b>frame</b> radar images. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{reported}} in this paper was to examine the categories of teacher-asked questions while using moving and <b>still</b> <b>frames</b> of science videodisc instruction. Videotapes were made of 12 volunteer, Midwestern, urban, elementary teachers using videodisc instruction. Coding of the teacher-asked questioning categories was determined using an adaptation of The Question Category System for Science (QCSS). Frequencies and percentages of question categories during moving and <b>still</b> <b>frames</b> of videodisc instruction were computed. Statistical analysis showed that {{there were no significant differences}} in the questioning categories asked by teachers during the moving or <b>still</b> <b>frames</b> of videodisc instruction.

500|$|Immediately before Cloudbase crashes to Earth off-screen, a <b>still</b> <b>frame</b> depicts Colonel White {{giving a}} salute {{from behind his}} Control Room desk. Anderson, who {{attributes}} this creative decision to maritime tradition, specifically remembered suggesting [...] "Let's make sure [...] goes down like the captain of a big ship." [...] Liz Morgan, who provided the voices of Destiny and Rhapsody Angels, has discussed how the emotion of the script manifested itself at the recording session: [...] "It was a moment when Destiny was very worried about Captain Scarlet and she was making impassioned pleas for him. Well, I started to cry, and immediately a voice {{came down from the}} recording booth and [...] Reg Hill, who was directing that particular week, said, 'No, Liz, love. Do it again, love. Puppets don't cry!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{version of}} [...] "This Charming Man" [...] was recorded on 14 September 1983, in Maida Vale Studio 4, for John Peel's radio programme (first broadcast: 21 September 1983). Produced by Roger Pusey, and assisted by Ted De Bono, {{this version of}} the song was first included on the 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow. On 28 October 1983, the [...] "Manchester" [...] version was released in the UK in 7" [...] and 12" [...] formats, reaching number 25 in the UK charts. The record sleeve uses a <b>still</b> <b>frame</b> from Jean Cocteau's 1949 film Orphée, featuring French actor Jean Marais. The song was later included as a bonus track on the cassette version of the band's debut album The Smiths in the UK, and subsequently on all American versions.|$|E
500|$|Two {{trailers}} for {{the series}} were produced. The first was developed before Cheese {{had been given a}} name in Sonic Advance 2 (2002); it referred to Cheese simply as [...] "Chao". It was made up largely of footage that would later appear in the series' intro, but also of unused scenes featuring unique anthropomorphic people. Sega showed off the second, which was narrated in Japanese, at its booth at the World Hobby Fair video gaming event in February 2003. It consisted mostly of scenes from the first few episodes, followed by introductions to the main characters. However, it also showed a <b>still</b> <b>frame</b> of a silver anthropomorphic hedgehog (not identified as Silver the Hedgehog) who never appeared in the series; years later in April 2015, Sonic Team's current producer Takashi Iizuka responded to fan question via Facebook, revealing it being simply Super Sonic in its early contour.|$|E

2500|$|The first notable {{figure of}} this {{architectural}} revolution was Thomas Rickman, who {{was based in}} Birmingham for 21 of the 23 years he practiced as an architect. Although he worked {{in a wide variety}} of architectural styles Rickman's understanding of Gothic was far more thorough and learned than that of most other architects of his time, and his Quaker background gave him a systematic and objective view of Gothic styles free from the complications of the Church of England's search for liturgical meaning. His earliest Birmingham church St George-in-the-Fields of 1819 (demolished) was a remarkably correct Gothic structure for its date, and moved away from the economical but historically inauthentic use of cast iron detailing of his earlier churches in Liverpool. It was followed by a series of [...] other notable works in the Birmingham area, including St Barnabas' Church, Erdington of 1824; the Watt Memorial Chapel of 1826 at St Mary's Church, Handsworth; All Saints Church, Ladywood of 1834 (demolished); and the Bishop Ryder Church of 1836 (demolished). Rickman's longest-lasting influence on the course of [...] the Gothic revival however was his book An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture, from the Conquest to the Reformation; the first study of Gothic architecture designed to guide architects towards historically authentic styles and the first to establish a convincing classification and chronology of English Gothic architecture, defining the four principal periods – Norman, Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular – that <b>still</b> <b>frame</b> the understanding of Gothic styles today.|$|E
