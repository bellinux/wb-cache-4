Hanneman arranges for <b>End</b> <b>Frame</b> to buy Pied Piper, but Richard rejects the deal. Gilfoyle reveals that a post-it note with the administrator username and password he took from <b>End</b> <b>Frame</b> allowed him to retrieve sales contracts Pied Piper could use to poach <b>End</b> <b>Frame's</b> customers. Richard approaches the CEO of Intersite, a porn company with whom <b>End</b> <b>Frame</b> was negotiating a $15 million deal, and offers them a technically superior deal. The Intersite CEO proposes a [...] "bake-off" [...] between <b>End</b> <b>Frame</b> and Pied Piper, to see who can better compress their video data, but the competition is called off when Hanneman accidentally deletes a large portion of Intersite's video library from Intersite's servers.|$|R

40|$|This report {{contains}} the complete structural analysis for an existing Joy Western electrostatic precipitator casing that will experience {{an increase in}} loading conditions due to {{the addition of a}} selective catalytic reactor into a coal-burning power plant. The analysis is divided into four major sections: load determination, stability requirements, individual stiffener analysis, and individual member analysis. All of the precipitator casing components-including the stiffeners in the top <b>end</b> <b>frame,</b> bottom <b>end</b> <b>frame,</b> side frame, hoppers, and hot roof as well as the struts, girders, and columns-were evaluated With respect to their ability to sustain the new load. In cases where the existing elements were deemed to be inadequate, a reinforcement design-including all relevant welding information-was determined and is presented here. Complete reinforcement drawings are also included. A cost analysis for this hypothetical design and a comparison to the actual reinforcement design developed by The Multitech Group are presented as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel motion texture {{approach}} is presented for synthesizing long character motion (e. g., kungfu) {{that is similar}} to the original short input motion. First, a new motion with repeated frames is generated by exploiting the symmetric properties of the frames and reversing the motion sequence playback in a given motion sequence. Then, the order of the above motion sequence is rearranged by putting the start and the <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> together. The graphcut algorithm is used to seamlessly synthesize the transition between the start and the <b>end</b> <b>frames,</b> which is noted as graphcut-based motion-texton. Finally, we utilize the motion-textons to synthesize long motion texture, which can be patched together like the image texture synthesis method using graphcut algorithm, and automatically form a long motion texture endlessly. Our {{approach is}} demonstrated by synthesizing the long kungfu motion texture without visual artifacts, together with post-processing including our new developed graphcut-based motion blending and Poisson-based motion smoothing techniques...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{tracking}} a video object in an ordered sequence of two-dimensional images, where the outcome is the trajectory of the video object throughout the time sequence of images. This method is designed to run in real-time in a synchronous video collaboration environment, and used for producing dynamic object annotations for enhanced video content understanding. A dynamic object is an object whose location or size in the video frame constantly changes due to the camera motion, the motion of its own, or both. We suggest a novel method for #nding the trajectory of the object in the intermediate frames given the locations and shapes of the object in two <b>end</b> <b>frames.</b> In addition to the shape and location information of the object, its texture information in the <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> is used to predict the location and search space of it in the intermediate frames. Keywords: Object tracking, video collaboration, histogram back-projection. 1. INTRODUCTION We observe an in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{realistic}} {{strength and}} deflection behavior {{of industrial and}} commercial steel portal frame buildings are understood only if the effects of rigidity of <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> and profiled steel claddings are included. The conventional designs ignore these effects and are very much based on idealized two-dimensional (2 D) frame behavior. Full-scale tests of a 1212 m steel portal frame building under a range of design load cases indicated that the observed deflections and bending moments in the portal frame were considerably different from those obtained from a 2 D analysis of frames ignoring these effects. Three-dimensional (3 D) analyses of the same building, including the effects of <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> and cladding, were carried out, and the results agreed well with full-scale test results. Results clearly indicated {{the need for such}} an analysis and for testing to study the true behavior of steel portal frame buildings. It is expected that such a 3 D analysis will lead to lighter steel frames as the maximum moments and deflections are reduced...|$|R
