40|$|M. A. This study {{comments}} on the debate surrounding the impact of measurement on the effectiveness and accountability of the <b>social</b> <b>work</b> profession. The basic objective {{of this study is}} to determine whether the utilization of the " single subject design " and " standardized measurement scales " have an impact on the effectiveness of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>service</b> delivery. For this research study the experimental design, and specifically the comparison Pretest-Posttest design, is utilized. The experimental group was exposed to the " single subject design " and " standardized measurement scales " as intervention techniques. The control group was not exposed to measurement as an intervention technique. The results of this study indicates a statistically significant difference in growth towards target, between the experimental group and the control group. Clients in the experimental group achieved a higher level of positive growth compared with clients in the control group. Service delivery within the experimental group was therefore more effective than service delivery in the corresponding control group. This study concludes that the utilization of measurement has a positive influence on the effectiveness of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>service</b> delivery. According to the study, social workers that apply measurement as part of their intervention techniques are more effective than social workers who do not apply measurement. It is therefore recommended that measurement should be part of all <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>service</b> rendering in order to enhance effectiveness...|$|R
