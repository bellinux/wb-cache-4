5000|$|Much of the <b>shuttle</b> was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> LI-900 silica tiles, {{made from}} {{essentially}} very pure quartz sand. [...] The insulation prevented heat {{transfer to the}} underlying orbiter aluminum skin and structure. These tiles were such poor heat conductors that one could hold one by the edges {{while it was still}} red hot.There were about 24,300 unique tiles individually fitted on the vehicle, for which the orbiter has been called [...] "the flying brickyard". Researchers at University of Minnesota and Pennsylvania State University are performing the atomistic simulations to obtain accurate description of interactions between atomic and molecular oxygen with silica surfaces to develop better high-temperature oxidation-protection systems for leading edges on hypersonic vehicles.|$|R

The ascent trajectory profile includes a brief initial vertical rise; zero-lift flight through the sensible atmosphere; variational steering into an 83 -kilometer by 185 -kilometer intermediate orbit; and a fixed, 460 -meter per second allowance for subsequent maneuvers. Results are given in terms of burnout mass fractions (including structure and payload), trajectory profiles, propellant loadings, and burn times. These results are generated with a trajectory analysis that includes a parametric variation of the specific impulse from 800 to 3000 seconds and the specific engine weight from 0 to 1. 0...|$|R
