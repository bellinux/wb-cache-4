To separate {{the impact of}} both parameters on the switching kinetics and to further deepen {{the understanding of the}} influence of local Joule heating, a nanometer-sized heating structure is employed. It consists of a 100 nm wide Pt electrode which, due to Joule heating, serves as heating source upon an electrical stimulus. These self-heating properties are underlined by a 3 D finite elements simulation model, which confirms a temperature increase of almost 500 K. Experimental electrical pulse measurements indicate that for this temperature a steady state is achieved in less than 100 ns. By employing this heating structure, kinetic measurements of a Pt/Ta 2 O 5 /Ta cell are performed at different temperatures and reveal that significantly decreased SET times are obtained with increasing temperature. This effect is accompanied by an increasing slope of the current prior to the <b>SET</b> <b>event.</b> The experimental results are further confirmed by predictions of an analytical model based on ionic conduction...|$|E

Data were collected throughout a student's school day, with interventions focusing upon the elimination of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> that occurred before school. The results indicate that (a) the occurrence of preceding <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> was related to higher frequencies of problem behavior and (b) interventions designed to eliminate preceding <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> were consistently associated with low frequencies of problem behavior...|$|R
40|$|<b>Setting</b> <b>events</b> are {{typically}} seen as antecedent contextual variables that influence behaviour. They {{are thought to}} act independently of Skinner's three-term contingency, which consists of a discriminative stimulus, response, and reinforcing consequence. There has been increasing interest in <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> in education from both a theoretical and applied perspective. This paper examines a range of conceptualisations of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> and appraises {{the extent to which}} they can be viewed as a discrete class of phenomena. Variation in the terminology used to describe <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> and lack of clarity in consideration of explanatory mechanisms tends to hinder analysis. Nevertheless, a number of plausible explanations exist to account for <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> associated with both conditioned and unconditioned reinforcers. While the conceptual underpinnings of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> remain unclear in part, they do serve the function of drawing our attention to a wide range of antecedent variables that may influence behaviour. Resolution of issues related to consistency of terminology and clarification of our conceptual understanding of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> may provide further guidance in their practical application to behaviour. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identified}} the <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> reported by caregivers {{as more and}} less likely to be asso-ciated with challenging behaviors of people with intellectual disabilities. Sixty-five staff work-ing with 22 individuals were interviewed using a <b>setting</b> <b>event</b> inventory. Some <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> (e. g., being in a crowded room) were reported as strongly associated with challenging behavior, some (e. g., one-to-one support) as strongly associated with its absence. Some (e. g., day of week) were reported to be largely “inert”; many were idiosyncratically associated with occurrence, absence, or inertness. Different categories of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> contributed different amounts to reported variation in challenging behavior. The inventory described here, or modified versions, may help identify relationships between <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> and challenging behaviors. The relation-ships reported in this study suggest ways in which service provision might be modified to help prevent challenging behavior...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{involves}} the multi-mode project payment scheduling problem with bonus-penalty structure where {{activities can be}} performed with several modes and a bonus-penalty structure exists at the deadline of the project. In the problem the decisions on when to schedule events and payments, the magnitude of each payment, and the performing mode of each activity need to be optimized. A two-module simulated annealing heuristic is proposed to solve the mixed integer non-linear programming models for the contractor and the client, and a satisfactory solution, which consists of payment event <b>set,</b> <b>event</b> schedule, and payment amount set, may be found through iterations between the heuristic's two modules. The profits of the two parties of the contract are changed significantly by the bonus-penalty structure and the structure may {{be considered as a}} coordination mechanism essentially, which may enhance the flexibility of payment scheduling and be helpful for the two parties to get more profits from the project. Through solving and analyzing an instance the insight that the bonus-penalty structure may advance the project completion effectively and improve the profits of the two parties in the meantime can be obtained. ...|$|E
30|$|Event {{reputation}} system (ERS): The event {{reputation system}} (ERS) prevents inaccurate traffic messages in VANETs. A dynamic reputation system {{is used to}} determine the incoming traffic trustworthiness to the driver. In this scheme, the vehicle gets enough reputation from inside sensors and received messages. When enough reputation is received, then the traffic warning will be broadcasting to other vehicles in the network. The scheme is dependent on two parameters: event reputation value and event confidence list. Event reputation system consists of three interfaces and four functionalities. One is event table storage for received messages or event from on-board unit sensors. The event table consists of event identity, type of event, time stamp of event, event location, event transmission range, event reputation value and event confidence value list. The event table stores each event separately and <b>set</b> <b>event</b> reputation value. The ERS uses aggregative event observation mechanism and reputation adoption mechanism. The event confidence threshold and event reputation threshold assess event intensity and reliability at the same time. The limitation of ERS is that event reputation value is low in high speed because of the sensor capability (minimum detection). The event confidence is small in low density. The other factors like event duration and transmission range also have an effect on ERS [84].|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of four combinations of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> on the social interactions of 7 preschool children with social delays. In Study 1, the status of the teacher, activity materials, and peer varied across conditions. In Study 2, the status of the teacher and materials varied across conditions. Within the combinations of <b>setting</b> <b>events,</b> we also examined teacher behavior. Teacher presence and absence was varied in both studies. The type and rate of teacher prompting were varied in Study 2. The four combinations of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> produced different rates of social behavior by the children with social delays. The optimal combination of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> for promoting peer interaction and reducing teacher-child interaction included teacher absence from the activity, a limited number and form of materials, and children paired with a socially skilled partner...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} of applied behavior analysis {{as a natural}} science approach {{to the study of}} human behavior are acknowledged. However, it is also argued that applied behavior analysis has provided limited access to the full range of environmental events that influence socially significant behavior. Recent changes in applied behavior analysis to include analysis of side effects and social validation represent ways in which the traditional applied behavior analysis conceptual and methodological model has been profitably expanded. A third area of expansion, the analysis of <b>setting</b> <b>events,</b> is proposed by the authors. The historical development of <b>setting</b> <b>events</b> as a behavior influence concept is traced. Modifications of the basic applied behavior analysis methodology and conceptual systems that seem necessary to <b>setting</b> <b>event</b> analysis are discussed and examples of descriptive and experimental <b>setting</b> <b>event</b> analyses are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial density as a <b>setting</b> <b>event</b> {{on the social}} {{interaction}} of preschool children were examined in this review. A specific interest was the potential application of this <b>setting</b> <b>event</b> to {{children with special needs}} in inclusive settings. Twelve studies were examined revealing a range of methodological and technical difficulties in the extant research. Several studies reported significant effects, but results were inconsistent and very limited research examining students with special needs is available. Several suggestions for future research are offered including conduct of studies in typical preschool settings with representative group sizes, study of children with special needs, and use of research designs that allow idiosyncratic responses to interventions to be considered. Despite considerable recent interest and research on <b>setting</b> <b>events,</b> the body of research on spatial density is dated and methodologically problematic.
