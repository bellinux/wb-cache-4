Since the withdrawal of all US stationed forces in 2006, Iceland’s security partnerships have diversified and {{attempts have been made to}} frame security in more multi-functional terms.

On this basis, a cross-party parliamentary committee was invited to start work in 2012 on guidelines for a security strategy. Its report, published in March 2014, establishes a large area of consensus on ‘softer’ security issues and on remaining in NATO, with a few dissenting voices on the latter. Its main omission is a proper treatment of economic and financial security, still tied to the divisive issue of EU membership.

Whether in the Strategic Partnership or in the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Russian Federation is considered by the European Union as a key partner.

The actual 'strategic partnership' is still very fragile in spite of recent declarations and developments.

The implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2005 might be a chance for the EU to give more substance and more consistency to their policy towards the new neighbours.

The ENP lacks coherence with respect to the existing EU -Russian Strategic partnership: Firstly, the place of Russia in the ENP is nothing but clear. Russia is 'half in half out'. Secondly, the Russian factor is largely under estimated in the EU policies towards the new neighbours.

40|$|This paper {{relies on}} {{theoretical}} approaches from the IR-discipline {{to account for}} important changes in Germany’s support for a common European foreign policy toward the Arab-Israeli dispute since the early 1990 s. It first describes two major shifts in Germany’s approach towards Middle East peace making: first, Germany’s growing support for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s; and second, Germany’s increasing support for a stronger political role of the EU in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process subsequent to the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada in September 2000. Subsequently, the paper engages in a theoretically informed analysis of the described foreign policy changes. In a first step, it draws on rationalist arguments which understand foreign policy change primarily as the result of a shift in Germany’s economic and <b>soft</b> <b>security</b> interests in the MENA region. It is argued that particularly the greater German exposedness to <b>soft</b> <b>security</b> threats from the MENA region – which resulted from the implementation of the Schengen agreement in 1995 - had a strong effect on Germany’s policy approach toward the Middle East. However, changes in Germany’s material interests in the region fail to account for other important aspects of Germany’s foreign policy behaviour. Here, (constructivist) explanations of experiential learning can help to close the rationalist explanatory gap. 1 I...|$|E
