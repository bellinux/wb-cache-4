The low basicity of the dimer anion can qualitatively be explained by resonance stabilization. The energies for proton transfer from dimers to monomers are therefore about 1. 2 eV lower than for proton transfer between monomers. For the MALDI process, proton transfer reactions involving matrix dimers provide a low energy pathway for matrix and analyte ion formation...|$|R

Compared with the wild type, the 4 CL downregulated line showed significantly {{increased levels of}} p-hydroxycinnamic acids such as p-coumaric, ferulic, and <b>sinapic</b> <b>acids.</b> In contrast, the CAld 5 H upregulated line had increased content of p-coumaryl and 5 -hydroxyconiferyl alcohols. In the 4 CL downregulated line, it was likely that most hydroxycinnamic acids were glycosylated. These results strongly suggest that the downregulation of 4 CL and upregulation of CAld 5 H disrupt the metabolic flow through the cinnamate/monolignol pathway and thus alter the amount and structure of its final product, lignin.|$|R

Proximate composition, phenolic acids profile (HPLC/MS), flavonol glicosides (HPLC/ MS), polyphenols (Folin-Ciocalteu assay), and the antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH assay) of the extracts were determined.

Methods: In this experimental study, 64 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into 8 groups. Control animals were intact. Sham group received vehicle of <b>sinapic</b> <b>acid</b> (Tween 80, 10 %). The experimental rats administrated with <b>sinapic</b> <b>acid</b> at doses 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 1, 1 and 10 g/rat respectively. <b>Sinapic</b> <b>acid</b> and Tween 80 were injected intracerebroventricular and post-training.

In corn snacks, without additives, nine phenolic compounds were identified. These were protocatechuic, 4 -OH-benzoic, caffeic, p-coumaric, salicylic, ferulic acids, rutin, isoquercetin and apigenin- 7 -glucoside. In the extract from Sambucus flowers and extract from snacks containing 20 % of Sambucus flowers fifteen polyphenols were found. They were additionally gallic, gentisic, vanillic, <b>sinapic</b> <b>acids,</b> kaempferol- 3 -rutinoside and astragalin. The radical-scavenging activity of the extracts was determined spectrophotometrically against DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical and using thin layer chromatography.
