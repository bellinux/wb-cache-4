40|$|We {{study the}} impact of public and <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> prices in auctions where buyers have {{independent}} private values and heterogeneous entry costs. We find that in a standard auction the optimal (i. e., revenue maximizing) public reserve price is typically above the seller's value. Moreover, an appropriate entry fee together with a public reserve price equal to the seller's value generates greater revenue. <b>Secret</b> <b>reserve</b> prices, however, differ across auction formats. In a second-price sealed-bid auction the <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> price is above the optimal public reserve price; hence there is less entry, a smaller probability of sale, and both the seller revenue and the bidders' utility are less than with an optimal public reserve price. In contrast, in a first-price sealed-bid auction the <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> {{is equal to the}} seller's value, and the bidders' expected utility (seller revenue) is greater (less) than with an optimal public reserve price.

40|$|We study optimal {{public and}} <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> prices for risk averse sellers in second price auctions with {{endogenous}} entry.

Thus, risk aversion raises public reserve prices, but lowers <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> prices. Further, we show that an optimal public reserve price is smaller than the <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> price (i. e., rP < rS). Hence, for a risk averse seller public and <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> prices are ordered: c < rP < rS < r 0.

I am afraid I mean that what was touching was rather the fact that the tinkle could penetrate than the fact that it died away; the light of criticism might have beat so straight--if the sense of proportion and the fact of compassion hadn't waved it away--on the æsthetic phase during which the appeal was mainly by the tinkle. The Scarlet Letter and The Seven Gables had the deep tone as much as one would; but of the current efforts of the imagination they were alone in having it till Walt Whitman broke out in the later fifties--and I was to know nothing of that happy genius till long after. An absorbed perusal of The Lamplighter was what I was to achieve at the fleeting hour I continue to circle round; that romance was on every one's lips, and I recollect it as more or less thrust upon me in amends for the imposed sacrifice of a ranker actuality--that of the improper Mr. Robinson, I mean, as to whom there revives in me the main question of where his impropriety, in so general a platitude of the bourgeois, could possibly have dwelt. It was to be true indeed that Walt Whitman achieved an impropriety of the first magnitude; that success, however, but showed us the platitude returning in a genial rage upon itself and getting out of control by generic excess. There was no rage at any rate in The Lamplighter, over which I fondly hung and which would have been my first [...] "grown-up" [...] novel--it had been soothingly offered me for that--had I consented to take it as really and truly grown-up.

Because many accountants shared Plender's view that <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> accounting was a regular and respectable practice, and because the pair had not been found guilty of publishing false information as a result of this, the professional response was disjointed and half-hearted. There were major changes, however: although the practice of <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> accounting remained acceptable, companies disclosed their use of this in their audit reports.

40|$|We analyze {{a dynamic}} second-price auction similar to online auctions where {{the price in}} any period equals the current second-highest bid. In this auction, one bidder, known as the {{informed}} agent, knows her private valuation. The other bidder, known as the uninformed agent, does not know his private valuation. However, upon seeing a posted price, he learns whether his valuation is above that price. We show that, in any equilibrium, the informed agent bids {{in the first period}} if her valuation is below some cutoff and bids only in the last period otherwise. The uninformed agent bids in every period to optimally change the price unless the price is above his valuation or he is the high bidder. Thus, this model suggests that late bidding or sniping and multiple bidding or nibbling are interrelated and provides an explanation for their prevalence in online auctions.

40|$|We examine seller {{strategies}} in 1177 Internet auctions on eBay, {{to understand the}} diversity of strategies used, and their impacts. Dimensions of strategic choice {{include the use of}} a ‘Buy it Now’ option, the level of the starting price, and the use of a <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> price. A major focus of our analysis is on differences across sellers with different volumes of sales. The largest volume sellers (termed “retailers”) in our sample employ uniform selling strategies, but lower volume sellers exhibit a wide variety of strategic choices. While some components of sellers’ strategies appear important in raising seller revenue, including starting the auction with a ‘Buy it Now’ offer, the overall impact of seller strategy choices on the outcome appears to be quite small. We interpret this as evidence for the competitiveness of the online auction market for frequently traded items with conventional retail alternatives. An exception is provided by the use of a <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> price, which raises the winning bid conditional on a sale, but reduces the probability of a sale. Depending on sellers’ risk aversion and impatience, this may also be an efficient outcome. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, also in {{response}} to criticism {{on the lack of}} market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market, The Art Newspaper in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency. The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with <b>secret</b> <b>reserves,</b> {{while at the same time}} representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.|$|E
40|$|Sellers in eBay auctions {{have the}} {{opportunity}} to choose both a public minimum bid amount and a secret reserve price. We ask, empirically, whether the seller is made better or worse off by setting a secret reserve above a low minimum bid, versus the option of making the reserve public by using it as the minimum bid level. In a field experiment, we auction 50 matched pairs of Pok‚mon cards on eBay, half with <b>secret</b> <b>reserves</b> and half with equivalently high public minimum bids. We find that secret reserve prices make us worse off as sellers, by reducing the probability of the auction resulting in a sale, deterring serious bidders from entering the auction, and lowering the expected transaction price of the auction. We also present evidence that some sellers choose to use secret reserve prices for reasons other than increasing their expected auction prices. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>secret</b> <b>reserves</b> by British companies, both to {{manipulate}} the content of published reports and to influence investor perceptions of corporate progress during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century, has been an important focus of historical enquiry. By way of contrast, relatively little attention has been devoted to the possible exploitation of fixed asset accounting practices to achieve similar financial reporting objectives. It is the aim of the present paper to help to redress this imbalance. The principal basis for the study is the archival records of four major iron and coal companies. Identified features of prudent financial policy include: a determination to restrict distributions and the level of activity to what the company could comfortably afford; and a reluctance to use loan finance. The selection of accounting practices was subordinated to the pursuit of these, and related, policy objectives. The identified use of prudent financial policies may be contrasted with Briefs (1976, p. 184) conclusion that nineteenth century companies consistently over-estimated profitability, with a consequential stimulation of business investment and economic growth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{contains}} three independent essays: Chapter 1 is a co-authored {{paper with}} my PhD colleague Yibai Yang. In Chapter 1, we analyze decisions of firms on outsourcing of intermediate goods and R&D investment. If firms choose in-house production, a high profit discount is incurred {{due to the}} inefficiency of producing the intermediate goods, whereas if firms search for and outsource to specialists, the production costs decrease, but an imitation risk arises by specialists, who may become competitors in the final-good market. Accordingly, patents are used to mitigate this possibility, which are costly. We show that in outsourcing, all firms outsource to the same specialist to minimize the possibility of successful imitation in equilibrium. Moreover, an interior equilibrium shows that firms still invest in R&D activities and outsource their intermediate goods with some patent protection, even though the selected specialist put effort into imitation. In Chapter 2, a repeated-purchase model with sequential search has been constructed, where agents have one-period memory. The contribution of the chapter is twofold: (1) the chapter extends the standard Diamond Paradox to a repeated setting and found two classes of symmetric equilibria, while one is replicating the diamond paradox in every period, the other is with a price that ensures visited consumers to return in the next period. (2) the chapter provides the first modeling study that, equilibrium price dispersion can be generated with homogeneous agents due to the choice of whether to have a repeated relationship. It is found that such equilibria with price dispersion can be supported only if the market is not perfectly stable (in the model, only after {{the introduction of a}} probability that a repeated relationship will break down with a certain exogenous probability, equilibrium price dispersion can be generated). In Chapter 3, behavioral observations are made from a self-collected ebay auctions dataset. The dataset offers two distinctive features differ from existing literature. Firstly, the dataset contains nine different electronic products valuing range from approximately 30 to 650 dollars, which allows the author to investigate sellers' behaviors across different price ranges. The data shows that, when the book value of products changes, sellers choose different reserve prices (in percentage terms) and differ in the usage of <b>secret</b> <b>reserves.</b> The author thus suggests that a number of results from previous field experiment literature (of auctioning a single homogeneous product) may not be robust to a change in product value. Secondly, in the dataset, professional sellers are distinguished from nonprofessional sellers. When professional and nonprofessional sellers run auctions in a competing environment, the data shows that they frequently follow different strategies. The differences in strategies are reported in this chapter, which offers insights into the competing auction literature. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|Based on eBay auctions {{of classic}} comic books, we explore what attracts bidders to {{individual}} online auctions. Seventy {{percent of the}} variation in the number of bidders across auctions is predictable based on characteristics of the item for sale, the seller, and the auction design. Not surprisingly, high minimum bids discourage bidders while longer auctions attract slightly more. We also find that the presence of a <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> price sharply reduces the number of bidders while third party certification attracts more. Seller reputation as measured by feedback ratings has a statistically significant impact on the number of bidders. Overall, our results support the hypotheses that bidding is fairly costly and that bidders value transparency. Holding issue, seller, and auction characteristics constant, an additional bidder is associated with a price increase of between 2. 3 % and 4. 3 %. While <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> prices sharply reduce the number of bidders, they have little impact on what individual bidders are willing to bid while third party certification of the auctioned item increases both the number and level of bids. On the other hand, the condition of the item being auctioned has a relatively minor impact on the number of bidders but strongly impacts their bids. 1 What Attracts Bidders to Online Auctions and What is Their Price Impact? 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} 80 auctions on eBay. Forty {{of these}} auctions were for various popular music CDs while the remaining 40 auctions were for video games for Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console. The revenue equivalence theorem states that any auction form {{having the same}} effective reserve price yields the same expected revenue. The effective reserve price on eBay consists of three components: the opening bid amount, the <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> amount, and the shipping and handling charge. We set no <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> price and varied the opening bid and the shipping and handling charge to keep the overall reserve level fixed. When the effective reserve was $ 4, auctions with a low opening bid and high shipping charges attracted more bidders, earlier bidding, and yielded higher revenue than those with a high opening bid and low shipping charges. Under the effective reserve of $ 8 treatments, the same results hold only for Xbox games. Unlike the other treatments, where the reserve represents less than 30 % of the retail price of the item, for CDs, the $ 8 effective reserve represents over 50 % of the retail price of the item. In this treatment, we find no systematic difference {{in the number of}} bidders attracted to the auction or revenues as a function of how the effective reserve is allocated between opening bid and shipping charges.

40|$|Currently, the {{legitimate}} {{transfer of ownership}} of an asset occurs either through voluntary means - gift, bequest, sale - or {{through the use of}} state power - compulsory acquisition, resumption, eminent domain, court order. In Australia and elsewhere, compulsory acquisition of private property is followed by the payment of compensation, which may be too little or too great. This paper outlines an auction mechanism that is intermediate between the forced resumption of water entitlements and their voluntary sale. To be effective, the mechanism requires there to be competitive bidders in the auction, and so the mechanism would work best if there were an end to collusion between public agencies in the water market. The seller would be an irrigation district, which would be compelled by government to engage in the auction. The proceeds of any auction sale would be distributed to the individual irrigators, according to fixed and known fractional shares. However, in contrast with the use of forced resumption, under the Shapiro-Pincus mechanism no sale would be made unless each individual irrigator receives at least what he or she has nominated as a minimum required payment. This guarantee would be secured {{through the use of a}} <b>secret</b> <b>reserve</b> for the auction of the district's water entitlements. The combination of a <b>secret</b> <b>reserve,</b> competitive bidding, and the share mechanism gives individual irrigators a financial incentive to nominate truthfully what each requires as a minimum payment. The mechanism may have other applications, including helping to secure unanimous agreement within an irrigation district, to offer to sell all of the district's entitlements. ...|$|R
