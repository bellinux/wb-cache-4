40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top weld seam of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of weld seam and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top weld seam and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top weld seam and maximum tensile shear strength. These correlations exist only when top weld seam having non uniform <b>seam</b> <b>boundary.</b> However, weld seam having uniform <b>seam</b> <b>boundary</b> do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of weld seam and tensile shear strength. The reason for {{this is due to the}} high value of standard deviation of the average width of the top weld seam. Width of weld seam is more responsible for tensile strength rather than variation of weld seam. ope...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{modelling}} of coal seams {{and their}} properties is standard geological practice for both underground and open cut mining. It {{is based on}} correlations of coal seams made between boreholes and the interpolation of relevant coal seam properties {{on the basis of}} the inferred coal <b>seam</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In the case of geotechnical studies, this same approach is not followed because there are insufficient geotechnical test results to form a basis for modelling and the geological models do not typically create boundaries for interburden rock types. Instead, geotechnical models tend to be based on coal seam geological models with test results shown as point data in the interburden intervals. This situation can be improved if geophysical logging data are used as the basis for geotechnical modelling. Appropriately analysed, these logs provide continuous measurements of lithological and geotechnical properties. In the case of natural gamma data, an analysis to show the variations in clay content allows sandstones to be separated from finer grained siltstones. If geophysical strata rating values are determined from the geophysical logs, they provide a measure of rock quality. From these analyses, 3 D models showing interburden properties as well as boundaries of the relevant rock types can be created and used as a basis for mine design and control of geotechnical hazards...|$|R

It {{takes the place of}} MARSTIE, although MARSTIE can be used to interactively edit the tie points afterwards. These tie points are used to create a mosaic whose <b>seams</b> (<b>boundaries</b> of input images) have been geometrically corrected to reduce or eliminate errors and mis-registrations. The methods used to find appropriate tie points for use in creating a mosaic are unique, having been designed to work in concert with the "MARSNAV" program to be most effective in reducing or eliminating geometric seams in a mosaic. The program takes the input images and finds overlaps according to the nominal pointing. It then finds the most interesting areas using a scene activity metric. Points with higher scene activity are more likely to correlate successfully in the next step. It then uses correlation techniques to find matching points in the overlapped image. Finally, it performs a series of steps {{to reduce the number of}} tie points to a manageable level. These steps incorporate a number of heuristics that have been devised using experience gathered by tie pointing mosaics manually during MER operations. The software makes use of the PIG library as described in "Planetary Image Geometry Library" (NPO- 46658), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 12 (December 2010), page 30, so it is multi-mission, applicable without change to any in-situ mission supported by PIG.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{application}} of geological controls in orebody evaluation and modelling is critical. Stratigraphic orebodies require more accurate {{location in space}} and better <b>seam</b> <b>boundary</b> definition. This is achieved by either modelling boundary surfaces of the orebodies or their thickness at specific points in 3 D space. Structurally deformed stratigraphic deposits pose a very special problem in variography and grade estimation – {{it is necessary to}} bring the locations of samples from the deformed space to the standard XYZ co-ordinate system. This is necessary in order to reconstruct the spatial distribution of grades at the time the deposit was formed and restore the relative positions of samples to their pre-deformed state. Earlier methods of unfolding deposits were based on various geometrical, mathematical or even manual techniques, while more recent methods were based on the use of an unfolded coordinate system for the transformation of every sample and estimation point. The alternative method presented in this paper, Tetrahedral Modelling, can be applied to deposits where mineralization is controlled by a pair of structural surfaces that can be modelled. In tetrahedral modelling the search ellipse is distorted to follow nominated structural surfaces leading to improved estimation accuracy. A case study is presented showing the benefits of this technique...|$|E

We find that the enhancements of the specific heats of the strong layers and of the overall or `bulk' critical temperature, T_c(J_ 1,J_ 2;m_ 1,m_ 2), arising from the collective effects reflect the observations of Gasparini and coworkers in experiments on confined superfluid helium.

40|$|The {{reproducibility}} {{of individual}} welding methods depends to large extents {{on the material}} properties. This is especially the case for impact welding as tests {{have shown that the}} surface properties influence the joint formation. With the aim to influence the formation and position of the lower curve of the welding process window, this paper focuses on how the surface topography influences an asymmetrical impact. Additionally, relevant process parameters (e. g. collision speed, collision angle, jet formation) will be included and disturbance contours that are placed transversely to the collision vector will be examined. A high-speed camera was used to measure the collision speed as well as the collision angle. The specific surface topographies were created using belt grinding (cutting with geometrically undefined edges) and laser ablation (non-cutting process, local vaporization of materials through pulsed laser beams). The tests exemplarily show a strong correlation between the surface geometries and the joint. The disturbance contours that were introduced transversely to the collision vector shift the lower weld <b>seam</b> <b>boundary,</b> whereas a reduction of the discharge energy leads to a relative strength of the joint of 1. 0. In sum, this paper offers fundamental insights into the mechanisms of the joint formation when using magnetic pulse welding and shows the influence of the surface topographies on the conflict between relevant procedural parameters and the possibility to shift the lower procedural window...|$|E
40|$|TiAl alloys offer a great {{potential}} to substitute {{high temperature resistant}} nickel-base alloys due to their lower specific weight. For increasing oxidation and creep resistance these alloys contain high amounts of niobium and other elements, which may influence the propensity for segregation. Furthermore these alloys generally exhibit low ductility and fracture toughness, which makes them prone to cracking during heat treatment. To avoid atmospheric influence the electron beam process has been chosen for joining two different TiAl alloys by welding. The GE microstructure consists of gamma (NG), the V 5 microstructure of a gamma/alpha 2 (FL) structure, which both show different properties. The experiments carried out have shown a potential for crack-free welding of TiAl up to 5 mm thickness with the electron beam. The cooling rates are highest in electron beam welding, thus a great reduction of welding speed down to either 1 mm/s or 2 mm/s in combination with preheating of at least 500 °C is necessary to obtain crack-free welds. Preheating was carried out efficiently by deflecting a defocused electron beam. While preheating mainly influenced {{the width of the}} weld seam and thus reducing stress peaks by homogenizing stress distribution, comparing the two alloys did not show great differences in welding parameters and cracking rates respectively, but in their microstructure. The alloy GE exhibited a peritectic solidification behavior, combined with minor segregations of aluminium. Due to their higher amount of aluminium high amounts of massive gamma-m have been witnessed mainly on weld <b>seam</b> <b>boundaries.</b> With reducing welding speed the amount of gamma-m decreased. The alloy V 5 was found to solidify via solid state beta, which could reduce and abolish stresses in the higher temperature range, i. e. directly after solidifying. The lower ductility at room temperature due to the lamellar microstructure could thus be compensated. It should be mentioned that, a certain TiB 2 coagulation was found in the HAZ of alloy V 5 which could influence the high temperature behavior. Both alloys exhibited a slight loss of aluminium in the weld seam, whose influence could not be figured out exactly, but should be considered during afterwards heat treatment. Nevertheless, hardness increase in both alloys was distinct, but only GE alloy showed a reduction with decreasing cooling rate. This is considered due to the potential of dislocation movement. A final heat treatment had no significant effect on the hardness and only small influence on the microstructure, hypothesizing that parameters have to be adjusted. To evaluate the mechanical properties tensile tests and stress measurements by x-ray and neutron diffraction have been carried out. Due to problematic dimensions and shape the tensile test specimen showed strong scattering of results. Although high values of up to 485 MPa were achieved, strain values were below 1 % and results are thus considered only to be trend-setting. The stress analysis, however, showed a significant reduction in welding residual stresses when preheating of at least 500 °C or massive reduction of welding speed was applied, this being sufficient for crack free joining. Neutron diffraction analysis thereby showed general applicability, although strong texture and extremely fine microstructure could deteriorate the measurement results...|$|R

Given a set of color images obtained by multiple RGB-Depth cameras around the human model, and a surface mesh reconstructed previously by point cloud, we establish a MRF model. To eliminate the <b>seams</b> at the <b>boundary</b> between adjacent color images, caused by multi-view misregistration and inaccuracy of depth data, we introduce an adaptive iterative factor into the MRF model. To smooth out the noticeable illumination variation between different color images, we apply the state-of-the-art method of Poisson blending to a composite vector field in gradient domain. Furthermore, we perform parameterization of the model’s surface and apply KNN algorithm to repair the blank regions without texture content. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, we compare it with another three advanced methods. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the global minimum of optimization almost fastest and creates a best texture on the surface of models. Therefore, our method proves evidently effective and preferable both in visual effect and quantitative analysis.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{fundamental}} step in stitching several {{pictures to}} form a larger mosaic is the computation of <b>boundary</b> <b>seams</b> that minimize the visual artifacts in the transition between images. Current seam computation algorithms use optimization methods that may be slow, sequential, memory intensive, and prone to finding suboptimal solutions related to local minima of the chosen energy function.

40|$|The {{geological}} {{debate about}} whether, {{and to what}} extent, humic coals have sourced oil {{is likely to continue}} for some time, despite some important advances in our knowledge of the processes involved. It is clear that not only liptinites, but also perhydrous vitrinites have the potential to generate hydrocarbon liquids in the course of natural coalification. Some liptinites, especially alginite, cutinite, and suberinite, contain a higher proportion of aliphatic moieties in their structure than other liptinites such as sporinite and resinite and are, therefore, more oil-prone. It is of potential value to be able to predict the several environments of deposition in which coals with high liptinite contents or containing perhydrous vitrinites may have been formed. Review of the distribution of oil-prone coals in time and space reveals that most are Jurassic–Tertiary with key examples from Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia. Methods based both on experimental simulations and the examination of naturally matured samples have been used to determine the order of generation of hydrocarbons from different macerals. Results are not entirely consistent among the different approaches, and there is much overlap in the ranges of degradation, but it seems probable that in the natural environment vitrinites begin to generate early, followed by labile liptinites such as suberinite, then cutinite, sporinite, and, finally, alginite. Petroleum potential may be determined by experimental simulation of natural coalification or inferred through various micro-techniques, especially fluorescence and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, or bulk techniques such as elemental analysis and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy. The latter three techniques enable a measure of the polymethylene component of the coal, which now appears {{to be one of the}} best available approaches for determining petroleum potential. No method of experimental simulation of petroleum generation from coals is without criticism, and comparative results are highly variable. However, hydrous pyrolysis, confined pyrolysis, and forms of open-system hydrous pyrolysis approach acceptable simulations. Whether, and to what degree generated liquid hydrocarbons are expelled, has long been the central problem in ‘oil from coal’ studies. The structure of vitrinite was believed until recently to contain an interconnected microporous network in which generated oil would be contained until an expulsion threshold was attained. Recent studies show the pores are not interconnected. Combined with a dynamic model of pore generation, it now seems that expulsion of hydrocarbons is best explained by activated diffusion of molecules to maceral boundaries and ultimately by cleats and fractures to coal <b>seam</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The main reason for poor expulsion is the adsorption of oil on the organic macromolecule, which may be overcome (1) if coals are thin and interbedded with clastic sediments, or (2) if the coals are very hydrogen-rich and generate large quantities of oil. The existence of oil in vitrinite is attested to by solvent extractions, fluorescence properties, and by microscopic observations of oil and bitumen. Experimental simulation of expulsion of oil from coals has only recently been attempted. The relative timing of release of generated CO₂ and CH₄ could have considerable importance in promoting the expulsion of liquid hydrocarbons but the mechanism is unclear. As it is universally agreed that dispersed organic matter (DOM) in some shales readily generates and expels petroleum, it is curious that few consistent geochemical differences have been found between coal macerals and DOM in interbedded shales. Unambiguous evidence of expulsion from coals is limited, and in particular only a few commercial oil discoveries can be confidently correlated to coals. These include Upper Cretaceous Fruitland Formation coals in the USA, from which oil is produced; New Zealand Tertiary coals; and Middle Jurassic coals from the Danish North Sea. It is likely that coals have at least contributed to significant oil discoveries in the Gippsland Basin, Australia; in the Turpan Basin, China; and in the Kutei and Ardjuna basins in Indonesia, but this remains unproven. Early reports that early Jurassic coals in mid-Norway were a major source of the reservoired oils have been shown to be inaccurate. None of the proposed ‘rules of thumb’ for generation or expulsion of petroleum from coals seem particularly robust. Decisions on whether a particular coal is likely to have been an active source for oil should consider all available geological and geochemical information. The assumptions made in computational models should be well understood as it is likely with new understandings of processes involved that some of these assumptions will be difficult to sustain. 45 page(s...|$|R

It has an ongoing program of coal resource assessment to optimise future mines within this 20 year period, using a six step resource and mine planning process. Desktop review and conceptual study at preliminary Levels 1 and 2 are based on general coal resource information. Further coal resource investigations are carried out for the more detailed evaluations in secondary assessment, prefeasibility study, feasibility study and detailed engineering from Levels 3 to 6. At Levels 1 and 2, completing conceptual planning, including preliminary resource evaluation and economic appraisal to the target cost uncertainty level of ± 33 per cent, is challenging in New Zealand’s highly variable geological and geographical conditions. Where coal deposit geometries are relatively simple, approximate methods for determining pit limits using overburden strip ratios, <b>seam</b> thickness, physical <b>boundaries,</b> and quality cut-offs may be sufficient. Many New Zealand coalfields are however complicated structurally, with multiple seams and extensive folding and faulting. Coal seams are characterised by variable dip, thickness, and quality over relatively short distances. In the North Island’s Waikato coalfields, coal is typically overlain by weak sediments and clay rich strata that necessitate very flat cut and fill slope angles. The proximity of these deposits to major infrastructure (including towns, highways and rail lines), significant environmental features such as the Waikato river and lakes, and valuable dairy farmland, add further complexity. Traditional preliminary mine planning techniques applied in these conditions are insufficient. Pit optimisation software, widely used in the metalliferous mining industry since the 1980 s, offers the ability to analyse many more specific factors affecting pit limits, mine layouts, and economics, with more rigour and for a much larger number of scenarios, than traditional methods allow.
