40|$|Abstract- Ultrasonic {{blood flow}} sensing is a {{non-invasive}} method for measuring blood flow velocity. The {{objective of this}} work is to produce a low-cost ultrasonic blood flow instrument utilizing Doppler shifted signals and enhanced signal processing methods. The instrument transmits a <b>single-frequency</b> <b>signal</b> into circulatory tissues and receives a signal that is Doppler shifted in proportion to velocity. Subsequent processing techniques produce an audio feedback signal whereby the user “hears ” the flow characteristics. The circuit used consists of a transmitter, receiver, and frequency shifter. Signal processing is performed externally to produce velocity profiles of arterial blood flow using Matlab ™ to create spectrograms and low-pass filtering on the recorded feedback signals. Spectrogram provide mapping of the velocity profiles. Resultant mapping indicate that velocity profiles have a roughly parabolic shape and that filtering is required to reduce high frequency noise.

The excellent performance of the TA devices on broadband signal responses will provide a design approach for sound parametric array and underwater communication equipment.

40|$|Detection of a {{pure tone}} signal in a {{narrowband}} noise masker can be improved {{by the introduction of}} coherently amplitude modulated masker bands in neighboring frequency regions, an effect called comodulation masking release (CMR). Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that detection of a spectrally complex signal in a comodulated masker critically depends on the signal∕masker interaction, with best sensitivity in conditions where the signal introduces across-frequency stimulus envelope differences. Consistent with this hypothesis, thresholds for a multi-frequency signal differed by approximately 10 dB depending on the relative patterns of signal∕masker interaction across frequency. In comodulated maskers, there was no improvement in threshold relative to the <b>single-frequency</b> <b>signal</b> threshold even in cases where the multi-frequency signal introduced across-frequency envelope differences. Experiment 2 tested conditions that have previously been associated with large spectral integration in comodulated but not random maskers.

Thus two distinctly different quantities are involved. In this review we define the quantities first, without reference to the units, as is standard practice in any system of quantities and units. We show that two different definitions of the quantity power level, or logarithmic power ratio, are possible.
