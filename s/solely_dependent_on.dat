5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of the forest for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville {{was in charge}} of a forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a punishment, and used the forest law because it was <b>solely</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1870s South Australia's defence was <b>solely</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the {{volunteer}} military, {{and a few}} artillery pieces purchased during earlier war scares. British troops had been withdrawn from the Australian colonies in 1870, leaving the state dependent on its own military resources. In {{a report to the}} government in 1866, Colonel Freeling and Major Peter Scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force. In 1876 the South Australian government, along with those from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland requested from the War Office that Major General Sir William Jervois, a noted coastal fortification expert, be appointed to advise on defence needs. He arrived in Sydney in mid-1877 with then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley. The 1877 report, delivered after he became South Australian Governor, called for three batteries, at Largs Bay, Semaphore and Glenelg, connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements, naval elements and mobile forces. He determined that South Australia's most probable defence risk was an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force, and this formed the basis of the final fortification design. His report called for Military Road to be extended to Marino, an electro-contact torpedo station be established on Torrens Island and that a gun boat be provided. In November 1878 the government passed the Military Forces Act, which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve. Two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in 1878 and a permanent artillery unit in 1882.|$|E

In recent years, climate change has resulted in much lower rain levels with drought periods lasting for much longer.

500|$|The code of many {{projects}} {{has to be}} modified to suit the GPU processing of Titan, but each code is required to be executable on CPU-based systems so that projects do not become <b>solely</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> Titan. OLCF formed the Center for Accelerated Application Readiness (CAAR) to aid with the adaptation process. It holds developer workshops at Nvidia headquarters to educate users about the architecture, compilers and applications on Titan. CAAR {{has been working on}} compilers with Nvidia and code vendors to integrate directives for GPUs into their programming languages. Researchers can thus express parallelism in their code with their existing programming language, typically Fortran, C or C++, and the compiler can express it to the GPUs. Dr. Bronson Messer, a computational astrophysicist, said of the task: [...] "...an application using Titan to the utmost must also find a way to keep the GPU busy, remembering all the while that the GPU is fast, but less flexible than the CPU." [...] Moab Cluster Suite is used to prioritize jobs to nodes to keep utilization high; it improved efficiency from 70% to approximately 95% in the tested software. Some projects found that the changes increased efficiency of their code on non-GPU machines; the performance of Denovo doubled on CPU-based machines.|$|E

60|$|Finally, {{the facts}} given {{in this chapter}} prove in how close and {{remarkable}} a manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small cellular mass forming a bud, resemble each other in all their functions--in their power of inheritance with occasional reversion,--and in their capacity for variation of the same general nature, in obedience to the same laws. This resemblance, or rather identity of character, {{is shown in the}} most striking manner {{by the fact that the}} cellular tissue of one species or variety, when budded or grafted on another, may give rise to a bud having an intermediate character. We have seen that variability does not depend on sexual generation, though much more frequently its concomitant than of bud reproduction. We have seen that bud-variability is not <b>solely</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> reversion or atavism to long-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired from a cross, but appears often to be spontaneous. But when we ask ourselves what is the cause of any particular bud-variation, we are lost in doubt, being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the external conditions of life as sufficient, and in other cases to feel a profound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part, of not more importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass of combustible matter.|$|E
40|$|Use of {{satellite}} data in crop growth monitoring could provide great value for regional food security assessments. By using {{the difference between}} remotely sensed crop canopy temperature and the corresponding ambient temperature {{at the time of}} the satellite overpass the daily actual rate of transpiration can be inferred. This relationship allows adjustment of the actual rate of assimilation and hence of actual crop growth. Although promising results were obtained using methods based on this premise, the sensitivity of these methods to temporal variability outside the time-window of the satellite overpass is a concern. Based on our findings we show that temporal aspects are indeed not negligible and an improvement in the accuracy of crop productivity assessments can be achieved if data from satellites with different temporal and spatial resolutions are combined. In this study, data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) instrument aboard the polar orbiting satellite National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration # 14 (NOAA- 14) and data from the Visible Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) instrument onboard the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite # 5 (GMS- 5) are integrated in a dynamic crop growth simulation procedure.

Handwriting is greatly modified by the fashion of the time. It is in reality a compromise between what the writer most likes to produce, and what he can produce with the greatest ease to himself.
