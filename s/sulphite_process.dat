40|$|Abstract Background Corn cob residue (CCR) {{is a kind}} {{of waste}} {{lignocellulosic}} material with enormous potential for bioethanol production. The moderated <b>sulphite</b> <b>processes</b> were used to enhance the hydrophily of the material by sulfonation and hydrolysis. The composition, FT-IR spectra, and conductometric titrations of the pretreated materials were measured to characterize variations of the CCR in different sulfite pretreated environments. And the objective {{of this study is to}} compare the saccharification rate and yield of the samples caused by these variations. Results It was found that the lignin in the CCR (43. 2 %) had reduced to 37. 8 %, 38. 0 %, 35. 9 %, and 35. 5 % after the sulfite pretreatment in neutral, acidic, alkaline, and ethanol environments, respectively. The sulfite pretreatments enhanced the glucose yield of the CCR. Moreover, the ethanol sulfite sample had the highest glucose yield (81. 2 %, based on the cellulose in the treated sample) among the saccharification samples, which was over 10 % higher than that of the raw material (70. 6 %). More sulfonic groups and weak acid groups were produced during the sulfite pretreatments. Meanwhile, the ethanol sulfite treated sample had the highest sulfonic group (0. 103 mmol/g) and weak acid groups (1. 85 mmol/g) in all sulfite treated samples. In FT-IR spectra, the variation of bands at 1168 and 1190 cm - 1 confirmed lignin sulfonation during sulfite pretreatment. The disappearance of the band at 1458 cm - 1 implied the methoxyl on lignin had been removed during the sulfite pretreatments. Conclusions It can be concluded that the lignin in the CCR can be degraded and sulfonated during the sulfite pretreatments. The pretreatments improve the hydrophility of the samples because of the increase in sulfonic group and weak acid groups, which enhances the glucose yield of the material. The ethanol sulfite pretreatment is the best method for lignin removal and with the highest glucose yield. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Even while Pagenstecher was {{starting}} up the Hudson River mill, in 1869 Illustrious Remington {{and his three}} sons, Hiram, Alfred D. and Charles R., were making a ton of newsprint daily in Watertown, New York, using four rag machines and an 84" [...] fourdrinier machine. By 1870, the Remingtons, seeing a future for wood pulp, built three mills on Sewall's Island in Watertown. These mills used the Voelter process allowing a low-cost, high-quality Remington newsprint {{to be made of}} 75% rags and 25% wood pulp instead of all-rag content paper costing five times more. A third invention caught the imagination of the Remingtons. In 1867, Benjamin Tilghman, an American chemist, discovered that sulphurous acid (H2SO3) dissolved the lignin in wood, leaving a residue of cellulose fibers. Nought came of this discovery. However, Alfred D. Remington learned that a Swede, Carl Daniel Ekman, was teaching papermakers in Sweden to make paper entirely out of wood pulp by using a <b>sulphite</b> <b>process</b> (SO3). Remington went to Sweden to see [...] "This Miracle" [...] for himself. He was so impressed that he imported Swedish chemical fiber for several years and later developed the [...] "sulphite process" [...] in his own plant on Sewall's Island. The Remingtons were selling newsprint to the New York Times. They received an order for ten tons stipulating that the newsprint contain no wood pulp! A. D. Remington, proud of his new product, sent it to the Times along with a note, asking them to try it. The reply was, [...] "come and get your paper", which he did. It wasn't long before the Times was eager and willing to buy this new and cheaper newsprint. The revolution in paper-making in the Black River region was complete: fourdrinier machines became bigger and bigger and faster and faster; the demand for spruce was insatiable and the lumbermen practically denuded the virgin forests; the unpleasant odor of the sulphite mills replaced the equally unpleasant odor of the tanneries. Other paper-makers, emulating the success of the Remingtons embarked on a costly program of mass-production of wood pulp newsprint.|$|E

The soda-anthraquinone process yielded similar quantities of pulp, with the same kappa number and marginally lower strength characteristics. The soda process needed a more severe chemical dose to yield less pulp, with the same kappa number and much lower strength characteristics.

40|$|Waste from {{pulp and}} paper mills consist of sugar-rich {{fractions}} comprising hemicellulose derivatives and cellulose by-products. A complete characterisation of the waste streams is necessary to study the possibilities of an existing mill. In this work, four chromatographic methods {{have been developed to}} obtain the most suitable chromatographic method conditions for measuring woody feedstocks, lignocellulosic hydrolysates and cellulose pulp in <b>sulphite</b> pulping <b>processes.</b> The analysis of major and minor monosaccharides, aliphatic carboxylic acids and furfurals has been optimised. An important drawback of the spent liquors generated after sulphite pulping is their acidic nature, high viscosity and adhesive properties that interfere in the column lifetime. This work recommends both a CHO- 782 Pb column for the sugar analysis and an SH- 1011 resin-based cross-linked gel column to separate low-molecular-weight chain acids, alcohols and furfurals.

[...] cmartin@irnase. csic. esLignosulphonates {{are complex}} biopolymers which are {{recovered}} from the spent sulphite pulping liquids. In the production of wood pulp using a <b>sulphite</b> pulping <b>process,</b> the lignins are sulphonated so they become water soluble. Lignosulphonates are used as binders, dispersants, emulsifiers and sequestrants {{in a host of}} products such as gypsum board, animal feed pellets and micronutrient systems. The properties of lignosulphonates are strongly affected by their structure, and therefore whether they are produced from softwoods, hardwoods, or grasses. In this work, we are using analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in order to get information on the structure of lignosulphonates. Analytical pyrolysis is a rapid and highly sensitive technique for characterizing the chemical structure of lignin, allowing the analysis of small amounts of sample without prior manipulation and/or isolation. Characteristic features of lignins, including their composition in terms of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units can be established based upon analytical pyrolysis. Four different lignosulphonate samples (one from hardwood and three from softwoods) were selected for this study: # 261 (hardwood calcium lignosulphonate); # 264 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 265 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 266 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+). These samples were analyzed by Py-GC/MS in order to asses the suitability of this technique for their characterization. All the lignosulphonate samples released, upon Py-GC/MS, high amounts of low molecular weight sulphur compounds (sulphur dioxide, dimethyl sulphide, propylene sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide and methanesulphonic acid methyl ester) arising from the sulphonate group. Lignin-derived compounds with both guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) structures, characteristic of a hardwood lignin, as well as some amounts of carbohydrate-derived compounds, were identified in lignosulphonate # 261. However, only guaiacyl (G) lignin-derived compounds, characteristic of softwood lignins, were present in the rest of lignosulphonates (samples # 264, # 265, # 266). The presence of only guaiacol and vanillic acid methyl ester in the pyrolysate of the lignosulphonate sample # 266 seems to indicate that this sample is more oxidized than the rest.

40|$|Despite a {{long history}} of growing Eucalyptus species in {{arboriculture}} in Britain (Purse and Leslie, 2016), there has been little interest in their potential for forestry until very recently. This situation is in marked contrast to that in many other countries, where many species found various forestry uses, notably for firewood production and for land reclamation (Zacharin, 1978; FAO, 1979). However, they did not become important timber species due to the poor sawmilling properties of trees, which were young compared to old-growth trees used for timber in their native Australia (e. g. Barr, 1996; Santos 1997). This situation changed in many countries with the discovery that certain eucalypts produce excellent quality short-fibre pulp using the Kraft and <b>sulphite</b> chemical <b>processes</b> (Doughty, 2000). There was burgeoning demand for such pulp from the 1950 s, and increasingly limited supplies of other suitable hardwood feedstocks, such as birch in Scandinavia and mixed hardwoods in the USA. This led to a surge of commercially-driven research on Eucalyptus, spanning silviculture, genetics, propagation and wood properties. This established that many eucalypts respond well to intensive silviculture, and can produce trees of a size and quality suitable for pulp on rotations of 7 - 10 years. The approach became known as short rotation forestry (SRF), and is practiced on an immense scale worldwide today, largely by the private sector (Marcus Wallenberg Foundation, 1984; Carle and Holmgren, 2008). The UK never has had a chemical pulp industry, and so these developments had little impact. Small trials of Eucalyptus for forestry in the UK only started in the 1950 s (Macdonald et. al., 1957) while the first systematic trials in the UK were in the 1980 s (Evans, 1986), although in Ireland trials started earlier in the 20 th century (O’Beirne, 1945; Mooney, 1960). Few of these trials were successful, and survival of the trees was frequently poor (Evans, 1980). These findings, coupled with poor timber quality, meant that little interest was generated. An exception was the small commercial coppice plantations supplying the floristry market with cut foliage. These have existed in Britain since the 1960 s, mainly in south-west England and in north Wales. Similar plantations were developed in Ireland at this time (Pollock, 1984; Forrest, 2000). In this article we review these and more recent trials in the context of commercial eucalyptus forestry elsewhere in the world, and identify the opportunities and risks that would be associated with undertaking larger-scale plantings of Eucalyptus species in Britain. We have previously discussed the species that are likely to be most suitable for this purpose (Purse and Leslie, 2016) ...|$|R
40|$|Lignosulphonates are by‐products {{from the}} <b>sulphite</b> pulping <b>process</b> for the {{manufacture}} ofspecialty dissolving pulps and paper. During {{the liberation of}} the cellulose, the lignin isfractionated and solubilised through covalent addition of sulphonic acid groups at variouspositions in the structure. The formed sulphonated lignin, lignosulphonate is then furtherisolated and refined. The amphiphilic nature of lignosulphonates has enabled them {{to be used as}} additives to varioussuspensions to improve their dispersion and stability. The by far largest utilisation oflignosulphonates is as dispersants in concrete. Here, lignosulphonates act by dispersing cementparticles to prevent flocculation, un‐even particle distribution and reduced strengthdevelopment. The dispersion is achieved through steric and electrostatic repulsion of the cementparticles by the lignosulphonate polymer. This behaviour is intimately linked with the overallsize and amount of charged groups in the dispersing polymer. Traditional modifications oflignosulphonates have been limited to removal of sugars, filtration and fractionation. Thesemodifications are not sufficient for utilisation of lignosulphonates in high‐strength concrete. Heresynthetic dispersants and superplasticisers are used which are considerably more efficient evenat low dosages. To compete with these, additional modifications of lignosulphonates are likely tobe necessary. The molecular weight and functional group composition have been identified anddescribed as the most interesting parameters that can be modified. Currently, no suitable method exists to increase the molecular weight of lignosulphonates. Oxidation by the natural radical initiating enzyme laccase is an interesting tool to achieve suchmodifications. In this thesis several aspects of the mechanism through which this enzyme reactswith lignin and lignosulphonate structures have been elucidated through model compoundstudies. Further studies showed that laccase alone was a highly efficient tool for increasing themolecular weight of commercial lignosulphonates at low dosages and in short incubation times. Immobilisation of the laccase to a solid support to enable re‐utilisation was also investigated. Modification of functional group composition of lignosulphonates was achieved throughozonolysis and the Fenton’s reagent, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron(II) acetate. Introduction of charged carboxylic groups was achieved through opening of the benzyl rings oflignosulphonates. It was found that a two‐stage process consisting of laccase oxidation followedby ozonolysis was an efficient technique to create a polymer enriched with carboxylic acidgroups with a sufficient molecular size. Oxidation by the Fenton’s reagent was shown to yield similar modifications as the combinedlaccase/ozonolysis treatment albeit with less pronounced results but with a large level of controlthrough variation of a number of reaction parameters. The Fenton’s reagent can therefore be aninteresting alternative to the aforementioned two‐stage treatment. These modifications are interesting for large‐scale applications not only because of theirsimplicity in terms of reaction parameters but also because of the ubiquity of the used enzymeand the chemicals in the pulp and paper industry.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sulphonic and carboxylic acid groups {{in combination with}} the effect of counter ion form, on the swelling capacity of mechanical pulp fibres was studied by means of water retention value (WRV) measured in the temperature range from 25 to 95 oC. Mechanical pulp fibres (TMP) were treated with hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium sulphite during conditions resembling those used in chemimechanical and bleaching processes commonly used in the industry. In conventional chemimechanical <b>processes</b> <b>sulphite</b> treatment is used before refining while peroxide treatment can be utilized both before and after refining. In this study we did however also use sulphite after peroxide treatment. When subjecting sodium sulphite treated pulps to a subsequent hydrogen peroxide step, all pulps show a decrease in sulphonic acid groups, which could be owed to dissolution of highly charged lignin. Pulps treated with a high hydrogen peroxide charge (4 %), showed a loss in carboxylic acid groups during subsequent treatment with sodium sulphite. This loss is probably due to dissolution of highly charged fibre material such as demethylated pectins. Both increased degree of sulphonation and carboxylation of the lignin reduces the softening temperature by means of reducing the degree of cross-linking in the lignin matrix. This softening probably improves the compressibility of the fibre pads in the sample holders of the WRV centrifuge, which would counteract an otherwise expected increasing WRV-value due to increased swelling potential. This makes it difficult to see clear trends in WRV as a function of increase in degree of sulphonation and carboxylation. When changing counter ion form from proton or calcium form to sodium form there is however always a clear increase in WRV in the range from 20 to 30 %.

40|$|A catalyzed chemimechanical-anthraquinone pulping {{of black}} spruce wood was {{investigated}} in this study. The effect of liquor pH on anthraquinone performance, AQ and mass transfer limitations on chemimechanical pulp properties {{and the effects of}} AQ, liquor pH and sulphite concentration on pulping kinetic were studied. It was observed that AQ was not an effective redox catalyst when added to the sulphite liquor at pH 4, but it was very effective at pH 7 and higher. When chemical treatment of chemimechanical pulping was done with the presence of AQ, the sulphur content of pulp was reduced due to preferential reaction of AQ with wood components. AQ, as a pulping agent, is much effective in increasing the delignification rate {{and at the same time}} protecting the degradation of carbohydrates. Pulps produced from wood wafers with cooking liquor at pH 7 containing 0. 1 % of AQ on oven dry wood, exhibited the following improved properties when compared with those prepared without addition of AQ: increased pulping rate, higher pulp yield and carbohydrates yield at the same level of residual lignin in pulp, and in addition, the strength properties such as breaking length and burst strength improved by 15 % even with a minimum AQ charge (0. 05 % and 0. 01 %). With regular wood chips, the penetration of sulphite seems to be superior to that of AQ. It was observed that AQ was not uniformly distributed in the impregnated wood chips even when the compression ratio was increased from 3. 5 : 1 to 5 : 1. The penetration of AQ into wood chips remains to be a major factor affecting the pulping rate and pulp properties (strength and brightness) in chemimechanical-AQ pulping. The rate of delignification in the initial phase of both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking at pH 7 shows the second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The order with respect to sulphite concentration for sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking were estimated to be 0. 24 and 0. 31, respectively. The activation energies of delignification of the initial phase in sulphite and sulphite-AQ pulping were 90. 2 and 97. 5 kJ/mole which was valid up to 30 % lignin removal within the temperature range of 160 °C and 175 °C. AQ as a pulping additive introduced to the sulphite liquor increased the rate of delignification 1. 5 times in the initial phase of delignification during the <b>sulphite</b> cooking <b>process.</b> At initial pH of sulphite liquor ranging from 7 to 10, the rate of delignification in the initial phase during sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking appears to be a second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The reaction orders with respect to sulphite concentration increases when the initial pH is below 8 and decreases when the initial pH is above 8 for both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking. The raw of delignificafion is dependent on the initial pH of cooking liquor and the addition of AQ...|$|R
