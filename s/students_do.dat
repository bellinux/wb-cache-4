The school is responsible for student safety, even when the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> not participate in the school to organize a religious ceremony. The school organizes the student the opportunity for a period of other activities. In high school, notification is made by the student himself.|$|R

5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary <b>students</b> <b>do</b> {{not believe that the}} HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E

25|$|Controversies {{concerning}} {{gifted education}} are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon {{the appropriateness of}} the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'.

In addition, fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and, among those who do, fewer complete the 10th grade.|$|E

25|$|After {{allowing}} for the socio-economic status of the parents, children attending private schools are not as able as those at state schools. At the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for example, after considering socioeconomic class, students at private schools underperformed those at state schools. One has, however, to be careful interpreting that data: {{it may be that}} such <b>students</b> <b>do</b> not underperform because they attend a private school, but that they attend a private school because they underperform. Some private Realschulen and Gymnasien have lower entry requirements than public Realschulen and Gymnasien.|$|E
25|$|Although age is not {{necessarily}} a prerequisite, many ballet <b>students</b> <b>do</b> not begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and, in such cases, serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe work too early. The long bones in feet begin to harden within the ages of 8 to 14, dancing en pointe before one's bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.|$|E
