2500|$|IBM {{donated the}} Lotus Symphony {{codebase}} to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012, and Symphony was deprecated {{in favour of}} Apache OpenOffice. Many features and bug fixes, including a reworked sidebar, were merged. [...] The IAccessible2 screen reader support from Symphony was ported and included in the AOO 4.1 release (April 2014), although its first appearance in an open source <b>software</b> <b>release</b> was as part of LibreOffice 4.2 in January 2014. IBM ceased official participation by the release of AOO 4.1.1.|$|E
2500|$|A CD <b>software</b> <b>release</b> {{can contain}} up to 700megabytes of data, which {{presented}} challenges when sending over the Internet, {{particularly in the}} late 1990s when broadband was unavailable to most home consumers. These challenges apply to an even greater extent for a single-layer DVD release, which can contain up to 4.7GB of data. The warez scene made it standard practice to split releases up into many separate pieces, called disks, using several file compression formats: (historical TAR, LZH, ACE, UHA, ARJ), ZIP, and most commonly RAR. The original purpose of these [...] "disks" [...] was so that each [...]rar file could fit on a single 1.44MB 3½ inch floppy disk. With the growing size of games, {{this is no longer}} feasible, as hundreds of disks would need to be used. The average size of disks released by groups today are 50megabytes or 100megabytes, however it is common to find disks up to 200megabytes.|$|E
