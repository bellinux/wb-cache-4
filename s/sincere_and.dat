5|$|The seventh episode {{features}} Stéphane Quême, {{otherwise known}} as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework. Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from {{it in the same}} way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{was born}} as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town, London, in 1797. She {{was the second}} child of the feminist philosopher, educator, and writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and {{journalist}} William Godwin. Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), which he intended as a <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> compassionate tribute. However, because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her illegitimate child, they were seen as shocking. Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|The {{precepts of}} Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> truthful dialogue. Force {{must be the}} last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its {{objective}} to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E

25|$|By 1815 {{the use of}} the Lot to {{determine}} membership began to wane.

The elders were satisfied she was <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> the congregation had no objection; but the Lot said 'no'.|$|E

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} argued that Molotov continued the talks with Britain and France {{to stimulate the}} Germans into making an offer of a non-aggression treaty and that the triple alliance failed because of the Soviet determination to conclude a pact with Germany. Another {{point of view is}} that the Soviet's pursuit of a triple alliance was <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> that the Soviet government turned to Germany only when an alliance with the Western powers proved impossible.|$|E

25|$|The Legionnaires were {{refugees}} and exiles who dated from Francia's day. Their opposition to tyranny was <b>sincere,</b> <b>and</b> they gravitated toward democratic ideologies.

Believing that more freedom would cure Paraguay's ills, they abolished slavery and founded a constitutional government {{as soon as they}} came to power. They based the new government on the standard classical liberal prescriptions of free enterprise, free elections, and free trade.|$|E
25|$|The {{negotiations}} {{were long and}} difficult. While the Russians were losing ground to the Poles, who took Kiev in May 1920, the Lithuanians sought to delay the talks. On May 22, 1920, the Lithuanian delegation even threatened {{to withdraw from the}} peace talks. However, as the situation changed and Russia successfully counterattacked, the Lithuanians were pressured into signing the treaty on July 12. After some debate over whether the treaty was <b>sincere,</b> <b>and</b> whether the Soviets had assumed any real liability, the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania ratified it on August 8, 1920.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} for a long time the collective security doctrine was a <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> unanimous position of the Soviet leadership, pursuing a purely defensive line, whereas others contend that from the very beginning the Soviet Union intended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, collective security being merely tactical counter to some unfriendly German moves. However, perhaps Moscow sought to avoid a great war in Europe because it was not strong enough to fight an offensive war; but there was much disagreement over the policy between Litvinov and Molotov about how to attain that goal, and Stalin alternated between their positions, initially pursuing both contradictory lines simultaneously quite early and abandoning collective security only at some point in 1939.|$|E

25|$|The villain Shockwave {{revealed}} {{during his}} battle with Jaime that Kord Industries is {{now owned by}} the 100. He again came into conflict with Kid Devil, who still harbored a grudge against him because of both the future Titans incident and his status with Ravager. Jaime tries to mend fences with Kid Devil, but their squabbling allows Shockwave to escape. During their second battle with him, Kid Devil managed to tap into his demonic powers and partially melts Shockwave's armor, enabling the two boys to defeat him. This seems to squelch the ill feelings between them. Kid Devil asks Jaime if he's heard from Ravager and Jaime replies that he's faced down an entire alien race, but Ravager scares him. Kid Devil finally realizes that Jaime is being <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> they shake hands and tell each other their real names. Later at Titans Tower Robin offers Jaime full-membership, which Jaime finally feels ready to accept.|$|E

25|$|Though he had {{recently}} toured Cameroonian in 1975 in December 1979 a full account of {{the circumstances under which}} Knight of Bahá'u'lláh for Cameroon, Hand of the Cause, Enoch Olinga had been murdered Sept. 16th 1977 in Uganda during political and social turmoil. Final answers may never be known why he and most of his family were murdered with confidence. A biography published in 1984 examined his impact in Cameroon and beyond. The first person in Cameroon to join the religion withstood beatings to persevere in his choice. The first woman to become a Bahá'í in Cameroon did so from his impact on her life though she had been an active Christian before - both she and her husband converted and {{were among the first to}} move to Togo and then Ghana. Another early Bahá'í, the first of the Bamiliki tribe, moved to what was then French Cameroon to help there. Another early contact joined the religion later but his wife was the first Bahá'í of Nigeria. The researcher again found that there was an emphasis not on rooting out cultural traditions among the peoples but instead focusing on awareness of the religion and awareness of scientific knowledge should not relate to social class. There were accusations of political intrigue of which Olinga was acquitted. It was judged that Olinga was always <b>sincere</b> <b>and</b> never belittled.|$|E
