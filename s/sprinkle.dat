5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are {{provided to the}} gods. Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to <b>sprinkle</b> mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated {{as part of the}} ritual itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to <b>sprinkle</b> sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with a}} bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E

40|$|Six heifers were {{housed in}} {{controlled}} environmental stalls.

This {{was followed by a}} one day hot period during which all heifers were <b>sprinkled</b> (1300 - 1500 hours). Rectal temperature and respiration rate were reduced in all animals during the first three days of heat stress. On days four and five, heifers <b>sprinkled</b> four hours had lower rectal temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate than heifers which were not <b>sprinkled.</b> Comparison of rectal temperature on days one - three vs day six of heat stress revealed heifers not <b>sprinkled</b> on days four - five were higher on day six vs days one - three. <b>Sprinkling</b> cattle effectively alters physiological responses to heat stress and improves dry matter intake...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of sprinkler misting (<b>sprinkling</b> water applied from 1 · 0 to 1 · 5 mm) on field micro-climate, canopy temperature and crop yield under hot-dry windy conditions in the North China Plain. Results indicated that canopy temperature in the <b>sprinkled</b> field depressed quickly after <b>sprinkling</b> stopped and was closely related to air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. Within 50 - 60 min after <b>sprinkling</b> ceased, the canopy temperature in the <b>sprinkled</b> field approximately equalled that in the non-sprinkled field. Water surface evaporation measured using a standard 20 cm diameter pan placed above {{the top of the}} canopy was about 0 · 8 mm/day lower in the <b>sprinkled</b> field than in the non-sprinkled field. The yield of winter wheat observed in the <b>sprinkled</b> field was higher than in the non-sprinkled field by about 291 kg/ha. In conclusion, sprinkler misting (<b>sprinkling</b> about 1 · 0 - 1 · 5 mm water amount for each event) is a useful method to timely improve field micro-climate and regulate canopy temperature under hot-dry windy conditions. © 2006 IAgrE...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate strategies designed to reduce heat stress of cattle. In the first experiment, cattle were <b>sprinkled</b> for 20 min every 1. 5 h between 1000 hours and 1750 hours (WET) versus not <b>sprinkled</b> (DRY). In a second experiment, treatments consisted of: (1) control, no water application; (2) water applied to the pen surfaces between 1000 hours and 1200 hours (AM); and (3) water applied to pen surfaces between 1400 hours and 1600 hours (PM). In both experiments, <b>sprinkling</b> lowered (P< 0. 05) mid-afternoon temperatures. In the first experiment, relative humidity (RH) of WET versus DRY pens differed (P< 0. 05) and averaged 72. 4 and 68. 9 %, respectively. The average temperature-humidity index (THI) in WET pens was 0. 5 units lower (P< 0. 05), than the THI in DRY pens. In the second experiment, RH in <b>sprinkled</b> pens was also greater (P< 0. 05) than RH in control (CON) pens However, THI differed (P< 0. 05) among treatments, being 81. 5, 80. 9, and 80. 3, respectively for CON, AM, and PM. Pens with sprinklers had {{a larger percentage of}} steers in areas where <b>sprinkling</b> took place, even on days when <b>sprinkling</b> had not occurred. Based on differences in percentage of cattle panting in <b>sprinkled</b> and non-sprinkled treatments, <b>sprinkling</b> was found to {{have a positive effect on}} cattle feeding area microclimate and to reduce the susceptibility of cattle to hyperthermia. However, cattle acclimatization to being <b>sprinkled</b> can result in slight hyperthermia even during cooler days when <b>sprinkling</b> would normally not be utilized...|$|R

According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or <b>sprinkle</b> the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.|$|E
