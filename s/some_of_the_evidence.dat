5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{submitted}} by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia. One of them has been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and has <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E

25|$|In November 2015, {{a former}} {{education}} minister in Gaddafi's regime {{was arrested at}} his home in England on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The man, believed by The Guardian to be Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk, had applied for political asylum in the UK following the Libyan Civil War in 2011.

25|$|Baxley then {{requested}} {{access to}} the original FBI files on the case and discovered that evidence accumulated by the FBI against the named suspects between 1963 and 1965 had not been revealed to the prosecutors in Birmingham.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of over 1000 specimens of Coelophysis at the Whitaker quarry at Ghost Ranch, has suggested gregarious behavior to researchers like Schwartz and Gillette. There {{is a tendency}} to see this massive congregation of animals as evidence for huge packs of Coelophysis bauri roaming the land. No direct evidence for flocking exists; the deposits only indicate that large numbers of Coelophysis, along with other Triassic animals, were buried together. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> from the taphonomy of the site indicates that these animals may have been gathered together to feed or drink from a depleted water hole or to feed on a spawning run of fish, and then became buried in a catastrophic flash flood or a drought.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. Please keep in mind that most of the information in this article is theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> is contradictory.

25|$|Moi's regime now {{faced the}} end of the Cold War, and an economy stagnating under rising oil prices and falling prices for {{agricultural}} commodities. At the same time the West no longer dealt with Kenya as it had in the past, when it was viewed as a strategic regional outpost against communist influences from Ethiopia and Tanzania. At that time Kenya had received much foreign aid, and the country was accepted as well governed with Moi as a legitimate leader and firmly in charge. Western allies deliberately overlooked the increasing degree of political repression, including the use of torture at the infamous Nyayo House torture chambers. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of these torture cells was eventually to be exposed in 2003 after Mwai Kibaki became President.|$|E
25|$|The Jefferson-Wayles {{descendants}} {{and most}} historians denied for nearly 200 {{years that he}} was the father of Hemings' children. Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> and thought to interpret it differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian Dumas Malone later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.|$|E
25|$|After the insurrection of 10 August, Roland was {{reinstated}} as Interior Minister, but {{was dismayed}} {{by what he}} saw as the lack of progress made by the Revolution. As a provincial, he opposed the Montagnards who aimed at supremacy not only in Paris but in the government as well. His hostility to the Paris Commune prompted him to propose transferring the government to Blois; and his attacks on Robespierre and his associates made him very unpopular. After failing to seal the armoire de fer (iron chest) found in the Tuileries Palace, containing documents that indicated Louis XVI's relations with corrupt politicians, he was accused of destroying <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> within. Finally, during the trial of the king, he and the Girondists demanded that the sentence should be decided by a poll of the French people rather than the National Convention. Two days after the king's execution, he resigned his office.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> current climate <b>of</b> “accountability” and “transparency” as {{demanded by}} the public, policy makers justify their actions by drawing on {{research}} findings and data collected by various means.

More recently, education policy documents drawing on international student survey results have appeared around the world. This paper evaluates <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences</b> used by policy makers and shows that {{there is a great deal}} <b>of</b> uncertainty surrounding <b>the</b> data underlying these research findings.
