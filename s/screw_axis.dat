5000|$|Lead [...] {{and pitch}} {{are closely related}} concepts. They can be {{confused}} {{because they are the}} same for most screws. Lead is the distance along the <b>screw's</b> <b>axis</b> that is covered by one complete rotation of the screw (360°). Pitch is the distance from the crest of one thread to the next. Because the vast majority of screw threadforms are single-start threadforms, their lead and pitch are the same. Single-start means {{that there is only one}} [...] "ridge" [...] wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of one ridge. [...] "Double-start" [...] means that there are two [...] "ridges" [...] wrapped around the cylinder of the screw's body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of two ridges. Another way to express this is that lead and pitch are parametrically related, and the parameter that relates them, the number of starts, very often has a value of 1, in which case their relationship becomes equality. In general, lead is equal to pitch times the number of starts.|$|R

40|$|Pedicle screw {{fixation}} is a challenging procedure in thoracic spine, as inadvertently misplaced screws have {{high risk of}} complications. The accuracy of pedicle screws is typically defined as the <b>screws</b> <b>axis</b> being fully contained within the cortices of the pedicle. One hundred and eighty-five thoracic pedicle screws in 19 patients that were drawn from a total of 1. 797 screws in 148 scoliosis patients being suspicious of medial and lateral malpositioning were investigated, retrospectively. Screw containment {{and the rate of}} misplacement were determined by postoperative axial CT sections. Medial screw malposition was measured between medial pedicle wall and medial margin of the pedicle screw. The distance between lateral margin of the pedicle screw and lateral vertebral corpus was measured in lateral malpositions. A screw that violated medially greater than 2  mm, while lateral violation greater than 6  mm was rated as an “unacceptable screw”. The malpositions were medial in 20 (10. 8 %) and lateral in 34 (18. 3 %) screws. Medially, nine screws were rated as acceptable. Of the 29 acceptable lateral misplacement, 13 showed significant risk; five to aorta, six to pleura, one to azygos vein and one to trachea. The acceptability of medial pedicle breach may change in each level with different canal width and a different amount of cord shift. In lateral acceptable malpositions, the aorta is always at a risk by concave-sided screws. This CT-based study demonstrated that T 4 –T 9 concave segments have a smaller safe zone with respect to both cord-aorta injury in medial and lateral malpositions. In these segments, screws should be accurate and screw malposition is to be unacceptable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Previous {{work in the}} {{open-loop}} {{behavior of}} mag-netically driven screws in soft tissue {{has focused on the}} impact of magnetic field rotation speed and pitch angle, measured between the field’s rotation <b>axis</b> and the <b>screw’s</b> principle <b>axis,</b> on the average magnetic torque, both in-plane and out-of-plane. However, prior work did not rigorously consider the role of screw geometry and tissue material properties on the resulting trajectory. This study seeks to develop a plausible empirical model from experimental measurements in an agar gel tissue phantom for use in further research and feasibility studies of magnetic screws for in vivo applications. Non-dimensional parameters representing rotation speed, pitch angle, screw size, magnetic strength, and tissue stiffness are varied orthogonally. Circular trajectories are fitted to the resulting recorded tra-jectories. Using physical insight and observation of the trends of the non-dimensional turning radius/curvature, simple models for each parameter group are proposed. A final empirical model is then proposed to unify the individual models. I...|$|R
