As long as the brighter-than-normal <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> are within the regulated maximum intensity for <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in general, this kind of implementation does not require specific regulatory approval since the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> are under all conditions operating in accord with the general regulations on <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> intensity, area, and aspect ratio on reaction time. Recent trends in auto body styling have begun to incorporate center high-mounted <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> (CHMSLs) into spoilers and trunk lids. These developments, brought on in part by technical advances in automotive lighting, have resulted in questions about the efficacy of <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> whose effective luminous area is long and narrow. Subjects in this study were asked to perform a computer-based tracking task to control their eye fixations, and to provide the approximate cognitive loading associated with driving, while responding to the onset of <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> of varying characteristics. The results of this laboratory study indicate that aspect ratio and intensity of <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> as well as their interaction, influence reaction time. Specifically, subject reaction times to the onset of simulated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> were longer when the stimulus intensity was low and the aspect ratio was large. These results suggest that further empirical investigation that examines intensity, area, and aspect ratio of <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in the context of the total rear-signaling system is required to determine whether regulation affecting the aspect ratio of <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> or CHMSLs is warranted...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate whether dedicated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> in comparison to <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> that are functionally combined with tail or turn signals, provide additional safety benefits at night. The analysis compared the frequencies of rear-end collisions in which the vehicles were struck to those collisions in which the same vehicles were the striking ones. The analysis used 1999 - 2003 Florida and North Carolina crash data. The vehicle sample consisted of 38 passenger car models for the years 1994 - 2003. Overall, the results include a statistically significant pattern that suggests a beneficial effect of dedicated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b> However, the results are complex and further analyses should be done to better understand the possible effect of dedicated versus combined <b>stop</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|R
25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a single lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> and any rear fog lamp.|$|R

This fast rise time not only improves the intentional conspicuity of the <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> but could also provide following drivers with increased time {{to react to the}} appearance of the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b> However, this faster rise time has not been shown to make cars with LED <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> less likely to be struck from behind.|$|R

25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|R
25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> and vice versa.|$|R

25|$|The 1952 Volkswagen Bus was {{equipped}} with only one <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> mounted centrally and higher than {{the left and right}} rear lamps which did not produce a <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> function. The 1968–1971 Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental high-mounted stop and turn signal lights integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the backglass. The Oldsmobile Toronado from 1971 to 1978, and the Buick Riviera from 1974 to 1976 had similar dual high-mounted supplemental stop/turn lights as standard equipment; these were located {{on the outside of the}} vehicle below the bottom of the backglass. This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time.
