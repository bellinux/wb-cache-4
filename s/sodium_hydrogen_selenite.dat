Bacteriol. 90 : 857 – 862. 1965. —The resistance of three microorganisms, Escherichia coli (ISU- 41), Proteus vulgaris (ISU- 37 c), and Salmonella thompson (ISU- 86 - 2), to increasing concentrations of selenite was determined. E. coli was completely inhibited by 1. 25 % <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenite,</b> and 0. 25 % <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenite</b> caused a pronounced lag. P. vulgaris survived selenite concentrations of over 3 %. S. thompson was inhibited completely by 3 % selenite {{but not by}} 2. 5 %, {{although there was a}} considerable lag and a decrease in total growth. The relationship of growth, uptake, and reduction of selenite was determined. The susceptible E. coli incorporated up to twice as much selenium as did the other two organisms during the early stages of incubation. Radioautographs of seleno analogues of sulfur-containing amino acids revealed the presence of seleno-cystine in all three organisms, and seleno-methionine in E. coli. Compounds having RF values corresponding to possible oxidation products of seleno-methionine were present in the hydrolysates of P. vulgaris and S. thompson. Kinetic aspects of selenite uptake, rather than the ultimate localization of selenite in the cell protein, appear to be the factors that determine the degree of resistance or of susceptibility to selenite...|$|E
40|$|Selenium and Tellurium are two {{elements}} that have gradually gained much importance {{over the years}} due to their notable biological effects and applications. In our experiment, we exposed Lactobacillus casei to different concentrations of <b>Sodium</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>Selenite</b> (NaHSeO 3) and Sodium Tellurite (Na 2 TeO 3). The resulting stable Se-Te nano alloys formed were then extracted from the cell by lysosomal action and further purification. Electron Microscopy shows the gradual change in shape of nano alloys from (spherical to rod) with concentration change, the average particle size ranging from 250 to 450 nm. ICP-MS confirms that bacteria are indeed not selective for either element and synthesise Se-Te nanoalloys using the same mechanism. The nanoparticles exhibit no toxic harm on Paramecium sp. used for toxicological studies. On further comparison with Gold and Silver Nanoparticles, Se-Te Nanoalloys prove to have comparatively lower toxicity on the eukaryotic test model.

In this paper, it was found that: the phytoextraction efficiency of alfalfa plants was enhanced after the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures were added into soil.

With the treatment of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of alfalfa plants and the acid soluble fractions of heavy metals in soils were increased. The translocation factor (TF) values of all alfalfas in heavy metals were low, but the TF of As, Cr, Hg, Mo tended to increase with <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacterial {{production}} of anionic sulphide is {{increased in the}} colon of ulcerative colitis and sulphides can cause metabolic damage to colonocytes. AIMS: To assess the reversal of the damaging effect of sulphide to isolated colonocytes by methionine and methionine derivatives. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: Isolated colonocytes were prepared from rat colons and 12 human colectomy specimens. In cell suspensions 14 CO 2 /acetoacetate generation was measured from [1 - 14 C]-butyrate (5. 0 mmol/l) {{in the presence of}} 0 - 2. 0 mmol/l <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide. The effect of 5. 0 mmol/l L-methionine, S-adenosylmethionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate and DL-methionine-S-methylsulphonium chloride on sulphide inhibited oxidation was observed. RESULTS: In rat colonocytes <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide dose dependently reduced oxidative metabolite formation from n-butyrate, an action reversed in order of efficacy by S-adenosylmethionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate > DLmethionine-S-methyl-sulphonium chloride > L-methionine. In human colonocytes S-adenosylmethionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate most significantly improved 14 CO 2 production (p = < 0. 005) suppressed by <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide.
