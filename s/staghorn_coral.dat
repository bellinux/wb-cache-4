The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral.</b>|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{the keys}} in the Atlantic Ocean the {{seafloor}} slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half {{the area of the}} park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef {{on the edge of the}} Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to [...] water depth, and <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral</b> below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{island has}} {{three types of}} habitats: coral reef, {{seagrass}} and nesting ground for marine turtles. Zoning of the coral reef is mapped under three zones of reef flat, reef slope and lagoon. Next to the shore line are the fringing reefs where fish species of fin and shell fishes spawn, and are found in abundance. As of 1986, there were 45 coral species in the reef. These are threatened due to human interference and natural causes. Live coral is reported in less than 1% area. There are 9 species of live corals in the lagoon and reef slope area. The species of live corals reported are: Acropora formosa (<b>staghorn</b> <b>coral),</b> Acropora robusta, Acropora, Acropora subglabra, [...] Acropora tortuosa, Acropora vaughani, Favites, Pocillopora verrucosa and Lobophytum Benthic organisms are reported on the reef slope and lagoon area. Macrobenthos {{are found in the}} inter-tidal and sub-tidal area. 23 species of polychaetes, 3 species of bivalves, 3 species of crustaceans, and 3 species of gastropods have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} coral reefs {{throughout}} the Caribbean and the world, the Florida Reef exhibits {{some signs of}} stress and deterioration. Precht and Miller state that the numbers of Elkhorn and <b>Staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> (Acropora ssp.) are declining to an extent that is unprecedented in several thousand years. Between 1981 and 1986, <b>Staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> declined by 96% at Molasses Reef. Between 1983 and 2000 at Looe Key, Elkhorn corals declined by 93% and <b>Staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> by 98%. A joint reef monitoring program conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Florida Marine Research Institute and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recorded a loss of 6% to 10% living corals at 40 sampling stations from 1996 to 2000.|$|R

2500|$|The {{area between}} Hans Lollik and Little Hans Lollik is {{relatively}} shallow and {{is primarily a}} hard bottom with scattered large patches of sand and cobble. [...] Currents flowing between the two islands are generally to the west, and are often quite swift. [...] The shallows along the shores of both islands are colonized by head corals, Diploria strigosa, D. clivosa, Siderastrea siderea, D. labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides, Montastraea annularis, M. cavernosa and Dendrogyra cylindrus. [...] There are scattered elkhorn coral Acropora palmata, and <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral</b> A. cervicornis. [...] In the shallower areas, less than 10ft (3 m) most of the Acropora is alive, while deeper there are numerous skeletons of these once massive spreading corals. [...] There are also some very large remnants of Porites porites colonies that lie between the two islands. Some of these mounds are 10 to 12ft (3 to 4 m) in height and width. Agarcia, Millepora, P. porites, {{and a variety of}} sponge species have colonize the dead coral of these mounds. [...] The entire area is destiny colonized by soft coral species and sea plumes, fans feathers are scattered throughout. [...] To the southwest there is a sandy beach, and the sand extends offshore into the bentic environment. [...] Within this sandy area there are emergent areas of rock that have become colonized by corals (Siderastrea and Diploria) and algae. Further offshore there is shallow reef area that is highly impacted by the on coming waves. [...] The reef area supports of variety of soft and hard coral colonization. [...] Along the western side of the island and along the northwestern tip the shoreline is rocky, and the rock extends below the sea. [...] There are large boulders and slabs of rock that lie just below the waters surface along the shore. [...] A diverse community of corals and sponges colonizes this rock substrate that rapidly drops to a depth of 20 to 25ft (6 to 8 m). [...] Head corals (Diploria strigosa, D. clivosa, Sidereastrea siderea, D. labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides, Montastrea annularis, M. cavernosa and Dendrogyra cylindrus), branching corals (Acropora palmate, A cervicornis, Porites porites), and fire corals (Millepora spp.) are common within this area.|$|E

50|$|The {{dominant}} mode of reproduction for <b>staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> is asexual, with new colonies forming when branches break off a colony and reattach to the substrate. This life history trait allows rapid population recovery from physical disturbances such as storms. However, it makes recovery from disease or bleaching episodes (where entire colonies or even entire stands are killed) very difficult.|$|R

40|$|Oral {{presentation}} - Session #: 02 : Abstract ID: 30014 My geologist friends {{tell me that}} Hong Kong has no 'proper' coral reefs. This {{is because}} {{there is no evidence of}} carbonate formations upon which living corals are still found. Instead, corals grow on exposed bedrock in a patchy distribution and any exposed carbonates are quickly eroded away. Were there proper coral reefs in the past? Consider that during the Qing Dynasty the industrial production of slaked lime was extensive throughout Hong Kong, yielding 40 tons per year from mining living bivalve and coral communities. Indeed, historical records and archaeological evidence describe a very different environment in the past; where apex predators, megafauna, and diverse reef invertebrates were common. Through archeological digs, we show that the diversity and abundance of corals and other invertebrates declined markedly over the last century, including the extirpation of several coral species. We analyzed subtidal push cores to show that coral abundance has decreased by 50 %, and coral fragment identification from sediments to delineate a 40 % contraction in the range of important <b>staghorn</b> <b>corals.</b> Today, coral decline is closely linked to coastal development and pollution, which limits the recovery of coral communities. However, thanks to government efforts at improving water quality, we demonstrate that active restoration of coral communities is possible. Through targeted propagation and transplantation we show that <b>staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> have high rates of growth and survivorship in areas where they were previously eliminated giving hope to the future of these marginal reefs...|$|R
5000|$|Since white band {{disease was}} first {{reported}} in the 1970s, the disease {{has led to the}} devastation of approximately 95% of the elkhorn and <b>staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> in the Caribbean region. [...] This resulted in both affected species being listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act and as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. [...] The decline in these corals has a lasting effect on both humans and the environment. [...] Coral reefs protect coastlines from ocean currents, waves, and storms, and the death of these corals only increases the loss of coastlines in affected regions. [...] Elkhorn and <b>staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> are two of the major reef-building corals, the foundation on which the rest of the coral reef is formed. [...] Its loss means the loss of a habitat for many coral reef dwelling species such as lobsters, parrot-fish, snapper shrimps, and many other reef species, causing a sharp decline in the biodiversity of an affected region. [...] Coral reefs are also home to more than twenty-five percent of all marine fish species, making them extremely biologically diverse. [...] The loss of this coral would be particularly damaging to people living on the coast in terms of the food supply, coastal protection, economic security and more. [...] Nearly 500 million people directly depend on coral reefs for food and income (through tourism or otherwise).|$|R
50|$|Acropora prolifera is {{very similar}} to <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral</b> (Acropora cervicornis) in {{appearance}} but usually forms smaller, denser clumps. The branches are mostly horizontal and often divide near the tip, sometimes fusing with other branches. It also resembles elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) and genetic studies show that it is a hybrid between that and <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral.</b> The corallites, the calcareous skeletal cups in which the polyps sit, are tubular and protrude {{from the surface of the}} branches. They are tightly packed and arranged in linear rows and there is a larger corallite at the tip of each branch. The branches are up to 2 cm in diameter and the whole colony may grow to 1.2 m across. The general colour is pale yellowish-brown and the branches have paler tips.|$|E
50|$|The <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral</b> (Acropora cervicornis) is a branching, stony coral with {{cylindrical}} branches {{ranging from}} a few centimetres to over two metres in length and height. It occurs in back reef and fore reef environments from 0 to 30 m depth. The upper limit is defined by wave forces, and the lower limit is controlled by suspended sediments and light availability. Fore reef zones at intermediate depths 5 - 25 m were formerly dominated by extensive single-species stands of <b>staghorn</b> <b>coral</b> until the mid-1980s. This coral exhibits the fastest growth of all known western Atlantic fringe corals, with branches increasing in length by 10 - 20 cm per year.

50|$|These solitary {{groupers}} live in seaward {{reefs and}} in shallow lagoon, usually at depths less than 20 m., {{but they can}} reach about 50 m. Juveniles prefer reefs with <b>staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> (Acropora species). They mainly feed on fishes, crabs, shrimps and cephalopods, with and increase of piscivory with age. After the sexual maturity they are initially females and later they turn into males. Usually the groupers with a length of 16 cm are still females. These fishes usually spawn from January to April and the spawning begin 2 to 3 days before full moon and last about 3-4 days.|$|R
50|$|Acropora secale is {{a species}} of {{branching}} <b>staghorn</b> stony <b>coral.</b> It is found in shallow parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean and the type locality is Sri Lanka. The oldest fossils found {{date back to the}} Pleistocene.|$|R
50|$|<b>Staghorn</b> <b>corals</b> are the {{dominant}} group of reef builders. They come in many shapes and sizes and can be highly variable in colour and form, even within the same species. Most are either branched or table-top shaped and some are encrusting. Their colours vary between browns, whites, pinks, blues, yellows, greens and purple, depending not only on species {{but also on the}} growing conditions. Identification is difficult and requires close examination of the corallites and a biochemical and genetic analysis. There is a corallite at the tip of each branch and, with the exception of Astreopora, these are small with up to twelve septa in two cycles.|$|R
