40|$|A large, highly ranked public {{university}} implemented {{a requirement for}} all incoming undergraduates to own a laptop computer starting in fall, 2000. To control increased expenditures for information technology, this requirement has shifted some {{of the cost of}} technology to students by decreasing the need for centralized general-purpose computing laboratories. At the same time, a shift towards centralized academic computing support occurred. This shift was away from information technology resources, services and support based in individual departments. This <b>shift,</b> <b>engineered</b> by the newly formed office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), was envisioned to generate cost savings through economies of scale. The educational impact of the laptop requirement is starting to be felt, but adoption is not widespread in daily classroom use. Envisioned cost savings have not yet become apparent. However, laptop ownership has enabled some new classroom activities, and helped to reinforce the leading-edge image of the university. ORGANIZATION BACKGROUN...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the data collected during a one-month visit to a 2 -unit, non-U. S. PWR. The data consist of results from interviews (largely with plant operators and former <b>shift</b> <b>engineers)</b> and from reviews of videotapes covering crew responses to steam generator tube rupture training exercises. The interviews were aimed at indicating perceptions of individual and group skills. The analysis shows that the interview results are fairly consistent, that the time required to perform key actions does not generally correlate very well with the team quality ratings obtained from the interviews, and that the team quality ratings obtained from interviews correlate reasonably with ratings of the team performances (during the exercises) developed using the 7 -dimension scale described in PNL- 7250.

The majority of South Launceston's <b>senior</b> list <b>shifted</b> to Western Storm, so AFL Tasmania decided that the new club was a sufficiently close representation of the defending premiers to allow it to compete in the Foxtel Cup, rather than substituting the 2013 runners-up Burnie.|$|R

Nowadays, in many work places such as nuclear industry, military and chemical parts human error can cause catastrophic event that led many events around the world, so {{the purpose of this}} study is analyzing human error in a utility unit control room of a Petrochemical Company using HEART method. MethodsData collection was done by direct observation methods, interview with "Bordman", <b>senior</b> <b>shift,</b> boss of Fuel vapor, related experts and analysis of previous incidents that occur. Then job analysis and human error identified respectively by HTA and TRACEr technique. Additionally, the error probability determined with HEARTtechniques which is a one of the tools of human reliability assessment. ResultsThe most important factors in incidence of human error at the control room operators were: fatigue, experience, consciousness, complexity of information, focus error and Error producing conditions were diagnosed: mental stress, High work load, focus, clear guidelines, lack of training and the task adaptation,. The most calculated likely error in the duties: reload bugs, boiler commissioning, control of production, maintenance, warning signs control.

Through five case studies in the UK, this paper analyses the effectiveness of Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS 25) and the processes of negotiation that it promotes. This assessment allows us to draw conclusions on the nature of the compromises this kind of negotiation can achieve and the implications of this for flood risk management. What emerges is that the beneficial impacts of decisions to develop floodplain areas are given a proper hearing and sensible conditions imposed, rather than arguments to prevent such development remaining unchallenged...|$|R

They constantly anticipated demand, monitored and instructed power stations to increase, reduce or stop electricity production. They used what was known as the [...] "merit order", a ranking of each generator in power stations based upon how much they cost to produce electricity. The objective was to ensure that electricity production was achieved at the lowest possible cost.|$|R

Control over the soluble signals that cells encounter in their local environment is a common theme in natural tissue formation, and also an emerging theme in functional tissue engineering strategies. This concept is particularly important in stem cell-based applications, in which local soluble signals can dictate cell fate decisions. Therefore, there is significant interest in using bioengineering approaches to control soluble signaling in the stem cell microenvironment. Nature often achieves intricate control over local soluble signaling via specific, non-covalent interactions. Inspired by these natural interactions, {{we are interested in}} creating biomaterials that actively regulate soluble signaling. For example, our recent studies have used engineered protein-peptide and protein-mineral interactions to build new classes of materials that are bio-responsive and capable of regulating growth factor signaling. This talk will specifically highlight bio-inspired protein conformational <b>shifts</b> and <b>engineered</b> growth factor sequestering as mechanisms to regulate stem cell behavior upon and within biomaterials...|$|R

40|$|The quantum vacuum {{fundamentally}} {{alters the}} properties of embedded particles. In contrast to classical empty space, it allows for creation and annihilation of excitations.

This system makes it possible to combine high-precision spectroscopy with the ability of switching between empty space and quantum vacuum.

Our study therefore opens up new avenues for high-precision benchmarking of non-trivial theoretical predictions {{in the realm of the}} quantum vacuum...|$|R

25|$|During the 19th century {{attempts}} were made to introduce practical steam powered vehicles. Innovations such as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions and better steering developed. Some commercially successful vehicles provided mass transit until a backlash against these large vehicles resulted in the passage of legislation such as the United Kingdom Locomotive Act (1865), which required many self-propelled vehicles on public roads to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively halted road auto development in the UK for {{most of the rest of}} the 19th century; inventors and <b>engineers</b> <b>shifted</b> their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives.

40|$|Oil {{exploration}} and production operations face a number of challenges. Professional planners have to design solutions for various practical problems or issues.

The present paper investigates a problem related to leading companies in the energy and chemical manufacturing sector of the oil and gas industry. Each company’s field engineers are expensive and valuable assets. Therefore, an optimized roster is rather important.

An efficient and quick optimization technique is presented to schedule the <b>shifts</b> of field <b>engineers...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we discuss}} how for self-adaptive systems some {{activities}} that traditionally occur at development-time are moved to run-time. Responsibilities for these activities <b>shift</b> from software <b>engineers</b> {{to the system}} itself, causing the traditional boundary between development-time and run-time to blur. As a consequence, we argue how the traditional software engineering process needs to be reconceptualized to distinguish both development-time and run-time activities, and to support designers in taking decisions on how to properly engineer such systems. Furthermore, we identify a number of challenges related to this required reconceptualization, and we propose initial ideas based on process modeling. We use the Software and Systems Process Engineering Meta-Model (SPEM) to specify which activities {{are meant to be}} performed off-line and on-line, and also the dependencies between them. The proposed models should capture information about {{the costs and benefits of}} shifting activities to run-time, since such models should support software engineers in their decisions when they are engineering self-adaptive systems...|$|R
