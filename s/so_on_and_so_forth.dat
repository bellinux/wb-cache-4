25|$|Multiple {{denominations}} {{experienced a}} split from 1861 until 1865 {{due to the}} ongoing political climate but also slavery. Often to distinguish these denominations the word Southern was used. Hence, for denomination that remained in the North the word Northern was used. Examples include Southern Presbyterians and Northern Presbyterians, Southern Baptists and Northern Baptists, Southern Episcopalians and Northern Episcopalians, and <b>so</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>forth.</b> Such splits entailed no theological conflicts or doctrine changes, and adjectives Southern/Northern were only used to describe one's base in the Confederacy/the Union, territorial scope, political allegiance/preferences or stance on slavery.|$|E

500|$|Hans Singer {{suggested}} that Nurkse's theory makes dubious {{assumptions about the}} underdeveloped economy. For example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand. However, an economy usually starts at a position which reflects the previous investment decisions undertaken in the country, and at any given moment, an imbalance already exists. So the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy. Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting {{out to make a}} balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another [...] "balancing investment" [...] to bring equilibrium, and <b>so</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein is a sharp {{critic of}} the state of Israel. Discussing Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah, Israeli {{historian}} Avi Shlaim stated that Finkelstein's critique of Israel [...] "is based on an amazing amount of research. He seems to have read everything. He has gone through the reports of Israeli groups, of human rights groups, Human Rights Watch and Peace Now and B'Tselem, all of the reports of Amnesty International. And he deploys all this evidence from Israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of Israeli practices, Israeli violations of human rights of the Palestinians, Israeli house demolitions, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian militants, the cutting down of trees, the building of the wall—the security barrier on the West Bank, which is illegal—the restrictions imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, and <b>so</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>forth.</b> I find his critique extremely detailed, well-documented and accurate." ...|$|E

Chung commented during an interview with FidGit that [...] "Gravity Bone started out very different from what it was and ended up getting scrapped ... <b>so</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>forth</b> until this version came out." [...] The first version of Gravity Bone featured more typical first-person shooter elements than the released version, and was based on a series of Quake 2 maps entitled Citizen Abel.

[...] Development shifted in a new direction, and Gravity Bone was transformed; the player would act as a computer hacker, [...] "hacking stuff all the time." ...|$|E

It is a German name, compounded of Bona (=Bohn) and Hrodo, Roto (=Rohde, Rothe) Bona and Rotto are cited as Lombard names.
