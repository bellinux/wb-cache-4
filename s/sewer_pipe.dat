By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{stochastic}} {{finite element}} method (SFEM) is employed to investigate the probability of failure of cementitious buried <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> subjected to combined effect of corrosion and stresses. A non-linear time-dependant model is {{used to determine the}} extent of concrete corrosion. Using the SFEM, the effects of different random variables, including loads, pipe material, and corrosion on the remaining safe life of the cementitious <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> are explored. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the merit of the proposed SFEM in evaluating the effects of the contributing parameters upon the probability of failure of cementitious <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> The developed SFEM offers many advantages over traditional probabilistic techniques since it does not use any empirical equations in order to determine failure of pipes. The results of the SFEM can help the concerning industry (e. g., water companies) to better plan their resources by providing accurate prediction for the remaining safe life of cementitious <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of structural behaviour of buried concrete pipes is fairly understood, except for how material deterioration affects structural behaviour and performance. Consequently, {{information on the}} structural behaviour of deteriorated <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> will contribute to {{better understanding of the}} changes in status, which is essential for achieving the desired efficiency gains for urban drainage systems. In literature, some attempts to study the behaviour of the buried pipes under laboratory conditions have been reported. However, no attempt was made to evaluate the structural response of deteriorated concrete <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> The paper describes the design of a laboratory set-up for evaluating the strength of deteriorated <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> The test setup is a representation of field conditions in order to see if it is possible to model the field condition. Overall, this research is a first step in determining the probability of collapse of deteriorated <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> that will enhance proper decision making for sewer rehabilitation.

25|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid growth of the 1830s and 1840s, cholera became a {{significant}} problem in St. Louis. In December 1848, cholera cases were reported after several steamboats crowded with immigrants likely brought the disease. In {{the spring and summer of}} 1849, cholera spread throughout the population to epidemic proportions, killing nearly 5,000 people. As a solution to the cholera problem, city officials constructed a sewer system to drain sinkholes that had become clogged with sewage and garbage. In addition to the nearly 31 miles of <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> built by 1861, cemeteries were removed to the outskirts of the town to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination, and a large mill pond was drained in 1851.|$|E
25|$|Secure {{land tenure}} is {{important}} for slum dwellers as an authentic recognition of their residential status in urban areas. It also encourages them to upgrade their housing facilities, which will give them protection against natural and unnatural hazards. Undocumented ownership with no legal title to the land also prevents slum settlers from applying for mortgage, which might worsen their financial situations. In addition, without registration of the land ownership, the government has difficulty in upgrading basic facilities and improving the living environment. Insecure tenure of the slum, as well as lack of socially and politically acceptable alternatives to slums, also creates difficulty in citywide infrastructure development such as rapid mass transit, electrical line and <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> layout, highways and roads.|$|E

30|$|Actually, blackwater <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are more}} prone to {{clogging}} than greywater <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> because of higher viscosity of blackwater. In typical domestic sanitary systems, large pipes of 4 – 5 inches dimeter are used for blackwater <b>sewer</b> while thinner <b>pipes</b> of 1.5 – 3 inches dimeter are used for greywater sewer. In multistory buildings, main <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> are installed vertically behind toilets and kitchens as separate columns for blackwater and separate columns for greywater and mixing them occurs at end points before sending them to the main municipal sewer network. This separation secure hindering of blackwater reflection to greywater drains in case of clogging of their passages. Using small amount of flushwater may cause high viscosity of the black water in blackwater pipes causing clogging. To avoid this, pipes of blackwater must be joined with greywater pipes at the closest point in the ground level. Mixing greywater with blackwater before sending them to the main sanitation duct can help in prevention of system clogging.|$|R
