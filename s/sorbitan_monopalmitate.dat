40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{mixtures}} containing carboxymethylcellulose acetate butyrate (CMCAB) and carbohydrate based surfactant, namely, <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Span 40) or poly(oxyethylene) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Tween 40) were spin-coated onto silicon wafers. The effect of surfactant concentration on resulting film morphology and surface toughness Was Studied by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). Upon increasing the concentration of Span 40 in the mixture, films became rougher and more heterogeneous, indicating surface enrichment by Span 40 molecules. In the case of mixtures composed by CMCAB and Tween 40, the increase of Tween 40 in the mixture led to smoother and more homogeneous films, indicating compatibility between both components. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that Span 40 and Tween 40 act as plasticizers for CMCAB, leading to dramatic reduction of glass transition temperature of CMCAB, namely, Delta T(g) = - 158 degrees C and Delta T(g) =- 179 degrees C. respectively.

Morphology {{and size of}} the particles was controlled through surfactants. <b>Sorbitan</b> monolaurate, sorbitain <b>monopalmitate</b> and sorbitain monostearate produced silica nanoparticles of varying sizes (80 &# 8208; 150 nm), indicating the effect of chain length of the surfactant. Increase in chain length of non&# 8208;ionic surfactant resulted in decreasing particle size of silica nanoparticles. Further, the size of silica particles was also controlled using NH 3 as base catalyst. These silica nanoparticles were incorporated into cement paste and their role in accelerating the cementitious reactions was investigated. Addition of silica nanoparticles into cement paste improved the microstructure of the paste and calcium leaching is significantly reduced as n&# 8208;SiO 2 reacts with calcium hydroxide and form additional calcium&# 8208; silicate&# 8208;hydrate (C&# 8208;S&# 8208;H) gel. It was found that calcium hydroxide content in silica nanoparticles incorporated cement paste reduced ~ 89 % at 1 day and up to ~ 60 % at 28 days of hydration process.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain finely dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli by adding to the media {{in which they are}} cultivated certain non-ionic wetting agents. The polyoxyethylene esters of oleic acid (Atlas G- 2144), lauric acid (Arias G- 2124), sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Tween 40), and sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), have proven especially effective in this respect. In addition to their wetting effect on the cell, certain of the water-dispersible esters just mentioned are capable of enhancing the growth of many strains of tubercle bacilli, probably by supplying them with long chain fatty acids in a non-toxic form available for metabolic utilization (3). Unfortunately, the ester linkage in these wetting agents is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases, a fact which prohibits their use in media containing animal tissues or fluids rich in these enzymes. It is therefore desirable to find other types of wetting agents capable of promoting dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli and stable in the presence of animal tissues.

The study investigated the effects of an increase in the hydrocarbon chain length, the double bonded hydrocarbon chains and the concentration of the surfactant on the rheological properties of the sorbitan fatty acid ester surfactant containing creams. In addition, the effects of the volume of inner phase and the short-term storage on the rheological properties of the sorbitan fatty acid ester surfactant containing creams were investigated. The creams studied were either simple, three-component creams, or complex, multi-component creams. The rheological properties were determined with dynamic oscillation stress sweep and oscillation frequency sweep measurements, with static creep recovery measurements and with time-dependent viscosity measurements...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate)</b> and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated the formation/preparation of stable, thermoreversible, thixtropic surfactant gels (amphiphilo-gels) with suitable physical properties for topical use.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of four surfactants at the silica-toluene interface {{have been}} investigated by Fourier-transform infrared - attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. Specifically, hexadecylamine, 1, 12 -diaminododecane, didecylamine and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> were studied. The silica surface for the spectroscopic experiments {{was provided by the}} native oxide layer on a silicon ATR prism. In order to study the CH(_ 2) stretching vibrations, the solvent was fully deuterated. Careful calibration of the ATR experiment enabled the contribution to the ATR spectrum made by adsorbed species to be calculated. The surface excess concentration of the amines were calculated over a range of bulk solution conentrations, enabling adsorption isotherms to be constructed. The use of polarized radiation allowed the orientation of the molecules within the adsorbed layer to be studied. The adsorbed layer of hexadecylamine showed some ordering of the aliphatic chains. There is some spectral evidence that the chains in the adsorbed layer of 1, 12 - diaminododecane adopt a 'looped' configuration. The effect of adsorbed layers of the molecules listed above upon the rheological behaviour of Aerosil 200 dispersions in toluene was investigated. Differences in the rheological behaviour of these dispersions have been correlated to differences in adsorbed layer structure as determined by FTIR-ATR. Due to differences in the Aerosil and ATR surface these correlations must be treated cautiously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) {{microspheres}} with peculiar spheres-in-sphere morphology {{were prepared}} by using oil- n-water emulsions and solvent evaporation technique. Ethylene vinyl acetate co-polymer (EVA) {{was used as}} the binder material. Preparation of HAP/EVA microspheres was followed by the thermal de-binding and sintering at 1150 °C for 3 h to obtain HAP microspheres. Each microsphere of 100 – 1000 mm was in turn composed of spherical hydroxyapatite granules of 2 – 15 mm size which were obtained by spray drying the precipitated HAP. The parameters such as percentage of initial HAP loading, type of stabilizer, concentration of stabilizer, stirring speed and temperature of microsphere preparation were varied to study their effect on the particle size and geometry of the microspheres obtained. It was observed that these parameters do {{have an effect on the}} size and shape of the microspheres obtained, which in turn will affect the sintered HAP micro-structure. Of the three stabilizers used viz. polyoxyethylene(20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Tween- 40), sodium laurate and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), only PVA with a concentration not less than 0 × 1 wt % showed controlled stabilization of HAP granules resulting in spherical microspheres of required size. Morphologically better spherical microspheres were obtained at 20 °C. Increasing the stirring speed produced smaller micro pher s. Smaller microspheres having size < 50 µm were obtained at a stirring speed of 1500 ± 50 rpm. A gradual de-crease in pore size was observed in the sintered microspheres with increase in HAP loading...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, there was an {{extensive}} research focused {{on the study of}} synthetic amphiphilic vesicles, prepared by nonionic surfactants (niosomes). The particle size of these vesicles is critical for their intended therapeutic benefits. Formulation and processing factors affect greatly the physical characteristics of the resulted nanosystems. Therefore, the present work was adopted to investigate how proper manipulation of various formulations and processing factors on vesicular Z-average particle size. The selected variables were membrane additives, [including cholesterol (CHO), dicetylphosphate (DCP) and stearylamine (SA) ], sonication time as well as drug loading factor (using mannitol and estradiol). <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (span 40) niosomes were prepared by the conventional thin film hydration method. Particle size, measured by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy, and polydispersity indices were measured and compared. The results indicated that CHO increased the vesicular size, with 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 (span 40 :CHO) ratios showing the same size. Sonication reduced the vesicle size by 23, 35 and 42 &#x 0025; after 10, 20 and 30 min, respectively. After 30 min, the effect of sonication was minor. The addition of charge inducing agents changed the zeta potential {{depending on the type of}} the additives. Surface charge increased the size by 24 and 11 &#x 0025; when using DCP and SA, respectively. Drug incorporation increased the vesicle size to an extent based on its aqueous solubility. There were about 35 and 6. 2 &#x 0025; increase in vesicular size for estradiol and mannitol, respectively, supporting the partitioning of lipophilic drug within the fatty acyl side chains of the bilayer membrane...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexible}} {{properties of}} the gels make them superior candidates for the delivery of bioactive agents in cosmetics, medicine, biomaterials and food technologies. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop bigels from the oleogel of sunflower oil and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> for the delivery of metronidazole. The bigels were prepared by mixing oleogel with the polymer solution. Natural (proteins and polysaccharides) and synthetic polymers were used to alter {{properties of the}} bigels. Fluorescence microscope was used to study the microstructure of the bigels. The molecular interactions amongst the components of the bigels were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. The mechanical behavior of the bigels was determined using viscometer and static mechanical tester. Gel disintegration studies were carried out at pH 7. 4. The thermal and electrical properties of the bigels were analysed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and phase-sensitive multimeter, respectively. Goat blood and HaCaT cells were used to test the hemocompatibility and the cytocompatibility of the bigels, respectively. The antimicrobial efficacy of the drug (metronidazole) loaded bigels was studied against E. coli. The efficiency of the bigels as controlled delivery formulations was evaluated in vitro. Iontophoretic delivery of the drugs was carried out by injecting an AC current (peak current of 96. 44 μA). The micrographs suggested the formation of an oleogel-in-hydrogel type of bigels. The particle size of the bigels containing proteins was smaller (4 - 5 μm) than the bigels containing natural polysaccharides and synthetic polymers. Hydrogen bonding was the major driving force in the formation of the bigels. The mechanical properties of the polysaccharide based bigels were better as compared to the other bigels. The firmness of starch bigels and maltodextrin bigels was found to be highest 729. 4421 ± 3. 1471 g and 1000. 7623 ± 1. 8211 g, respectively. All the bigels exhibited pseudoplastic flow and were viscoelastic in nature. The disintegration time of the bigels was dependent on the property of the polymer used. The melting endotherm of the bigels was ~ 46 °C. The bigels were biocompatible in nature. The drug loaded bigels showed equivalent inhibitory zones against E. coli as compared to the marketed formulations. The application of AC current increased the in vitro drug release. In conclusion the results of the study suggested that the release of metronidazole was controlled by various types of polymers and also greatly influenced by the physical and mechanical properties of the bigels...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Tecnologias do Medicamento, apresentada à Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade de CoimbraGels have {{consistently}} been studied for {{their role in}} topical and transdermal drug delivery systems as a non-invasive technique, for pharmaceutical and cosmetics application. These formulations are semi-solid three-dimensional structures, porous, with unique characteristics, such as rigidity and elasticity at the same time. Because of their high aqueous phase content, gels permit a greater dissolution of drugs through the skin and enhance skin hydration by retaining {{a significant amount of}} transepidermal water, in contrast to creams and ointments. Conventionally, gels are differentiated into two different types according to the nature of their liquid phase: hydrogels, which contain a polar solvent (water) and organogels, which contain an organic/non-polar solvent, as external phase. Hydrogels consist of polymeric materials that exhibit the ability to swell and retain a large amount of water or other biofluids in its structures. Despite its great affinity for water, they only possess a swelling behavior without dissolving in water. This proves its high flexibility, similar to natural tissue. Organogels consist of a network of self-assembled molecules which forms a thermally reversible gel upon cooling, immobilizing a non-aqueous liquid. They are mainly composed by lipids (organic phase), so they easily interact with the lipid skin surface and enhance the drug permeation through the skin. The most widely used lipids are based in edible oils due to their high biocompatibility, such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, sesame seed oil or olive oil. Organogels form viscoelastic structures through non-covalent associations with gelling agents in low concentrations. The commonly used organogelators include sorbitan monostearate or <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate.</b> These superstructures, often long fibers or needle-shaped structures, which entangle or form pseudocrystalline regions, immobilizing the liquid largely by surface tension and forming a gel of variable consistency. Lecithin organogels are a special type of organogels that do not require addition of any additional surfactant or penetration enhancer, as lecithin serves both the purposes. Recent studies have reported other types of gels for dermal drug application, such as proniosomal gels, emulgels, bigels and aerogels, combining features of conventional hydrogels and organogels. In conclusion, further studies in gel technologies are essentials to overcome the drawbacks of each gel system and for developing cost effective delivery systems for transdermal applications...|$|E
