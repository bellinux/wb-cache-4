25|$|The {{explanation}} of the <b>seat</b> <b>compression</b> in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the axle of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an inertial frame, only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the inertial frame has a simpler physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the inertial frame, fictitious forces are zero. See inertial frame for more detail.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} an {{ejection}} seat is pilot survival. The pilot typically experiences an acceleration of about 12-14g. Western seats usually impose lighter loads on the pilots; 1960s-70s era Soviet technology often {{goes up to}} 20-22 g (with SM-1 and KM-1 gunbarrel-type ejection <b>seats).</b> <b>Compression</b> fractures of vertebrae are a recurrent side effect of ejection.|$|R
40|$|Appendicitis {{and trauma}} both present in {{emergency}} department commonly but their presentation {{together in the}} same patient is unusual. We present a case of a middle-aged man brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain after he was involved in motor vehicle collision. He was perfectly fine before the accident. His primary survey was normal. Secondary survey revealed tenderness in right iliac fossa with seat belt mark overlying it. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed 8 [*]mm thickening of appendix with minimal adjacent fat stranding. There is also subcutaneous fat stranding of anterior lower abdominal wall possibly due to bruising. Impression of posttraumatic <b>seat</b> belt <b>compression</b> appendicitis was made. Laparoscopic appendectomy was done and patient recovered uneventfully. Histopathology showed inflamed appendix, proving it to be a case of <b>seat</b> belt <b>compression</b> appendicitis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} done {{at the request of}} an {{international}} car development company. The projectwas performed by a student from Bachelor Programme in Industrial Design Engineering at Lule√•University of Technology and was carried out at the consultant company Cross Design which offersconsultancy service for different car manufacturers and developers. The project aim was to contributeto the development of lighter and cheaper products, a part of the car industries constant developmentprocess. The project goal was to find one or more solutions of how to fasten a backrest covermade of compression molded textile fiber on a front seat of a car and how to create an estheticalattractive transition between the hardback and the upholstery. Given the project goal two questionswas formulated: What type of solution for fastening the hardback on the seat is suitable? What typeof solution is suitable for an esthetically attractive transition between the hardback and the upholstery?The work was carried out through a stage gate model and was separated in following phases: theoreticalbackground, idea generation, concept generation and further development. During the theoreticalbackground study the following subjects were investigated: car <b>seats,</b> <b>compression</b> moldedtextile fiber, the importance of an attractive interior design and the type of fastener used in the finalconcept. In addition to that the sustainability of car production and using was highlighted. The ideageneration was made by using different methods for creative thinking, the ideas generated were thenevaluated and clustered in to four concepts in the concept generation phase. The concepts were thenevaluated and some further development was made before the decision of final concept and furtherdevelopment of that. The final concept suggests a fastening system of velcro. The solution consists of a combined fasteningof the hardback and the upholstery. The upholstery and the hardback is merge together byvelcro so that they together hold each other up. velcro is sewn in the fabric of the upholstery andeither fastened in the opposite part of the velcro which is fastened in the hardback or, if it is possible,directly fastened in the fiber structure of the hardback. To find out which type of velcro and whichone of the two mentioned solution that should work best an initial test was made but there were notime for a final test. In order to put the concept in production some further development is recommended. These recommendationsconsists of: finding out which type of velcro is best suited for the application, furtherinvestigate the possibility of mounting the velcro directly to the fiber structure of the hardback withoutthe use of an opposing side of velcro and {{to find a way to}} ensure consistency when mounting thehardback and upholstery to the seat. The solution then needs to be tested to ensure they withstandthe wear and tear of everyday use. Validerat; 20151106 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|From 1997 through 2002, the Air Force Research Lab and TNO Defence, Security and Safety (Business Unit Human Factors) were {{involved}} in a series of tests to quantify the accuracy of five Human Modeling Systems (HMSs) in determining accommodation limits of ejection seat aircraft. The results of these tests indicated that baseline information on initial pilot position and posture, soft tissue <b>compression,</b> <b>seat</b> cushion effects, restraint harness effects, and protective ensemble effects are all necessary before attempting to accurately use human modeling systems for this purpose. This work is now continuing with the objective of gathering these data and applying them to a single HMS. The human model will, in effect, be "trained" with this baseline information so its interaction with the seat and cockpit will be quantitatively comparable to that of a pilot's in the same cockpit. The goal of this project is to provide - for a single aircraft - a fully validated modeling approach for use during future modifications to a specific cockpit. This paper will outline the approach that will be followed over the next several years, the elementary issue of needed accuracy and effective verification, as well as early progress in tracking human motion within the cockpit using electro-mechanical (FARO Arm), and magnetic trackers (Ascension) ...|$|R
