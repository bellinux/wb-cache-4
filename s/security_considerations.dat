5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national <b>security</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national <b>security</b> <b>considerations</b> and thus not justiciable.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY We {{first model}} the {{variants}} of OAEP and SAEP by changing a construction and {{position of a}} redundancy, and establish a universal proof technique in the random oracle model, the comprehensive event dividing tree. We then make a taxonomical <b>security</b> <b>consideration</b> of the variants of OAEP and SAEP, based on the assumptions of one-wayness and partial-domain one-wayness of the encryption permutation, by applying the tree. Furthermore, we demonstrate the concrete attack procedures against all insecure schemes; we insist that the security proof failure leads to some attacks. From the <b>security</b> <b>consideration,</b> we find {{that one of the}} variants leads to a scheme without the redundancy; the scheme is not PA (plaintext aware) but IND-CCA 2 secure. Finally, we conclude that some of them are practical in terms of security tightness and short bandwidth...|$|R

25|$|In the {{financial}} year 2004–05, the company earned Rs. 15142.2million from its electricity department, and 839.18 crore from its transport department. Profits from its electricity department totalled Rs. 152.82 crore (US$35m), and losses in its transport department totalled Rs 212.86 crore ($48.8m), giving {{the company a}} net loss of Rs. 62.04 crore ($14.2m). For {{the financial}} year 2005–06, BEST is expected to earn Rs. 15401.3million ($352.92m) with a profit of 1408million ($32.3m) from the electricity department alone. However, its transport department is expected to earn 9486.8million ($217.39m), with a loss of 1403.0million ($32.26m). This gives it an estimated net loss of Rs. 5million ($114,575). Newer management techniques, such as retrenching of excess staff (494 till date), and the closure of less patronised routes, have reduced the losses in recent years, from a high of Rs. 1.75 billion ($40.1m) in 2001. Daily earnings from its transport system is Rs. 20million ($458,450). It collects Rs. 7million ($160,450) worth of five rupee coins daily, Rs. 4.8million ($110,000) worth of ten and twenty rupee notes, and Rs. 6million ($137,535) worth of fifty rupee notes, through its fare collection system. This has led a unique situation wherein it has accumulated a surplus of short change. In July 2005, the company floated tender inquiries to 54 banks to exchange the loose change, which totalled 46.7million ($1.07m). However, none of the banks sent in a single bid, some citing that their vaults are full, and others saying it would be unprofitable for low denominations, given <b>security</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|E

500|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) was a {{landmark}} Court of Appeal case in administrative law, specifically {{with regards to}} reviewing the grounds of detention without trial under the Internal Security Act. One of the main issues before the court was whether the test for judicial review was objective or subjective; in other words, whether judges could examine whether the executive's decision to detain a person was in fact based on national <b>security</b> <b>considerations,</b> as well as whether the executive's considerations in determining the detention fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified in section 8(1) of the Act. The court, in an obiter ruling, advocated the objective standard, stating: [...] "All power has legal limits {{and the rule of law}} demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power." [...] Although the case was legislatively overruled in respect of internal security matters by amendments to the Constitution of Singapore and the Internal Security Act, the principle still applies in judicial review proceedings not involving the Act.|$|E

The <b>security</b> <b>considerations</b> for such a visit were significant; there were threats made against her should she visit the moors, but Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with Topping that it would be worth the risk. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt [...] "quite cynical" [...] about Hindley's motivation in helping the police. Although the letter from Winnie Johnson may have played a part, he believed that Hindley's real concern was that, knowing of Brady's [...] "precarious" [...] mental state, she was afraid that he might decide to co-operate with the police, and wanted to make certain that she, and not Brady, was the one to gain whatever benefit there may have been in terms of public approval.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new cryptographic primitive called broadcast encryption with dealership. This notion, which has never been discussed in the cryptography literature, is applicable to many realistic broadcast services, for example subscription-based television service. Specifically, the new primitive enables a dealer to bulk buy the access to some products (e. g., TV channels) from the broadcaster, and hence, it will enable the dealer to resell the contents to the subscribers with a cheaper rate. Therefore, this creates business opportunity model for the dealer.
