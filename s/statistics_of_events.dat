The slider-block model is chosen {{as a representative of}} systems with avalanches. Similar behavior can be observed in a forest-fire model and a sand-pile model.

It is found that the slider-block model has a critical point when the stiffness of the model is infinite. Critical exponents are found and it is shown that the behavior of the slider-block model, particularly, the occurrence of system-wide events is strongly dominated by the finite-size effects.

It seems clear that if we want to have a clear idea of the origin of UHECRs, we have to auspicate the realization of larger, better experiments, such as the ongoing Auger project and the space-borne EUSO experiment.

The diffractive selection {{is based on}} tagging of the leading proton in the Forward Proton Spectrometer. The <b>statistics</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> obtained during the HERA II running period (integrated luminosity of 156. 7 pb− 1) enables the measurement of jet final states with leading proton for the first time.

The phase space of diffractive dijets is in this analysis by factor of 3 in xIP larger than in previous measurements. The QCD predictions based on the DGLAP parton evolution describe the measured data well even in a non-DGLAP enriched phase space where one on the jets goes into the region close to {{the direction of the}} outgoing proton.
