40|$|Bioconvection {{occurs as}} the result of the {{collective}} behaviour of many micro-organisms swimming in a fluid and is realised as patterns similar to those of thermal convection which occur when a layer of water is heated from below. A methodology is developed to record the bioconvection patterns that are formed by aqueous cultures of the single-celled alga Chlamydomonas nivalis. The analysis that is used to quantify the patterns as a function of cell concentration, <b>suspension</b> <b>depth</b> and time is described and experimental results are presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} the sampling of splash droplets carrying fungal spores uses fixed photographic film. Droplets left clear, permanent traces within which spores were easily visible. The droplet spread factor was constant because the gelatine layer was uniform. A comparison of {{estimates of the}} numbers of splash droplets, spore-carrying droplets and spores dispersed by a 5 mm drop falling onto a spore <b>suspension</b> (<b>depth</b> 0. 5 mm) with those obtained by other workers demonstrated the reliability of this method. The accuracy was improved by semi-automatic analysis of the spore-carrying splash droplet traces with an image-analysing computer...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the CO 2 absorptivity provided by an in situ carbon supply system using a photosynthetic culture of the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis in an open raceway pond. The effects of initial total carbon concentrations (ranging from 0 to 0. 1 mol/L), suspension depths (ranging from 5 to 20 cm) and pH values (ranging from 8. 9 to 11. 0) on the CO 2 absorptivity were studied. The results indicated that CO 2 absorptivity was positively correlated with pH value, negatively correlated with total carbon concentration, and only negligibly affected by the <b>suspension</b> <b>depth.</b> The optimum total carbon concentration range and pH range were 0. 03 similar to 0. 09 mol/L and 9. 7 similar to 10. 0, respectively. An average CO 2 absorptivity of 86. 16 % and average CO 2 utilization efficiency of 79. 18 % were achieved using this in situ carbon-supply system in large-scale cultivation of Spirulina platensis, with an initial total carbon concentration of 0. 06 mol/L and pH value of 9. 8. Our results demonstrated that this system could obtain a favorable CO 2 utilization efficiency in outdoor, large-scale cultivation of Spirulina platensis in open raceway ponds...|$|E
40|$|Splash {{dispersal}} of conidia which differ {{in shape and}} size, those of Pseudocercosporella herpo ichoides (needle-shaped, 52 ?? 2 ??m) and Pyrenopeziza hrassicae (cylindrical, 12 ?? 3 ??m), was studisd by allowing 5 mm drops to fall 13 m on to <b>suspensions</b> (<b>depth</b> 0. 5 mm, concentration 120, 000 spores/ml) of each. The resulting splash droplets were collected on photographic film. The pattern of spore dispersal with distance {{and the distribution of}} spore-carrying droplets and spores within droplet-size categories were similar for both fungi. Regressions of square root spore number) on droplet diameter gave lines with slopes of 0. 0138 for P. herpotrichoides and 0. 0167 for P. brassicae...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of wind on the splash dispersal of Septoria nodorum pycnidiospores was studied in a raintower/wind tunnel complex with single drops or simulated rain falling on spore suspensions or infected stubble with windspeeds of 1. 5 to 4 m/sec. When single drops fell on spore <b>suspensions</b> (<b>depth</b> 0. 5 mm, concentration 7. 8 ?? 105 spores/ml) {{most of the}} spore-carrying droplets collected on fixed photographic film between 0 ??? 4 m downwind (windspeed 3 m/sec) were > 200 ??m in diameter. However, most spores were carried in droplets with diameter > 1000 ??m, 70 % of which carried more than 100 spores. When simulated rain fell on infected stubble most of the spore-carrying droplets collected beyond 1 m downwind (windspeeds 1. 4 and 4 m/sec) were 600 ??m; most of these droplets carried only one spore. The distribution of splash droplets (with diameter > 100 ??m) deposited on chromatography paper showed a maximum at 40 ??? 50 cm upwind of the target but many more droplets were deposited 20 ??? 30 cm downwind, when single drops fell on a spore suspension (concentration 1. 2 ?? 105 spores/ ml) containing fluorescein dye with a windspeed of 2 m/sec; droplets were collected up to 3 m downwind {{but not more than}} 70 cm upwind. With a windspeed of 3 m/sec, numbers of sporecarrying droplets and spores collected on film decreased with increasing distance downwind; most were collected within 2 m of the target but some were found up to 4 m. When simulated rain fell on infected stubble, increasing the windspeed from 1. 5 to 4 m/sec greatly increased the number of spores deposited more than 1 m downwind. At 1. 5 m/sec none were collected beyond 2 m downwind, whereas at 4 m/sec some were collected at 4 m. A few air-borne S. nodorum spores were collected by suction samplers at a height of 40 cm at distances up to 10 m downwind of a target spore suspension on which simulated rain fell...|$|R
50|$|After {{attending}} {{his first}} Avalanche training camp he was reassigned {{and returned to}} AHL affiliate, Lake Erie, {{for the beginning of}} the 2011-12 season. Malone established himself within the Monsters in a physical checking role on the third line. In contributing offensively with 13 points in 24 games, Malone was recalled by the Avalanche upon a <b>suspension</b> to <b>depth</b> Avalanche forward Kevin Porter. Malone made his NHL debut with the Avalanche the following day on December 9, 2011, in a 4-1 defeat against the Edmonton Oilers. He recorded his first NHL point, an assist, in his fifth career game in a 3-2 shoot-out victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on December 19, before playing his first professional game against his cousin Ryan Malone and the Tampa Bay Lightning on Christmas Eve. Malone contributed with 2 assists in 9 games before he was returned to Lake Erie {{for the duration of the}} year to finish second on the team and first as a rookie in scoring with 36 points in 67 games.|$|R
40|$|Navigation in {{the port}} of Zeebrugge can be {{hindered}} {{by the presence of}} a high concentrated benthic <b>suspension</b> (hcbs). <b>Depth</b> averaged suspended sediment concentrations (including the hcbs layer) range from 10 mg. l - 1 up to 4,OOOmg. l - 1. The suspended sediment concentration within the benthic layer can reach several tens of grams per litre. The top of this hcbs layer is identified by the 210 kHz acoustic reflection surface. The Nautical Bottom, a site-specific upper limit for the bulk density, above which navigation is concerned to be safe, is defined at l, 200 kg. m - 3. A better understanding of the human and environmental effects on the hcbs layer could result in countermeasures reducing siltation and maintenance dredging. A statistical analysis of parameters such as weekly dredging intensity, location of the top of the mud layer, growth rate of the mud layer, fresh water input from the Leie by-pass channel, wind force and wave height in the period from 1999 till 2005 resulted in poor correlation coefficients. Three interpretations are given. Week averaged hydro-meteo data masks the occurrence of short-time events such as storms. The mud layers calculated growth rate can be levelled out due to the variable time span between soundings. Finally, dredging works are not planned solely based on the level of nautical depth, which reduces the correlation between environmental conditions and dredged volumes. However, seasonally trends are clearly visible in both human and environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Three successful ERTS- 1 satellite passes have produced synoptic imagery showing distribution of suspended matter and aquatic interfaces over Delaware Bay and adjacent Atlantic coastal regions. The interfaces {{are a major}} hydrographic feature in Delaware Bay and frequently include regions of high convergence. In the upper and middle bay the interfaces tend to align along the flow axis {{of the river and}} parallel to the shoreline. A correlation has been found between the concentration of sand particles in <b>suspension</b> and the <b>depth,</b> suggesting that most of the heavier particles are lifted into temporary suspension over shoals and shallow areas by currents and waves. The second type of interface is primarily a tidal intrusion of shelf water into the bay during incipient flood tide, with associated discontinuities in salinity and temperature. The convergence properties of such fronts attract heavy accumulations of foam which were found to contain strong concentrations of heavy metals and other toxic substances...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a direct capillary-driven method based on wetting and evaporation of various suspensions to fabricate regular two-dimensional wires {{in an open}} microfluidic channel through continuous deposition of micro- or nanoparticles under evaporative lithography, akin to the coffee-ring effect. The suspension is gently placed in a loading reservoir connected to the main open microchannel groove on a PDMS substrate. Hydrophilic conditions ensure rapid spreading of the suspension from the loading reservoir to fill the entire channel length. Evaporation during the spreading and after the channel is full increases the particle concentration {{toward the end of}} the channel. This evaporation-induced convective transport brings particles from the loading reservoir toward the channel end where this flow deposits a continuous multilayered particle structure. The particle deposition front propagates backward over the entire channel length. The final dry deposit of the particles is thereby much thicker than the initial volume fraction of the <b>suspension.</b> The deposition <b>depth</b> is characterized using a 3 D imaging profiler, whereas the deposition topography is revealed using a scanning electron microscope. The patterning technology described here is robust and passive and hence operates without an external field. This work may well become a launching pad to construct low-cost and large-scale thin optoelectronic films with variable thicknesses and interspacing distances...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{ingestion}} is {{an important}} exposure route by which immobile soil contaminants enter the human body. We assessed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) release from a contaminated soil, containing 49 mg PAH kg– 1, using a SHIME (Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem) reactor comprising the stomach, duodenal, and colon compartments. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon release was defined as that fraction remaining in the digest supernatant after centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 x g. The PAH release in the stomach digest was only 0. 44 % of the total PAH present in soil, resulting in PAH concentrations of 23 µg PAH L– 1 chyme. The lower PAH releases in duodenum (0. 13 %) and colon (0. 30 %) digests, compared with the stomach digest, {{were thought to be}} attributed to combined complexation and precipitation with bile salts, dissolved organic matter, or colon microbiota. We studied these complexation processes in an intestinal <b>suspension</b> more in <b>depth</b> by preparing mixtures of 9 -anthracenepropionic acid, a Bacillus subtilis culture, and cholin as model compounds for PAHs, organic matter, and bile salts, respectively. Bile salts or organic matter in the aqueous phase initially enhance PAH desorption from soil. However, desorbed PAHs may form large aggregates with bile and organic matter, lowering the freely dissolved PAH fraction in the supernatant. Using the model compounds, mathematical equations were developed and validated to predict PAH complexation processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Contaminant release and subsequent complexation in the gut {{is an important}} prerequisite to intestinal absorption and thus bioavailability of that contaminant. The data from this research may help in understanding the processes to which PAHs are subjected in the gastrointestinal tract, before intestinal absorption...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Ordovician (Upper Katian to Middle Hirnantian) of the Skogerholmen Formation, Husbergøya Formation and the Langøyene Formation {{has been}} studied on the islands Hovedøya, Rambergøya and Langøyene in the inner part of Oslofjorden. During the Upper Katian to Middle Hirnantian there was a shift from the {{dominance}} of calcareous shale and limestone {{to an increase in}} coarser siliciclastics with deposition of mainly siltstone-and sandstone beds. Transport and sedimentation have mainly taken place through storm-generated currents and <b>suspensions,</b> with water <b>depths</b> varying from beneath storm-wave base to proximal settings of a prograding shoreface. The sedimentary logs display an upwards shallowing in the uppermost part of the Skogerholmen Formation by the occurrence of a thin limestone conglomerate. This was followed by a flooding event and a subsequent slow upwards shallowing in the Husbergøya Formation. Rhythmic variations in thickness of storm-deposited beds are observed throughout the Husbergøya Formation and indicate sea-level fluctuations. There is a marked increase in very fine sand fraction {{at the top of the}} studied succession. This indicates a rapid fall in sea-level which was most likely controlled by the Late Ordovician glaciation in Gondwana land. A forced regression with progradation of the shoreline is proposed as mechanism for the increasing sand content in the uppermost part of the studied succession. Five sedimentary logs on three localities were created during the fieldwork. Each log represents approximately 30 meters of succession. Three of the sections are logged in the scale of 1 : 10 and show measured thickness, lithology, sedimentary structures and fossil content of each individual observed bed. Both siliciclastic and carbonate samples were collected and studied in thin sections and polished slabs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was {{studying}} the phenotypic and genetic relationships between udder morphology traits and udder health in dairy sheep. From 2000 to 2008 udder traits, somatic cell count (SCC) and clinical mastitis cases were recorded in an experimental flock consisting each year of around 900 ewes. A logistic regression was performed to evaluate the risk for a ewe of showing either a mastitis or at least 2 daily SCC records greater than 1 × 10 6 cells/ml in one of its lactations as function of udder traits scored in 1 st lactation. 1587 individual udder scores and 39, 950 SCC daily records were used for the analysis. Secondly, genetic correlation between lactation mean of somatic cell score and udder traits were estimated by a REML method applied to four bi-trait animal models, using data from 2251 primiparous ewes. Logistic regression results indicated that the risk of mastitis or high SCC values during the productive life increased as the cistern height increased and the degree of udder <b>suspension</b> and udder <b>depth</b> decreased. This suggests that the appraisal of the udder is a useful tool for culling decision aimed at increasing the sanitary status of the flock. The genetic correlation between lactation SCS and udder traits were favourable for udder depth (− 0. 50 ± 0. 12), teat placement (0. 39 ± 0. 011) and degree of udder suspension (− 0. 42 ± 0. 011) and closed to zero for the degree of separation of the two halves. Thus selection for udder morphology, already implemented in some dairy sheep breeds with the aim of improving machine milkability, will lead to a favourable correlated genetic response on SCC...|$|R
