5|$|In most cases, {{rainfall}} is {{the only}} effect that these cyclones have on California. Sometimes, the rainfall is <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall is unusual in tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may be <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and {{activated charcoal}} may be administered {{early on to}} bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
50|$|A {{factor that}} affects the spread and {{severity}} of the virus is the species and variety of host, as some are more susceptible than others. For example, the barley variety CM67 is very susceptible. It has a much higher transmission rate than other varieties, and if symptoms are <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> due <b>to</b> weather conditions, this variety can even be sterile.|$|R
50|$|Cassin's hawk-eagle is {{currently}} categorised as Least Concern by BirdLife International. Despite a decreasing population, estimated at 1,000-10,000 individuals, Cassin's hawk-eagles {{has a large}} geographic range and its population decline is not <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> for it <b>to</b> given Vulnerable status.|$|R
50|$|Damage to the trails, bridges, and {{campground}} was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> for Havasupai <b>to</b> close visitor {{access to}} the village, campground, and falls until the spring of 2009.

5|$|Those with {{abnormalities}} <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant treatment have {{an increased}} risk of death reported to be 23% over 18 months and 46% over 50 months. This risk is reduced to less than 10% in those receiving treatment with PAP. Treatment also reduces the need for hospital admissions and reduces healthcare costs.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
50|$|Death of a Transformer {{can follow}} {{irreversible}} (mortal) stasis lock or {{be caused by}} a sudden traumatic injury (such as a close-proximity nuclear explosion, or spark excision). A few weapons, such as a high powered fusion cannon, are known <b>to</b> be powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> damage <b>to</b> immediately terminate a Transformer. Also, while the utter destruction of a body can and usually does cause death, a Transformer can often survive total dismemberment. Notable examples include Optimus Prime (during the Generation 1 series), Ultra Magnus (during the movie), Starscream and Waspinator (repeatedly).|$|R
50|$|In the United States during World War I, {{conscientious}} objectors {{were permitted}} to serve in noncombatant military roles. About 2000 absolute conscientious objectors refused to cooperate in any way with the military. These men were imprisoned in military facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). Some were subjected to treatment such as short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>to</b> cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|R
40|$|Optimization of {{multidisciplinary}} {{systems is}} critical as slight performance improvements can provide significant benefits over the system’s life. However, optimization of multidisci-plinary systems is often plagued by computationally expensive simulations {{and the need}} to iteratively solve a complex coupling-relationship between subsystems. These challenges are typically <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>to</b> prohibit formal system optimization. A solution is to use multi-fidelity optimization, where other lower-fidelity simulations may be used to approximate the behavior of the higher-fidelity simulation. Low-fidelity simulations are common in practice...|$|R
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Australian weasel shark is {{commonly}} caught by prawn and fish trawlers operating off northern Australia. Smaller numbers are also captured in gillnets and on longlines.

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{opinion was}} mixed.

Others pointed out that once Americans go abroad, they are subject to the laws and penal codes of the country they visit. The Singapore Embassy received [...] "a flood of letters" [...] from Americans strongly supporting Fay's punishment, and some polls showed a majority of Americans favored it.|$|R

5|$|In September 1987, B-1B (s/n 84-0052) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near La Junta, Colorado while flying on a {{low-level}} training route. This {{was the only}} B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in jump seats, {{and one of the}} four crew members in ejection seats perished. The root cause of the accident was thought to be a bird strike on a wing's leading edge during the low-level flight. The impact was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sever fuel and hydraulic lines {{on one side of the}} aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection.

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Guillermo's track, {{the storm}} never {{threatened}} any major landmass, resulting in {{little impact on}} land. However, because of its extreme intensity, it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean, affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico. Along the American Pacific coast, three people drowned amid high waves, two in Baja California and one in California. At its peak, Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record; however, it has since been surpassed by seven other storms, including Linda later that year. The effects of Guillermo were not deemed <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> justify retirement of its name.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E

50|$|When the {{hypothalamus}} detects a hyperosmolar extracellular environment, {{it causes}} the secretion from the posterior pituitary gland of a peptide hormone vasopressin which acts on the effector organ, {{which in this}} case is the kidney. The effect of vasopressin on the kidney tubules is to reabsorb water from the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, thus preventing aggravation of the water loss via the urine. The hypothalamus simultaneously stimulates the nearby thirst center causing an almost irresistible (if the hyperosmolarity is <b>severe</b> <b>enough)</b> urge <b>to</b> drink water. The cessation of urine flow prevents the hypovolemia and hypertonicity from getting worse; the drinking of water corrects the defect.|$|R

5|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the French Revolution {{inspired}} many Irishmen to fight for similar principles of liberty, equality, and brotherhood in their own nation; liberty in this context largely meant independence from Great Britain. With these goals in mind, in 1791 Dublin lawyer Wolfe Tone founded the Society of United Irishmen. Allying itself with the French Republic, the society was suppressed by the British authorities and forced to go underground when war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and other members secretly travelled to France to convince the French National Convention to invade Ireland. Such an invasion, they argued, could rely on support from large numbers of Irish irregulars, and if successful would strike a severe blow to the British war effort—perhaps even <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> force Britain to seek peace.|$|E
5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel girder bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
25|$|Ischaemia/infarction: if an {{arterial}} thrombus {{cannot be}} lysed {{by the body}} {{and it does not}} embolise, and if the thrombus is large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery, then local ischaemia or infarction will result. A venous thrombus {{may or may not be}} ischaemic, since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, non-ischaemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic, due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage. In deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain, redness, and swelling; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular oedema and visual acuity impairment, which if <b>severe</b> <b>enough</b> can lead <b>to</b> blindness.|$|R
