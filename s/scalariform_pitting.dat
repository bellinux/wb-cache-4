50|$|In the gnetifer hypothesis, the gnetophytes are {{sister to}} the conifers, and the {{gymnosperms}} are a monophyletic group, sister to the angiosperms. The gnetifer hypothesis first emerged formally in the mid-twentieth century, when vessel {{elements in the}} gnetophytes were interpreted as being derived from tracheids with circular bordered pits, as in conifers. It did not gain strong support, however, until the emergence of molecular data in the late 1990s. Although the most salient morphological evidence still largely supports the anthophyte hypothesis, there are some more obscure morphological commonalities between the gnetophytes and conifers that {{lend support to the}} gnetifer hypothesis. These shared traits include: tracheids with scalariform pits with tori interspersed with annular thickenings, absence of <b>scalariform</b> <b>pitting</b> in primary xylem, scale-like and strap-shaped leaves of Ephedra and Welwitschia; and reduced sporophylls.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 11 collections of eight taxa. Diameter {{and length of}} tracheids are related to plant size, but populations in cooler locations have narrower and shorter tracheids than one would expect {{on the basis of}} plant size and age, and smaller tracheids are believed to be of selective value in these environments because of their resistance to embolisms. Vesturing is absent from tracheids in taxa from warmer localities but pronounced in colder places; this, too, is a probable mechanism for resistance to embolism formation. Helical thickenings are reported for one collection of T. insipida; these thickenings, otherwise known in the family only from Pseudowintera, may play a role similar to vesturing. <b>Scalariform</b> <b>pitting</b> on end walls of tracheids occurs during {{the first three years of}} secondary xylem formation, and may also occur after cambial trauma. Axial parenchyma is scarce to absent, and diffuse when present. Rays in Tasmannia wood have relatively few procumbent cells. A summary wood description for the family is presented, and a key to the eight genera is given. Although wood anatomy does contain some features of generic value, data from floral morphology, pollen structure, and leaf anatomy more strongly support the recognition of eight genera. Some species have very distinctive features, but genera are difficult to define; pending acquisition of chemical data, eight genera may be provisionally recognized. The only feature considered as a possible phylogenetic trend in wood within the family is an increased tendency for alternate pits to supplant scalariform pits on end walls of tracheids. Tracheids of Winteraceae demonstrate that <b>scalariform</b> <b>pitting</b> is pervasive and preserved in a flexible way; alternate pits are hypothesized to have been evolved in the family for increased wall strength. Ecological correlations, presented for the entirety of the family, are much like those shown within Tasmannia...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFossil lignophyte stems show {{remarkable}} diversity including non-sympodial and sympodial {{forms and}} a variety of pith and tracheid structures. Most lack <b>scalariform</b> bordered <b>pits</b> on radial walls of secondary xylem tracheids, while these occur in the putative progymnosperm Protopitys and some (but not all) cycads, bennettitaleans, and angiosperms. We describe a new genus of Permian gymnosperms that comprises decorticated stems and branches with a parenchymatous pith that is septate in stems but entire in branches and has scleroid cells that are organised singly or in bands. Vasculature is non-sympodial, comprising endarch primary xylem strands that become mesarch leaf traces that are occluded through ontogeny. Secondary xylem is pycnoxylic with <b>scalariform</b> bordered <b>pits</b> on radial tracheid walls. The eustelic and non-sympodial organisation, the septate pith and the presence of <b>scalariform</b> bordered <b>pits</b> on secondary tracheids represent a unique combination of features not previously seen in lignophyte genera, justifying the erection of Xuanweioxylon scalariforme gen. et sp. nov.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are reported for seven specimens representing six varieties {{of the four}} species of Drimys generally recognized. Tracheid length and diameter are correlated both with plant size and with severity of climate: wide, long tracheids, not fluctuating in diameter seasonally, occur in Drimys of moderate elevations in subtropical latitude; narrower, shorter tracheids, becoming radially narrower briefly in latewood, occur in Drimys from higher altitudes and latitudes. Vesturing (warty layer) on the inside surface of tracheids occurs in Drimys from latitudes and altitudes where appreciable freezing is to be expected, but vesturing is absent at lower elevations and latitudes. Vesturing may bond water to tracheid walls better so that water columns do not break under high tensions produced by such conditions as transpiration when soil remains frozen. <b>Scalariform</b> <b>pitting</b> on end walls of Drimys tracheids occurs {{during the first year}} (metaxylem), but is replaced by alternate circular pits later; injury to the cambium, even of a mild kind, results in reversion to sca 1 ariform end wall pitting.

40|$|The core {{of plant}} {{physiology}} {{is a set}} of functional solutions to a tradeoff between CO_ 2 acquisition and water loss. To provide an important evolutionary perspective on how the earliest land plants met this tradeoff, we constructed a mathematical model (constrained geometrically with measurements of fossils) of the hydraulic resistance of Asteroxylon, an Early Devonian plant. The model results illuminate the water transport physiology of one of the earliest vascular plants. Results show that Asteroxylon’s vascular system contains cells with low hydraulic resistances; these resistances are low because cells were covered by <b>scalariform</b> <b>pits,</b> elliptical structures that permit individual cells to have large areas for water to pass fromone cell to another. Asteroxylon could move a large amount of water quickly given its large pit areas; however, this would have left these plants particularly vulnerable to damage from excessive evapotranspiration. These results highlight a repeated pattern in plant evolution, wherein the evolution of highly conductive vascular tissue precedes the appearance of adaptations to increase water transport safety. Quantitative insight into the vascular transport of Asteroxylon also allows us to reflect on the quality of CO_ 2 proxy estimates based on early land plant fossils. Because Asteroxylon’s vascular tissue lacked any safety features to prevent permanent damage, it probably used stomatal abundance and behavior to prevent desiccation. If correct, low stomatal frequencies in Asteroxylon reflect the need to limit evapotranspiration, rather than adaptation to high CO_ 2 concentrations in the atmosphere. More broadly, methods to reveal and understand water transport in extinct plants have a clear use in testing and bolstering fossil plant-based paleoclimate proxies...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: According to the {{air-seeding}} hypothesis, embolism vulnerability in xylem elements {{is linked}} directly to bordered pit structure and functioning. To elucidate the adaptive potential of intervessel pits towards fluctuating environmental conditions, two mangrove species {{with a distinct}} ecological distribution growing along a natural salinity gradient were investigated. Methods: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative characteristics of alternate intervessel pits in A. marina and <b>scalariform</b> intervessel <b>pits</b> in Rhizophora mucronata. Wood samples from three to six trees were collected at seven and five sites for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively, with considerable differences between sites in soil water salinity. Key Results: Vestured pits without visible pores in the pit membrane were observed in A. marina, the mangrove species with the widest geographical distribution on global {{as well as local}} scale. Their thick pit membranes (on average 370 nm) and minute pit apertures may contribute to reduced vulnerability to cavitation of this highly salt-tolerant species. The smaller ecological distribution of R. mucronata was in accordance with wide pit apertures and a slightly higher pitfield fraction (67 % vs. 60 % in A. marina). Nonetheless, its outer pit apertures were observed to be funnel-shaped shielding non-porous pit membranes. No trends in intervessel pit size were observed with increasing soil water salinity of the site. Conclusions: The contrasting ecological distribution of two mangrove species was reflected in the geometry and pit membrane characteristics of their intervessel pits. Within species, intervessel pit size seemed to be independent of spatial variations in environmental conditions and was only weakly correlated with vessel diameter.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes.

Amborella shares stomatal configurations, nodal type (in part), ray types, and porose pit membranes in tracheary elements with llliciaies s. l., but differs from that order in lacking oil cells, vessels, and grouped axial parenchyma cells. These data are consistent with a basal position in angiosperms for Amborella, and for a close relationship with, but not inclusion in, llliciales; inclusion in a monofamilial order is conceivable. Both loss of pit membranes or pit membrane portions on end walls and increase in cell diameter are requisites for origin of vessels.

For instance: fig. 3 c (p. 24) is said to show abrupt latewood in Larix laricina, but the earlywood-latewood transition zone is not included in the photomicrograph; on p. 68 the vessels of Nyssa are said to be predominantly in multiples of four or more but the photograph illustrates vessel pairs alternating with fibres (i. e., vessel multiples in a distinct radial pattern; the latter feature is illustrated on p. 69 with examples showing no sign of such a pattern at all!); the tangential vessel arrangement of fig. 4 b, p. 70 is in fact oblique; Myrica is incorrectly credited with ephedroid perforations on p. 73; Sphenostemon pictured with the most beautiful example of <b>scalariform</b> intervessel <b>pits</b> is said to show spiral thickenings instead (p. 74); long and slender pit canals are mistaken for plasmodesmata on p. 83; essentially similar fibre-tracheids in Eucryphia are classified as belonging to two fibre types (p. 87); fibres of Sleumerodendron are mistaken for vascular tracheids and crystals in the Dicotyledons are illustrated with an example from Gnetum (p. 124). The quality of many of the photomicrographs leaves much to be desired...|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} similar to Hamatophyton verticillatum and {{is found in the}} Xiejingsi Formation. R. songziensis {{consists}} of branched axes, up to 20 cm long, which have slightly swollen nodes and internodes with ribs and narrow branches produced from the nodes. The axes are protostelic. Cross sections show a roughly triangular or quadrangular organization of the primary xylem and radial arrangement of the secondary xylem. Primary xylem is exarch upon maturation, with protoxylem strands positioned around the tips of the primary xylem arms. No differentiation between fascicular and interfascicular regions of the secondary xylem is apparent, and ray cells are rarely observed. Protoxylem tracheids have helical wall thickenings, whereas the tracheids of meta- and secondary xylem possess <b>scalariform</b> and/or bordered <b>pits.</b> All R. songziensis axes bear trichomes or spines, some up to 2.8 mm long. At the nodes are whorls of six leaves, up to 2.4 cm long, that regularly or irregularly fork two to four times. The leaves are positioned perpendicular to the axis in proximal portions of the plant but insered at acute angles in distal portions. Fertile branches are produced in a terminal strobilus (8.5 cm long), which is subtended by whorls of normally developed leaves. It consists of a central axis and up to 16 whorls of fertile units, each of which consists of a bract and 6-10 sporangia. The bracts are elongate-cuneate and have prominent marginal fringes; sporangia are attached to the abaxial surface at the base of each brac. Although R. songziensis closely resembles H. verticillatum with its external axis morphology, leaf shape, and structure of the primary xylem. However, the two forms differ in strobilus morphology.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{importance}} of wood bonding {{increased in the}} last decades due to the increased usage of wood composites whose performance depends {{to a large extent}} on the adhesive penetration and subsequent bonding of the adherends. The presented research used XMT (x-ray microtomography) to perform a non-destructive, threedimensional analysis of the adhesive bondline and wood-structure of Southern yellow pine, Douglas-fir and yellow-poplar samples. A phenol-formaldehyde adhesive was used. The sodium hydroxide catalyst was replaced with rubidium hydroxide during resin formulation. This was done to improve the image contrast. The reconstructions of the wood structure of Southern yellow pine showed tracheids, rays, fusiform rays, resin canals and pits. On the Douglas-fir sample tracheids, pits and rays were displayed clearly. The yellow-poplar images showed vessels, fibers, bordered <b>pits,</b> <b>scalariform</b> sieve plates and rays. The renderings of the adhesive-bondline of Southern yellow pine proved the dominant role of tracheids for the adhesive flow and showed rays as a secondary pathway of adhesive flow. The results revealed no adhesive flow occured through bordered pits, while simple pits permitted some adhesive flow through ray parenchyma. The results for Douglas-fir showed a similar result; the tracheids were the predominant path of adhesive penetration, while rays played a secondary role and no adhesive flow through the pit aperture was visible. The adhesive flow through the microstructure of yellow-poplar wood occured mainly through vessels and also through rays, but no adhesive flow through the pits was directly observed. The segmentation of the images in three phases: void space, cell wall substance and adhesive, enabled the calculation of the effective bondline thickness based on the adhesive, as well as the volumetric measurement of all three elements and their share on the sample volume. Subsequent experiments showed that the exposure of the Southern yellow pine and yellow-poplar bondlines to cyclic moisture did not cause delaminations or cracks. However, there were some indicators that the samples experienced some irreversible swelling. Finally, the generation of 3 -D animations of wood samples and bondlines of Southern yellow pine, Douglas-fir and yellow poplar was achieved. This animation was a way to present the results of this research in a quick and accessible way that illustrates the three-dimensional microstructure of a wood-adhesive bond...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Three growth {{forms of}} the genus Microseris, of the tribe Cichorieae, family Compositae, were {{compared}} {{with respect to their}} anatomical structure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify lines of evolutionary specialization in the genus. Two of the three species studied, M. laciniata and M. borealis, are perennials, while the third, M. lindleyi is an annual. Seedling development and primary growth of the root is essentially similar in all three species. There are two groups of initials in the root apex; the upper group giving rise to the stele and the lower group differentiating into the rootcap, epidermis and cortex. Differences occur in secondary growth of the primary root. The cortex is persistent in all three species. Microseris lindleyi produces a relatively large amount of secondary xylem in relation to secondary phloem. The cambium consists largely of fusiform initials and some non-typical fusiform initials, Definite ray initials were not observed. Outwardly, the cambium derivatives differentiate into storage parenchyma in which phloem strands are embedded. A phloem strand consists of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma and laticifers. The secondary xylem consists of both tracheids and vessels, both with <b>scalariform</b> to <b>pitted</b> lateral walls and the latter with simple perforated end-walls, thick-walled fibers, appearing only in the later part of secondary growth, and xylem parenchyma. The two perennials, M. laciniata and M. borealis have fleshy roots which consist largely of storage parenchyma, in which the phloem strands are arranged in concentric rings. Here also there are connections between most of the phloem strands of each ring by means of anastomosing laticifers but not between those of different rings. The secondary xylem is scanty, and consists of tracheids, vessels and xylem parenchyma. The vessels are arranged more or less in radiating rows which correspond with the location of phloem strands in the storage parenchyma. Both perennials produce adventitious roots that replace the primary root. Their anatomical structure differs from that of the primary root in that there are more than two protoxylem ridges, and there is a pith present. The adventitious roots show transverse wrinkling in the upper regions as a result of contraction. In the primary root, contraction is indicated primarily by folding of the Casparian strips, and is not obvious externally. All three species possess a one-layered tunica in the shoot apex. Aerial stem structure was described only for M. lindleyi and M. laciniata. The rosettes of the perennials form a primary thickening meristem which accounts for much of the increase in diameter of the stem of the rosette stage. In all three species, the stem is a eustele. Vascular bundles are always bordered at their outer margins by laticifers which are the first elements to mature in a procambium strand. In M. laciniata, a ring of phloem strands or medullary bundles develops at the inner periphery of the vascular cylinder. These phloem strands consist of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma and laticifers. Xylem elements may be differentiated at a later stage, and secondary growth may occur also. This work suggests M. lindleyi as the most advanced species because of its woodiness, alternate leaf position, absence of medullary bundles in addition to morphological and chromosomal features described by previous workers. Among the two perennials, M. borealis is more advanced over M. laciniata because of the horizontal rootstock and the absence of medullary bundles. M. laciniata is considered to be closest to the putative common ancestor than any of the two other species...|$|R
