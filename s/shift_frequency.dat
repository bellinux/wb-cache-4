The light <b>frequency</b> <b>shift</b> is very weak because of the very low speed of the particles compared to the speed of light. In order to overcome this problem, an absorption line of the molecular iodine is used: the absorption of iodine depends strongly on the light frequency going through the iodine vapor.
