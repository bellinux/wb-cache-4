40|$|The {{fishery is}} a classic example of market failure. Government {{intervention}} does not necessarily correct this, but may instead seek economically inefficient solutions, because of either a deliberate trade-off between efficiency and equity or political expediency. Norway's fishery policy is seen as a case in point. Its stated objectives put a low priority on economic efficiency, while various objectives based on equity are put in the foreground. The result is that the contribution of Norway's fisheries to the national income is slight. Norway's fishery policy consists of two largely uncoordinated parts, one concerned with maintaining fishermen's incomes and the other with managing fish stocks. Since the introduction of the 200 -mile limit, most fish stocks exploited by Norway have been managed by total allowable catches (TACs). While this has prevented the depletion of fish stocks, the regulations introduced to enforce the TACs have been an economic failure. The <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>TACs</b> has in some cases revealed a willingness to attain solutions expedient in the short term at the expense of long-term benefits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the use of various wavelets based techniques for denoising of [C 11] (R) -PK 11195 time activity curves (TACs) in order to improve accuracy and precision of PET kinetic parameters, such as volume of distribution (VT) and distribution volume ratio with reference region (DVR). Simulated and clinical TACs were filtered using two different categories of wavelet filters: (1) wave shrinking thresholds using a constant or a newly developed time varying threshold and (2) "statistical" filters, which filter extreme wavelet coefficients using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> "calibration" <b>TACs.</b> PET pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using linear models (plasma Logan and reference Logan analyses). For simulated noisy TACs, optimized wavelet based filters improved the residual sum of squared errors with the original noise free TACs. Furthermore, both clinical results and simulations were in agreement. Plasma Logan VT values increased after filtering, but no differences were seen in reference Logan DVR values. This increase in plasma Logan VT suggests a reduction of noise induced bias by wavelet based denoising, as was seen in the simulations. Wavelet denoising <b>of</b> <b>TACs</b> for [C 11] (R) -PK 11195 PET studies is therefore useful when parametric Logan based VT is the parameter of interest. © 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe eastern Georges Bank haddock {{resource}} is shared and {{managed by the}} U. S. and Canada through a transboundary resource sharing agreement. This agreement includes an annual process for joint stock assessment, <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> a <b>TAC,</b> and harvest shares for each country. The resource sharing agreement provides a mechanism for establishing bilateral action by both countries, but covers {{only part of the}} total haddock stock on Georges Bank. The resource sharing agreement does not apply to non-Georges Bank haddock stocks in the U. S. and Canada. Haddock is an important source of income for U. S. and Canadian fishermen and is a commodity that is traded between the two countries. Thus, management decisions taken under the transboundary sharing agreement have implications for domestic markets in the U. S. and Canada and through trade links between the two countries. This paper explores the implications of pursuing different harvest strategies between the U. S. and Canada within an institutional setting that requires bilateral control over a portion of potential haddock supplies, yet provides opportunities to take unilateral action that could affect international trade and prices received by domestic fishermen in both countries...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Despite the {{intensive}} therapeutic drug monitoring <b>of</b> tacrolimus (<b>TAC)</b> using trough whole blood concentrations, graft rejections occur in transplant recipient patients. Thus, {{other ways to}} monitor closely immunosuppressive treatments are necessary. A promising way <b>of</b> monitoring <b>TAC</b> treatments could be the measure of its concentrations inside of the lymphocyte cell. Whereas the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) was evaluated in renal and liver transplant recipients, data regarding PBMC concentrations <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> in cardiac transplant recipients are lacking. This study aimed, in cardiac transplant recipients: to validate a method for determination <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> in PBMC, to investigate PBMC trough concentrations <b>of</b> <b>TAC,</b> and to evaluate their relationship with trough whole blood concentrations. DESIGN AND METHOD: We developed and validated a High-performance-liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry method <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> quantitation in PBMC. The method was then evaluated by determining TAC concentrations in PBMC of 24 cardiac transplant recipients. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were prospectively included in the study. Tacrolimus PBMC concentrations displayed a large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability (CV= 71. 4 %) in the cohort. A lack <b>of</b> correlation between <b>TAC</b> whole blood trough concentrations and TAC trough concentrations in PBMCs was found (r= 0. 259; p= 0. 183). CONCLUSION: Further studies should be implemented to evaluate the correlation between TAC concentrations in PBMC and clinical outcomes in cardiac transplant recipients to allow concluding whether monitoring TAC concentrations in PBMC is a good tool to prevent graft rejection in cardiac recipients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Calcineurin inhibitors induce renal {{vasoconstriction}} and oliguria during acute toxicity. We previously {{demonstrated that}} the non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline improved glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow in the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> acute tacrolimus (<b>TAC)</b> toxicity. This study was undertaken to deter-mine which of the known adenosine receptor sub-types {{is responsible for the}} observed effect of theophylline. Methods. The GFR was measured by clearance of 51 Cr-EDTA in anaesthetized, instrumented Sprague– Dawley rats at three time points: at baseline, 60 min after intravenous administration <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> (0. 05 mg/kg) or vehicle (V) and at 100 min after TAC or V. Either DMSO (n 5) or one of the three available specific adenosine receptor subtype antagonists 1, 3 -dipropyl- 8 -cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX, 2 mg/kg, n 5), a selec-tive A 1 receptor antagonist, 8 -(3 -chlorostyryl) caffeine (CSC, 2 mg/kg, n 4), a selective A 2 a receptor anta-gonist and 3 -ethyl- 5 -benzyl- 2 -methyl- 4 -phenylethy-nyl- 6 -phenyl- 1, 4 -dihydropyridine- 3, 5 dicarboxylate (MRS 1191, 1 mg/kg, n 5), a selective A 3 receptor antagonist, was administered intra-peritoneally prior to the final GFR measurement. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to detect differences between groups (P< 0. 05). Results. Measured GFR declined by 30 % from base-line 60 min after TAC. In DMSO treated animals, GFR decreased 51 % from baseline at 100 min after TAC, but increased 45 % from baseline at 100 min after TACþMRS 1191. Conclusions. Only administration of the A 3 adenosine antagonist increased GFR following TAC, suggesting that this receptor mediates the effect of theophylline on GFR...|$|R
40|$|Conflict {{resolution}} skills {{exhibited by}} teachers {{are a key}} contributor to the perceptions that students have of school authority, especially in schools with high rates of conflict. Perceptions about the way teachers deal with student conflicts {{have been shown to}} affect adolescent decision making and proclivity to work with school authorities during victimization scenarios (Aceves, Hinshaw, Mendoza-Denton, & Page-Gould, 2010). Thus, these perceptions shape some aspects of the student-teacher relationship, but there have been no empirical investigations into whether perceptions of teachers' actions during conflicts (TAC) actually influence student functioning within academic domains. This dissertation explored the relationship between perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> and school outcomes of institutional identity, institutional belonging, and academic achievement among an at-risk sample of 188 ethnic minority urban adolescents. A theoretical model was proposed in which perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> function as a protective buffer against poor school outcomes in the face of two risk factors: victimization experience and low academic self-efficacy. Adolescents completed self-report measures <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC,</b> school victimization experiences, academic self-efficacy, institutional identity, and institutional belonging 3. 5 months into the school year (Time 1). Grade point average (GPA) was accessed through school records {{at the end of the}} school year (Time 2) as an indicator of academic achievement. Multiple regression analyses were modeled to test whether perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> moderated the relationship between the two risk factors (victimization experience and self-efficacy), and the three dependent variables (institutional identity and institutional belonging at Time 1; GPA at Time 2). Controlling for student-teacher relationship quality, student perceptions of teacher fairness, biological sex, grade level, and aggression variables, perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> positively predicted student institutional identity, but not institutional belonging. A test of statistical interaction showed that victimized adolescents with negative perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> had the lowest levels of institutional identity; victims with positive perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> were buffered against low identity and actually reported a higher sense of institutional identity than did non-victimized adolescents. Academic self-efficacy predicted Time 2 GPA, but this association was moderated by perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC.</b> As hypothesized, students who reported negative academic self-efficacy beliefs but positive perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> at Time 1 were protected against GPA decline at Time 2. This finding remained significant even when controlling for Time 1 GPA. Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> did not appear to have an effect on Time 2 GPA for students with positive self-efficacy beliefs. These findings suggest that adolescents who perceive effective teacher management of conflicts are protected against the negative effects of hostile school environments, victimization, and negative self-efficacy beliefs. The implications for high-risk ethnic minority urban adolescents are discussed in the context of developmental and cognitive theories of adolescence...|$|R

This study aimed to explore this phenomenon in detail in 15 renal transplant recipients with diarrhea, whose immunosuppression consisted of corticosteroids, mofetil mycophenolate and Tac. Both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3 A 4 and PGP activity, important determinants <b>of</b> <b>Tac</b> bioavailability, were assessed, together with global CYP activity and investigations for gastrointestinal infection, function and morphology. Global CYP, CYP 3 A 4, PGP and trough/dose levels <b>of</b> <b>Tac</b> were compared with diarrhea-free controls.

Time to peak concentration and drug half-life, however, were not altered. In addition, a concomitant decrease (+/- 50 %) of intestinal PGP activity was noticed in patients with diarrhea.

40|$|Plasma tachykinin {{levels are}} known to be altered with sexual acyclicity and loss of {{reproductive}} function. Ovulatory dysfunction, as seen in postmenopausal women, is also often encountered in hypothyroid patients. To know the involvement of different tachykinin genes in hypothyroidism-associated reproductive disorders, we performed DD-PCR with the pituitary RNA of control and hypothyroid rats to see the differentially expressed gene profile. Subsequently, we selected a few clones, tachykinin being one of them. Since its expression was up regulated in hypothyroidism as it does in the sexually acyclic females, we wanted to correlate these two phenomena with hypothyroidism associated reproductive disorders. We observed differential expression <b>of</b> <b>tac</b> 2 along with other tk genes and their receptors in rat pituitary and ovary, which suggests that hypothyroidism affects the expression of these genes in these tissues. The experiments were repeated in ovarian tissue obtained at surgery from hypothyroid human patients, which showed similar expression pattern <b>of</b> <b>TAC</b> 3 (equivalent to rat tac 2) and their receptors as in rat ovary. Significant reduction <b>of</b> <b>tac</b> 2 expression in reproductively less active rat ovary suggests the association <b>of</b> <b>tac</b> 2 with reproductive senescence.
