5|$|Attachment {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip <b>Shaver.</b> Four styles of attachment {{have been identified in}} adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game Georgia Tech {{defeated}} Furman 25–0, playing mainly substitutes. Hay was spread on the field {{in an attempt to}} counteract the steady downpour. Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore <b>Shaver</b> after crossing the goal line. Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could do to affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), <b>Shaver</b> (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E

50|$|In 2009, <b>Shavers</b> {{transferred}} Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. During the 2009 {{season at}} Tyler, <b>Shavers</b> redshirted {{due to his}} coach missing the out-of-state/transfer list. With the starting running back spot belonging to Don Brown, <b>Shavers</b> was worked out at defensive back just {{to get on the}} field. <b>Shavers</b> played in 6 of the Apaches 8 games during the 2010 season, receiving only 50 carries as the backup running back. <b>Shavers</b> productive season at Tyler netted him 2nd Team All-Conference honors.|$|R

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with <b>Shaver</b> Road, US131 widens {{into a full}} freeway which passes the Gourdneck State Game Area as it enters the Kalamazoo metropolitan area. US131 meets I-94 southwest of Kalamazoo {{and picks up the}} Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94) designation for a couple of miles. This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit36 and follows US131's business loop along Stadium Drive into downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of Western Michigan University. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US131 passes the northern end of Bus. US131, a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US131. North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern Allegan County.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point <b>shaver,</b> and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shavers</b> Mountain and Back Allegheny Mountain {{are part}} of the same {{structural}} ridge that follows the eastern edge of <b>Shavers</b> Fork from Pocahontas County into Tucker County. North of U.S. Route 250, the ridge is known as <b>Shavers</b> Mountain; south, it is Back Allegheny Mountain. This ridge separates the <b>Shavers</b> Fork watershed, which eventually flows to the Monongahela River, from the Greenbrier River watershed, which eventually enters the Kanawha River.|$|R
50|$|After {{the loss}} to Ali, Ellis won his next eight fights by knockout. But on June 18, 1973, he fought Earnie <b>Shavers,</b> who was 44-2 (43 KOs), at Madison Square Garden. Ellis, ranked fourth by the WBA, stunned <b>Shavers</b> with a {{chopping}} right to the jaw and backed him into a corner. <b>Shavers</b> took numerous shots in the corner before clinching. After the referee separated the fighters, <b>Shavers</b> put Ellis down for the count with a wickedly powerful single right uppercut to the chin. The time was 2:39 in the first round. It was a stunning win for <b>Shavers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or <b>shaver),</b> produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost eighty years, {{going through a}} half-dozen owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the <b>Shaver</b> Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E
5|$|During the Article 32 hearing, the prosecution, led by Captain Ashden Fein, {{presented}} 300,000 {{pages of}} documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. The court heard from two Army investigators, Special Agent David <b>Shaver,</b> head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU); and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, {{who works for the}} CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on an SD card found in her basement room in her aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland; and 10,000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.|$|E

5|$|The {{first issue}} of If was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it {{featured}} stories by Richard <b>Shaver,</b> Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By the time the third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the masthead for some years. Quinn brought in Ed Valigursky as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some wraparound artwork—an unusual feature—which helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer Lester del Rey turned down the job (a decision he {{is reported to have}} later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage Larry T. Shaw, an active science-fiction fan who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as associate editor and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine's quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, when Miss Shaver’s father died, the Baroness sought {{her out and}} {{reestablished}} the friendship. The Baroness asked <b>Shaver</b> {{to accompany}} her to Menominee and invest a half-interest in the family’s Menominee home, which <b>Shaver</b> agreed to do. <b>Shaver</b> took up residence in the Menominee home and oversaw some improvements in the home. However, she quickly ran through the inheritance from her father and asked that the Baroness repay all the money she had loaned her over the years, funds totaling some $100,000. But the Baroness claimed {{that she did not}} owe Miss <b>Shaver</b> any money and that Miss <b>Shaver</b> had signed a release absolving her of any indebtedness. <b>Shaver,</b> seeing no other recourse, sued the Baroness for extortion. The trial took place in Menominee in 1917 and was settled out of court, with the Baroness being required to repay $13,515.|$|E
