Past modifications can also leave waterbodies unfavourable for crayfish, but sometimes there is scope to improve them. Mitigation measures {{can reduce the}} impact and reinstate or even improve habitat. Various case studies show measures used during engineering works {{and some of the}} problems. Good planning and supervision are vital. The big issues at river and catchment scales (non-indigenous crayfish, disease, water quality and landuse) may be higher priorities than provision of habitat at site or reach level; e. g. fencing in pastures improves riparian areas for crayfish and other <b>species.</b> <b>If</b> <b>necessary,</b> there are various options for natural and artificial refuges, but their success depends on flow characteristics, substrate and accessibility.

40|$|The {{solubility}} and hydrolysis behaviour of Th(IV), U(IV), Np(IV) and Pu(IV) {{is critically}} reviewed. Based on a chemical model, which includes all mononuclear species An(OH) _n" 4 "-"n up to n= 4 and also polynuclear <b>species,</b> <b>if</b> <b>necessary,</b> {{the solubilities of}} amorphous An(IV) hydroxides or hydrous oxides are calculated {{as a function of}} pH. The SIT is used for ionic strength corrections to evaluate the thermodynamic hydrolysis constants and solubility products at I= 0 and 25 C. At first, the hydrolysis constants from less ambiguous experiments are selected from the literature, e. g. from solvent extraction studies with Pu(IV) and Np(IV) trace concentrations, where the interference of colloid formation can be excluded, or from spectroscopic investigations on the initial hydrolysis of U(IV). Unknown formation constants of mononuclear hydrolysis species are estimated by applying semi-empirical models, correlating the known constants for tetravalent actinides with those of actinides of other oxidation states. Based on the known and estimated hydrolysis constants, the solubility products of An(OH) _ 4 (am) or AnO_ 2 x xH_ 2 O(am) are then evaluated from experimental solubility data available in the literature. The solubilities of amorphous Pu(IV), Np(IV) and U(IV) precipitates in carbonate-free solutions of pH 1 - 13 are well described with a model including solely mononuclear hydrolysis species. The neglected contributions of polynuclear or colloidal species do not exceed the range of uncertainty. In the case of Th(IV), no unambiguous thermodynamic constants could be evaluated. Accounting for the considerably higher solubilities of amorphous Th(IV) precipitates in the pH range 2 - 5, a set of constants is evaluated, which includes the polynuclear species Th_ 4 (OH) _ 1 _ 2 " 4 "+ and Th_ 6 (OH) _ 1 _ 5 " 9 "+ proposed in potentiometric titration studied. However, recent investigations provided strong evidence for the formation of colloids under these conditions. (orig.)

30|$|Species {{delimitation}} of polypores {{was long}} based upon macro-morphological and ecological characters. However, these classical morphological species concepts {{have proven to}} be too wide for many important medicinal polypore species, e.g. for Ganoderma lucidum, G. applanatum, or Laetiporus sulphureus (Banik et al. 2010; Banik et al. 2012; Hseu et al. 1996, Ota et al. 2009). Polypore species, described upon morphology as generalists on several hosts, have often turned out to consist of multiple phylogenetic (cryptic) lineages, and the description of new <b>species</b> <b>if</b> often <b>necessary</b> within such species complexes (Skaven Seierstad et al. 2013). This makes comparison of studies working on metabolites from medicinal polypores forming a morphological species complex especially critical and difficult. It is therefore essential to document, from which habitat and substrate the fruit body was obtained, to deposit a voucher in a public mycological collection and a culture in a public culture collection, in order to check or to re-identify the fungus. Moreover, it is also recommended to sequence barcoding regions of the investigated fungal material, in order to allow for a later verification of the identification of the fungus.|$|R
40|$|A {{checklist}} of all species of Ficus L. {{available in the}} present political boundary of India is provided. About 115 taxa (89 species and 26 infraspecific taxa) of Ficus have been recorded here based on all available information. The taxa have been arranged according to the current classification among six subgenera and 12 sections. The maximum number of the species belongs to subgenera Urostigma. For each species, correct nomenclature with first citation followed by several relevant works and important synonyms has been provided along with Indian as well as world distribution. The taxonomic comments have also been provided for many <b>species,</b> <b>if</b> found <b>necessary.</b> Out of the 115 taxa occurring in India, only 10 taxa have been recorded as endemic. One new combination Ficus hirta Vahl subsp. triloba (Buch. -Ham. ex Voigt) Chaudhary has been proposed. In India, the species are distributed throughout the country from South to North up to the Himalayas at about 2, 000 m elevations. The maximum diversity of the species lies in the North-East region followed by the Peninsular region and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the solubility and aggregation properties of humic and fulvic acids, and their interaction with hydrophobic metal complexes and with aqueous metal ions. A parallel study involved quantitative analysis of solution equilibria between Al(III), Cu(II) and simple ligand systems representing possible complexing moieties in humic substances. The solubility and aggregation properties of humic acid were studied as a function of pH and ionic strength by gel permeation chromatography and equilibrium dialysis. Predominantly smaller molecules were dissolved below pH 4; the solubility of the larger humic molecules increased with increased pH and with decreased ionic strength. The potential of XAD resins for the isolation of humic acid from soil extracts was investigated. These macroporous adsorbents were found to be unsuitable for this purpose. Large molecules were excluded from the XAD resins; those components which were adsorbed could not be completely desorbed by strongly alkaline solutions. In conjunction with the solubility studies these results highlighted the operational nature of the fraction defined as 'humic acid' and raised questions about the reported differences between aquatic and soil derived humic substances. The interaction of humic substances with hydrophobic Cu(II) complexes (L = 1 -(2 -pyridylazo) - 2 -naphthol and 8 -hydroxyquinoline) was studied by ASV (at a NCTMFE) and by visible absorption spectroscopy. Humic substances (HS) interacted hydrophilically with these <b>species</b> (<b>if</b> <b>necessary</b> displacing a low molecular weight ligand) to form a ternary complex, HS-Cu-L. Algal assays established that humic acid could thus ameliorate the extreme toxicity of hydrophobic Cu(II) complexes provided that the displaced ligand itself is not toxic. The apparent lability of Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes with humic and fulvic acids was studied by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). At a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) the Cu(II) complexes of humic and fulvic acids were of similar lability; the apparent lability decreased as the pH increased. Complexes of humic substances with Cu(II) were less labile than those with Pb(II). Results were dependent on the electrode system used for the measurements. The effects of adsorption of humic substances on several electrode surfaces were characterized (HMDE, thin mercury film (TMFE), Nafion-coated TMFE, and bare glassy carbon). These effects were exerted predominantly in the deposition step. A method for measuring the apparent lability of metal-humic complexes was developed which corrected for the contribution from adsorption. Ion selective electrode (ISE) potentiometry was used to probe the complexation capacity of humic and fulvic acids for Cu(II) (at pH 5. 0, 6. 3, and 7. 0) and the relative stability of these complexes (pH 2. 5 - 7. 5). For both humic substances the complexation capacity increased with pH. Assuming bidentate coordination then, for fulvic acid at pH 5. 0, 6. 3, and 7. 0 respectively, complexation capacity measurements indicated that 82 - 85 %, 67 - 72 %, and 50 - 60 % of carboxyl groups were not involved in strong Cu(II) binding under the experimental conditions. For humic acid the proportions were 73 - 79 %, 33 - 43 % and 5 - 25 % respectively. Cu(II) complexes with fulvic acid were significantly less stable than those with humic acid. At the same carboxyl group concentration, Cu(II) binding curves for humic acid were displaced markedly to lower pH, indicating stronger binding. For a 1 : 20 Cu(II) :COOH ratio the pH displacement between the humic and fulvic acid curves was 0. 65 at pH 3. 5 and 1. 0 at pH 5. 0. The larger humic acid molecules (fractionated by 0. 025 μm filtration in weakly acidic solution) were stronger complexors than were the smaller moieties. The apparent stability of Cu(II) -humic complexes decreased with increased metal-to-ligand ratio and with increased ionic strength. The competition of Mg(II) and Al(III) for humic Cu(II) complexation sites was studied. Simulation of the Cu(II) binding curves for humic substances identified the discrete ligands malonate and citrate as reasonable models for humic chelating sites; complexation by salicylate and phthalate moieties was considerably weaker than that by humic substances. Quantitative pH potentiometric studies were made on the complexation of Cu(II) and Al(III) by carboxylate ligands (25 °C, 0. 1 mol L- 1 KCl). The models which best described the solution equilibria in the Al(III) systems were: Al(III) -malonic acid: AlL (log K = 6. 71), AlL 2 (4. 94), AlL 3 (2. 61), AlL 20 H (- 7. 0) Al(III) -isocitric acid: AlHL (10. 07), AlL (6. 96) The Cu(II) - 5 -methoxy-N-(2 -hydroxybenzyl) sarcosine system (CuL (7. 05), CuLH. 1 (- 3. 98)) demonstrated the contribution of 'cascade binding' to metal complex stability. Formation of insoluble species in the Cu(II) -butane- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetracarboxylic acid system prevented quantitative analysis...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the East African caeciliid Boulengerula were reconstructed using 12 S, 16 S and cytb mitochondrial gene sequences for 32 samples from Kenya and Tanzania. The generally well-supported and resolved phylogeny displayed the following {{relationships among the}} five nominate species sampled: (B. boulengeri ((B. taitanus, B. niedeni), (B. changamwensis, B. uluguruensis))). This resolution supports a formerly proposed bipartition of the genus, and differs significantly from previous, morphological phylogenies. Our analyses identified genetic differences between several mtDNA clades that potentially represent undescribed <b>species.</b> <b>If</b> substantiated, the <b>necessary</b> taxonomic revision will have implications for conservation assessments that depend to an important extent upon sizes of distributions. Overall, {{there is a positive}} correlation between genetic and geographic distance among and within the main clades. The two lowland, coastal individuals sampled are nested within primarily montane clades. Dating analyses suggest some temporally congruent divergences in Boulengerula, but other divergences happened at different times and over a long period, perhaps extending back to the Oligocene/Eocene. Our results for Boulengerula suggest a role for relative long-term environmental stability in the origins of the Eastern Arc Mountain...|$|R
