In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows.

Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|E

In this context the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The brick veneer is generally connected to the <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> by brick ties (metal strips that are attached to the <b>structural</b> <b>wall,</b> as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer). There is typically an air gap between the brick veneer and the <b>structural</b> <b>wall.</b> As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and weep holes can be left {{at the base of the}} brick veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.|$|E

The {{cyclic loading}} test of three steel high {{performance}} concrete(SHPC) <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> was conducted {{and the failure}} pattern of the <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> under the combined effect of axial force, bending moment, and shear force was researched. Based on the experimental results, the displacement-based deformation capacity design method was proposed for SHPC <b>structural</b> <b>walls.</b> It is obtained for the interrelated relationships among the ultimate drift ratio, the axial load ratio, the characteristic value of stirrup content and the aspect ratio. It is concluded that the increasing the characteristic value of stirrup content and limiting the axial load ratio were effective means to improve ductility. The characteristic value of stirrup content of SHPC <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> with different ultimate drift ratio and axial load ratio were proposed and the conclusion can be referred by the design of SHPC <b>structural</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Field {{evidence}} was interpreted {{to suggest that}} discontinuities in the longitudinal web reinforcement caused severe damage in <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> during strong ground motion. To test this hypothesis, six small-scale reinforced concrete <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> were tested under lateral displacement reversals. Test variables included the presence of web longitudinal reinforcement discontinuities and number of loading cycles. The test results indicated that unit tensile strains in longitudinal reinforcing bars in boundary elements were approximately 50 % higher in <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> with web longitudinal reinforcement cutoffs relative to walls without reinforcement cutoffs. Higher unit tensile strains caused an increase in permanent strain accumulation, increasing the likelihood of bar buckling. Additional loading cycles after yielding also accelerated permanent strain accumulation. A method is proposed for estimating the drift capacity of slender <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> with and without reinforcement discontinuities. ...|$|R

40|$|Wind load {{is really}} the result of wind {{pressures}} acting on the building surfaces during a wind event. This wind pressure is primarily {{a function of the}} wind speed because the pressure or load increases with the square of the wind velocity. <b>Structural</b> <b>walls,</b> or shear walls, are elements used to resist lateral loads, such as those generated by wind and earthquakes. <b>Structural</b> <b>walls</b> are considerably deeper than typical beams or columns. This attribute gives <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> considerable in-plane stiffness which makes <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> a natural choice for resisting lateral loads. In addition to considerable strength, <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> can dissipate a great deal of energy if detailed properly. Walls are an invaluable structural element when protecting buildings from seismic events. Buildings often rely on <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> as the main lateral force resisting system. Shear walls are required to perform in multiple ways. Shear walls can then be designed to limit building damage to the specified degree. The loaddeformation response of the <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> must be accurately predicted and related to structural damage in order to achieve these performance goals under loading events of various magnitudes. The applied load is generally transferred to the wall by a diaphragm or collector or drag member. The performance of the framed buildings depends on the structural system adopted for the structure The term structural system or structural frame in structural engineering refers to load-resisting sub-system of a structure. The structural system transfers loads through interconnected structural components or members. These structural systems need to be chosen based on its height and loads and need to be carried out, etc. The selection of appropriate structural systems for building must satisfy both strength and stiffness requirements. The structural system must be adequate to resist lateral and gravity loads that cause horizontal shear deformation and overturning deformation. The efficiency of a structural system is measured in terms of their ability to resist lateral load, which increases with the height of the frame. A building can be considered as tall when the effect of lateral loads is reflected in the design. Lateral deflections of framed buildings should be limited to prevent damage to both structural and nonstructural elements. In the present study, the structural performance of the framed building with shear wall will be analysis...|$|R

40|$|Evaluations of the {{stiffness}} and the ductility of reinforced concrete shear walls have been receiving added emphasis {{due to their}} importance {{in connection with the}} serviceability limit state design for tall buildings and the ductility design for earthquake-resistant building systems. In this thesis an investigation has been conducted into the effects of steel reinforcement and axial loads on flexural stiffness and curvature ductility of reinforced concrete <b>structural</b> <b>walls.</b> An analytical method of analysis is proposed first in this study for the determination of stresses and strains for a given moment-curvature relationship of reinforced concrete sections. The proposed analytical analysis is performed based on the close form integration. It is less approximate and the numerical errors can then be reduced significantly, comparing to the numerical integration used in the traditional numerical methods for determining the stress and strain of moment-curvature curves. Theoretical moment-curvature relationships for typical reinforced concrete wall sections with different steel ratios and different axial load levels are derived respectively. A new model is presented to describe the effects of steel reinforcement and axial forces on {{the stiffness}} and ductility of the flexural wall sections. It has been shown that the flexural stiffness of the sections can significantly be increased with the increase in reinforcement ratio in the section. Moreover, the curvature ductility of the sections can be decreased with the increase in the axial forces of the cross-sections. A 3 -point plot is then introduced to describe the proposed model. As the flexural stiffness and the curvature ductility can be evaluated from a moment curvature curve, the 3 point plot provides designers a convenient means of understanding the stiffness and ductility behaviour of the flexural <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> with the effects of steel reinforcement and axial loads. Design formulas for calculating the flexural stiffness and curvature ductility of the <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> with consideration of different reinforcement ratios and axial load ratios are derived. The formulas provide practising engineers a very simple and efficient means for the analysis of flexural <b>structural</b> <b>walls,</b> particularly in the preliminary design of shear-wall types of tall buildings. The practical implications of utilising the enhancing effects of steel reinforcement and axial loads on the flexural stiffness and ductility in the design of <b>structural</b> <b>walls</b> are considerable. Economies could be achieved by recognising these enhancing effects. The research provides a basis for the development of more rational analysis and design of reinforced concrete, flexural <b>structural</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
