40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the challenges for the Latin American left-wing governments throughout the electoral campaigns of 2014 - 2015. Up to the moment these electoral campaigns and their results were not researched and analyzed in the scientific literature. However, it was not the only aim of the article. The authors consider necessary to explain how the achievements made by the Left-Wing political forces may affect and determine the general political situation and international panorama of the region. Consequently, the special attention is paid to {{the analysis of the}} electoral rallies in some key countries for the Left-Wing block as whole. These countries are Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Salvador as they represent different patterns of Left-Wing turn in the region. As almost all of them form part of some Latin American <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>groups,</b> the authors also make some prospects about the possible shifts in the system of international relations in the region as a consequence of these electoral campaigns. Within the marks of the article the authors analyze possible transformations of South American Common market (MERCOSUR) and the Bolivarian Alliance for Americas (ALBA) and explain how the results of elections of 2014 would affect the envolvement of some Leftist governments into these <b>integration</b> <b>groups.</b> According to authors’ criteria, the Pirric triumph in Salvador should inevitably put in question the plans of Salvadoran close envolvement into the ALBA. Additionally, the visible weakening of Leftist government in Brazil will bring the redetermining of its relationship with the USA and can also affect Brazil’s leading role in the Mercosur. The authors confront the statistical data and the results of elections with the known facts of political behavior of Left-Wing governments in respect of the economical and political integration and relationship with the USA, China and Russia. The main object of the research was to measure the priorities for the foreign policy of Uruguay, Salvador and Brazil with a purpose to conclude the shape of their future political and economical participation in blocs and groups. As the official political declarations not always correspond to the real behavior of many governments, we also often confront them with the political remarks made by some politicians and governmental officials trying to understand the authentic line of their foreign policy determined by different factors...|$|R

What contributions did CEFTA {{make to the}} EU membership endeavour? In which ways did the EU membership drive impact on the subregional cooperation process? Were restrictions on the form of integration applied (basic trade liberalisation in the CEFTA case) a conscious choice or are there inbuilt limits to <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> pursued in the EU pre-accession context? What factors influenced the institutionalisation and widening issues? Does the CEFTA experience offer any lessons for other <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> exercises, including those already underway - as in the West Balkans - or purportedly on the agenda - as in the 'United Economic Space' planned by certain former Soviet states?

40|$|Since {{information}} technologies (IT) {{such as the}} 2 ̆ 2 Internet 2 ̆ 2 are being heralded as vehicles for increasing economic integration, {{the focus of this}} study is to determine ways that Internet technology can be used to increase West African subregional trade. The research design used both the survey and case methods to determine (1) perceptions of how the four independent variables (political, economic, social and technical) influence Internet adoption, and (2) whether Internet adoption has an influence on subregional trade in West Africa. The multilingual questionnaire (English, French and Portuguese) was based on an extensive review of literature and exploratory information taken from Internet discussion groups. The respondent sample frame was taken from embassy trade lists, commercial trade directories, and convenience samples of Internet discussion groups focusing on technological development in Africa. Questionnaires from seven countries were received. Case analysis consisted of a series of structured interviews which took place at a technology conference in Accra, Ghana. These interviews were conducted to supplement the survey response rate. After the data were tested for both reliability (alpha coefficient) and validity (factor analysis), five hypotheses were tested. The study found that (1) out of the four independent variables chosen for the study, only the political variable had a profound influence on Internet adoption and (2) Internet adoption is strongly correlated with subregional trade. Conclusions drawn from this study suggest that, despite the lack of ability to regulate the Internet, the government plays an important role in producing the a hospitable climate for its development. While cost is still a concern for most trade companies, awareness of the Internet is widespread and 2 ̆ 2 technophobia 2 ̆ 2 has been surmounted. Alternative power sources are needed to sustain growth and collaborative efforts are encouraged for <b>subregional</b> <b>integration.</b> Some recommendations are: formation of Internet advocacy groups to influence government technological initiatives; collaboration between subregional organs such as Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) and West African Enterprise Network (WAEN); proliferation of subregional 2 ̆ 2 telecenters 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 West African Internetwork 2 ̆ 2 topology using Internet and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to promote <b>subregional</b> <b>integration...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> and their mutual cooperation. I {{consider}} it as an important topic, because the relationship between <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> {{is a relatively new}} phenomenon. The global economy and international trade are currently undergoing significant changes and regionalism is gaining in importance. The aim of this work is the <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> in the world not only to map, but to explore the relationship between economic integration. I focus on groups that show signs of multilateral regional integration, and ask what form their cooperation has. The work presents the relationship between <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> in the world. There are different types of agreements and negotiations. The first kind of cooperation charts the relationships that exist between groups of a selected region of the world (intra-regional cooperation). It follows the second part, which introduces us to the vision of continental groupings. The last section outlines the cooperation between groups from different regions of the world (trans-regional cooperation) ...|$|R

For the purpose of evaluating ease {{of access to the}} markets of the region, the study looks at partial agreements on economic complementation entered into {{within the framework of the}} Treaty of Montevideo, and at the structure and level of the relevant tariffs. The study likewise analyzes the main features of foreign investment regimes in the region, the incipient flows of intraregional capital and the factors that have caused these to develop. The document ends with a number of recommendations for measures intended to increase the links between the various integration schemes in Latin America and the Caribbean. This work falls into three sections. The first deals with trends in regional trade; the second covers intraregional investment; and the third and last offers some recommendations for possible measures to improve economic ties between the integration schemes of the region...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThis article {{looks at}} the {{benefits}} that Panama could derive from its possible integration with {{the countries of the}} Central American Common Market (CACM);. First of all, Panama's production structure is analysed in terms of the phenomenon known as the "Dutch disease": this reveals the de-industrializing effect that the booms in the services sector have had on the economy. An examination is then made of the advantages that Panama could derive from gradual integration with the CACM countries in terms of intra-industry exports, promotion of investments, competition and modernization of production, and it is asserted that these benefits do not exist, on a reciprocal basis, in a scheme based on unilateral trade openness. An examination is also made {{of the ways in which}} <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> could further a process of modernization of production which could offset the adverse effects of the Dutch disease. Finally, some econometric equations based on a gravity model are presented and a quantitative assessment is made of the appreciable improvement that Panama could secure in its trade balance with the CACM if it became a full member of that integration scheme...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the causes of {{emergence}} {{of the most important}} Latin American <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> in a period {{since the end of the}} World War II till the present days. The set of groups consists of ALADI, CAN, SELA, OTCA, MERCOSUR, ACS-AEC, ALBA, UNASUR, CELAC, and the Pacific Alliance. The main goal of the thesis is to discover how did the power predominance of the United States contribute to the emergence of Latin American <b>integration</b> <b>groups.</b> The tested hypothesis is based on the concept of soft balancing, and assumes that the primary cause of emergence of Latin American <b>integration</b> <b>groups</b> was the fear of the power predominance of the United States.
