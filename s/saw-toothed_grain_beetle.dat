40|$|Graduation date: 1959 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the performance of four species of stored grain beetles in competition at three levels of moisture and temperature. The insects used in these tests were the granary weevil, the rice weevil, the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 90, 80, and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and at moisture levels of 15, 12, and 9 percent moisture content in two varieties of commercial wheat. Redmond variety commercial feed wheat was used for the majority of these tests. Several of the tests were duplicated using Idaed variety seed wheat. The competition studies were designed to test the performance of one species of grain beetle when reared in the presence of one or two other species. The procedure used was to obtain 50 adult insects of each species from stock cultures. These insects were picked at random and introduced into 250 gram samples of wheat in one pint containers and allowed to remain for one week. The initial adult population was then removed and the adult progeny were counted periodically to determine the size and time of appearance of the first generation. The following combinations of insects were tested: 1. Granary weevil and <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> 2. Granary weevil and red flour beetle 3. <b>Saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle 4. Granary weevil, <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle 5. Rice weevil and <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> 6. Rice weevil and red flour beetle In addition to these combinations, all species of insects were reared alone in each test in order to compare the performance of the insects when in pure culture and when in competitive situations with the other species. The rice weevil was the best competitor of the four species and was less influenced by the presence of other species of beetles. The rice weevil has a wide range of temperature and moisture tolerance and, though considered a tropical species, it is a common and successful pest of stored grain in the Pacific Northwest. The granary weevil was a good competitor because of its capacity to attack whole grains but did riot do as well as the rice weevil, probably because of its lower reproductive rate and longer life cycle. The granary weevil and the rice weevil were well adjusted to the conditions of these tests because of their ability as primary feeders in whole grain. Competition between weevils and bran bugs (the sawtoothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle) usually favored the bran bugs since the weevils chewed up the grain and made food material available to the bran bugs. In competition with weevils, the bran bugs usually appeared earlier than the former but ordinarily had smaller populations. In competition between bran bugs, the red flour beetle was almost always the dominant species. This was because of the ability of the red flour beetle to attack whole wheat grains and because of its extensive predation of the eggs and pupae of the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle.</b> The <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle usually produced larger populations {{in the presence of the}} rice weevil than when with the granary weevil. Where conditions of high temperature and moisture were present in the grain, mold often formed. The presence of the mold may have been favorable to the two species of bran bugs. It has been observed that when the granary weevil or the rice weevil is reared alone under high moisture conditions, there is considerable mold growth. When, however, the weevils are reared in the presence of one or two species of bran bugs, little or no mold is found. It is not known if the bran buns actually feed ori the mold but the results of these tests indicate that both species of bran bugs either feed on the mold or in some way inhibit its formation in grain at high moisture and. temperature levels.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} insect infestation on areas of heating in stored grain, and to demonstrate the ability of four species of insects to initiate or promote the spread of these heating areas. The four insects used were the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius (L.), the lesser grain borer Rhizopertha dominica (F.), the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Hbst.). All four of these insects are common pests of stored grain. Heating was initiated by adding moisture to a small portion of a confined mass of wheat. The term hot spot was used in reference to areas of the grain mass that showed a rise in temperature above that of the surrounding grain. Hot spots due to the growth of fungi on the moistened grain were referred to as fungus hot spots. A device was designed and constructed in which a small hot spot could be started and observed visually and electronically. It consisted of a wooden box of about one cubic foot capacity with two glass sides and an internal system of thermocouples and humidity indicators. Ten of these boxes were in operation during a period of two years in 18 laboratory experiments. A larger system of thermocouples and humidity indicators was installed in a Butler bin at the Oregon State University Entomology Farm in which 600 bushels of wheat were utilized in four different experiments. Hard white wheat was used in all experiments, and test insects were obtained from laboratory cultures. It was observed that fungus hot spots reached a peak of heating at room temperature about two weeks after moisture was added. Heating was confined to the small mass of grain that was moistened by the addition of water when no insects were present, and did not spread to the surrounding grain mass. The temperature declined rapidly unless additional moisture was forced into adjacent areas of the grain mass to start a second area of heating. Effects of insects on fungus hot spots varied according to the species of insect present. The granary weevil demonstrated the greatest ability, of the four insects tested, to promote the spread of a fungus hot spot. Hot spots involving the granary weevil, either by itself or in combination with other insects, expanded until most of the wheat in the laboratory boxes was involved. The lesser grain borer demonstrated an ability to promote the spread of a fungus hot spot almost equal to that of the granary weevil, but required a longer period of time. The red flour beetle and the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> failed to promote the spread of a fungus hot spot, and heating declined as rapidly in their presence as without them. Field experiments on a larger scale likewise showed the granary weevil to be superior to the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> in promoting the spread of fungus hot spots. Higher temperatures were recorded in the field experiments than in the laboratory experiments but heating was confined to the small mass of moistened grain when granary weevils were not present...|$|E

40|$|Many stored product {{insect pests}} are termed "freeze-intolerant" because they cannot survive ice {{formation}} in their extracellular body fluid.

The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the influence of the concentration of the ice-nucleating-active bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (10, 100 and 1000 ppm), temperature and duration of sub-zero exposure on the cold tolerance of the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius (L.) and the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.). After an application of 1000 ppm of powdered P. syringae to grain, the mortality of S. granarius and O. surinamensis was increased after 24 -h exposure to - 4 degrees C.

40|$|Low {{temperatures}} {{have been}} used for many years to control populations of stored-product insects. The aim of aeration was primarily to cool down the grain and then to prevent its deterioration by reducing the number of insects. In Belgium, the mild winters enable insects to survive to the next season. In autumn, the progressive lowering of temperature has an acclimation effect on stored-product insects. The present study was undertaken to determine the survival at low temperatures of non cold-acclimated and laboratory- and field-cold-acclimated insects. We have chosen to work with the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius (L.) and the <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.). They are the most frequent stored-grain pests in Belgium. To compare the cold-hardiness of different laboratory cold-acclimated insects, S. granarius and O. surinamensis were placed at nine different cold-acclimation temperature regimes. Insects were kept at 5 degrees C for 2, 4 and 6 weeks or at - 5 degrees C for 4, 7 and 14 days. To assess the field-cold-acclimation in autumn and in winter, insects were monthly taken from a bin and transferred to 5 degrees C for 6 weeks. S. granarius adults were more cold-hardy than O. surinamensis, but O. surinamensis adults compensated their cold-sensibility by a great ability to acclimate.

Three of the bins were equipped with an aeration control system activated by specific ambient air conditions in three cycles. Three of the bins were aerated by the on–site, storage manager under his normal regimen. Grain temperatures were recorded at four locations within each bin. To monitor insect viability, small cages were filled with approximately 150 g of rice and 20, 1 – to 2 –week–old mixed sex adults of one insect species. The species that were tested included the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (Fauvel); the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.); and the <b>saw–toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.).

40|$|The <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Silvanidae), is a {{cosmopolitan}} stored-product pest. Early studies on O.  surinamensis in the 1930 s described {{the presence of}} peculiar bacteriomes harboring endosymbiotic bacteria in the abdomen. Since then, however, the microbiological nature of the symbiont has been elusive. Here we investigated the endosymbiotic system of O.  surinamensis in detail. In the abdomen of adults, pupae, and larvae, four oval bacteriomes were consistently identified, whose cytoplasm was full of extremely elongated tubular bacterial cells several micrometers wide and several hundred micrometers long. Molecular phylogenetic analysis identified the symbiont {{as a member of}} the Bacteroidetes, in which the symbiont was the most closely related to the endosymbiont of a grain pest beetle, Rhyzopertha dominica (Bostrichidae). The symbiont was detected in developing embryos, corroborating vertical symbiont transmission through host generations. The symbiont gene showed AT-biased nucleotide composition and accelerated molecular evolution, plausibly reflecting degenerative evolution of the symbiont genome. When the symbiont infection was experimentally removed, the aposymbiotic insects grew and reproduced normally, but exhibited a slightly but significantly more reddish cuticle and lighter body mass. These results indicate that the symbiont of O.  surinamensis is not essential for the host’s growth and reproduction but contributes to the host’s cuticle formation. Symbiont genome sequencing and detailed comparison of fitness parameters between symbiotic and aposymbiotic insects under various environmental conditions will provide further insights into the symbiont’s biological roles for the stored-product pest...|$|E

The sensory capability of the antenna was assessed by a study of the structure, distribution and function of sensilla using SEM and TEM. Seven different sensilla types, including 3 with an olfactory function, were identified, although the total number of olfactory sensilla was low compared with those for mechanoreception. Antennal responses to odours were studied using both the electroantennogram (EAG) technique and single-cell recordings, whilst a 2 -choice pitfall assay and a single-insect arena test were used to investigate behavioural responses. Food-produced volatiles from carob pods were found to produce large amplitude antennal responses and attraction in behavioural assays. Analysis of such volatiles by coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography (GC-EAG) demonstrated at least 3 active components, of which one was identified as hexanoic acid. Attraction to food odour was found to vary with insect age, and this correlated with similar variation in the EAG response, suggesting a role for peripheral receptor sensitivity in modulating insect behaviour. Beetle-produced volatiles also caused antennal responses and attraction of conspecific individuals of both sexes, thus acting as an aggregation pheromone. The active components were identified by GC-EAG as (Z,Z) - 3, 6 -dodecadien- 11 -olide, (Z,Z) - 3, 6 -dodecadienolide and (Z,Z) - 5, 8 -tetradecadien- 13 -olide. These act as a multicomponent pheromone, with separate antennal receptors for each component. Although no sexual differences in antennal responses were found, consistently more females than males were attracted to the pheromone. This suggested a partial sex pheromone function, as the pheromone was shown to be male-produced. However, the ratio of females:males attracted was found to vary with the blend ratio tested. Thus if males are able to alter the blend they produce, the pheromone may act at different times as either a sex pheromone or an aggregation pheromone. Finally, the functional and evolutionary importance of odours to this insect are discussed. </p...|$|E

High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached.

Insects, 8 (2). doi: 10. 3390 /insects 8020042 The efficacy of ozone was evaluated against four economically-important stored-product insect species at 27. 2 °C and 20. 4 % r. h. Adults of phosphine-susceptible laboratory strains and phosphine-resistant field {{strains of the}} red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), <b>saw-toothed</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Linnaeus), maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (Linnaeus), were exposed in vials to an ozone concentration of 0. 42 g/m 3 (200 ppm) for 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h with 0 and 10 g of wheat. Initial and final mortalities were assessed 1 and 5 d after exposure to ozone, respectively. After an 8 – 12 -h exposure to ozone, initial mortality of Sitophilus spp. and O. surinamensis was 100 %, whereas the highest initial mortality of T. castaneum was 90 %. A 3 – 4 -h exposure to ozone resulted in 100 % final mortality of Sitophilus spp., whereas O. surinamensis required a 6 - to 10 -h exposure to ozone. Adults of T. castaneum were least susceptible to ozone, and after a 10 -h exposure, mortality ranged between 82 and 95 %. Time for the 5 d 99 % mortality (LT 99) for adults of laboratory and field strains of Sitophilus spp., O. surinamensis and T. castaneum were 2. 00 – 5. 56, 4. 33 – 11. 18 and 14. 35 – 29. 89 h, respectively. The LT 99 values for adults of T. castaneum and O. surinamensis {{were not significantly different}} between bioassays conducted with 0 and 10 g of wheat. The LT 99 values for the laboratory strains of Sitophilus spp. in the absence of wheat were significantly lower than those obtained in the presence of wheat. Both phosphine-susceptible and -resistant strains were equally susceptible to ozone. Ozone effectively suppressed adult progeny production of all four species. Ozone is a viable alternative fumigant to control phosphine-resistant strains of these four species. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|E

PhillipsKnowing {{the factors}} that {{influence}} the distribution patterns, establishment and persistence of stored product insects aids {{in the development of a}} more effective pest management program in grain storage structures. This research focuses mainly on the insect communities of stored wheat and stored rice in two different geographical locations, their temporal relationships and the most important or abundant species within that community. Stored wheat was sampled for one season in Manhattan, KS and for rice stored in Beaumont, TX was sampled for two seasons. Hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea stercorea (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) was one of the most abundant species and was present in every bin of either wheat or rice and appeared to move into and out of the grain mass. In wheat bin, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was a predominant species captured in the bin headspace, but was not frequently recovered in the grain mass. Headspace temperatures tended to be warmer than grain temperatures and outside temperatures. Other major insects recovered in wheat bin included the following groups or species: Anthicidae, Lathridiidae, Cryptolestes, foreign <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Ahasverus advena (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), sawtoothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), smalleyed flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionoidea) and minute pirate bug Xylocoris favipes (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). In rice bins, the predominate species were hairy fungus <b>beetle,</b> foreign <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and Angoumois <b>grain</b> moth Sitotroga cerealella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Angoumois grain moth was one of the most abundant species in rice, and was captured in the headspace as well as below the grain surface. Rice bins varied considerably in the relative abundance of different species between bins within a season and between seasons. Foreign <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and hairy fungus beetle were especially variable among bins. Two species of weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) that are not grain pests, the sugar cane rootstock weevil, Apinocis deplanata and rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were present in high numbers in rice bins from September-December 2009...|$|R

The grain bin was filled with Hard Red Spring wheat and liquid nitrogen was introduced {{from the bottom of}} the bin. The survival of both cold acclimated and unacclimated C. furrugineus was tested. The study reveals that cold acclimated insects had higher survival than unacclimated insects under similar cooling conditions. In most cases, mortalities of as high as 100 % were achieved at the bottom 100 cm of the grain bin for unacclimated insects for most of the trials. Insect survival increased as the distance {{from the bottom of the}} grain bin increased. There was no adverse effect of liquid nitrogen aeration on wheat germination.
