25|$|The {{double-deck}} design usually includes {{lowering the}} bottom floor to below {{the top level}} of the wheels, closer to the rails, and then adding an upper floor above. Such a design will fit under more bridges, tunnels and power wires (<b>structure</b> <b>gauge).</b> For cost and safety, this design also minimizes car height (loading gauge) and lowers the centre of gravity.|$|E
25|$|When {{carried by}} rail, {{containers}} can be loaded on flatcars or in container well cars. In Europe, stricter railway height restrictions (smaller loading gauge and <b>structure</b> <b>gauge)</b> and overhead electrification prevent containers from being stacked two high, and containers are hauled one high either on standard flatcars or other railroad cars. Taller containers are often carried in well cars (not stacked) on older European railway routes where the loading gauge (especially with the reduced gauge for UK lines) is particularly small.|$|E
25|$|Exceptions in {{this region}} include bilevel {{passenger}} rail cars used by the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, Montreal's AMT, MARC and MBTA Commuter Rail, {{all of which were}} built to unique designs to clear specific <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> problems on those systems. The bilevels used on LIRR, MARC, and MBTA were built by Kawasaki Rail Car, Inc., while the bilevels for AMT and NJ Transit were built by Bombardier Transportation. Recently Rotem has built additional new cars of a similar design for MBTA.|$|E

50|$|The {{loading gauge}} limits {{the size of}} {{passenger}} carriages, goods wagons (freight cars) and shipping containers that can be conveyed on a section of railway line and varies across the world and often within a single railway system. Over time {{there has been a}} trend towards larger loading gauges and more standardization of gauges with older lines having their <b>structure</b> <b>gauges</b> enhanced by raising bridges, increasing the height of tunnels and making other necessary alterations. Containerisation and a trend towards larger shipping containers has led rail companies to increase <b>structure</b> <b>gauges</b> to compete effectively with road haulage.|$|R

25|$|Bilevel cars {{may not be}} usable in {{countries}} or older railway systems with low loading gauges. With the exception for Bombardier MultiLevel Coaches, this includes much of the rail network in the North East of the USA, which includes the North East Corridor of Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, Metro North and the Long Island Railroad as well as almost the entire British rail network. In some countries such as the UK new lines are built to a higher than the existing <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> to allow the use of double-deck trains in future.|$|E
25|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} usually {{cost less}} to build {{because they are}} usually lighter in construction, using smaller cars and locomotives (smaller loading gauge), as well as smaller bridges, smaller tunnels (smaller <b>structure</b> <b>gauge)</b> and tighter curves. Narrow gauge is thus often used in mountainous terrain, where the savings in civil engineering work can be substantial. It is also used in sparsely populated areas where the potential demand is too low for broader gauge railways to be economically viable. This {{is the case in}} some of Australia and most of Southern Africa, where extremely poor soils have led to population densities too low for standard gauge to be viable.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{passenger}} rail {{lines in the}} Northeast have a loading gauge that can only accommodate cars [...] or less in height; {{this is due to}} <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> restrictions such as bridges and tunnels that are too low, and may also have electrified lines overhead.|$|E

The small <b>structure</b> <b>gauges</b> and {{consequently}} small loading gauges on British railways mean that double stacking {{is not possible}} and that well cars are required {{to be able to}} transport 9 ft high intermodal containers on routes where the loading gauge is W9 or smaller.|$|R

2500|$|In {{recent years}} [...] "hicube" [...] "high cubic capacity" [...] boxcars {{have become more}} common in the USA. These are taller than regular boxcars and as such can only run on routes with {{increased}} clearance (see loading gauge and <b>structure</b> <b>gauge).</b> The excess height section of the car end is often painted with a white band so as to be easily visible if wrongly assigned to a low-clearance line.|$|E

50|$|In quantum physics, the {{mathematical}} notion is usually applied to {{the mathematical}} <b>structure</b> of <b>gauge</b> algebras.

25|$|The strongest {{evidence}} that a line was built as single-track and duplicated {{at a later date}} consists of major structures such as bridges and tunnels that are twinned. One example is the twin Slade tunnels on the Ilfracombe Branch Line in the UK. Twinned structures may be identical in appearance, or like some tunnels between Adelaide and Belair in South Australia, substantially different in appearance, being built to different <b>structure</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{are usually}} built with smaller radius curves, smaller <b>structure</b> <b>gauges,</b> lighter rails, etc., {{they can be}} substantially less costly to build, equip, and operate than standard gauge or broad gauge railways, particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain. The lower costs of narrow-gauge railways mean they are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify {{the cost of building}} a standard or broad gauge line.|$|R
2500|$|Bombardier MultiLevel Coaches.

Previously, the region had a fleet of gallery cars produced in 1969 by Canadian Vickers for the Canadian Pacific Railway's [...] "TownTrain" [...] service; CPR's commuter rail operations in Montreal were transferred to public authorities in October 1982, and these bilevel cars have now been retired.|$|E
2500|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{also have}} specialized use in mines and other environments where {{a very small}} <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> makes a very small loading gauge necessary. Narrow-gauge railways also have more general applications. Non-industrial narrow-gauge mountain railways are or were common in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Pacific Cordillera of Canada, in Mexico, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Greece, and Costa Rica. In some countries, narrow gauge is the standard, like the [...] gauge in Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Africa, the Australian states of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, and the [...] in Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
2500|$|... {{there is}} only one model, the PA5. The cars are [...] long, and [...] wide.

PA5 cars have stainless steel bodies and three doors on each side. LCD displays above the windows (between the doors) display the destination of that particular train. The PA5 cars are coupled into seven-car or eight-car formations, with conductors' cabs on all cars and engineers' cabs on the [...] "A" [...] (driving) cars.

We find that there is an L_∞ algebra for the <b>gauge</b> <b>structure</b> and a larger one for the full interacting field theory.

50|$|To {{illustrate}} the structure, consider a ferromagnet which {{is composed of}} atoms each equipped with a tiny magnet. When these magnets are lined up, {{the inside of the}} ferromagnet bears a strong analogy to the way empty space can be <b>structured.</b> <b>Gauge</b> vector fields that are sensitive to this structure of empty space can only propagate over a finite distance. Thus they mediate short range interactions and acquire mass. Those fields that are not sensitive to the structure propagate unhindered. They remain massless and are responsible for the long range interactions. In this way, the mechanism accommodates within a single unified theory both short and long-range interactions.|$|R
