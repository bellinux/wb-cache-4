500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so {{we thought it would be}} cool to get a bit of retribution in there."

As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that <b>stand</b> <b>point</b> , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, response to the ode by critics was mostly positive. Andrew Bradley declared in 1909 that [...] "The Immortality Ode, like King Lear, is its author's greatest product, but not his best piece of work." [...] When speaking of Grasmere and Wordsworth, Elias Sneath wrote in 1912: [...] "It witnessed the composition {{of a large number of}} poems, many of which may be regarded among the finest products of his imagination. Most of them have already been considered. However, one remains which, in the judgment of some critics, more than any other poem of the numerous creations of his genius, entitles him to a seat among the Immortals. This is the celebrated ... It is, in some respects, one of his most important works, whether viewed from the <b>stand</b> <b>point</b> of mere art, or from that of poetic insight." [...] George Harper, following Sneath in 1916, described the poem in positive terms and said, [...] "Its radiance comes and goes through a shimmering veil. Yet, when we look close, we find nothing unreal or unfinished. This beauty, though supernal, is not evanescent. It bides our return, and whoever comes to seek it as a little child will find it. The imagery, though changing at every turn, is fresh and simple. The language, though connected with thoughts so serious that they impart to it a classic dignity, is natural and for the most part plain.... Nevertheless, a peculiar glamour surrounds the poem. It is the supreme example of what I may venture to term the romance of philosophic thought." ...|$|E
