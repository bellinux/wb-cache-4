40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the UK Coalition Government’s {{policies}} aimed at putting into place a regulatory framework {{to create a}} competitive market in English higher education. I explore the complexities of this highly charged political process, and the ensuing ‘hullabaloo ’ it has created. This is because, as Polanyi (1992) remarks, instituting a market is a political process, conditioned by power, competing interests, contingency and contradictions. I show that whilst some elements of Coalition policy build upon the previous Labour administration’s proposed reforms, in key aspects they also depart from them, particularly in terms of privatising the HE sector and opening it to for-profit firms, new forms of financialisation, governance through risk, and consumerism. In ambition, then, the Coalition’s HE policy represents a potential radical transformation in the governance of the sector, {{and what it means}} to be a student. Revealing the strategies to legitimate and ‘fix’ the new <b>sectoral</b> <b>rules</b> for a competitive market in a regulatory framework is important if we are to fully understand the wider politics at play, and the longer-term implications of these for the sector, for students and for society...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of Public Service Obligations (PSO) {{in the network}} sectors of SGEIs are defined by the normative values of a good administrative protocol with <b>sectoral</b> <b>rules</b> set out in EU legislation. The Europeanisation of these sectors provides a coherent base which informs the national approaches in providing for acts of entrustment {{and the establishment of}} independent national regulatory agencies. This paper examines the development of this model and provides a comparison with the approach taken in economic social services sectors where Member States face a developing imperative to designate essential SSGI as SGEI. This is a social services environment in which a growing Public Service Industry is increasingly seeing private sector economic actors enjoy a general advantage over third sector not-for-profit and charity entities, in the public procurement processes. The comparison highlights the significant differences in the way that PSOs are expressed between the network SGEIs and the ‘social’ SGEIs and raises a question of whether it is time to consider, in at least some social services sectors, whether the {{expression of}} PSOs should be re-modelled {{in such a way as}} to replicate those in the network SGEI sectors...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} Generalized Taylor Economy (GTE) {{framework}} {{in which there are}} many sectors with overlapping contracts of different lengths to analyze the design of monetary policy. We derive a utility based objective function of a central bank for this economy and use it to evaluate the performance of alternative simple rules. We find that a simple rule that targets an index that gives more weight to the sectors which have longer contracts and are more important in the aggregate index yields a welfare outcome nearly identical to the optimal policy. However, we find that potential gains in targeting sector specific inflation rates rather than the aggregate inflation rate is very sensitive to the shape of the distribution. We show that except for the cases where prices/wages are reoptimized very frequently, the performance of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>rule</b> can be closely approximated by a simple rule that targets aggregate inflation.

I first identify a number of relevant features of network industries that may affect {{the way in which}} {{antitrust law}} and regulatory rules should be applied. These relevant features include (among others) network effects, market structure, market share and profits inequality, choice of technical standards, relationship between the number of active firms and social benefits, existence of market power, leveraging of market power in complementary markets, and innovation races. I find that there are often significant differences on the effects of application of antitrust law in network and non-network industries...|$|R
40|$|Mutual {{recognition}} {{is a remarkable}} innovation facilitating economic intercourse across borders. In the EU's internal goods market it has been helpful in tackling or avoiding the remaining obstacles, namely, regulatory barriers between Member States. However, there is a curious paradox. Despite the almost universal acclaim of the great merits of mutual recognition the principle has, in and by itself, contributed only modestly to the actual realisation of free movement in the single market. It is also surprising that economists have not or hardly underpinned their widespread appreciation for the principle by providing rigorous analysis which could substantiate the case for mutual recognition for policy makers. Business in Europe has shown a sense of disenc hantment with the principle because of the many costs and uncertainties in its application in actual practice. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to provide the economic and strategic arguments for employing mutual recognition much more systematically in the single market for goods and services. The strategic and the "welfare" gains are analysed and adetailed exposition of the fairly high information, transaction and compliance costs is provided. The information costs derive from the fact that mutual recognition remains a distant abstraction for day-to-day business life. Understandably, verifying the "equivalence" of objectives of health and safety between Member States is perceived as difficult and uncertain. This sentiment is exacerbated by the complications of interpreting the equivalence of "effects". In actual practice, these abstractions are expected to override clear and specific national product or services rules, which local inspectors or traders may find problematic without guidance. The paper enumerates several other costs including, inter alia, the absence of <b>sectoral</b> <b>rule</b> books and the next-to-prohibitive costs of monitoring of the application of the principle. The basic problems in applying mutual recognition in the entire array of services are inspected, showing why the principle can only be used in a limited number of services markets and even there it may contribute only modestly to genuine free movement and competitive exposure. A special section is devoted to a range of practical illustrations of the difficulties business experiences when relying on mutual recognition. Finally, the corollary of mutual recognition - regulatory competition - is discussed in terms of a cost/benefits analysis compared to what is often said to be the alternative, that is "harmonisation", in EU parlance the "new approach" to approximation. The conclusion is that the manifold benefits of mutual recognition for Europe are too great to allow the present ambiguities to continue. The Union needs much more pro-active approaches to reduce the costs of mutual recognition as well as permanent monitoring structures for its application to services (analogous to those already successfully functioning in goods markets). Above all, what is required is a "mutual recognition culture" so that the EU can better enjoy the fruits of its own regulatory ingenuity...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Footprint (EF), {{launched}} by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre in close cooperation with Directorate-General for the Environment, gives specific guidance for comprehensive, scientifically-sound and consistent environmental assessment of products and organisations. The EF rules are reported in two guidance documents: one applicable to all goods and services, the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) guide, and one to organisations, the Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) guide. The principal aim of the EF guides is to ensure science-based decision support for industry and policy. To make the general-level EF rules more relevant and applicable to specific product categories and sectors the EF guides provide requirements to develop so called PEF Category Rules (PEFCRs) and OEF <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Rules</b> (OEFSRs). PEFCRs and OEFSRs are seen as crucial especially for consistent and robust business-to-business (B 2 B) and business-to-consumer (B 2 C) communication intended {{to be used for}} comparisons. The focus of this paper is on the PEFCRs. It highlights the key challenges in the process to develop PEFCRs and takes into account amongst others recent developments led by the US EPA in this area. When developing PEFCRs, the appropriate scope of the product category needs to be defined sufficiently broad to enable meaningful comparisons of products providing the same function on the one side, while remaining focused enough to be manageable from a process point of view on the other side. Different approaches can be used such as 1) a need-based approach 2) a functional approach and 3) a material-based approach. Each of these approaches has pros and cons which are also discussed in this contribution. An example of a very wide product group is the food products. The ENVIFOOD protocol of the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Round Table was developed to be also in line with the PEF and can serve as a starting point to develop PEFCRs for food and food packaging defining several product categories and related PEFCRs below the level of the ENVIFOOD protocol.

40|$|The latest EU {{policies}} {{focus on}} the issue of food safety with a view to assuring adequate and standard quality levels for the food produced and/or consumed within the EC. To that purpose, the environment where agricultural products are manufactured and processed plays a crucial role in achieving food hygiene. As a consequence, it is of the utmost importance to adopt proper building solutions which meet health and hygiene requirements and to use suitable tools to measure the levels achieved. Similarly, it is necessary to verify and evaluate the level of safety and welfare of the workers in their working environment. The safety of the workers has not only an ethical and social value but also an economic implication, since possible accidents or environmental stressors are the major causes of the lower efficiency and productivity of workers. However, the technical solutions adopted in the manufacturing facilities in order to achieve adequate levels of safety and welfare of the workers are not always consistent with the solutions aimed at achieving adequate levels of food hygiene, even if both of them comply with <b>sectoral</b> <b>rules</b> which are often unconnected with each other. Therefore, it is fundamental to design suitable models of analysis that allow assessing buildings as a whole, taking into account both health and hygiene safety as well as the safety and welfare of workers. Hence, this paper proposes an evaluation model that, based on an established study protocol and on the application of a fuzzy logic procedure, allows evaluating the global safety level of a building. The proposed model allows to obtain a synthetic and global value of the building performance in terms of food hygiene and safety and welfare of the workers as well as to highlight possible weaknesses. Though the model may be applied in either the design or the operational phase of a building, this paper focuses on its application to certain buildings already operational in a specific productive context...|$|E
40|$|In the 1980 s, the EU began {{collecting}} the personal data of people arriving {{from third countries}} {{in order to control}} migratory flows within the EU. However, since the 9 / 11 attacks function creep has led to this information, which was originally collected for EU border management, being used by police authorities. Information systems such as SIS, VIS, CIS and Eurodac have been amending their own regulations to permit access by police authorities from the member states and Europol. This paper analyses the potential conflict arising from these practises and the fundamental right to data protection in the EU. First, general and <b>sectoral</b> data protection <b>rules</b> applicable to the data processed by SIS, VIS, CIS and Eurodac will be examined. After that, this study will assess whether allowing law enforcement authorities to access such EU information systems could violate the EU principles of necessity and purpose limitation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the issues {{occurring in the}} promotion of Cinnamon tree product marketing in Palpa district of Nepal. Cinnamon production and collection systems are reviewed. Case studies indicate how poor people maintain their livelihood by marketing cinnamon bark and leaf in the study area. Profit and marketing margin analysis indicate most benefits are diverted to road-head and wholesale traders. Primary producers are receiving a very small share. The comparative benefit cost analysis of selling cinnamon leaf in crude form vs as processed (oil) after steam distillation is explored. The sensitivity of producing Cinnamon leaf oil to labor cost and market price changes is also analyzed. Selling the essential oil of cinnamon leaf to India is more profitable than selling raw Cinnamon leaf. However, several legal constraints render such sale infeasible. The existin g tax and royalty system includes collection and permit systems, conflicting sectoral and cross <b>sectoral</b> policy, and <b>rules</b> hindering the effective promotion of Cinnamon products. This study suggests that group marketing has to be promoted by Conservation Utilization of Medicinal Plants Cooperatives Limited (CUMPCOL) in order to generate more income for farmers locally. Group marketing can help eliminating road head traders. 1...|$|R
