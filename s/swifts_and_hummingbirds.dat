50|$|In {{form and}} habits, however, {{they are very}} similar to both caprimulgiform group - or, at first glance, to small owls with huge eyes. The {{ancestors}} of the <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> two groups of birds which are morphologically very specialized, seem to have looked very similar to a small owlet-nightjar, possessing strong legs and a wide gape, while the legs and feet are very reduced in today's <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> and the bill is narrow in the latter.|$|E
50|$|Unlike prokinesis, {{which is}} {{widespread}} in birds, rhynchokinesis is only known in cranes, shorebirds, <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds.</b> The adaptive significance of rhynchokinesis in certain non-probing birds {{is not yet}} known. It is hypothesized that the schizorhinal skull in proximally rhynchokinetic birds reflects ancestry, but has no adaptive explanation, in many living species.|$|E
5000|$|Strisores ( [...] ) is a clade of birds. It {{includes}} the living families and orders Caprimulgidae (nightjars, nighthawks and allies), Nyctibiidae (potoos), Apodiformes (<b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds),</b> {{as well as}} the Aegotheliformes (owlet-nightjars) whose distinctness was only recently realized. The Apodiformes (which include the [...] "Trochiliformes" [...] of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy) and the Aegotheliformes form the Daedalornithes.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} changes are minor adjustments. For instance, instead of putting the <b>swifts,</b> treeswifts, <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> {{in the same order}} that {{includes}} nothing else, Sibley and Ahlquist put them in the same superorder that includes nothing else, consisting of one order for the <b>hummingbirds</b> <b>and</b> another for the <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> treeswifts. In other words, they still regard the swifts as the hummingbirds' closest relatives.|$|R
25|$|Many <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> some <b>hummingbirds</b> use thick, quick-drying saliva {{to anchor}} their nests. The chimney swift starts by dabbing two globs of saliva onto {{the wall of}} a chimney or tree trunk. In flight, it breaks a small twig from a tree and presses it into the saliva, angling the twig {{downwards}} so that {{the central part of the}} nest is the lowest. It continues adding globs of saliva and twigs until it has made a crescent-shaped cup.|$|R
50|$|Which genera {{apart from}} the present one should be {{included}} in the Aegialornithidae is not quite certain. Primapus belongs either here or is a basal true <b>swift,</b> <b>and</b> Cypselavus is either an aegialornithid or a treeswift. The latter group is sometimes controversially included in the Aegialornithidae, as are the Jungornithidae, another prehistoric apodiform family that was somewhat intermediate between treeswifts <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Otidae is a clade that {{includes}} the superorders Otidimorphae (bustards, turacos, and cuckoos) and Cypselomorphae (nightbirds, <b>swifts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds).</b> It was identified in 2014 by genome analysis. Before {{it was thought that}} Cypselomorphae was closely related to birds such as pigeons, flamingos, tropicbirds, and the kagu in the possibly polyphyletic taxon Metaves. They occupy a basal branch of the clade Passerea.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{analysis}} of DNA sequence data - notably β-fibrinogen intron 7 - Fain and Houde considered {{the families of}} the Caprimulgiformes to be members of the proposed clade Metaves, which also includes the hoatzin, tropicbirds, sandgrouse, pigeons, kagu, sunbittern, mesites, flamingos, grebes and <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds.</b> This clade was also found by the expanded study of Ericson et al. (2006), but support was extremely weak.|$|E
5000|$|Eocypselus rowei shares {{features}} {{in common with}} both hummingbirds and swifts leading Ksepka to declare [...] "This fossil bird represents the closest we've {{gotten to the point}} where <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> went their separate ways". [...] It was probably not a hoverer, like a hummingbird, but also not a fast flyer like a swift. [...] E. rowei was less than 5 in from head to tail. Its feathers made up more than half the size of its wingspan. [...] The bird was small enough to fit into the palm of a hand and weighed less than 1 oz. It probably had black plumage and may have had an iridescent sheen, like modern swifts.|$|E
50|$|Taxonomists {{have long}} {{classified}} <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> treeswifts as {{relatives of the}} hummingbirds, a judgment corroborated by {{the discovery of the}} Jungornithidae (apparently swift-like hummingbird-relatives) <b>and</b> of primitive <b>hummingbirds</b> such as Eurotrochilus. Traditional taxonomies place the hummingbird family (Trochilidae) in the same order as the <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> treeswifts (and no other birds); the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy treated this group as a superorder in which the swift order was called Trochiliformes.|$|R

5000|$|Subsequent studies {{consider}} none of {{the orders}} contained in the [...] "Passerae" [...] particularly close to the passerines. And {{with the possible exception}} of the Columbiformes, about whose evolutionary history next to nothing is known as of 2007, all the [...] "Passerimorphae" [...] are universally considered to be about as far from the Passeriformes as a neoavian can possibly be. The all-encompassing [...] "Ciconiiformes" [...] are rejected by modern science, as is the grouping of owls and nightjars to the exclusion of <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> which moreover are not so distantly related to justify treatment as distinct orders. The close relationship of Musophagiformes and owls, while neither of the two groups is firmly placed in avian systematics, is also highly suspect.|$|E
5000|$|You et al. (2006) {{concluded}} that the anatomical characteristics of Gansus were similar to foot-propelled diving birds, such as Hesperornis (from the Cretaceous) and the loons (Gaviidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae). [...] On the other hand, Li et al. (2011) {{concluded that}} Gansus showed a more similar morphology to ducks. Two years later, Nudds et al. (2013) showed that the pectoral limb length proportions of Gansus were most similar to <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> (Apodiformes), while the pelvic limb length proportions fell within the modern birds (Neornithes), showing similarities with grebes (Podicipedidae), albatross (Diomedeidae) and cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), suggesting that Gansus was both volant and capable of diving to some degree using either foot-propelled or, perhaps, both its wings and its feet for underwater locomotion.|$|E

40|$|In <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> (Apodiformes), the splenius capitis muscle {{displays}} a charac-teristic modification, the ‘cruciform origin’. The muscle pairs {{arise from the}} second ver-tebra by several slips which criss-cross and interdigitate with each other, before inserting into the skull. In {{the course of a}} study on the neck muscles of the Common Swift, we paid special attention to the arrangement of these slips of the splenius capitis muscle, and noted a previously unrecognized individual modification of this muscle. In addition, we observed an incipient cruciform origin of the deep portion (slip) of the rectus capitis ventralis muscle that has not been noticed for swifts or any other avian taxon before. The development and function of these modifications of the splenius capitis and rectus capitis ventralis muscle are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{apparent}} {{contrast to}} most other tissues, the ocular lenses in vertebrates show striking differences in protein composition between taxa, {{most notably in}} the recruitment of different enzymes as major structural proteins. This variability {{appears to be the}} result of at least partially neutral evolutionary processes, although there is also evidence for selective modification in molecular structure. Here we describe a bird, the chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), that lacks delta-crystallin/argininosuccinate lyase, usually the major crystallin of avian lenses. Clearly, delta-crystallin is not specifically required for a functionally effective avian lens. Furthermore the lens composition of the swift is more similar to that of the related hummingbirds than to that of the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), suggesting that phylogeny is more important than environmental selection in the recruitment of crystallins. However differences in epsilon-crystallin/lactate dehydrogenase-B sequence between swift and hummingbird and other avian and reptilian species suggest that selective pressures may also be working at the molecular level. These differences also confirm the close relationship between <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>hummingbirds...</b>|$|E
