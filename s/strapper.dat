25|$|A new trophy {{is struck}} {{each year and}} becomes the {{property}} of the winning owner. In the event of a dead heat a second cup is on hand. The present trophy is hand spun from 1.65kg of 18-carat gold. The winning trainer and jockey also receive a miniature replica of the cup (since 1973) and the <b>strapper</b> is awarded the Tommy Woodcock Trophy, named after the <b>strapper</b> of Phar Lap.|$|E
25|$|Early on 5 April 1932, the horse's <b>strapper</b> for the North American visit, Tommy Woodcock, {{found him}} in severe pain and with a high temperature. Within a few hours, Phar Lap haemorrhaged to death. An autopsy {{revealed}} that the horse's stomach and intestines were inflamed, leading many to believe the horse had been deliberately poisoned. There have been alternative theories, including accidental poisoning from lead insecticide and a stomach condition. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that the infection could be formally identified.|$|E
25|$|Phar Lap at {{the time}} was owned by American {{businessman}} David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford had enough money to become joint owner of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not agree with this decision and refused to go, so Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap's <b>strapper</b> Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest prize money ever offered in North America racing. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5kg). The horse was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides. From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.|$|E
6000|$|BLANCO. The words were, [...] "Ive got the cinch on {{you this}} time, Blanco Posnet." [...] Yes, Sheriff, I saw those words in {{green on the}} red streak of the rainbow; and as I saw them I felt <b>Strapper's</b> grab on my arm and Squinty's on my pistol.|$|R
50|$|His first book, People Minus X, was {{published}} in 1957 by Simon & Schuster, followed by The Planet <b>Strappers</b> in 1961 (Pyramid). The Ballantine collection issued in 1978, The Best of Raymond Z. Gallun, provides a selection of his early work. Gallun was honored with the I-CON Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985 at I-CON IV; the award was later renamed The Raymond Z. Gallun Award.|$|R
40|$|Horse {{trainers}} should double-check wage rates, argues this {{audit report}} on the horse racing industry in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Summary: The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) conducted an audit program in the horse racing industry in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. We initiated the NSW/QLD/VIC Horse racing industry audit program (the program) in response to information we received alleging underpayments of <b>strappers</b> and stable hands in the horse racing industry. Our complaint data for the 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12 financial years also showed that we had received almost 90 complaints from the horse racing industry. The majority (84 %) were received from the eastern states. In conducting the program, we selected 86 horse racing trainers for assessment. We found 34 (40 %) employers in contravention and 52 (60 %) compliant. We recovered $ 39 502 for 61 employees...|$|R
2500|$|Sowada {{was born}} in Sydney in November 1961, {{the first of three}} {{children}} to Valentin and Helen Sowada. Her father was a photographer whose picture [...] "The Rigger" [...] was published by the Sydney Morning Herald in 1965. She went to Bronte Public School and Randwick North High School and started her working life as a <b>strapper</b> in the thoroughbred horse racing industry. She briefly worked as an insurance broker before commencing studies at the University of Sydney. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in archaeology in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011 the Sydney Morning Herald {{published}} an article in which a New Zealand physicist and information from Phar Lap's <b>strapper</b> state that the great horse was never given any tonic with arsenic and that he died of an infection. Said Dr. Putt, [...] "Unless {{we are prepared to}} say that Tommy Woodcock was a downright liar, which even today, decades after the loveable and respected horseman's death, would ostracise us with the Australian racing public, we must accept him on his word. The ineluctable conclusion we are left with, {{whether we like it or}} not, is that Phar Lap's impeccable achievements here and overseas were utterly tonic, stimulant, and drug-free." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE SHERIFF. Morning, Elder. [Passing on.] Morning, <b>Strapper.</b> [Passing on]. Morning, Miss Evans. [Stopping between <b>Strapper</b> and Blanco]. Is {{this the}} prisoner? ...|$|E
60|$|BLANCO. And I ate it, I suppose, before <b>Strapper</b> fetched up with me. [Suddenly and dramatically] Sheriff: I accuse Feemy of immoral {{relations}} with <b>Strapper.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [At {{last the}} women are pushed out, leaving Elder Daniels, the Sheriff's brother <b>Strapper</b> Kemp, {{and a few others}} with Blanco. <b>Strapper</b> is a lad just turning into a man: strong, selfish, sulky, and determined.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER</b> [without] Hold hard, George. [At the door] Theyve got the horse. [He comes in, {{followed}} by Waggoner Jo, an elderly carter, who crosses {{the court to}} the jury side. <b>Strapper</b> pushes {{his way to the}} Sheriff and speaks privately to him].|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> Young Jack {{has brought}} a boxful up. Theyre all ready.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> No: it's a woman. [Blanco yells {{and covers}} {{his eyes with}} his hands].|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> On Pug Jackson's {{bench in}} his shed. He's makin a coffin for it.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> I dont {{believe you}} started not {{for two hours}} after you say you did.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> Youre {{accountable}} {{to me for}} the horse until you clear yourself, Elder: remember that.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> No. He traded {{it before}} we overtook him, I guess. But Feemy {{saw him on}} it.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> We aint got nothin {{to do with}} that. This is the man, aint he? [pointing to Blanco].|$|E
60|$|ELDER DANIELS [returning to {{move the}} other sack] I am sorry {{to say that it}} was the Sheriff's horse--the one he loaned to young <b>Strapper.</b> <b>Strapper</b> loaned it to me; and the thief stole it, {{thinking}} it was mine. If it had been mine, I'd have forgiven him cheerfully. I'm sure I hoped he would get away; for he had two hours start of the Vigilance Committee. But they caught him. [He disposes of the other sack also].|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER</b> [to Feemy, {{as he goes}} to the door] I'm {{done with}} you. Do you hear? I'm done with you. [He goes out sulkily].|$|E
60|$|Go out to them, <b>Strapper</b> Kemp; {{and tell}} them about your big brother's little horse that some wicked man stole. Go and cry in your mammy's lap.|$|E
60|$|ELDER DANIELS. Dont be headstrong, Blanco. Whats the use? [Slyly] They might let {{up on you}} if you put <b>Strapper</b> in the way {{of getting}} his brother's horse back.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> I'll get {{a witness}} all right enough. I know the road he took; and I'll ask at every house {{within sight of}} it for a mile out. Come boys.|$|E
6000|$|BLANCO. I don't know {{of my own}} knowledge. I only {{argue that}} if the horse had been worth its keep, you wouldn't have lent it to <b>Strapper,</b> and <b>Strapper</b> wouldn't have lent it to this eloquent and venerable ram. [Suppressed laughter]. And now I ask him this. [To the Elder] Did we or did we not have a quarrel last evening about a certain article that was left by my mother, and that I {{considered}} I {{had a right to}} more than you? And did you say one word to me about the horse not belonging to you? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> If I hadnt promised Elder Daniels here to {{give him}} a chance to keep you out of Hell, I'd take the job of {{twisting}} your neck off the hands of the Vigilance Committee.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> You {{were looking}} at a rainbow, like a damned silly fool instead of keeping your wits about you; and we stole up on you and had you tight before you could draw a bead on us.|$|E
60|$|<b>STRAPPER</b> [to the Sheriff] George: this is rot. How {{can you get}} an unprejudiced jury if the {{prisoner}} starts by telling them theyre all rotten? If theres any prejudice against him he has himself to thank for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "A strapper--a real <b>strapper,</b> Jane: big, brown, and buxom; {{with hair}} just {{such as the}} ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there's Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Strapper {{returns with}} a woman. Her {{expression}} of intense grief silences them as they crane over one another's heads to see her. <b>Strapper</b> takes her {{to the corner of}} the table. The Elder moves up to make room for her.] ...|$|E
60|$|THE FOREMAN [To Blanco, {{on his way}} out] A {{man like}} you makes me sick. Just sick. [Blanco makes no sign. The Foreman spits disgustedly, and follows <b>Strapper</b> out. The Jurymen leave the box, except Nestor, who collapses in a drunken sleep].|$|E
6000|$|His {{arms are}} bound {{with a rope}} with a long end, which Squinty holds. They release him when he enters; and he {{stretches}} himself and lounges across the courthouse {{in front of the}} women. <b>Strapper</b> and the men remain between him and the door.] ...|$|E
6000|$|THE SHERIFF [jarred beyond {{endurance}} by the sound] Hold you noise! will you? Shove his neckerchief {{into his}} mouth if he don't stop. [To the woman] Dont you mind him, maam: he's mad with drink and devilment. I suppose theres no fake about this, <b>Strapper.</b> Who found her? ...|$|E
60|$|ELDER DANIELS. Well, even if {{you want}} to be hanged, is that any reason why <b>Strapper</b> shouldn't have his horse? I tell you I'm {{responsible}} to him for it. [Bending over the table and coaxing him]. Act like a brother, Blanco: tell me what you done with it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>STRAPPER.</b> No, nor you hadnt {{a railway}} train neither. But Feemy Evans saw you {{pass on the}} horse at four o'clock twenty-five miles from the spot where I took you at seven {{on the road to}} Pony Harbor. Did you walk twenty-five miles in three hours? That so, Feemy, eh? ...|$|E
6000|$|BLANCO. Bear witness {{all that}} I {{had a right}} to take a horse from him without {{stealing}} to make up for what he denied me. I am no thief. But you havnt proved yet that I took the horse. <b>Strapper</b> Kemp: had I the horse when you took me, or had I not? ...|$|E
