5|$|Although erections are not {{necessary}} for satisfying sexual encounters, many men <b>see</b> <b>them</b> as important, and treating erectile dysfunction improves their relationships and quality of life.

5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone would <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.|$|E

[...] Clinton settled on the extraterrestrial concept because of its originality, saying, [...] "Put niggers in places that you don't usually <b>see</b> <b>'em.</b> And nobody had <b>seen</b> <b>'em</b> on no spaceships!

5|$|A {{panel of}} MPs began {{the task of}} going through over 40,000 {{documents}} related to Afghan detainees on 10 July 2010. The MPs, consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse. An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the panel to determine whether to allow the MPs to <b>see</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel Moroni took back the plates once Smith finished using them.|$|E

5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States.

An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
