40|$|Medical {{packages}} {{have to meet}} highly {{specific criteria}} over and above other types of packages. Protection of contents from microbial contamination and physical damage is a priority. The permeability to sterilizing gas; retention of properties and appearance after sterilizing radiation; printability and aseptic presentation {{all have to be}} present at reasonable cost. The most important is maintenance of sterile integrity. In order to have sterile integrity, the medical package must have high barrier properties. Sterility maintenance is the ability of porous packaging materials to act as barriers to microorganisms. The random non- woven structure of <b>spunbonded</b> olefin creates a highly complex maze through the sheet. This torturous path coupled with infinitesimally small openings presents bacteria with an impossible task to penetrate the <b>spunbonded</b> olefin. Thus by virtue of the properties exhibited similar to the 2 ̆ 2 Size Exclusion 2 ̆ 2 principle, <b>spunbonded</b> olefin maintains permeability for gas sterilization but not for microorganisms. The immediate consequences of this morphology are: high opacity, high filtration efficiency, acceptable to high air permeability and excellent strength. Strength of a <b>spunbonded</b> sheet {{is directly related to the}} strength of the individual fibers and how are they bonded. It is clear that to have an effective material; strength, permeability and barrier have to be balanced in an optimum structure. Packages made from <b>spunbonded</b> olefin can be sterilized by ionizing irradiation which is commercially exposure to ionizing radiation, high energy electron from electron beams or gamma rays from Cobalt- 60 or Cesium- 137 radioisotopes. Irradiation does not leave a residue in the <b>spunbonded</b> olefin and it does not make it radioactive. The low energy level of Cobalt and Cesium isotopic gamma rays does not induce any radioactivity. Although, irradiation has the same sterilizing effect on <b>spunbonded</b> olefin packages as ethylene oxide gas treatment, it does not appreciably raise the temperature of the medical product as does an Eto cycle. One of the characteristic advantages of the irradiation process is that the medical product can be irradiated even after package has been sealed so recontamination after processing is prevented. It is not possible for the medical product itself to become radioactive, and there are no residues of any kind left by this process. Once treated, medical packages are considered sterile and ready for use...|$|E

The invention was patented: Patent no. 71212, Russian Federation, priority number 2007137443 of 09. 10. 2007. <b>Spunbond,</b> nonwoven polymeric fabric, allows to introduce technologies which might exclude paper and other moisture absorptive materials from the process of herbarium making. The idea of the new way of drying plants for the herbarium consists in creating thin air linen around the plant in the herbarium press {{with the use of}} <b>spunbond.</b> Thanks to the free air access, plants dry very quickly and stay flat at the same time. The plants are dried in the herbarium press with the use of black <b>spunbond,</b> with the density from 60 grams per square meter to 150 grams per square meter, instead of usual newspapers. In 2009 - 2011 Multi-purpose Herbarium Press was tried out in Central Russia, In the Northern Ural, Northern Africa and France. In all these parts of the world scientists were absolutely satisfied with the results. <b>Spunbond</b> can also be used for keeping the herbarium. It lasts longer and is cheaper than paper. It doesn’t break into small pieces, doesn’t absorb moister from the outside, doesn’t deteriorate because of the sun, and cannot be damaged by insects. The use of <b>spunbond</b> when making herbarium allows to avoid using wood (shelves and cupboards) and paper in the rooms where herbariums are kept, because they are kept on metal shelves.

40|$|The room {{temperature}} morphology of quench-cooled isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and its development were investigated by scanning transmittance electron microscopy (STEM) and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). STEM dark field images revealed that within an amorphous matrix there exist microcrystalline regions, 160 A in size on the average, having the $ alpha$-monoclinic crystal form. Regions of lower crystalline order were also observed which have an $ alpha$-monoclinic crystal form that has a substantially longer b crystallographic axis. DSC studies indicate that during quench-cooling to the glassy state iPP samples attain a low degree of crystalline order to an extent that depends on sample mass. Upon heating from the glassy state, an exothermic transition is observed following the glass transition temperature which corresponds {{to the formation of}} the {{room temperature}} morphology. Cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to monitor morphological changes in the purely crystalline phase of quench-cooled iPP films and <b>spunbonded</b> fabrics during annealing. The spectra were obtained using a pulse sequence that incorporates a delay period with a reduced spin locking field prior to cross polarization. Morphological changes occurring within the purely crystalline phase of iPP were related to observations made by DSC. Upon annealing, the CP/MAS NMR spectrum of the purely crystalline phase of both iPP samples changed by a redistribution in the intensity of the various peaks within a given carbon resonance. This redistribution of intensity was found to reflect the conversion from the $ alpha sb 1 $ to the $ alpha sb 2 $ monoclinic crystal forms. It is shown that the double melting endotherm observed by DSC for the <b>spunbonded</b> fabrics is due to the exothermicity which is associated with this conversion. It is concentrated in the temperature region between 156 and 163 $ sp circ$C. The tensile properties of the <b>spunbonded</b> iPP fabrics and fibers were enhanced by the dispersion of a silica/silicone additive and by changing the resin characteristics. This additive acts as a nucleating agent for iPP under isothermal crystallization conditions. This nucleating ability manifests itself in smaller crystal sizes and higher nucleation densities in the iPP fibers and bond points. The improved tensile properties are attributed to the smaller crystal sizes which form a more homogeneously dispersed crystalline phase in the amorphous phase as well as {{to increase the number of}} load-bearing tie molecules...|$|E

The experimental fit to the Bryner model is the better of the two, but requires specification of fabric thickness in addition to basis weight and fiber diameter to achieve actual mean pore diameters that closely match target values.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and functional performance of nonwoven fabric critically {{depends on the}} fibre architecture. The fibre laydown process {{plays a key role}} in controlling this architecture. The fibre dynamic behaviour during laydown is studied through a finite element model which describes the role of the parameters in defining the area covered by a single fibre when deposited on the conveyor belt. The path taken by a fibre is described in terms of the radius of gyration, which characterises the area covered by the fibre in the textile, and the spectrum of curvature, which describes the degree of fibre looping as a function of the arc length. Starting from deterministic and idealised fibre curvature spectra, stochastic Monte Carlo simulations are undertaken to generate full nonwoven web samples and reproduce the uniformity of fibre density. A novel image analysis technique that allows measurement of the uniformity of real <b>spunbonded</b> nonwoven samples from images of textiles is used to confirm the validity of the model.

40|$|The {{polyimide}} precursor (polyamic acid) produced of 4, 4 &#x 2032;-oxydiphthalic anhydride and 4, 4 &#x 2032;-oxydianiline was electrospun using needleless electrospinning method. Nonwoven layers {{consisting of}} submicron fibers with diameters {{in the range}} about 143 &# 8211; 470 &#x 2009;nm on the polypropylene <b>spunbond</b> supporting web were produced. Filtration properties of these nanofiber layers on the highly permeable polypropylene support&# 8212;namely filtration effectivity and pressure drop&# 8212;were evaluated. Consequently, these polyamic acid fibers were heated to receive polyimide nanofibers. The imidization process has been studied using IR spectroscopy. Some comparisons with the chemically identical polyimide prepared as the film were made...|$|R
