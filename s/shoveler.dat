5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern <b>shoveler.</b>|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, <b>shoveler</b> and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E

5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, <b>shoveler,</b> warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E

500|$|Aldermaston Gravel Pits {{consist of}} mature flooded gravel {{workings}} surrounded by dense fringing vegetation, trees and scrub, affording {{a variety of}} habitats for breeding birds and a refuge for wildfowl. The irregular shoreline with islands, promontories, sheltered eutrophic pools and narrow lagoons, provides undisturbed habitat for many water birds, including surface-feeding ducks such as teal (Anas crecca) and <b>shoveler</b> (Anas clypeata). The surrounding marsh and scrub are important for numerous birds including nine breeding species of warblers, water rails (Rallus aquaticus), kingfishers (Alcedoa atthis) and an important breeding colony of nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos). In 2002 English Nature bought Aldermaston Gravel Pits from the mineral extraction company Grundon and it is managed as a nature reserve by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. [...] The River Kennet itself, from near its sources west of Marlborough down to Woolhampton, has been designated as a SSSI primarily because it has an extensive range of rare plants and animals that are unique to chalk watercourses.|$|E

5000|$|Red <b>shovelers</b> have a {{diet that}} {{includes}} herbs, grasses, pond weeds, widgeon grass, algae, and eelgrass. They also feed on small invertebrates. The bill {{is equipped with a}} lamellate filtering mechanism that allows the extraction of small items of food from the water. Pairs form in the wintering grounds, after often noisy courtship. Once a clutch of 7-8 eggs is laid, incubation lasts about 25-26 days, followed by 40-45 days of fledging. [...] Red <b>shovelers</b> are partially migratory, with the southern most birds migrating north during the winter season.|$|R
40|$|The {{biogeochemistry}} of phyllosilicate–Fe redox cycling was {{studied in}} a Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass) dominated redoximorphic soil from <b>Shovelers</b> Sink, a small glacial depression near Madison, WI. The clay size fraction of <b>Shovelers</b> Sink soil accounts for 16 % {{of the dry}} weight of the soil, yet contributes 74 % of total Fe. The dominant mineral in the clay size fraction is mixed layer illite–smectite, and in contrast to many other soils and sediments, Fe(III) oxides are present in low abundance. We examined the Fe biogeochemistry of <b>Shovelers</b> Sink soils, estimated the abundance of Fe redox cycling microorganisms, and isolated in pure culture representative phyllosilicate–Fe oxidizing and reducing organisms. The abundance of phyllosilicate–Fe reducing and oxidizing organisms was low compared to culturable aerobic heterotrophs. Both direct isolation and dilution-to-extinction approaches using structural Fe(II) in Bancroft biotite as a Fe(II) source, and O 2 as the electron acceptor, resulted in recovery of common rhizosphere organisms including Bradyrhizobium spp. and strains of Cupriavidus necator and Ralstonia solanacearum. In addition to oxidizing biotite and soluble Fe(II) with O 2, each of these isolates was able to oxidize Fe(II) in reduced NAu- 2 smectite with NO 3 - as the electron acceptor. Oxidized NAu- 2 smectite or amorphous Fe(III) oxide served as electron acceptors for enrichment and isolation of Fe(III) -reducing microorganisms, resulting in recovery of a strain related to Geobacter toluenoxydans. The ability of the recovered microorganisms to cycle phyllosilicate–Fe was verified in an experiment with native <b>Shovelers</b> Sink clay. This study confirms that Fe in the native <b>Shovelers</b> Sink clay is readily available for microbial redox transformation and can be cycled by the Fe(III) -reducing and Fe(II) -oxidizing microorganisms recovered from the soil...|$|R

50|$|If {{you are on}} {{the look}} out for the {{northern}} <b>shoveler,</b> you might want to check out Weed Lake. They can also be found near ponds and marshes in the prairies of Western Canada. The northern <b>shoveler</b> is a duck that swims in shallow water and makes a nest on the land nearby. Be careful not to confuse this bird with the mallard. The northern <b>shoveler</b> male has a green head, red bottom and a white, brown and a light gray chest. Try not to get mixed up because a female northern <b>shoveler</b> and female mallard ducks, look the same. Male northern shovelers' eyes look different then male mallard ducks, they are yellow. Animal that prey on northern shovelers include red foxes, raccoons, owls, hawks, minks, crows, skunks and coyotes. They build their nest by water. In their nest, there are 8-12 eggs laid. When the duckling hatches, it will fledge - grow feathers large enough to fly. This usually takes 40-70 days. The northern <b>shoveler</b> communicates with a quiet quack, mostly heard at spring courtship. In the fall, it migrates to Mexico for the winter. Males weigh 17-38, females weigh 17-28 and the wingspan is 31 inches long. The northern <b>shoveler</b> diet is pondweed, bulrush, various grasses, sedges and algae.|$|E

50|$|Northern <b>shovelers</b> feed by dabbling {{for plant}} food, often by {{swinging}} its bill {{from side to}} side and using the bill to strain food from the water. They use their highly specialized bill (from which their name is derived) to forage for aquatic invertebrates - a carnivorous diet. Their wide-flat bill is equipped with well-developed lamellae - small, comb-like structures {{on the edge of the}} bill that act like sieves, allowing the birds to skim crustaceans and plankton from the water's surface. This adaptation, more specialized in <b>shovelers,</b> gives them an advantage over other puddle ducks, with which they do not have to compete for food resources during most of the year.
