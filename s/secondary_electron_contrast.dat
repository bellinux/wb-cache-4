A three-dimensional sketch of the FinFET can be seen in Fig. 1. The small channels benefit from superior electrostatic channel control, resulting in enhanced turn-off behavior. However, its fabrication demands excellent lithography and etching techniques, since very small fins with smooth vertical sidewall surfaces, that define the channel region, have to be fabricated. Furthermore for the fabrication of a minimal device the overlay accuracy must be in the range of the fin width. Electron beam lithography marks and optical alignment marks for all subsequent lithography steps are predefined with optical lithography on an SOI wafer with 50 nm top silicon and etched into 100 nm buried oxide. This topographic step yields sufficient <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> <b>contrast</b> of the alignment marks for an SEM based electron beam lithography at 10 keV with 100 nm thick calixarene resist [3].

40|$|We {{report about}} a time {{resolved}} measurement of electron dynamics in an aluminum oxide thin film on silicon done by Ultrafast Scanning Electron Microscopy (USEM). This novel technique aims {{to join the}} time resolution typical of fs lasers to the spatial lateral and depth resolution of electron microscopy in a single tabletop tool. The USEM apparatus operates in Ultra-High Vacuum regime, and in our pump-probe setup the sample under test is excited both by an UV fs laser pulse and by a delayed electron pulse, triggering the emission of low energy electrons to the detector. Optical properties in the visible and near UV of wide bandgap insulators are influenced by defects that act as traps for electrons; lifetime and energy of excited states have been studied by time resolved photoluminescence [1]. It’s known from cathodoluminescence measurements that defects may be excited also by the electron beam of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) [2]. Our goal is to evaluate the excitation dynamics of the color centers in an insulator from the <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> <b>contrast</b> typical of the SEM images. The laser‑induced electronic contrast of the alumina film shows a relevant CW contribution, that we attribute tentatively to the photo‑induced carriers within the insulator. Nonetheless, by employing lock-in detection of secondary electrons, {{it is possible to}} observe also a fast dynamics with components ranging from hundreds of picoseconds to few nanoseconds. We observed an enhancement of secondary electron emission rising at zero delays and vanishing for positive delay with a time constant of tens of nanoseconds attributed to the excitation of an oxygen vacancy by the laser beam. It was possible to observe a depletion mechanism acting at positive delays and decaying with a tau of tens of picoseconds that was attributed to laser induced surface charging [3]. A third enhancement acting at negative delays and decaying with a time constant of few nanoseconds was attributed to the photoemission of electrons from color centers excited by the electron beam.

40|$|A {{series of}} Si-doped AlN-rich AlGaN layers with low resistivities was {{characterized}} {{by a combination of}} nanoscale imaging techniques. Utilizing the capability of scanning electron microscopy to reliably investigate the same sample area with different techniques, it was possible to determine the effect of doping concentration, defect distribution, and morphology on the luminescence properties of these layers. Cathodoluminescence shows that the dominant defect luminescence depends on the Si-doping concentration. For lower doped samples, the most intense peak was centered between 3. 36 [*]eV and 3. 39 [*]eV, while an additional, stronger peak appears at 3 [*]eV for the highest doped sample. These peaks were attributed to the (VIII-ON) 2 − complex and the VIII 3 − vacancy, respectively.

Finally, we demonstrate that the technique can be applied to different diffused layers for solar cell applications, even at room temperature if an appropriate excitation wavelength is used.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid a {{premature}} breakdown and high leakage-currents of Silicon Carbide (SiC) unipolar Schottky power diodes the Schottky-contact area needs to be shielded from the high electric field inside the device.

In contrast, the active area consumption of this p+-type regions has a negative effect on the differential resistance. To design those p+-shields it is inevitable to compare simulated dopant profiles with those manufactured by ion implantation.

The mechanism that gives rise to such a <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> (SE) <b>contrast</b> effect is not fully understood, however. A review of the different models that have been proposed to explain this SE contrast is given.

However, {{the nature of these}} precipitates was unknown so far. Here, in such positions, scanning transmission electron microscopy was performed after defect-controlled focused ion beam preparation. First of all, the defect site was localized by microscopic reverse-bias electroluminescence imaging. The high accuracy of following FIB target preparation (< 0. 1 mu m necessary) was obtained by both, electron beam-induced current imaging and <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> material <b>contrast</b> observation during the slice-by-slice milling of the TEM specimen.

For keeping and further enhancing their features, the particles should be protected from coalescence or degradation.

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} device dimensions {{are reduced to}} the deep sub-micron regime, minor departures from the designed distributions of electrostatic potentials can affect device performance dramatically. Parameter optimisation in device processing and modelling is crucial for achieving precise potential profiles. Such optimisation is not possible without comprehensive feedback from advanced characterisation techniques. The ability to acquire two- and three-dimensional measurements of potential distributions with high spatial resolution, high precision and under an applied electrical bias is therefore in great demand. The technique of off-axis electron holography in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) promises to fulfil these requirements in two dimensions and can be combined with electron tomography for three-dimensional measurements. In this dissertation, the practical challenges {{that are involved in}} the application of electron holography to the characterisation of electrostatic potentials in working MOSFETs are addressed. A novel method for the application of electrical contacts to a TEM specimen is developed and applied to a diode structure. Off-axis electron holography measurements are carried out on a pn junction using both this and an alternative geometry and compared with simulations. A semi-biased MOSFET is then characterised successfully using electron holography, suggesting that the examination of working transistors in the TEM is a realistic prospect. In order to investigate sources of error and practical challenges, the influence of diffraction <b>contrast</b> on <b>electron</b> holographic phase images is investigated.

All the backscattered or <b>secondary</b> <b>electrons</b> positively contribute to the image formation independently of their trajectories and specimen exit points. The resolution of the backscattered electron images depends only on the beam size and the signal to noise ratio. The generation volume of backscattered <b>electrons</b> affects the <b>contrast</b> but does not represent in itself a limit to the resolution.
